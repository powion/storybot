 today reddit was blocked in russia and i am the one who posted this post which lead to this 
 in russia there is a law which allow <unk> russian censorship agency to block any website without court <unk> 
 two years ago i tested how rkn react to abuse on popular <unk> <unk> 
 on of that websites was reddit 
 one thing i learned is that rkn does n't want to block popular websites 
 they respond me that this content is illegal and they blocked it but they were n't 
 it was on <unk> on <unk> aug 2015 they posted a call to help them contact reddit administration to official <unk> page 
 funny thing but they called psilocybe a plant 
 several hours ago they reported that reddit is blocked in russia seems like things changed 
 how reddit is blocked 
 fully 
 as reddit switched to there is no way to block special page 
 will i remove this post 
 no 
 i also think that reddit administration needs to do nothing 
 this is important issue on freedom of speech and only rkn want to <unk> it 
 btw this post is a guide for indoor growing psilocybe mushrooms in russian 
 i 'm not sure if any people saw this before blocking but if you are here and you can read russian now you know to grow some shrooms thanks to rkn 
 <unk> : russia <unk> reddit as they comply with request and blocked that post for russian users 
 <unk> : this is how russian internet censorship works so i was happily sending away my resume online using various <unk> websites 
 not getting much in the way of response until i received this one yesterday 
 so i 've been fooling around with this girl for awhile now and naturally we 've cycled through all your standard vanilla kinks and things were starting to wind down a bit 
 this was n't a big deal though as neither of us is interested in anything more than casual sex so there 's no pressure to keep things fresh and exciting 
 that being said a little bit ago she randomly messaged me saying she has something naughty to share and sends me cellphone footage of her with a vibrator doing some impressive <unk> squirting 
 she goes on to talk about how excited she is for teaching herself how and we proceed to make plans to explore this further 
 next thing i know she 's cumming in my face like a chinese firefighter trying to <unk> a burning chemical factory while i 'm right there dumping fuel on the flames 
 now before i get carried away here i 'll just say i 'm a m nurse by trade and i have no <unk> about what 's really going on 
 i can tell exactly where her <unk> are coming from and i 've made peace with the fact that the girl is pissing in my face while i go down on her no big deal 
 so finally to the point 
 she 's been squirting in my face for a few weeks now and i 've gotten enough in my mouth to know how it tastes 
 the most surprising thing about the experience is the fact that her piss did n't taste at all like i 'd thought it would 
 <unk> from <unk> gatorade to that bland tea they serve you at oriental restaurants that you dump sugar packets into 
 i thought it was a <unk> at first but after repeatedly testing this observation i 'm quite certain that her piss tastes sweet sometimes blatantly so 
 the <unk> side of me thought all this was kinky as hell so i really did n't think on it too much until this morning 
 i just woke up and had a weird nurse 's epiphany about it 
 sweet urine 
 glucose urine 
 <unk> 
 jesus christ 
 i 'm a fucking dumbass 
 i race over to my bag where i keep my backup <unk> for work wake her <unk> ass up and <unk> her finger to check her blood sugar 
 <unk> 
 **fuck 
 ** <unk> 
 <unk> 
 <unk> 
 ** <unk> but <unk> as fuck 
 she 's got the <unk> 
 diabetes 
 i broke the news as gently as i could which was something to the tune of holy shit fuck 
 that 's some serious fucking diabetes 
 call your doctor '' 
 hysterics ensued 
 so now she 's out to the doctors office and possibly the urgent care clinic for treatment and i 'm sitting here trying figure out a good cover story for how i knew.. tldr tifu by breaking some bad news to a girl after she squirted '' in my face and i diagnosed her with diabetes after realizing her piss was unnaturally sweet 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - update : insert the obligatory omg this went <unk> 
 1 '' .. on a serious note though thanks for the reddit <unk> <unk> 
 this has been a long day and i have n't felt this cool on the internet since that time i used a voice <unk> in an <unk> to convince my <unk> i was a black guy 
 to bring things current the girl is doing fine now they 've ran more thorough tests and strongly suspect she 's a type 1 diabetic but it 'll take a few days and tests to confirm the <unk> results 
 she 's got a lot on her mind all i can think about though is how we went from casual fuck buddies to <unk> connected by the act of getting her piss in my mouth 
 still the response has been hilariously fantastic 
 while there 's a lot of contention on whether this is a fuck up i 'll just say that a couple factors had stuck out to me personally that framed it like that such as the fact that it took weeks for me to piece this all together my majorly panicked reaction to it and the <unk> state of <unk> i had caused after scaring the girl half to death 
 that all kind of <unk> the lucky guess i made in my mind anyway 
 no longer though 
 right now i feel like the fucking <unk> thanks for helping me see the cloud 's golden lining this actually happened yesterday but whatever 
 okay here we go 
 a little background about me 
 i 'm young mid 20 's i 'm a guy i 'm white and i 'm a huge philadelphia eagles fan american football 
 for this of you who are n't familiar with the sport the eagles and the dallas cowboys have a huge <unk> that has existed for years 
 here 's where i fuck up 
 so i 'm at work fast food this day i had decided to wear my favorite eagles shirt underneath of my uniform because why not 
 an older black guy walks into the store wearing a cowboys hat t-shirt lanyard and jacket 
 upon seeing him most of my co-workers greeted him with a smile and a hello 
 i on the other hand without thinking greeted this 60 year old black guy with a we do n't serve your kind here '' 
 it instantly registered to me what i had said when all my co-workers looked at me in disbelief 
 i also realized that this poor guest could n't see my t-shirt under my uniform 
 i instantly began apologizing and explaining 
 i took my uniform shirt off showed him my phone background my credit card literally anything i could to show him i was trying to make a sports joke and not being a racist little shit 
 after about 30 seconds of me explaining he started laughing so hard i thought he was gon na piss himself 
 then he told me not worry about and that he understood 
 i gave him his food for free 
 then the manager wanted to have a little <unk> 
 i was n't fired but i was yelled at pretty well 
 so that 's the story of how sports made me look racist 
 so i 'm hoping a load of people are going to come out in support of me here but i 've got that sinking feeling i may be alone in this 
 our toilet broke so i was in shopping for new ones and the sales person joked no doubt for the <unk> time that i 'll want one that automatically puts the seat down after i 'm finished with it 
 i <unk> back and said if i did n't have a wife i could save money and not buy one with a seat and i 'd never have to hear women complaining about putting it down again 
 to which he gave me a strange look and said but what about when you need to poop 
 i naturally pointed out that i 'm a guy and therefore do n't put the seat down i sit on the rim of the bowl 
 several embarrassing moments later i realize that i 've misunderstood my entire life and that guys do indeed use the toilet seat 
 i left empty handed and red faced 
 thinking about it now it makes sense 
 especially how men 's restrooms have seats 
 but i just assumed it was a <unk> <unk> <unk> had a meeting at work today 
 there were about 30 people in the meeting and it was very important 
 it was only supposed to last 1-2 hours but it went way over time 
 3 hours after the meeting started i really had to pee 
 but seeing as it was already an hour over time i was confident i could hold it till the meeting was over 
 no one else had gotten up since the meeting started and seeing as i 've only been employed there for less than a month i was n't going to be the first one to do so 
 after 4 hours my bladder was about to explode 
 i battled myself mentally trying to convince myself to just go pee while the other half of me did n't want to make a bad impression this early in my career 
 right as i was about to jump up and just go for it they wrapped up the meeting 
 as soon as they dismissed i jumped from my seat and ran straight to the bathroom 
 i started <unk> before i had barely made it into the bathroom and i was already peeing 2 steps from the urinal 
 i settled in at the urinal and unleashed a <unk> load of urine 
 apparently i was n't the only one who had to use the restroom because there were more and more people coming in and using the toilets or standing along the wall behind me waiting for the urinal to open up 
 not wanting to stand there and pee forever i tensed up by bladder peeing as hard and as fast as i could 
 i guess when you do this you also hold your breath 
 either way i pushed way too hard for way too long 
 i started getting really light headed and lost my balance 
 i took 2 steps back and passed out falling straight on my back 
 i was probably only passed out in the floor for less than 5 seconds but that was plenty enough time for about 10 of my coworkers to see me stumble back fall in the floor with my dick hanging out of my pants and then piss into the air like an angel statue in a park all over myself and the floor 
 i 'm not sure i can show my face there tomorrow 
 tl dr tried to pee too hard showed my dick to my coworkers and pissed all over myself 
 edit- i was feeling better about the situation after reading some of your comments until i realized that someone had to clean up my urine after i left 
 <unk> <unk> holy shit guys you popped my gold cherry not once but twice 
 not that it will help me when i have to go to work tomorrow but it makes me happy for now at least 
 thanks 
 edit3 - for those of you who missed it when it was posted and have wondered about how work went the next day here is the update edit 4 - this post was <unk> narrated check it out here went to fancy movie theater with date 
 decide to buy a bottle of wine 
 go back to bar 
 ask for two glasses 
 bartender says he needs two id 's 
 i 'm too lazy to go back to seats to grab dates id 
 tell him i 'm alone and was embarrassed to ask for just one glass 
 he is clearly <unk> 
 idiot me then tries to sell the story and continue on about how lonely i 've been recently 
 he tells me he 's off in a few minutes and insists on watching the movie with me 
 i try to fight it but i could only argue so much without giving away the truth 
 bartender is insistent 
 i text my date what 's happening 
 go back to theater with my new date 
 sit a few rows in front of my first date 
 she has the stupidest grin on her face as me and the bartender jared sit a couple rows in front of her 
 he ends up being super cool and bought me and him another bottle during the movie 
 movie ends 
 i thank him for his gesture 
 he did n't even ask for my number or anything 
 i think jared was just a genuine guy trying to comfort someone 
 met back up with my date in the parking lot and thankfully she found the whole thing hilarious 
 i do n't deserve jared.last night my wife 's boss from her brand new job invited us over for dinner 
 on the drive over my wife <unk> many times to me just how important it was to make a good impression 
 i <unk> and <unk> informed my silly wife that i always make good <unk> 
 my wife 's boss is a single lady in her <unk> so it was just the three of us 
 we <unk> over drinks and salads and seemed to really be hitting it off 
 she laughed at my <unk> <unk> jokes and my wife seemed pleased 
 soon she brought out the main course a nice big juicy steak for each of us 
 as i began to cut into my steak i was discouraged to discover how under cooked this steak was 
 now i 've had my fair share of rare steak 
 i prefer medium but i can handle rare 
 this was <unk> short of rare 
 i probably could 've <unk> the cow had i tried 
 instead i sat there <unk> with my knife and fork worrying about how i was going to get away with not eating this steak 
 claim <unk> 
 no i 'd already <unk> great enthusiasm upon seeing the steak 
 just then our <unk> excused herself to the kitchen to take care of some <unk> preparations 
 as i looked across the fancy dining room table at the open window of this 3rd story apartment ... a cartoon light bulb appeared over my head 
 i knew i had to be <unk> realizing that she could return at any moment 
 i committed 
 i grabbed the steak with my hand gently shook off the juice and executed a perfect throw right through the center of the open window 
 here 's the big time fu 
 the window was n't open 
 it was the <unk> <unk> window you 've ever seen in your life 
 that is until my mostly raw slab of steak slammed up against it and slowly slid down leaving a trail of bloody juice in its wake 
 my wife - who 's steak was a nice medium rare and was unaware of my predicament - turned jaw dropped and stared at me like i was an alien from another planet 
 this look then slowly <unk> into more of a <unk> expression of <unk> anger 
 my wife 's boss heard the thud of the <unk> impact and came quickly 
 she took in the scene the steak sitting on the window <unk> the blood trail my empty plate and then gave me an <unk> puzzled look 
 i just did n't know what to say 
 it felt like a minute of silence but was probably 3 or 4 seconds 
 finally the best i could manage was i ... i 'm so sorry 
 i am such a clutz ... i do n't know ... i was just cutting it.. and ... it ... ... it slipped ... just ask my wife i really am a clutz ... right honey ... 
 no help coming from that direction ... i will clean this up ... i ca n't believe this ... i am so sorry '' etc ... etc ... both women continued to stare at me like i had escaped from the <unk> bin as i smeared the blood around the window with my cloth napkin <unk> off the steak and continued to mutter my incoherent explanation 
 i knew no one was buying the story 
 i knew what i had to do 
 i sheepishly returned to my seat and proceeded to eat every bite of that disgusting cold <unk> bloody raw steak 
 i remained pretty quiet the rest of the evening 
 my wife 's only two words to me since the incident are i 'm fine '' 
 tl dr : tried to sneakily throw my <unk> steak through an open window ... only to find out it was n't open 
 edit : wow thanks stranger 
 update : just got the first <unk> '' i 'm fine '' communication from my wife via text who is at work ... good news boss name and i just had a good laugh over how much of a fucking idiot u are 
 i hope u know u will never live this down 
 love u you moron '' let me tell you that i have made a bad mistake this evening 
 my girlfriend who let me tell you is only my 2nd girlfriend of all time said i am invited to dinner '' with her and her parents 
 i was very aghast nervous and <unk> to be invited to such a situation 
 but i knew it must be done 
 i met them nicely i should tell you and it started off in a good way 
 the idea slapped my mind that i should do a comic bit to make a good impression and become known to them as a person who is amusing 
 when i saw that baked potatoes were served i got the idea that it would be very good if i pretended i did not know what potatoes was 
 that would be funny 
 well let me tell you : backfired on my face 
 i 'll tell you how 
 so first when the potato became on my plate i acted very interesting 
 i showed an expression on my face so as to seem that i was confused astounded but in a <unk> way curious and interested 
 they did notice and seemed confused but did not remark 
 so i asked this looks very interesting 
 what is this '' 
 they stared at me and the mother said it 's a baked potato '' 
 and i was saying oh interesting a baked ... .what is it again '' 
 and she was like a potato '' 
 and i was like a <unk> oh interesting 
 never heard of a potato looks pretty good '' 
 and then they did n't see i was <unk> but thought i really did not know what is a potato 
 so i knew i would be very shamed humiliated depressed and disgusted if i admitted to making a bad joke so what i did was to act as if it was not a joke but i committed to the act of pretending i did n't know what a potato is 
 they asked me very incredulous did i really not know what a potato is 
 that i never heard of a potato 
 i went with it and told them yes i did not ever even hear of a potato 
 not only had i never eaten a potato i had never heard the word potato 
 this went on for a bit and my girlfriend was acting very confused and embarrassed by my fucked up antics '' and then the more insistent i was about not knowing what a potato is was when them parents starting thinking i did know what a potato was 
 well let me tell you i had to commit 100 % at this point 
 when i would not admit to knowing what a potato was the father especially began to get annoyed 
 at one point he said something like enough is enough 
 you 're fucking with us 
 admit it '' 
 and i said sir before today i never heard of a potato 
 i still do n't know what a potato is other than some kind of food 
 i do n't know what to tell you '' 
 well let me tell you he got very annoyed 
 i decided to take a bite of the potato and when i did i made a high pitched noise and said taste 's very strange '' 
 that is when the father started yelling at me and the mother kept saying what are you doing '' 
 and my girlfriend went to some other room 
 finally the father said i should get the fuck out of his house '' and i said it was irrational to treat me like this just because i never heard of a potato before 
 well let me tell you he did n't take that kindly 
 now in text messages i have been telling my girlfriend i really do n't know what a potato is 
 the only way i can ever get out of this is for them to buy that i do n't know what a potato is 
 i wish i never started it but i ca n't go back 
 i think she will break up with me anyway 
 it never really made sense why over the course of three years i never got one comment or <unk> for all of my posts 
 reddit is an absolutely huge site but after a couple years you begin to have your doubts 
 i decided to check to see if i could see my posts in an <unk> browser and saw that none of my posts existed 
 what the fuck 
 it was at that moment i realized that from my first post i was shadow banned and all of my <unk> over three years never was <unk> by a soul 
 i ca n't fucking believe i never caught onto it sooner 
 i 've had my hand raised for three years and no one could ever see me and i never questioned it 
 <unk> my post history to see the <unk> world 
 this literally just happened 
 i was walking to the spot i normally stand at on the train platform but i did n't have my contacts in so my <unk> perception was n't very good 
 i hear someone say hi so i turn to look as i 'm walking and i see my friends sister with her arms <unk> 
 in my head i 'm like oh alright she wants a hug so i go in and give her a hug 
 i thought it felt kind of strange like she was n't really hugging back so i end the hug and back up to look at her 
 at this point i realize a that it was n't my friends sister but a random woman waiting for the train and b she was extending her arms to someone who was behind me who i noticed after the hug 
 they both looked pretty horrified so i did n't even really try to explain myself i kind of just walked away without saying anything 
 tl dr : went in for a hug ruined someone 's <unk> 
 more like more whole life really 
 hi i my name 's john 
 i 've been lurking for a while but i 've finally made an account to post this 
 i need to get my life off my chest 
 about me 
 i 'm a <unk> year old <unk> and i have been living my whole life the opposite of how i wanted 
 all my dreams my passion gone 
 in a steady 9-7 job 
 6 days a week 
 for 26 years 
 i repeatedly chose the safe path for everything which eventually changed who i was 
 today i found out my wife has been cheating on me for the last 10 years 
 my son feels nothing for me 
 i realised i missed my father 's funeral for nothing 
 i did n't complete my novel travelling the world helping the homeless 
 all these things i thought i knew to be a <unk> about myself when i was in my late teens and early twenties 
 if my younger self had met me today i would have punched myself in the face 
 i 'll get to how those dreams were crushed soon 
 let 's start with a description of me when i was 20. it seemed only yesterday when i was sure i was going to change the world 
 people loved me and i loved people 
 i was <unk> creative spontaneous risk-taking and great with people 
 i had two dreams 
 the first was writing a <unk> book 
 the second was travelling the world and helping the poor and homeless 
 i had been dating my wife for four years by then 
 young love 
 she loved my <unk> my energy my ability to make people laugh and feel loved 
 i knew my book was going to change the world 
 i would show the perspective of the <unk> and the <unk> showing my <unk> that everybody thinks differently that people never think what the do is wrong 
 i was 70 pages through when i was 20. i am still 70 pages in at <unk> by 20 i had backpacking around new zealand and the phillipines 
 i planned to do all of asia then europe then america i live in australia by the way 
 to date i have only been to new zealand and the phillipines 
 now we get to where it all went wrong 
 my biggest regrets 
 i was 20. i was the only child 
 i needed to be stable 
 i needed to take that graduate job which would <unk> my whole life 
 to devote my entire life in a 9-7 job 
 what was i thinking 
 how could i live when the job was my life 
 after coming home i would eat dinner prepare my work for the following day and sleep at 10pm to wake up at 6am the following day 
 god i ca n't remember the last time i 've made love to my wife 
 yesterday my wife admitted to cheating on me for the last 10 years 
 10 years 
 that seems like a long time but i ca n't comprehend it 
 it does n't even hurt 
 she says it 's because i 've changed 
 i 'm not the person i was 
 what have i been doing in the last 10 years 
 outside of work i really ca n't say anything 
 not being a proper husband 
 not being me 
 who am i 
 what happened to me 
 i did n't even ask for a divorce or yell at her or cry 
 i felt nothing 
 now i can feel a tear as i write this 
 but not because my wife has been cheating on me but because i am now realising i have been dying inside 
 what happened to that <unk> risk-taking energetic person that was me <unk> to change the world 
 i remember being asked on a date by the most popular girl in the school but <unk> her for my <unk> 
 god i was really popular with the girls in high school 
 in university/college too 
 but i stayed loyal 
 i did n't explore 
 i studied everyday 
 remember all that backpacking and <unk> i told you about 
 that was all in the first few years of college 
 i worked part-time and <unk> all that i had earned 
 now i save every penny 
 i do n't remember a time i spend anything on anything fun 
 on anything for myself 
 what do i even want now 
 my father passed ten years ago 
 i remember getting calls from mom telling me he was getting sicker and sicker 
 i was getting busier and busier on the verge of a big promotion 
 i kept putting my visit off hoping in my mind he would hold on 
 he died and i got my promotion 
 i have n't seen him in 15 years 
 when he died i told myself it did n't matter what i did n't see him 
 being an atheist i rationalized that being dead it would n't matter anyway 
 what was i thinking 
 <unk> everything making excuses to put things off 
 excuses 
 procrastination 
 it all leads to one thing nothing 
 i rationalized that financial security was the most important thing 
 i now know that it definitely is not 
 i regret doing nothing with my energy when i had it 
 my passions 
 my youth 
 i regret letting my job take over my life 
 i regret being an awful husband a <unk> machine 
 i regret not finishing my novel not travelling the world 
 not being emotionally there for my son 
 being a damn <unk> wallet 
 if you 're reading this and you have a whole life ahead of you please 
 do n't procrastinate 
 do n't leave your dreams for later 
 <unk> in your energy your passions 
 do n't stay on the internet with all your spare time unless your passion needs it 
 please do something with your life while your young 
 do not settle down at 20. do not forget your friends your family 
 yourself 
 do not waste your life 
 your ambitions 
 like i did mine 
 do not be like me 
 sorry for the long post just had to get it out there 
 tl : dr i realised i let procrastination and money stop me from pursuing my passions when i was younger and now i am dead inside old and tired 
 edit : i am quite overwhelmed at the response thank you for your time 
 i had posted on a whim and did not expect the reception 
 in regards to my post i must admit i was quite emotional at the time 
 as i read what i had written earlier i ca n't stop myself from noticing an <unk> of spelling and grammatical mistakes phrases that i would not usually say 
 i do n't think i have used capital locks so much in my life 
 however i will not edit them 
 that would not do it justice 
 i have read many of the replies and will try my best to answer the reoccurring questions 
 i will add that the replies have given me a new perspective of life reddit and humanity in general 
 the amount of encouragement and humour <unk> to <unk> me 
 despite my situation i even found myself laughing at a few of the comments 
 what my plans are 
 i am planning to cut down my hours substantially 
 i will take a new job if i have to as i am relatively <unk> 
 i am going to talk to my wife 
 divorce is currently not what i have in mind and i hope that our communication and relationship will improve 
 if it does n't then so be it 
 we will both move on 
 i see there are quite a number of negative comments about her however i am going to have to say in her <unk> she really is a lovely person 
 she is smart empathetic and has a great sense of humour 
 i 'm not saying it was okay for her to do what she did but she 's not an evil person 
 i know that 
 we were both in the fault 
 we let communication <unk> and with it our relationship 
 there is so much more to being a head of house than just being able to bring in the money 
 a steady balance of emotional connection love and finance is what i will <unk> to give 
 my son 
 i do n't any anything about him 
 i really do n't 
 i have unknowingly distanced myself from him i only see him around dinner time 
 i do not recall having a proper conversation with him it 's quite preposterous now that i think about it 
 i 'm not exactly sure how i 'll start <unk> with him i have become quite a boring person 
 however i plan to change that 
 i refuse to be a poor role model 
 i will ensure that he does not make the same mistake i did with my family 
 i have decided i am going to start watching his basketball games and rugby games on saturdays 
 i never have due to work but i will ensure that i do 
 perhaps i will even play video games with him 
 there was a time i had a collection of <unk> games and i was n't half bad either 
 who knows i might really connect with my son and it seems to be something he enjoys 
 in regards to the novel and travelling i admit i am a different person from my youth 
 i no longer have the creativity and desire to complete the novel 
 when i found the <unk> 70 pages the writing was no longer mine 
 i have changed substantially in 26 years 
 i am sorry to disappoint as so many of you seemed incredibly keen to read it 
 however i am just as excited to read the stories of all of you aspiring <unk> that have expressed their passion 
 the travelling i might still do 
 family trips probably in the school holidays 
 maybe with my wife every now and then if she 'd have me 
 i ca n't turn back time and see my father for a final time though my mother is still alive 
 she lives in london so visits are quite difficult 
 however i will make an effort to see her 
 i do love my parents 
 i only wish i had not <unk> them as i did 
 in regards to the advice i have given 
 i stand by what i said 
 live your life 
 do not procrastinate and let <unk> stop you 
 however i might add avoid living in <unk> 
 i have had the good fortune to have had never experienced hunger or <unk> 
 i would imagine chasing your ambitions and being happy would be <unk> more difficult without proper nutrition and living standards 
 i believe someone mentioned their dream was financial <unk> 
 i say that is just as valiant as any dream to have 
 we are all different and are missing different things in our lives be honest with yourself and you 'll know what you really want 
 i believe there were <unk> upon my language and university/college or what not 
 i will clarify that although australians generally call <unk> education <unk> here i have made small efforts to <unk> to americans as they are the main users at least i assume 
 and yes university/college was free when i attended 
 i believe australians now are able to attend them relatively free upfront and can pay their fees after they graduate 
 i believe i have covered the general scope of questions 
 p.s 
 thank you for the gold i do appreciate it but they are n't of real value to me 
 perhaps if reddit ever includes a <unk> gold feature i will gift them to some of the <unk> 
 and yes please stop sending me gold 
 i also believe someone tried to even donate to me 
 i assure you money is not what i read 
 please save it for yourself 
 i do n't think i 'll come back to reddit unless i hear about a way to <unk> gold 
 i thank you all for your sympathy your time and i wish all the best for those in difficult situations 
 i have faith in your capacity and ability to change to become happy to help yourselves 
 because after all you 're the person in the best position to 
 and no i am not considering religion i just do not have the correct mindset 
 i am logical to the point that i can not however that is not to say religion is n't bad it gives people the hope and sense after death which i really do envy 
 sincerest of regards john 
 background 
 my cousin and i both male were having a sleep over when we were around 6 years old 
 we started talking about girls and about how they could pee we could n't figure it out so we started to come up with ideas 
 one thing led to another and we started talking about how to have sex with a girl since we had never seen a vagina we thought maybe it was the butt 
 curious we proceeded to put our little peckers into each others butts and just lay there 
 one on his stomach and the other on top we would switch positions 
 at the time i thought nothing of it but years down the road when i was a teenager i realized what the hell had happened 
 i tried my best to ignore this little piece of history and so did my cousin 
 but every time we would hang out as we grew up you could tell it was still awkward and was only getting worse 
 fast forward 20 years and we are both married out at dinner on a double date and we had an obviously gay waiter 
 my cousins wife remarks i do n't understand how they can have sex with other men that is just weird '' i <unk> said its pretty easy '' 
 both wives look at me and i go what like you 've never had causal gay sex with your cousin when you were 6 before 
 my stupid brain thought this would be a good way to finally break the ice on the situation i meant it to be so ridiculous that the wives would never think i was serious 
 instead it led to a lengthy conversation of what the <unk> '' and oh my fucking gods '' as my cousin and i tried to explain to our wives why we had gay sex in a walk in closet at my grandmothers house at the age of 6. tifu by letting my wife and cousin 's wife know that we had gay sex when we were children 
 in a restaurant with a gay waiter 
 im sure people overheard 
 i often play a game with my son where we have a martial arts duel with various fruits and vegetables 
 for example i 'd be throwing grapes as if they were ninja stars and he 'd be defending with a cucumber <unk> sword 
 it 's just one of those strange family <unk> i guess 
 anyway last night i was preparing dinner and enjoying a few glasses of wine 
 i felt in my element chopping potatoes when suddenly i was struck in the side of my face by a <unk> stick 
 i jumped around in battle mode while letting out a war cry 
 unfortunately i did n't put my knife down before this flailing maneuver and ended up slicing my son 's hand open 
 he screamed i screamed 
 the doctor reported me to child services 
 edit : i 'm his mother for goodness sake 
 so my coworker call him jeff is <unk> but his parents kept trying to get him a girlfriend 
 when he kept <unk> them his parents eventually asked if he was gay 
 he decided to pretend he was and said he was already seeing a coworker and then asked me to pretend to be with him even going so far as to offer money i do n't really know enough people to care about my reputation and could think of worse ways to earn money so i agreed 
 his parents wanted to meet me 
 the original plan was to meet his family and leave a very bad first impression so he would have reason to not bring me around them 
 well i got there and it turns out his family is about the most fucking awesome family i 've ever met 
 i expected everybody to either <unk> around the gay thing or be very over <unk> about supporting it either way i would <unk> and make an ass out of myself 
 turns out they treated me just like they would anybody else so i could n't do that 
 then his twin sister call her jenny comes out and decides to try to make me uncomfortable by sitting on my lap i did n't mind and asking questions that most would consider inappropriate i kind of fell in love with her that night 
 well i ended up leaving a good impression and was invited to dinner the next night to meet his other sister and her husband 
 that dinner went great as well so i ended up just saying fuck it i 'll come over whenever they invite me and just hope we do n't slip up '' 
 things went pretty well over next few months i got along with everybody and kept telling myself i 'd ask jenny out after we told them the truth 
 well jeff ended up getting an apartment and moving out of his parents house he needed a roommate and i volunteered i wanted to move out of my parent 's house anyway 
 one night i get back from work to find a fucking candle lit dinner waiting for me turns out he really was gay and had a crush on me and decided the best way to seduce me would be an elaborate scheme to trick me into moving in with him 
 needless to say i rejected him and he was actually surprised when i did 
 so he calls his mom crying and said i <unk> on him 
 his family hates me now especially jenny 
 they wo n't believe a word out of my mouth because it 's his word against mine 
 so now i live signed a 1 year lease and work with a guy who thinks he 's in love with me 
 i did learn a valuable lesson though if you are going to live a lie record some kind of proof that it 's a lie 
 tldr pretended to be gay to help friend get parents off his back find out he was n't pretending 
 now i live with a gay guy who thinks he 's in love with me 
 update 07/21 convinced jenny to let me explain the situation from my point of view 
 she believes me but said she wo n't side against her twin even if he 's in the wrong 
 now my only hope is to convince him to tell the truth 
 update 2 07/21 just went through more drama in an hour than i have in the last 5 years 
 basically after jenny left she went home and confronted jeff he slept at their house 
 they then invited me to come clear the air 
 i told them the same thing i told jenny then jeff told his side of the story but spun it just enough to convince them that he did n't think we were pretending and that i led him on 
 he also left in the part about me cheating he said he caught me with a girl and that 's what <unk> this whole mess 
 since i ca n't <unk> anything he said they now believe that i 'm a sack of shit that likes to lead on gay men for fun while i 'm out sleeping around i 've only been with one girl 
 and to salt the wound just a little bit more jenny called me a creep for letting her sit on my lap apparently it was only cute when i was gay 
 the only person who even questioned jeff 's lying ass is his older sister and she said the same thing jenny did i wo n't side against my family even if they are wrong '' 
 so i just lost what was basically my second family and i 'm either stuck living with captain dipshit or stuck with an apartment i ca n't afford alone 
 update 3 07/21 so things just went from a bad situation to a <unk> one 
 my boss just called me on my day off to tell me jeff asked to be put on a different schedule than me 
 apparently jeff told him i threatened to kick the shit out of him and i fucked up more royally than i 've ever fucked up before i said i never said anything like that and to tell jeff to prove it '' and now i 've got to go in later to discuss this situation and he told me i was probably going to be suspended until further notice 
 that motherfucker attacked my job this means war 
 update 4 07/21 well i called my landlord and am meeting him on his lunch break today also somebody i know offered to get me some legal <unk> so i 've got a meeting later today to discuss my options 
 also is there a better way to do this update thing 
 i 'm not sure if this is correct form for this kind of thing 
 update 5 07/21 i just got a call from the coworker that knew a bit about it he got together a group of our coworkers and they pulled jeff aside and convinced '' him to admit he was lying to the manager so the job part might be resolved 
 now we just need to come to an understanding about the apartment 
 i 'm willing to live with him for the remainder of the lease if he 's willing to sign a <unk> or something stating that this is over 
 i 'm not going to try to fix things with his family you guys have rightfully pointed out that it is n't worth it 
 i 'll probably end up being a hermit after this mess 
 update 6 07/21 just got a confirmation that he came clean to our manager he 's being sent home early and we both have to come back later tonight to resolve this situation he did n't give me any information about the <unk> suspension but i 'm optimistic 
 when he gets here i 'm going to sit down with him and apologize for everything i 've done to hurt him real or imagined and then hopefully we can settle this like <unk> people 
 then after i find someone to take over the lease i 'm going to go on my merry way and hope for the best 
 update 6.5 <unk> narrated this for some reason and it 's funny as hell 
 here 's the link : update 7 07/21 so jeff came home and we had a fairly short but very <unk> discussion 
 he agreed to put this whole thing behind him on the condition that i let him continue the lie with his family 
 i agreed to apologize to his family from the bottom of my heart for cheating on him and admit that i was leading him on 
 in return he agreed to make a <unk> confession video admitting that we were both at fault <unk> the cheating and leading on altogether and he would let it die here and now 
 we sealed the deal by punching each other and unknown to him i recorded the whole conversation on my laptop 
 i wo n't do anything with said recording unless he forces my hand 
 thank you guys from the bottom of my heart your comments have helped me think through this mess and not react in a physical manner 
 this is mostly likely my last update unless something <unk> happens with the landlord lawyer or workplace 
 also he said he 'd try to make jenny apologize for calling me a creep even he agrees she ca n't get mad about something she <unk> in the first place 
 and the movie rights go to whoever gets a script written up first just as long as the actor portraying me is a handsome motherfucker 
 update <unk> holy shit this hit the front page and some kind soul gave me gold 
 thank you whoever you are 
 update 8 <unk> i 'm sorry for updating so late but i fell asleep after getting home and just woke up 
 i talked to our landlord and told him we had a falling out and even though it 's solved i wanted to know if it was possible to get out of the lease if i could find somebody else willing to take it on 
 he said he 'd be willing to let me draw up a <unk> lease or something along those lines my memory is fuzzy right now so if i can find somebody willing to live with dipshit i 'll be free 
 after that i talked to the lawyer he said that it 's illegal to record somebody without <unk> so if i tried to use the recording i could face <unk> charges he advised i <unk> the recording 
 furthermore he said i could file a lawsuit for slander and something about character but i 'd be open to a <unk> and jeff has at least 5 people who would be willing to <unk> on his behalf 
 then he told me a <unk> order would be a terrible idea it would be extremely obvious that i was only filing it either as retaliation or as a preemptive legal defense 
 so he advised me to avoid <unk> jeff in any way and hope he does n't find out about the recording 
 after that i went to tell my own family what was happening and things did n't go well my mother first said i was pretending to be gay the same way that guys say they were joking after being rejected 
 then after i played the recording she admitted she 'd rather have a gay son who 's in denial than a son who would manipulate an entire family 
 so needless to say we are n't speaking at the moment my siblings are refusing to take sides for the most part so no help there either 
 after that me and jeff met up at work for the meeting with our boss 
 we both got written up for unprofessional <unk> and told this was first and only warning next time there is drama between us we both get fired 
 and he 's going to put jeff on a later shift than me so we do n't have very much <unk> in schedule 
 next we went to his family 's house so i could make my apology i decided to follow the advice of the people on here and did n't support his lie about leading him on or cheating but i did n't directly deny them either so i kept up my part of the deal 
 after my apology i even managed a few tears it was n't exactly hard they basically took turns berating me but i took it and did n't argue or defend myself after that i told them they 'd probably never see or hear from me again and left 
 on my way out the sister 's husband followed me out and loudly threatened to fuck me up if he ever saw me again 
 but he sent me a text like 5 minutes apologizing and said he was just trying to earn some points with them by defending their honor and that he actually secretly was on my side 
 i basically just rolled my eyes and told him to fuck off 
 i think that 's pretty much it i 'm still shaking like a motherfucker but at least the worst part is over 
 update 9 <unk> well i got fired today our boss was watching through the security footage from the other day and saw the coworkers approach jeff in a <unk> <unk> '' and he decided jeff only dropped his complaint against me because they threatened him 
 he also suspended two of the guys involved and fired another 
 so i 'm seriously considering just skipping town right about now 
 final update <unk> it 's been a couple days since my last update and i do n't know how many people will even see this but i 'll do it anyway 
 i 've decided to leave town it 's next to impossible to get a job here without connections and i do n't have many and to make it worse i was fired from my previous job 
 not to mention i either hate or am hated by just about everybody here and i could use some distance from my family 
 so i do n't see much future in california for me 
 i 'm going to tell my landlord the full story and show him the recording in hopes that he 'll let me out of the lease 
 even if he does n't i 'm willing to risk taking a ding to my credit and jeff 's and just leave anyway 
 an xbox friend of mine lives in texas and told me he 'd help me get started if i choose to move to his town but i 'm not eager to <unk> trust somebody i barely know that 's what started this shit in the first place 
 so do you guys have any good advice for me 
 i 'm leaning toward texas because it would be nice to have somebody to help me get started but if you guys have a better place please share 
 a place with fairly low cost of living and plenty of job opportunities would be nice 
 anywhere except colorado or <unk> 
 some people have asked for another update so here it is <unk> 
 : i have decided on texas my xbox friend has been helping me apply for jobs and look at apartments 
 i am still living with jeff and we have n't had any more drama 
 we both basically pretend that the other one does n't exist 
 jenny actually sent me a text and apologized for her part in this and i told her to go fuck herself 
 i 've sort of made peace with my mother but it an <unk> kind of peace 
 and my old coworker that got fired for threatening jeff helped me get an <unk> job moving furniture 
 they call me when they need help with a delivery or something and pay me cash 
 i considered showing the recording to my old boss to try to get my old job back but decided that i really do n't want to work for somebody that jumps to <unk> based on <unk> evidence regardless of the actual story 
 if i missed anything let me know and i 'll elaborate 
 another quick update for you guys <unk> : i applied at a temp agency last week and they got me a part time job working nights 
 tonight is my first night 
 i also got a job interview next week for a full time day job 
 if i get it i plan to work both and save up as rapidly as i can 
 after a month or two i 'd be able to move to texas with enough to have a safety net while i get set up there 
 nothing new on the jeff situation 
 i usually retreat to my room when he gets home and only come out for food 
 yet another update 08/14 : things went well at the part time job and they will be keeping me on they do n't know i 'm leaving 
 i went to make peace with my mom and basically told her we needed to agree to disagree before i left because i probably wo n't be visiting for a very long time 
 after a while she actually told me she was considering packing up the family and coming to texas with me 
 nothing is concrete yet but it sounds like she was serious 
 so i might actually have my family to help me 
 another update <unk> : either next week or three weeks from now i 'll be going to texas to work out a place to live 
 after that i 'll come back here grab a <unk> and start the process 
 my family is coming with me so it will be a bit more complicated but i 'm glad to have them 
 i 'll be passing through <unk> ca <unk> <unk> <unk> dallas and <unk> tx 
 i 'm still leaning toward dallas but am open to any of those 
 if anybody has anything to say about those areas i 'd appreciate it 
 also i have a football card collection that i 'm going to sell if it 's worth enough to make a difference 
 and my mother has a collection of foreign <unk> that she 's willing to sell 
 does anybody here have any advice on how to go about selling either of them 
 update to answer some common <unk> : op is overreacting by moving to a new town just because of some drama '' i 'm not leaving town because of jeff i 've wanted to leave california for a while now 
 being fired just lit a fire under my ass 
 i was n't going to seriously consider moving as long as i had a decent job 
 op should <unk> up jeff '' i 'm not going to take any sort of revenge i do n't want to invite any more problems into my life right now 
 i 've been talking to another redditor that i trust and with their help i 've written a letter that i 'll leave for him when i go 
 basically it explains that his actions have severe consequences and has an open to <unk> but vaguely suicidal ending 
 then i 'll create a new facebook and abandon my old one he 's still on my friends what about the recording '' 
 i 'm not going to do anything with the recording unless he decides to fuck with my life some more 
 why not <unk> '' 
 because i fucking hate snow have you decided where you 're going '' 
 we 've settled on houston will be leaving as soon as my mother gets her next paycheck 
 we 'll just convoy up and hope to get into a house quickly 
 my temp agency has offices in houston that will get me a job fairly quickly 
 op show pics of <unk> '' i 'm not going to provide any personal information on here not mine nor anybody else 's 
 for all of you who gave me words of <unk> thank you from the bottom of my heart 
 if i ever get rich i 'll give all of you puppies or something 
 ok people have been asking for another update and i live to please : i am still in <unk> we 're still going to texas 
 we 're going to put everything in storage except what we can fit in my car or mom 's van then just convoy up to houston and find a place to live 
 we 'll probably leave in two weeks 
 nothing new on the jeff front i 've only seen him a few times this last week 
 i still hide in my room every time he comes home 
 you can call it petty but i call it not <unk> fate 
 i 'll try to update when something happens 
 <unk> update for you guys : we 've decided on san antonio instead of houston and will be leaving on the 15th 
 i 've been having kind of a moral dilemma about the goodbye the note i 've written to him might be a bit too far 
 i 'm trying to find the right combination of words to make him realize what he did was not right and maybe prevent him from doing it in the future 
 probably the last update before i move : we 're still committed to san antonio and will be leaving sometime next week probably on thursday 
 we 've got a storage shed and have been moving all our shit into it this last week and my sister 's boyfriend has decided to come with us 
 so we 've got another driver and more potential for income 
 my last day at the temp job is on sunday and i 've gotten two different managers to write up letters of <unk> as well as about 6 references 
 so the odds of my landing a job have gone up significantly 
 still have n't been able to sell my football cards so i 'll probably just keep them 
 also at the request of <unk> i posted my letter to jeff in the comments 
 here 's the link 
 i 've said it before but i 'll say it again it 's been good having so many people offer up advice and support i truly wish i could do something for all of you in return 
 to the people who 've offered me a drink or a hug if i pass through your respective town i 'll hit you up 
 to everybody else thank you for being awesome 
 quick update for those still following this : we have not made it to san antonio just yet 
 we 've had delay after delay and things are not going very well so far 
 car problems money problems and too much road work 
 we are in <unk> <unk> new mexico right now and have about 600 miles left to go 
 we should make it there tomorrow evening if things go smoothly after that we 'll try to get into a house but it will be difficult as we have less money than we expected to but i 'm trying to stay optimistic about everything 
 another quick update : we went to see houses today with the most kind and <unk> <unk> in the country 
 we are going to submit the application tomorrow and hopefully it wo n't take very long as staying in a hotel is draining our money at an <unk> rate 
 i 've applied for a few jobs and am going to a temp agency tomorrow to see if i ca n't get anything immediately 
 jeff called yesterday and i did n't answer he left a message crying and basically telling me how sorry he is 
 i doubt i 'll be calling him back any time soon 
 final update : we got into a house just got our internet turned on today 
 i 'm still working on getting a job but things are looking up for us 
 this post won fuck up of the year 
 i was n't planning on doing an update but after winning this i feel compelled to do one 
 so here it is : life is pretty good for me now 
 i made it past the <unk> period at my new job 
 it 's probably the best job i 've ever had i love both the work and the co workers and my managers are fucking awesome 
 nothing new from jeff 
 my old landlord has n't contacted me so i do n't think i 'm in trouble for breaking the lease 
 i think that pretty much <unk> it up 
 thank you guys again for all the awesome shit you do and i 'm sorry if you sent me a pm that i never replied to i still get too many to reply to without resorting to something generic like thanks you too '' 
 tldr : pretended to be gay to help friend 
 found out he was n't pretending 
 he was pissed that i turned him down destroyed my relationships and got me fired 
 i moved across the country 
 i <unk> am a server at a restaurant 
 last week we had lone male customer come in and asked to be seated by the window my area of serving we immediately hit it off 
 he was older than me had a sexy scottish accent hilariously witty and very <unk> 
 i was thrilled when he left his number on the back of the bill 
 fast forward one week : after a few small talk texts we decided to meet up and agree at 3:00pm at the city fountain right downtown in a busy area 
 i arrive a few minutes early and decide to sit in the shade of a nearby statue and wait 
 within seconds an older relativley handsome guy wearing sunglasses approaches me 
 hey it 's great to see you '' 
 i smile and greet him and he immediatley lunges into some big 5 minute long story about a <unk> <unk> he got into on his way driving to meet me and apologized <unk> for being late 
 by this point i could clearly tell he did n't have a scottish accent 
 you do n't have nearly as much of an accent that i thought you did am i crazy 
 he laughed and gave me a weird look <unk> how i must be crazy because he has never had an accent 
 we continue walking slowly on the downtown strip making more small talk 
 by this point i had a feeling something was <unk> i could 've sworn the accent was the main reason i had been drawn to him in the first place 
 when he asks me how to produce my name as the o with the dots '' is relativley uncommon in our country 
 i say my name which has the letter o not <unk> and he is immediatley giving me a weird look 
 we stop in the middle of the <unk> surrounded by people walking 
 he takes off his sunglasses revealing an unfamiliar face 
 you 're not ben are you '' 
 i ask awkwardly to which he shakes his head 
 we both burst out in laughter realizing we clearly fucked up 
 i 'm supposed to be meeting a girl i 've met online down bedside that statue at 2:30 
 she 's a <unk> but i have n't a picture of her face '' 
 we speed walk back to the fountain both almost in tears due to the hilariously embarrassing moment that we found ourselves in 
 we part ways just before the fountain and i see my real date sitting reading a book 
 didnt mention the ridiculous event that happened moments before and had a <unk> date 
 tl dr went on a first date ended up being the wrong date found my real date <unk> happened a few years ago and i was living in zimbabwe at the time and i was having a pretty bad day i was going to see my auntie who lived about <unk> away from me 
 if youre african you 'll <unk> that this was no small journey 
 so i got in my car and set off and about 3 hours into the journey i came across a dude by the side of the road who was going in the same direction so out of the goodness of my heart i said jump in 
 we go to talking and he happened to be going to exact same village as me and he knew my auntie 
 half an hour passes and we 're making polite <unk> chat and <unk> about old times in zimbabwe when all of a sudden he tell me to pull over so i do 
 he runs out of the car and starts making <unk> noises so i assume he 's throwing up its dark at this point so i cant really see much so i go check on him first mistake 
 i get out and go to his side expecting him to be there but he 's not ... <unk> i here someone behind and me and before i know it im <unk> 
 so i wake up a couple hours later <unk> this becuase the sun was coming up at this point without my car clothes or wallet 
 so im thinking great 
 i look around and see im on some <unk> wearing the <unk> clothes 
 so i start walking in no particular direction and eventually come across a settlement 
 i explain to them my situation and they tell me that the nearest main road is at least a good half a days walk from where i am and they dont get many cars coming through this part but they heard one last night which might be our thief 
 i start walking in the direction they point me in and after what felt like forever i come <unk> a road so i pitch up and start waiting now i know most of you are thinking why not call someone i had no phone with me and i dont have the best memory so i didnt know any numbers that would come in handy 
 after a couple of hours a car stops and lets me hitch i let him know the <unk> and he says we 're in the complete opposite direction of my intended destination but he 's willing to drop me close enough to walk the rest of the way to which i thought great 
 its takes a good two days to get there and he drops me off and i say my goodbyes to my driver i take down his number so i can <unk> him later on 
 at this point im starting to <unk> my <unk> i walk for a few miles and as im getting closer to my <unk> i can here a lots of singing and what appears to be a large crowd which i though was strange 
 im about 100 feet from the house and i see my son which again i thought was strange because he was meant to be in school at this time but instead of running to me and hugging me as he normally does ... he runs away screaming to my complete bewilderment 
 i get to the the gate and all of a sudden the large crowd alerted by my sons scream has stopped singing and is stood silent 
 my wife appears and starts to run towards me hugging and kissing me like ive been gone for months 
 my auntie appears and immediately <unk> when she sees me 
 i still have no clue whats going on at this point and im exhausted so we rush to get my auntie inside and i see my picture <unk> of a large box that resembles a coffin sitting in the living room ... so it turns out that the guy who robbed me and made off with my car my wallet and all my clothes was in a car crash so bad that they couldnt identify the body and because the only things they could use to identify him was my wallet they assumed it was me that had died in the crash 
 since there was no body of sorts they could arrange the funeral <unk> quickly and that is what i had stumbled upon 
 my son still has <unk> to this day and and my wife has told me never to pick up a hitch <unk> ever again 
 tl dr got <unk> <unk> died and family thought it was me they arrange my funeral and i somehow manage to stumble upon my own funeral 
 so this morning i was in court <unk> a traffic ticket when i called the judge your <unk> '' ... this happened yesterday so if you 're out there bus girl i want you to know 
 it 's not what you think 
 yesterday after working a <unk> shift at the old internet <unk> i 'm a network engineer 
 i got on the bus to go home just like always 
 ahead of me in line is a young woman who is looking very pretty she has red hair and a nice <unk> <unk> 
 i do n't think much of it but we end up sitting across from each other on the bus 
 i 'm reading something that was on the front page but get the urge to look up and see her face 
 i had only seen the back of her head before 
 i glance up and to my delight she is very pretty 
 <unk> 
 i have seen one more pretty girl in the world than i did before 
 except <unk> she looks up at me 
 i realize i 'm probably <unk> and not really paying attention 
 i look down 
 i do n't really know why i do n't have a problem talking to girls 
 i have a long time girlfriend and i do n't talk to very many women these days 
 i 'm feeling a bit sheepish and awkward so i glance up again for some reason 
 a second after i do - she looks up at me and catches me starring at her or at least she thinks i 'm starring at her 
 she screws up her face a little bit 
 i 'm not even that ugly oh well 
 twice in a row i 've been caught slipping 
 none of this matters because the mid-way stop at the <unk> is coming up and usually everyone gets off the bus here 
 she stands up as the bus stops and i breath in relief 
 i also stand up in search of a more comfortable seat the bench seats that face <unk> kind of suck 
 so i 'm waiting for people to clear out and people are getting off the bus 
 but on today of all days much more people are getting on the bus much more than usually 
 must be a football game tonight or something 
 she is n't getting off the bus 
 she sits by the window in a regular seat 
 i look around - all of the other seats are being filled quickly 
 i walk to the back of the bus nothing 
 i look around there is nothing 
 the universe 's cruel game of musical chairs is playing creep '' by <unk> 
 i sit down next to her 
 she looks at me like a deer in the headlights and i think she is actually afraid 
 flash forward 10 minutes and i 've moved seats as we are the only two people left on the bus 
 she is looking over at me regularly probably making sure i 'm not furiously masturbating or something 
 last stop 
 my stop 
 her stop 
 our stop 
 we get off the bus she goes first and stars walking in my house 's direction 
 we slowly walk together for a few blocks she keeps checking over her shoulder 
 she finally turns down a <unk> and i think maybe i can relax now 
 i turn down my street 
 i breath a sigh of relief finally the coast is clear and i do n't feel like i 'm stalking anyone 
 then she appears she clearly took a <unk> to get away from me and i met up with her on my road 
 she starts running up the steps to my building and i 'm freaking the fuck out like what is happening am i actually stalking this girl 
 i keep walking towards my building i just want to go home 
 she turns and yells at me from the stairs stop fucking following me fucking creep '' this is how i met my new neighbor 
 so i have been setting this prank up for about 3 weeks now but unfortunately the fruits of my labor came to <unk> yesterday 
 all for the best i guess 
 background : my wife and i are very healthy and we eat the same thing for breakfast every day well maybe a solid <unk> days a year 
 it is egg whites and toast 
 it has got to the point that if i do n't eat this for breakfast my entire day feels off '' 
 i put salsa on my eggs while she uses ketchup and she has to have ketchup or else she will not eat breakfast 
 we have a backup bottle or two in the pantry just in case she runs out 
 3 weeks ago : i notice that her bottle is running pretty low and she has to actively shake the bottle to get the last remnants out 
 we are pretty earth conscious as well so nothing goes to waste use until the last drop 
 there is still just enough left in the bottle that i can tell she is thinking that she should n't <unk> it just yet and puts it back into the fridge 
 i notice this thought process going on in her head and decide i should mess with her 
 once we finish up breakfast she goes to get ready 
 i take one of the full bottles of ketchup and add just enough to the almost empty bottle so that she will have the amount needed for breakfast the next day 
 breakfast the next day rolls around and she does the same thing adds ketchup to her breakfast and decides there is just enough to save and puts it back in the fridge 
 i again refill the bottle with just enough for the next day 
 i should also mention that she is short i hid the refill bottle at the top of the pantry so she could not see that it had been opened and used 
 2 weeks ago : after 7 days <unk> watching her add ketchup to her breakfast i can begin to see an intrigued look on her face when she is prepping her breakfast 
 she does n't say anything but you can tell she has taken notice of the bottle 
 this goes on for another 7 days 
 1 week ago : breakfast continues to go off without a hitch and every time she adds the ketchup to her breakfast she gets a little <unk> in her eye like she really really wants to say something about it but does n't want me to make fun of her being crazy and thinking the ketchup bottle is never ending 
 to the point that she will look at me start to say something and then stop herself change the subject and put the bottle away 
 i have never looked forward to breakfast so much in my entire life 
 all this week : she is on the verge of saying something everyday 
 its becoming hard to not laugh while watching her add the ketchup to her eggs but i am laughing hysterically on the inside 
 at this point i have used roughly a half bottle of ketchup refilling the other one 
 this is all i can imagine when watching her yesterday : she adds ketchup to her breakfast and looks me directly in the eye and dead serious says <unk> we have a fucking magical ketchup bottle '' 
 i could not control my laughter and proceed to loose my shit while she tries to explain to me how she has used the exact same bottle of ketchup for 3 weeks and it has been almost empty '' the entire time 
 she now thinks i am laughing because of her belief in magic and she is trying as hard as possible to convince me that she is serious and it is magic 
 i proceed to go into the pantry take out the half empty bottle of ketchup and place it on the counter 
 it all finally clicks in her head and at that moment the empty ketchup bottle clicked into my head but do n't care because i made a magic ketchup bottle happen so i am essentially jesus 
 tl dr made my wife believe we had a magic ketchup bottle but it hurt just as much as normal bottle when flung at my face 
 edit # 1 : wow gold 
 yeeooww 
 thanks so much everyone 
 edit # 2 : yes you can leave ketchup out of the <unk> 
 it does n't go bad for months given the <unk> many restaurants do this 
 it does <unk> eventually but you can tell from the color change and it tastes a little off 
 it will not make you sick for a long time 
 also the ketchup bottle was plastic i did not die 
 edit # 3 : to all the people saying bread is not healthy seeing as i do not have <unk> disease my body can process it just fine 
 it is organic <unk> grain <unk> whole <unk> 
 you can find it at a trader joe 's near you 
 also the egg whites come already separated from the <unk> in a container so they are not being thrown out 
 edit # 4 : to all the people saying that this is not a healthy breakfast i suppose you are the people who put no dressing on salad which sounds terrible 
 using any dressing <unk> will not make the meal <unk> 
 my wife is a <unk> in a hospital food knowledge is kind of her thing 
 edit # 5 : this got way more attention than i ever imagined and yes we do stupid stuff like this all the time to each other 
 my mom got me some chocolate covered pretzel bits for christmas and they literally looked like shit 
 i told my parents and they said they look like pretzels and told me to stop being ungrateful 
 after everyone went to bed i put a few of my chocolate pretzels outside of the cat litter box to make it look like the cat got shit everywhere 
 the next morning i come downstairs and my family is complaining about the cat shit so i decide to be funny and pick one up and take a bite out of it and laugh at everybody because i was right about the pretzels looking like shit 
 i take a bite 
 it 's soft 
 it 's not a chocolate pretzel it 's fucking shit 
 my family is howling with laughter as i run to the bathroom 
 they knew what i had done and replaced my pretzels with actual cat shit 
 i do n't think i can ever show my face around my family again 
 they keep telling me i can clean the litter box if i get hungry 
 edit : hilarious narration by cyae1 
 edit 2 : thanks for the gold 
 at least i got something out of eating cat shit 
 edit 3 : i 'm glad so many enjoy my suffering 
 i went to the doctor a few weeks ago and i am <unk> free 
 thanks for all of the concern 
 my family still <unk> me every so often 
 i am dreading a family get together next <unk> sister-in-law is an absolute <unk> 
 she has always had some shit mobile phone but recently upgraded to an iphone due to some pressure from her kids 
 she was having some problems with certain aspects of it certain things draining her battery etc and asked me if i could have a look at it 
 so me being the absolute evil genius that i am entered a text <unk> so that when she typed the word <unk> which is her husbands name it would come up 'you 're a fat bitch 
 lol jk 
 i know this is hardly an <unk> prank and an <unk> text she would try and text her husband 'hi jay and it would come up 'hi you 're a fat bitch 
 lol jk which seemed like a pretty harmless joke that he would n't really be offended by 
 so i sit back to wait for the outcome 
 fast forward a couple of hours and i hear an ungodly <unk> of my front door 
 i answer the door and she shoves past me what the fuck did you do to my phone '' 
 i am completely taken aback by how angry she is and was like sorry kelly it was only a joke was jay pissed off '' 
 to which she replied i did n't fucking text jay my friend 's mum had just died i wrote to her on facebook to say 'so sorry for your loss thinking of you love kelly and jay '' what she had actually written was so sorry for your loss thinking of you love kelly and you 're a fat bitch 
 lol jk '' so for those of you who do n't know there is a google survey app for android you can download where you get to take surveys 
 after <unk> the surveys you receive anywhere from $ <unk> to $ <unk> for doing a survey to use on the google play store 
 now with these surveys i have always lied 
 the more i 'd <unk> these answers the more valuable '' it makes my opinion 
 the more valuable my opinion is the more surveys i get which means more play store credit 
 if i had been honest i would not have gotten any surveys much like when i told my friend about the app and never got a survey after his first one 
 so far i 've received about $ 35 in play store credit by doing these surveys 
 so this morning i got a google survey on my <unk> 
 it was a 3 question survey 
 the survey asked if i had ever been to a water park called kelp water parks 
 i said yes 
 then it asked what my favorite slide was 
 i just chose a random name of a ride and proceeded to the next question 
 only then did i find out it was n't a survey but it was designed to fish out people like me 
 people who lie on their surveys 
 it told me that the kelp water park did n't exist 
 google then proceeded to scold me saying lying is a bad thing and it will most likely not consider me for future surveys 
 google caught me lying and left me feeling like i lied to my own father 
 tldr : lied to google 
 received a virtual spanking over their survey app 
 so i 'm pulling a long day up at <unk> to get to the airport pull a full day working in a different country and head back to the airport for 6pm just to get back to my bed late late at night 
 a <unk> day 
 and there 's nothing to eat the whole day but <unk> food 
 even the freaking business lunch that i 've been looking forward to is in a low rent cafeteria due to <unk> at the client 's site 
 i hold it together through the day the occasional <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> and an air of professional courtesy but things are going badly for my guts by the time i 'm waving goodbye and getting into the airport taxi 
 now i 'm used to <unk> where you sit in the back separated by a screen but this is more of a private hire situation and i 'm up at the front with the driver 
 i 'm actually irritated that i 'm still holding back this storm of gas that 's been building through meeting after meeting with no opportunity for release but for <unk> 's sake i do n't let rip next to the poor cabbie 
 turns out <unk> are a one way street 
 we 've been driving about five minutes and this terrible smell hits my nose 
 the cabbie has ripped one i ca n't believe it 
 my eyes are <unk> and he just carries on talking about the weather like it has n't even happened 
 i figure he 's probably embarrased so i do n't say anything 
 but a couple of minutes later another one 
 bam 
 it 's fucking disgusting i have to close my mouth because the air 's thick enough you can basically taste it 
 but then i 'm just breathing through my nose which is helping nobody 
 it actually feels like it 's burning me 
 my throat is closing up 
 above all it seems so deeply <unk> 
 i 'm here maintaining some class holding back a fart that could <unk> a second universe but i 'm still breathing the same <unk> as if i was n't courtesy of my filthy cabbie 
 i think fuck it if this guy goes in for round three i am releasing my demons and letting him take the blame 
 we 're five minutes out and he parks another air biscuit 
 fuck you i think and i do the deed 
 it 's perfectly executed 
 a silent release of a full day of pressure every fart has been <unk> since 9am and i 'm <unk> them all in with interest 
 it 's a silent rush of hot air compressed into ten seconds of pure release 
 i 'm almost surprised you do n't hear my rusty <unk> slam shut when it finally ends 
 mission accomplished 
 the perfect <unk> fart 
 i know what you 're thinking 
 how did this go wrong 
 did n't gamble and lose 
 did n't let out a loud <unk> trumpet 
 did n't puke or pee knock his coffee into his lap or set off the passenger <unk> 
 nope 
 it all went according to plan 
 for a moment i was proud of myself 
 then the smell hits 
 i have fucking <unk> myself 
 it 's a devastating <unk> to what has come before 
 it hits all the usual notes and adds a hint of burning rubber for effect 
 it 's a spectacular crescendo of <unk> <unk> 
 i can recognise every awful thing i 've eaten all day in the mix 
 it 's a fart so carefully <unk> it could have come with <unk> notes and they would have been one word in length : <unk> 
 now let me tell you how this was a fuck up 
 the electric window slowly slides down next to me and the cold air hits my face 
 the cabbie turns to me with actual tears in his eyes and says : i am so <unk> sorry '' 
 uh ... what for '' 
 i ask innocently 
 that fart '' he replies eyes wide open as if it should be obvious 
 i mean jeez everybody farts we 're only human 
 but *that* ... i 'm just so sorry '' 
 he leaves the windows down all the way into the airport and gives me a discount on the fare 
 all the <unk> way home all i can think is i stink so bad i have made a cabbie apologise '' 
 edit : thank you for the gift of gold so not today but in early 2010 i was in the hospital for a few weeks with really bad pneumonia i did n't realize how bad it was until the day i was discharged when the doctor told me they basically thought i was going to die every day i was there 
 on my first day in the icu i received an emergency chest tube 
 due to the <unk> of the situation there was no time to prep no time to put me under no time to apply anesthetics 
 this was the most painful and scary moment of my entire life but that is a whole long story of it 's own 
 during my hospital stay i <unk> surgery where they cut into my lung to scrape all the fluid out called a <unk> : warning gross and was given 2 new chest tubes 
 miraculously i was discharged a week later with about 40-50 <unk> in my back and some <unk> strong pain meds to be refilled every two weeks 
 two weeks later just after getting a fresh bottle of pain meds i went in for a check up with the doctor 
 he wanted me to pee in a cup so they could see if the medicine was having any effect on my liver 
 i peed in the cup and all was well 
 are you ready for the fuck up 
 i woke up 
 the entire doctor 's visit was a very <unk> dream 
 what happened <unk> was i got up in the middle of the night opened my full bottle of pills and peed in it 
 by the morning it was just a sludge of pills that had <unk> into a <unk> <unk> 
 i was devastated 
 because i had been given such a strong dose of a highly controlled pill they could not give me another prescription so i was stuck in horrible pain while trying to catch up with my courses until i could order my scheduled refill 
 edit : forgot a edit 2 for those of you complaining there is no tl dr : **tl dr : peed should n't <unk> for this 
 so i am a dispatcher for my town 's police and fire departments and i worked an overtime shift last night from <unk> i usually work the swings so i was dead tired by <unk> i was doing police dispatch and unusually our department has the pd <unk> pick up 911 's as well as the calltakers most dont 
 for good reason 
 at <unk> i was working a <unk> in progress on the radio and without even thinking i picked up a 911. i love answering the phones 
 911 lines are my favorite 
 were anyway 
 long story short i <unk> the address while trying to respond to my officers on the radio 
 the call was for a 48 year old male conscious and breathing but with chest pain 
 <unk> and <unk> on this street are n't too far from each other but they are <unk> by a river so the fire <unk> had to go all the way south to the nearest bridge head eat on the bridge then back north to the street and address 
 the delay was 14 minutes 
 fourteen agonizing awful minutes 
 because after i called them back to get the correct address they called back a minute later saying he was not conscious anymore 
 and he died 
 not sure how i feel right now or if it even matters how i feel 
 that guys family just lost him because of my human error 
 my stupid fucking <unk> to the most basic thing about my profession 
 get your fucking addresses right 
 so yeah that 's how i fucked up 
 i am going to go get very very drunk <unk> decided to make a quick run to the bank today to deposit a check 
 i arrived and pulled into a parking space and put my car in park 
 i was looking down and reading a text on my phone when i suddenly noticed my car was rolling forward 
 i switched into full panic mode 
 the only thing separating me from the 40 mph traffic in front of me was a small patch of grass that i would be crossing at any moment now 
 i started pumping my brakes to no avail and decided my best bet now would be to warn the oncoming traffic 
 so i laid on my horn and began wrestling to get my seat belt off so i could bail out if needed 
 keep in mind because i am being <unk> it may seem like a while had passed by now but all of these thoughts and reactions happened within <unk> a 6 second span of time 
 suddenly my car stopped rolling 
 i looked up and around trying to figure out what had happened 
 i glanced at the bewildered drivers in the parked cars on either side of me that i had just rolled past 
 it was then that i realized that i had not left my parking spot 
 the other two cars on either side of me had begun backing out at the same time giving me the sensation that i was moving forward 
 in other words a parking lot full of people had just witnessed me pull into a parking spot and then suddenly have what must have seemed to be a complete meltdown tearing at my seat belt and lying on my horn as i struggled to <unk> the jaws of death 
 i decided it was best to leave and go the bank across town instead 
 this literally just happened in the last half hour and i 'm still kind of in <unk> confused 
 so i 've been chatting with this girl on tinder for the past couple days and things were going well 
 tonight she suggests that i come over to watch a movie and cuddle 
 i accept the invitation since all i was doing was watching the <unk> of true detective and this season has been confusing enough 
 i make it to her apartment complex when suddenly my phone dies that should have been the sign right there 
 i run to the gas station to buy a <unk> since i already drove out there and i 'm committed to this cuddle 
 i get into her apartment and everything seems normal we go strait to her room since her roommate a dude was in the shower right next to the living room 
 not even a few minutes into the movie we start making out and it starts getting a little toasty 
 while were kissing she keeps getting texts and going out to talk to her roommate a couple times which i thought was odd 
 she comes back in and takes off my shirt and then says i want you to fuck me right now '' 
 it catches me off guard since i did n't take her for the type 
 i knew something was up at this point so i tell her that she was going a little fast for me 
 i hear the shower stop in the other room and then she says do you mind if my roommate joins in '' 
 that is n't really what i had in mind and get up a little startled when suddenly roommate guy barges in balls naked and says i 'm going to pound you into the ground i 'm going to pound you into the fucking ground '' 
 as he <unk> into my eyes my dong went limp and i proceed to sprint out of the apartment as fast as i could with my shoes and shirt in one hand 
 as i 'm running out he yells i 'm going to track you down you better run i 'm coming after you '' 
 i did n't look back and ran as fast as i could to my car in shock and disbelief that something like that actually happened to me 
 needless to say i 'm going to take a break from tinder for a little while 
 edit : i 'm glad many of you are concerned about my wallet it was in the car the entire time so its safe 
 as soon as i go to lunch i 'm going to report her to tinder and get her account banned 
 more importantly i will be filing a report with the police i realize this could have gone way worse for me and i do n't want anyone else walking into that situation if its a set <unk> scam 
 update : so as i was enjoying my <unk> at lunch i received a text from her let me know what you think still seems kind of sketchy 
 i have no words to say how sorry i am about last night 
 that guy is an ex of mine and he kept threatening me until i came over and drank with him 
 he got me really drunk and got on my tinder and was actually texting you from his phone 
 he told me i could n't go home until you came over and i convinced you to have a three some 
 thank you for not taking advantage of me 
 i was scared shitless and i know he freaked you out too 
 i got your number from his phone after he passed out before i left so i could apologize 
 again so sorry that you were put in that situation 
 this did n't happen today but over a couple weeks when i was going to boarding school 8 years back 
 so i transferred in as a 10th grader from south korea into a <unk> boarding school in the us 
 because it was a boarding school i had a roommate with whom i had only exchanged a couple emails before coming to the school 
 the first day of school came and i got to my room 
 the room had a bunk-bed and having arrived first i took the bottom bunk and started unpacking 
 soon after i heard a knock on the door 
 it was my roommate and his dad 
 we exchanged greetings and were busy unpacking until it was time to go have lunch meet new people and do what high schoolers do on their first day of school 
 the first day of school went by before i knew it but i did n't really get to hang out with my roommate that much as we were supposed mingle with everybody in our grade 
 it was soon <unk> so i climbed into my bottom bunk and my roommate climbed up to his top bunk 
 we exchanged <unk> and prepared for bed 
 and then i started my daily 50 sit-ups 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with an obligatory <unk> from the <unk> i had been doing 50 sit-ups daily before going to bed for about a year then and the first day of school was no reason to break my habit 
 i was kind of afraid that i would wake my roommate but he did n't say anything and it sounded like he was asleep 
 so i thought nothing of it and went to bed 
 this goes on for a couple days and one day my roommate carefully asks me without looking down from his bed umm ... are you alright bro '' 
 to which i respond while heavily breathing yeah 
 <unk> '' i 'm fine 
 just doing my daily routine you know 
 - pant '' to this my roommate responds uh ... <unk> '' i shrug it off and go to bed 
 about a week later in the middle of my sit-ups i hear a creaking sound on top of my bed and from my bottom bunk i can see my roommate 's hands and the top of his head slowly starting to surface from the edge of his bed 
 he starts to peek down at my bed but with eyes so white that you 'd think that he heard somebody get brutally murdered 
 i casually continue my sit-ups as usual and ask what 's '' pant up '' 
 suddenly i see a wave of relief wash over his face 
 his expression rapidly changes from fear to realization to relief and then to laughter 
 oh my god you were doing sit-ups 
 oh thank god '' 
 what did you '' grunt think i was doing '' 
 i totally thought you were furiously jacking yourself off every single night before bed 
 i thought you would come up to my bed and rape me while i was asleep or <unk> had been thinking that i was <unk> with an asian sexual <unk> '' and then it hit me 
 his previous comments 
 the <unk> silence every night 
 my roommate acting strange around me 
 for more than two weeks my roommate had been thinking that my daily sit-ups had been daily <unk> sessions complete with my huffing and puffing grunting and ahhh 's 
 for more than two weeks my roommate had been laying awake on his top bunk hearing me <unk> and grunting down on the lower bed only imagining me getting myself off not daring to look down for a fear of <unk> something <unk> 
 we had a great laugh and we still talk about it every once in a while 
 **tl dr** - went to boarding school had a roommate with whom i shared a bunk-bed 
 i slept on the lower bed he on the top bed 
 every night i did sit-ups before going to bed 
 for 2 weeks my roommate thought that i had been furiously getting myself off 
 **edit** : what front-page 
 i will be enjoying my <unk> reddit fame 
 to answer some frequently asked questions : * yes i know sit-ups are n't very effective especially when done on a soft surface 
 i did n't know anything about fitness back then and had mistakenly thought <unk> 
 must do sit-ups since i am moving my stomach 
 i also progressively worked my way up to 50 from 10 a night 
 i also do n't do any sit-ups now in bed or on the floor 
 * the <unk> at our school had enough space for sit-ups on the lower bed but just barely 
 * for science - pic of abs taken aug 15 2015 : no i am not a time traveler 
 i live in tokyo and it 's already the 15th here 
 this is a long story with a lot of details 
 so strap in there 's a nice payoff at the end 
 like most tifu i was younger at the time about 19 years old and was working at an italian restaurant in the town that i live in 
 i live in a decently sized beach town that has no little to no crime and feels very much like a small town 
 the bosses at the restaurant i worked at were only a few years older than me and had hired me basically because i made them laugh during the interview 
 i realized this was important on my first day because basically every other employee at the restaurant were girls 
 hot ones 
 like it 's hard to concentrate on what you were doing hot 
 of course my bosses did this so that they could hook up with them after work 
 and it worked 
 i regularly witnessed this process 
 so it was never surprising when one would n't show up and they 'd hire another hot one sometime thereafter 
 i actually became numb to it 
 instead of trying to act cool when a hot girl showed up for her first day i was actually just cool about it 
 because i was never the one getting laid 
 the bosses <unk> every chance that walked in through the front door 
 so when one day a mid 30 's supermodel faced russian girl walked in the front door dressed like me i did n't even flinch 
 she was without a doubt the new hottest girl at the restaurant 
 but i was polite and said hi a couple times to her but ultimately ignored her the first few weeks she worked with me 
 mind you the restaurant was always super busy and i knew that all these girls ended up hooking up with my wealthy good looking bosses 
 i knew my chances were <unk> to none 
 why bother even trying 
 after a few weeks of basically ignoring this girl i realize that every day we work together she basically starts to follow me around 
 if i 'm at the bar she 's at the bar 
 if i 'm at a break out back she 's on her break too 
 we start talking and she 's funny and i like listening to her 
 so eventually i start giving her rides home from work and picking her up when she needs it 
 and thus begins the <unk> for the most insane hookup night of my life 
 see this girl did n't own her own car but lived in a nice house with a roommate in a nice neighborhood 
 the same neighborhood as my wealthy bosses 
 my bosses actually had to pass her house on their way home from work 
 the neighborhood was within walking distance of work which is why she started working there 
 so we start getting closer but like the idiot that i am i never even begin to think there is potential that i could hook up with her 
 i 'm sure i am completely in the friend zone 
 and i did n't care 
 she 's pretty and she 's hanging around with me and i 'm 19. she 's 30 something 
 i feel special enough 
 i also do n't think much of it either when i show up to work and start getting <unk> by one of my bosses about hanging out with her 
 he teased me in a fun way and i deny there being anything between us because there was n't 
 but after a few days of this i noticed the boss who primarily hooks up with the girls watching me a lot and not being so nice to me anymore 
 i 'm young but i immediately understand the problem i 'm creating 
 he hires hot girls and then fucks them 
 that 's the routine 
 i 'm fucking up his routine 
 hottest girl in the restaurant is hanging around me and not him 
 being that i like my job and make way more money than a 19 year old should i really start pushing away from hot russian girl 
 to the point of ignoring her 
 this was when i learned an early lesson about really hot girls 
 one you 've probably heard before 
 their entire adult life is <unk> with guys who chase them constantly <unk> them and never leave them alone 
 for a guy any guy to completely ignore them is foreign to them 
 paying them no attention will a lot of time actually make them go after you harder 
 which is exactly what happened 
 so now it 's becoming <unk> to me and everyone else we work with that this girl wo n't leave me alone 
 she begins to hang on me and tease me and do anything that will have me paying attention to her 
 on one side of the coin it was awesome 
 on the other side i could see my one bosses boiling rage that the younger funny guy he hired was beating him in the hot russian girl game 
 and i was n't just beating him i was sweeping the series 
 without so much as trying 
 so one weekend night i show up for work and as soon as i get inside the boss who has begun to hate me calls me into the office 
 by the way let 's call hot supermodel russian girl anna '' 
 boss : what 's going on with anna '' 
 me : i do n't know did she not show up '' 
 boss : no i mean with you and her 
 you guys fucking '' 
 so i 'm young and smart and know when i should n't let people walk over me or <unk> me 
 i want to keep my job but i wo n't be a bitch about things either 
 so smiling i say i 'm not sure if that 's any of your business '' 
 big mistake 
 the mistake that starts it all 
 because he slams the paper 's he working on down hard on the table 
 he turns around in his chair and says do you like your job 
 do you want to keep it '' 
 he knows the answer so i just stare at him 
 well then stop seeing anna 
 stop picking her up stop hanging with her every second that you are here 
 stop allowing her to hang on you 
 or i 'll fire you '' 
 immediately i understand the depth of how much he is into this girl and he 's willing to fire me over it to get his way 
 and so i agree 
 i make the decision right then and there that i 'll keep away from her 
 like i said i have little to no chance anyway and i 'm making great money 
 whatever 
 the night begins to wind down and i decide to go take a break out back 
 i 've been ignoring anna all night and my boss is now thoroughly pleased with me 
 his master scheme has worked and he can get back to trying to fuck the hottest waitress in the restaurant 
 so i 'm sitting out back not even thinking about the situation when anna busts out the back door and slams it shut behind her 
 she 's evidently pissed 
 she walks right up to me and does n't fuck around with what 's on her mind 
 anna : are you mad at me '' 
 me : no look anna i like you 
 you 're great 
 but us being friends is making shit uncomfortable with the bosses and i. they 're getting pissed at me '' 
 anna : because shitty boss wants to fuck me '' 
 me : yes because shitty boss wants to fuck you '' 
 anna : do you want to fuck me '' 
 this is the part in the movie where the record would scratch and then the main character laughs uncomfortably completely at a loss for words 
 me : um uh ... look you 're beautiful 
 no guy who sees you is n't attracted to you '' 
 anna : i asked if you wanted to fuck me '' 
 me : yeah 
 i would fuck you '' 
 anna : good then when we got off work tonight take me back to my place and fuck me '' 
 and with that she walks off and back into the restaurant 
 i sit there stunned in a haze 
 i 'm pretty sure she 's serious 
 i 'm terrified 
 my life up until this point has been awful drunken hookups with high school girls at parties 
 i literally ca n't think 
 but i 'm in 
 i 'm <unk> fucking in 
 fuck my boss 
 this is worth losing my job over 
 so we wrap up work and she jumps in my car and we speed off 
 it 's only when i pull up to her house do i remember shit ... my boss lives in this neighborhood 
 i 'm pretty sure he has to pass right down this road when he goes home 
 this must be how he has figured out she and i had been hanging out so much 
 i ca n't leave my car in the driveway 
 he 'll see it 
 so she comes up with an idea i ca n't disagree with 
 there 's a doctors office in a business complex right across the street 
 i can park there and just run back over 
 it 's perfect 
 so i get back to her house and walk in her front door and walk to her room and she 's standing in her underwear 
 it goes without saying that it 's a memory burned into my mind 
 she takes my hand sits me down on her bed and what follows is exactly what a 19 year old kid dreams of 
 so it 's about 30 minutes later and the room is <unk> lit and i 'm praying to every major <unk> and thanking them that i have n't finished too quickly because i want this moment to last forever 
 she 's on top of me and time is in slow motion 
 it 's the greatest moment of my life at that point 
 which is why it took me a few seconds to realize i 'm seeing flashlights on her ceiling 
 i 'm also seeing flashlights underneath her door to her room 
 she notices them first 
 then i 'm snapped back to reality 
 she starts to freak out 
 it 's obviously flashlights 
 pouring into her house 
 being that i was the guy and the guy is always supposed to protect the girl i run naked to one of the windows 
 i look outside to see and i 'm not exaggerating here 10 to 12 police cars with their lights on 
 in my peripheral i noticed something out of the corner of my eye 
 slowly approaching is 5 officers dressed completely in swat gear 
 my only rational thought is that i 'm watching all this and i 'm naked 
 i no longer have an erection 
 i grab my boxers throw them on and go to run back to the window 
 they 're at this house but this ca n't be for us 
 i 'm confused 
 from outside a man yells town i live in police 
 open the front door immediately 
 the house is surrounded 
 we have a k-9 unit 
 we will send him in if you do n't comply '' 
 i do n't even think 
 i 'm not a guy who gets in trouble a lot and have police officers in my family 
 the police tells you to do something you do it 
 end of discussion 
 so i run to the front door i swing it open and am staring at about 20 officers 
 swat included 
 now my erection is inside me 
 i put my hands up and go to speak when a hand comes out of nowhere and whips me to the ground 
 in my underwear 
 and it 's raining 
 i land in a puddle 
 hard 
 i hear hot russian girl scream 
 the police rush past and enter the house 
 what the fuck is happening 
 i now have a vagina 
 i 'm cuffed there 's dog 's barking 
 a knee crushes into my neck and i 'm throw into the back of a car while i 'm asking what is happening 
 a few minutes pass and i turn to see hot russian girl 's roommate and hot russian girl in my t-shirt and a towel talking to police 
 they 're both cuffed 
 i 'm sitting the back of the squad car for about a minute when i glance across the street and see 3 more police cars parked next to my jeep 
 where i had parked in the business complex 
 that perfect parking spot to hide from my boss 
 then it dawns on me 
 it was n't a perfect spot 
 because it was well passed midnight 
 we work at a restaurant that does n't get out till late 
 so i parked my car in an empty business parking lot late at night got out and ran around the side of the building 
 mind you i 'm dressed in black from my job 
 late at night dressed in black running around the side of a closed building 
 that probably looked pretty suspicious to the elderly security guard who <unk> the complex at night 
 so he made a call to the <unk> 
 so i know you 're thinking at this point well there 's no way this many officers let alone swat would show up for this 
 but they did 
 and here 's why 
 the security guard went to the building to play police officer while waiting for the cops to arrive 
 he got out his flashlight and went searching apparently from building to building looking into windows 
 he at one point climbed up on a bench and looked inside a window and slipped and his flashlight crashed into and through a window 
 so now the alarms have gone off 
 when the police finally show up he completely neglects to mention he 's the one who set off the alarm 
 being that he 's old i 've kind of forgiven him since then 
 so when the cops go searching the <unk> they not only find a broken window but know someone has attempted to get inside 
 obviously 
 but they ca n't find me 
 because i 'm across the street having the greatest night of my life 
 so they call the k-9 unit for a search 
 which just so happens to be doing a late night training operation with the local swat team 
 what better way to train then to do a real world exercise with someone breaking and entering 
 but it gets better 
 her roommate drove a really nice car 
 an older mercedes 
 a mercedes that had just recently been in a minor car accident the week before 
 damage right to the driver side of her car 
 not major but a nice little <unk> 
 so when the k-9 <unk> and tracks me passed the building right up to the house i 'm in yeah the dogs noses are that good they now see a car that looks like it has been kicked in and house with basically no lights on in it 
 they treat the situation as if i could be running and trying to get away from them 
 which gets us back to where i 'm at 
 soaked in my underwear in the back of a squad car 
 now i know this has been a long story and if you 've stuck with it the payoff is coming right now 
 and it 's an amazing payoff 
 when i 'm pulled out of the car i explain the same story to them that hot russian girl has told them : my boss told me to stay away and so i parked my car across the street to get laid 
 basically word for word 
 the look they all give each other was priceless 
 i 'll cherish that look forever 
 but they now realize they have fucked up majorly but do n't want to admit it just yet 
 there 's about 10 cops standing around me outside of the car 
 swat guy : how 'd the window get broken '' 
 me : i do n't know i did n't touch anything 
 i just ran around the side to her house '' 
 officer : the security guard just told us he accidentally broke it he did n't tell us that earlier '' 
 swat guy : so you 're over here kinda hooking up '' 
 me : yes sir 
 we work together 
 we just got off work 
 that 's why i just parked there '' 
 swat guy # 2 : she 's like in her 30 's 
 you look about 16 '' 
 me : i 'm 19. but yeah she 's older than me '' 
 swat guy : wow '' 
 a couple chuckles 
 then silence 
 swat guy : seriously ... good for you man 
 i 'm amazed 
 you 're on another level then i was at your age '' 
 they then begin to apologize and begin to say things like you understand we were just doing our jobs we did n't know what was actually happening 
 you could have been dangerous '' etc 
 etc 
 so i tell them not to worry and that i have police family members and completely understand 
 i wo n't be suing them or filing reports or anything 
 i just want the cuffs off 
 so they continue to be extra nice as they turn me around to take my cuffs off 
 so the payoff i 've been talking about ... the amazing kicker to the whole story 
 when they turn me around i 'm now facing back out across the street in my underwear with the cuffs still on and i see both my bosses pulled over on the side of the road sitting on the side of their car watching the whole thing 
 how long they have been there i do n't know 
 there were so many cop cars in the street they had to stop and wait 
 i was fired coincidentally within a few weeks 
 i dropped a kid on the floor 
 so i 've been missing my leg for four years now 
 i 've <unk> quite well 
 i get around just fine with a prosthetic 
 however when i 'm at home in my small apartment i prefer to crawl short distances instead of going through the hassle of putting my prosthetic on 
 it 's <unk> more convenient that way 
 so last night we had some company over to watch scary movies and i read everyone a few short submissions to <unk> 
 everyone was pretty spooked before we went to bed 
 two friends of mine slept on the couch and one of them was someone we have never had over before 
 so this individual had never seen me crawl without my leg on 
 to describe it i kind of move like a very slow <unk> who 's missing a <unk> leg 
 like a tri-pod crawl if that makes sense 
 so i suppose it can be <unk> if you 're not expecting it 
 in the middle of the <unk> morning i decide to leave my room for a drink 
 i did n't turn the hall light on so i would n't disturb my sleeping guests 
 there 's just enough light coming from the light above the sink to guide me where i needed to go 
 as i 'm turning the corner to enter the kitchen i see a figure and i hear oh shit what the fuck '' next thing i know i 'm getting kicked in the face 
 i suppose my friend recognized my foul mouth screaming back at him because then he turned the light on and started apologizing profusely 
 tl dr : i crawled through my apartment without my prosthetic leg my friend thought i was a demon and started kicking me in the face 
 edit : a lot of people are asking why i do n't just hop 
 well in the accident that took my leg i also maintained compound <unk> in all the long bones in my remaining leg causing the my <unk> <unk> and <unk> too all be replaced by titanium <unk> 
 hopping on such a leg causes too much stress and pain to my remaining knee cap 
 even without those injuries though it 's usually not recommended for any <unk> to hop as a frequent mode of transport even for short distances 
 last week i went for a walk in the forest 
 the next day when i was in bed my legs started itching 
 i turned on the light and discovered two tiny little fucking disgusting ticks just chilling there trying to <unk> me of blood that i would prefer to keep myself 
 i felt a bit panicky because of <unk> disease 
 to prevent getting this disease it is important to removes the ticks asap <unk> within <unk> hours 
 my walk was <unk> hours ago 
 i removed the ticks and proceeded to check the rest of my body for ticks 
 i got a bit paranoid and started to feel an itch in my butt crack 
 i discovered it is very hard to examine your own butt crack 
 <unk> : put mirror on laundry basket squat over it shine with <unk> in the area of <unk> i then saw a black blob about 2 <unk> in <unk> next to my b-hole 
 shit a tick that sucked itself full of blood in an area that i couldn’t quite reach 
 i proceeded to panic because i wanted this fucker out of my body 
 even though i felt embarrassed to the max i decided it was essential to wake up my mum so she could help me 
 an awkward <unk> session later and my grumpy mum is bending over my ass to remove from there : a piece of <unk> poo 
 tl dr my mom discovered i don’t wipe properly 
 edit : peeps are saying it 's nonsense that i ca n't reach my ass 
 true i can reach but not with the precision needed to take out a tick 
 it has to be done in a certain way so the head is not left behind ... edit2 : thanks for all the butt wiping tips 
 also it seems removing the head matters less then i thought 
 <unk> i had a phone interview with chevron for a chemist position 
 the interview began with usual pleasantries and they asked how i was 
 i 'm from boston and as any of you <unk> know the weather here is currently <unk> 
 so i responded it 's 70 and sunny in boston in november so i certainly ca n't complain '' 
 they chuckled at my line so i went full steam ahead with the <unk> followup : haha you guys at chevron keep up the good work with this global warming '' 
 silence on the other end for 5 solid seconds 
 needless to say i probably wo n't be getting a call <unk> was leaving my office when i decided to order chipotle for the first time using the app 
 i typed in my credit card information and ordered a burrito bowl 
 i then got a confirmation email in the name of my girlfriend but i did n't think anything of it since i knew she uses the app all the time and has used it on my phone before 
 when i get there i ask for the order i placed 
 the lady looked at me suspiciously and asked me for an id 
 i told her that it 's probably under my girlfriend 's name and that i can show her the confirmation email 
 as i told her this i get weird stare from a guy in the back on the phone and a few other employees working the line 
 the guy came up to me and told me i had to wait there 
 turns out i placed an order using my girlfriend 's saved credit card which she had lost a few days before 
 chipotle called her to tell her that there was no <unk> available that night which lead her to think that i the thief was using her <unk> card 
 she told them that i had stolen her card and to call the cops and detain me 
 that 's exactly what they were doing until i called her to get things straightened out 
 yup almost got arrested for ordering a burrito bowl 
 edit just to make things a little bit clearer since i did not expect for this to blow up : 1. my gf did n't cancel her card because she was almost certain it was somewhere in the house 
 she ended up finding it today in the washing machine 
 2. chipotle did n't detain me 
 they 're not allowed to but they were trying to figure out a way to make me wait 
 as a matter of fact they did not know what to do with me before learning that i was n't a thief 
 my gf was surprised by the call and her first reaction was that someone actually stole her card and to hold me accountable for it 
 3. i 'm alive 
 no e.coli and no food poisoning 
 it has n't been 24 hours yet so i may start to feel some delayed symptoms 
 i 'll check back in in a few hours 
 by the way burrito bowls taste terrible without <unk> i fucked up 
 there 's a girl in my ecology class 
 let 's call her madge '' 
 madge is your <unk> try-hard holier-than-thou know-it-all with an <unk> facial expression i can only describe as cat trying to shit a peach pit '' 
 one of those <unk> and <unk> 
 i even tried to get along with madge at the start i 'd sit by her and try to engage her read : humor her with conversations in relevant topics about ecology such as the <unk> <unk> of apes or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> but just trying to be civil was a futile endeavour 
 expecting madge to be civil with you because you were civil with her is like expecting the lion not to eat you because you did n't eat it 
 madge was born to be an asshole 
 everything you said to her was met with a pffft '' or a dramatic roll of the eyes and a quick retort such as well if you 'd actually <unk> <unk> et al 
 2007 you would have known that ... '' she had to be better and smarter than everyone at everything all the time 
 and boy that shit got real old real quick 
 so i stopped sitting by her 
 and began to <unk> her 
 with a pre-occupied <unk> 
 i thought about her twice today before even writing this that 's how much i do n't like her 
 fast forward to the first capture the flag game of the year 
 being a freshman i thought i 'd attend as a way to get out of my residence room and meet some people 
 the first game was at about <unk> the campus was already dark and i showed up just wearing shorts and a t-shirt 
 out of <unk> people who knew capture the flag was so popular 
 i ended up being possibly the most under-dressed person there 
 <unk> <unk> suits <unk> and black morph costumes were just some of the <unk> 
 this was like capture the flag olympics 
 teams were <unk> into short sleeve <unk> long sleeve and the flags '' were two bicycle lights 
 i began to mingle with fellow short-sleeves ... and that 's when i saw her 
 madge 
 black boots black pants black <unk> black <unk> black cap black gloves 
 she was going all call of duty for this game -- of course 
 why would n't she be a try-hard at capture the flag too 
 and i just knew i 'd have to tag her the fuck out 
 this was my chance to prove i was better at something 
 the first few rounds us short-sleeves did terribly because no one stayed behind to defend so we lost 3 rounds promptly 
 each time they blew the whistle i could hear madge laughing 
 i could hear it 
 so i switched to defense 
 to prevent camping '' there was a 50 meter <unk> around each flag '' 
 conveniently for me there was a group of hedges 50 meters away from my flag 
 so i hid in the hedges 
 each time anyone from the other team tried to sneak up to our flag i 'd jump out of the hedges startle the hell out of them and that would give me the time i needed to run up and tag them out 
 i 'd probably tagged out 8-10 people in about 15 minutes when the stars aligned and i saw her 
 madge 
 walking through the shadows along the side of a building headed straight for our flag thinking she was so sneaky with all her matching black gear 
 this was it 
 it was <unk> time to <unk> 
 but i was too <unk> 
 i bounded from the hedges like sea biscuit while she was still a good 40-50 feet away 
 so i yelled <unk> '' 
 to try to emphasize the <unk> effect 
 she shrieked in surprise but without missing a beat she spun around 180 degrees and headed back for her side '' at a dead sprint 
 i then realized that if she got to her side before i caught her she 'd be out of play '' and i could n't tag her out -- that was an impossible embarrassment i could n't allow it 
 i took off too at a dead sprint 
 like <unk> i 'm not so much for long runs but dangerous across short distances 
 i was gaining on her and now confidently puffed up with a laugh i shouted you can run if you want i 'll just catch you when you 're tired '' 
 the chase lasted probably <unk> feet before she tripped on a tree root and fell pretty hard but made no attempt to get back up 
 as i got closer i realized she had stooped to a whole new low - playing the crying game surely exaggerating an injury that would thus make my tagging '' of her <unk> 
 but then as i got closer still i realized she was *really* crying like <unk> crying 
 i was still mad so as i got up to her i said crying wo n't fucking help '' at which point she rolled on to her back and looked up at me and shouted get the fuck away 
 i leaned down to make eye contact and said it 's just a fucking game '' to which she cocked an eyebrow and said what the fuck are you talking about '' 
 and then it hit me 
 i did not recognize this girl 
 *this was not madge 
 * this was some girl walking to the bus station after a night class 
 horrified mouth hanging open the <unk> of my mind spun as i suddenly imagined what it must have been like from her perspective : a large strange bearded sweaty under-dressed man jumped out of the bushes screaming <unk> 
 and when she ran he ran too screaming you can run if you want i 'll just catch you when you 're tired '' and when he saw her crying said crying wo n't fucking help '' 
 i wanted to apologize i wanted to introduce myself i wanted to explain but all i could get out was hey ... sorry -- it was it 's just ... hi i 'm ... hey you know capture the flag ... 
 please do n't call the police this was all a misunderstanding '' and then i ran away hoping she had n't seen enough of my face to create a <unk> <unk> for campus security 
 i never ended up tagging her or madge for that matter and i never went back to capture the flag after that i hear it may be getting cancelled but i probably caused some seriously <unk> <unk> about night classes that will haunt that poor girl forever 
 dear night class girl if you 're a redditor i am so sorry 
 i 'm actually a pretty nice guy really 
 tl dr - today i fucked up by wanting to get back at a <unk> know-it-all from ecology class by chasing her down at a night game of capture the flag only to realize i 'd chased down and probably subsequently scarred some girl from night class who was n't even playing 
 **edit : ** wow thanks for the reddit gold guys - i 'd say you surprised me and popped my gold cherry '' but that expression would seem to be in poor taste after my story 
 **edit : ** i never realized how much i made it sound like she broke her neck at first 
 holy shit 
 also i laughed my ass off at how many people say there 's sexual tension between me and madge 
 fucking madge 
 ... but maybe there is tension 
 maybe i am in love with her ... holy shit my whole life has been a lie 
 jk lol i really still hate her 
 <unk> thing ever just happened to me so buckle up <unk> 's story time : girl on a dating app tells me in the first few messages that i 'm really cute true and interesting also true and asks me to meet her at <unk> for coffee at a random mcdonald 's 
 when i ask if she 's a 45 year old man trying to <unk> my organs she proceeds to send me 15 pictures in a row that look like they 're straight from facebook 
 because that 's how you convince somebody you 're real not true 
 now normally i do n't accept <unk> like this because i 'm thinking what 's the catch '' 
 well i decide to live a little on the yolo side ... and since it 's right next to a subway sandwich shop i think that the worst that could happen is it 's a 45 year old lonely man i give him a big hug because i know the feeling as a 25 year old lonely man get a tasty sandwich then go home 
 apparently that was not the worst thing that could happen 
 i show up 
 she shows up 
 she 's real 
 i 'm surprised 
 i buy her coffee because i subscribe to traditional gender roles unless requested otherwise 
 she uses her mccafe frequent <unk> card so she gets stamps 
 its cute 
 while the guy is making her drink she tells me to go find a table outside in the sun 
 i go outside and find the perfect goddamn table because i 'm a romantic at heart 
 5 minutes later 
 10 minutes later 
 15 minutes later 
 no girl 
 i text her the typical guy message lol u get lost 
 no response 
 turns out she took the coffee and left 
 so i 'm not saying it 's bad to leave a date if you feel uncomfortable or are n't attracted to them 
 it 's totally your decision 
 but i do n't think that 's the case ... i think this girl is a serial mccafe <unk> 
 and i do n't think this was her first time 
 it was too professional 
 too clean 
 it was the perfect <unk> 
 and i 'm starting to think i 'm not even mad ... she did n't steal my credit card or my organs 
 just a few <unk> 
 and my heart 
 for those who ca n't read good <unk> if you 're a polite person it 's muscle memory to hold the door open for whoever 's behind you 
 i was leaving my university library through a revolving door and i was reading something on my phone 
 this gorgeous girl was behind me with a coffee in one hand and books in the other 
 as i exit out into the open without even realizing it i hold my hand back to stop the motion of the door 
 she walked right into the glass spilling her coffee all over herself 
 i panicked and ran 
 i can never go <unk> happened about 3 hours ago ... be me 29 years old male living in probably the most corrupted country in the world venezuela 
 so just to give you some background venezuela is in a very difficult situation political and <unk> the majority of us want to get rid of this corrupted government and we have <unk> in a fee days so tension is palpable in the streets police and military are corrupted as fuck you can buy weapons such as grenades or sub machine guns to them etc etc basically hate is in the air 
 so i was in a traffic jam one of the many we have daily when the hunger hit me i had a big bag of doritos in my car so i decided to eat i have a <unk> bypass and ca n't eat that much i was eating with my window open when a motorcycle with 2 military officers low rank stand beside me waiting for their turn to pass i see the guy in the back literally drooling looking at the doritos so why not 
 i wo n't eat this much '' i offer him the bag and he did n't <unk> to take it with a very big smile and thanking me ... 20 seconds later the shit storm 
 the driver next to me gets out of his car screaming you <unk> <unk> 
 let the guy alone he have done nothing to you '' he thought i was being black mailed and i got asked for money inside the bag wich is one of many ways for them to get paid black mailing you i get out of the car to explain that it was n't money but hell no the military officer that was driving told me in not a such a pleasant way to stay inside the car that he could handle it ... he gets down the bike and goes to the guy that was screaming baton in hand when all of a sudden no less than 20 people are surrounding him screaming thief 
 oppressor 
 go to hell '' and start punching him 
 military # 2 gets <unk> to help his friend and getting punched and screamed he managed to get military # 1 in the bike and proceed to drive as fast as he could ... everyone get to their cars and guy # 1 gets to me doritos in hand here 's your money '' ... .. now i have back my doritos in my car and sadness in my heart for how deep this society has fallen ... but i have half a bag of doritos to eat in the traffic jam tomorrow and i have that going for me wich is nice 
 tl dr : 2 military officers got their ass kicked for a bag of doritos i gift them 
 edit : sry for my bad english 
 edit 2 : wow we are the # 2 in the front page im very glad you guys enjoyed my tifu and at the same time i feel kind of sad because it is true 
 but still # 2 with half a bag of <unk> ... corn chips with cheese flavor 
 edit 3 : the <unk> doritos guy '' edit 4 : thx to /r/rokutenverzwei for the heads up about a guy using my photo claiming im one of the terrorists on the mali terrorist attack original message hey there 's a guy over <unk> using your photo saying it 's was a pic released by the police in the <unk> mali terrorist attack 
 here 's the link go there asap '' 
 if you guys could go there and report that guy i would gladly appreciate it.my roommate goes shopping on sunday <unk> 
 he bought a carton of eggs 
 last night after shopping he went out and i knew he 'd probably not be back that night 
 so i decided to scramble every egg from the carton 
 i ate some of them it was always my intention to replace the egg carton just to get that out of the way and the rest i stuffed the scrambled egg back into the carton 
 so it was just a carton of scrambled egg 
 then on the back of the carton i wrote pre scrambled '' in marker 
 this morning i hear my roommate exclaim what the fuck '' 
 i ran into the kitchen and saw him staring dumbfounded at the carton 
 he kept looking from me to the carton and back 
 did you buy the pre-scrambled kind '' 
 i asked 
 he looked at me like i had just spoken <unk> so i repeated my question 
 the fuck do you mean '' 
 he replied 
 i took the carton from him acted like i was carefully examining the <unk> and then pointed out the writing on the back 
 pre-scrambled 
 yeah you bought pre-scrambled eggs '' i said 
 he looked as perplexed as it is possible for a person to be 
 <unk> <unk> 
 i put on an act of being amazed that he had never heard of pre-scrambled eggs and about how i always check the back of the carton to make sure they are n't pre-scrambled 
 he stammered something along the lines of but what ... but why ... how ... why would they ... what the ... why ... '' i was about to reveal it was a prank when he suddenly got very serious and intense like a <unk> <unk> white sort of vibe and he said fuck no 
 not my eggs '' 
 then he wheeled around and marched out of the apartment 
 out to his car 
 and he left 
 i was a bit concerned 
 and probably should have shouted after him before he left 
 but i did n't 
 so like 40 minutes pass and i hear our apartment door open and i hear i 'm banned 
 i 'm banned from the stop & amp shop 
 banned '' 
 i walk out to the kitchen with some <unk> 
 he looks <unk> 
 banned '' 
 he dropped the egg carton on the floor 
 did you fuck me '' 
 he was n't taking it well 
 they do n't fuckin sell this shit 
 did you fuck me '' 
 at this point i admitted to pranking him 
 and i apologized 
 he just stared at me for a moment then shouted something like you 're buying me fucking new eggs '' 
 then he slammed his bedroom door 
 then he opened it and yelled i have to drive to motherfucking pathmark are you kidding me 
 you go too far 
 fuck '' 
 and slammed the door again 
 then he opened it again and shouted stop laughing '' 
 and slammed the door again 
 i do feel bad about this because it was never the intention of the prank to get him banned from the supermarket 
 i have already replaced his eggs and i am in the process of thinking up some way to make it up to him regarding his <unk> 
 tl dr - accidentally got my roommate banned from the supermarket when i convinced him they sold him pre-scrambled '' eggs 
 actually i was the interviewer 
 although the main interview and hiring is done by someone else they are sent to me for <unk> minutes at the end since i 'm the person they will directly be <unk> with 
 i always get a print out of their resume beforehand which i glance at during the <unk> well today i had an interview and it went fine 
 at the end we got up and i told the woman that it was nice to meet her and we 'd let her know 
 but since the resume has absolutely no future use to me i was <unk> ripping it up and throwing it in the trash in front of her as i said this 
 the look of horror on her face was tangible 
 it was only about 15 seconds after she walked out the door that i realized what i had done and how soul-crushing it must have felt 
 so to poor interview woman i say now : sorry 
 you were actually a decent candidate '' 
 edit : update : so today i was sitting on my couch enjoying some jalapeño <unk> chips when my wife walked in the living <unk> 10 years ago in my horny teen boy years <unk> i used to go online to chatrooms or webcam sites to get off 
 i was also <unk> and talked to other boys and probably men 
 i decided to record some videos of myself and send them to people online 
 my parents just got a new video camera and gave me their old one 
 it was one of those <unk> cassette tape kinds 
 so i took all these very raunchy videos of myself jerking myself off spreading my ass cumming onto myself putting things up my butt etc 
 it was after that i realized i had no idea how to upload the film onto my computer 
 so i just forgot about it 
 years passed i went to college moved away became a normal adult etc 
 this weekend i 've been at my parents house for a family gathering including <unk> 
 yesterday after dinner i was out in the yard playing soccer with my younger cousins while most of the adults were inside watching old family videos ... ... after a couple hours i go inside into the living room and see my uncle has <unk> up that old cassette camcorder to the tv 
 immediately my memory is flooded with my nasty antics my heart hits 200 <unk> 
 my mom must have dug it up when i moved out and saved it 
 i quickly look at the screen 
 it 's my sisters high school basketball game 
 i try to remember if i destroyed the tape 
 i must have 
 how could i not 
 the basketball game cuts to a family vacation to a lava flow field 
 my dad making goofy faces and me being a moody twat 
 i cringe at my <unk> behavior 
 uncle presses fast-forward <unk> of <unk> rock formations fly past then abruptly transitions into a fleshy mass of humiliation 
 it 's hard to make out what 's going on but i know instantly 
 my uncle presses play i die inside 
 there i am laid on my back legs raised up against a table pointing my underage dick at my face beating off and moaning 
 oh goodness '' said grandma 
 what the fuck '' said everyone else 
 i put my hands up to my face and wished that an <unk> would hit right where i 'm standing 
 i just <unk> participated in one of the worst public break-ups i 've ever seen in my life 
 * about 3 hours ago now - this is a copy of my direct post to facebook upon occurrence * 
 there 's a couple standing in front of me on the tram <unk> trams = endless <unk> entertainment when the bloke receives a text message and his lady just happens to see who it 's from no matter that he tried to frantically hide it from her view - we are <unk> are eagle 
 she immediately starts screaming at him and slapping his business suit and going on about ** '' how fucking dare you '' ** and all that 
 the tram stops 
 she rips off her engagement ring storms off the tram and throws the ring back at him ... <unk> i <unk> catch **on the <unk> 
 with one final **fuck you to hell 
 ** - the doors closed and it was just me and him standing there in silence for like a solid minute 
 me : uhh ... do you want this 
 <unk> ... '' 
 handing back that goddamned ring in front of all those people watching was one of the most awkward things i have ever had to do in my life 
 real 
 edit : went to sleep with 1 upvote - woke up with a whole <unk> 
 cheers for the read guys

 i 'm a dude from canada who likes to tell stories : edit 2. you all are so amazing thanks for the <unk> last night my girlfriend was going to be home alone 
 she asked if i wanted to sleep over so i said fuck yeah 
 i 'm not allowed to sleep over her house ever 
 so i was super excited 
 i slept over and fell asleep 
 her parents are n't supposed to come home till around noon so we figured it 's perfect since my girlfriend has to be at work by 9am 
 well my friends her dad came home 
 now i am currently stuck in her room trying to be as quite as possible 
 my girlfriend left to work already and i have work in less than 3 hours 
 i ca n't sneak out because her bedroom is upstairs and he is downstairs working on shit on the computer 
 i will update you guys as soon as i 'm out of here 
 hopefully it 's soon edit : i 've been stuck for over an hour now 
 no signs of him leaving 
 my back is starting to cramp up from not moving 
 less than 2 hours until i have to be at work edit 2 : since so many of you keep telling me to jump out the window 
 i was considering it but <unk> there is no way i could go through the whole thing without making a lot of noise 
 the layout of the house is pretty much the same as the one across 
 i would the window on the second floor is what we are looking at 
 i 'm starting to consider calling work saying i might be late but i 'm going to wait a little more 
 less than 1.5 hrs till work final update : front page 
 thanks everyone 
 <unk> a lot of you guys really wanted me to get caught 
 thanks for all the suggestions and advice 
 i ended up waiting it out 
 the dad ended up taking a shower and i thought that would have been my chance but i started to think about how i sometimes leave the water running to warm up before jumping in 
 i didnt want to die today so i waited again 
 finally he left just on time for me to run home and leave for work 
 but seriously 
 you guys wanted me to kill him tie myself up and pretend to be kidnapped someone suggested making out with the mother 
 idk how that would help 
 i didnt do no ninja jump off the second story 
 if he had n't left by a certain time i would have been ready to take <unk> advice and done the whole pizza deal 
 lucky for me i did n't have to take things to that level 
 thanks everyone this happened last night not today but still less than 24 hours ago 
 so my husband loves birds all kinds of birds 
 he thinks they are great 
 he is especially fond of ducks 
 last night while he was in the kitchen prepping a snack i thought it would be fun to change the desktop photo on his laptop he had left it open on the couch 
 i found a cute duck picture made it his desktop background set the laptop back on the couch and made my way innocently back to the kitchen table where i had also been having a snack 
 my husband finishes his snack a little while later and heads back to the couch while i remain at the table 
 he pulls his computer towards him and goes omg honey look 
 ducks '' 
 as he stands up holding his laptop and tries to come to me he trips and falls over the glass end table we have shattering it 
 if that was n't bad enough he fell onto his <unk> smashing it completely open and crushing it 
 if that also was n't bad enough he also broke his wrist because of how he fell on it since he was holding the laptop 
 i feel like a terrible person but my husband still loves ducks 
 tl dr : my husband got so <unk> over a picture of ducks i procured that he broke himself a table and his <unk> happened a couple weeks ago 
 i’m using a throwaway because i don’t want this shit tied to my main account 
 i’ll try to make this as short as possible 
 <unk> <unk> : <unk> in my early twenties and not that experienced when it comes to sexy times 
 all the porn in the world couldn’t have prepared me for this 
 * i was going out with a girl for about 6 months 
 it was nice 
 she was freaky 
 i liked it 
 she kept hinting towards butt stuff which i’ve never done 
 i was skeptical but after talking to my friends about it they encouraged me to give it a shot and to be open minded '' 
 we’re driving one day listening to music and some song comes on and one of the lyrics were <unk> got ta eat the booty like <unk> i’ll never forget this fucking song 
 the gf knows the song and she’s singing the lyrics and she’s looking directly at me while singing that line 
 <unk> message 
 fast forward a couple days and she’s over at my place taking a shower getting ready for work 
 i join 
 sexy time 
 <unk> open <unk> rang through my mind 
 so i decided to try something new 
 i tried to eat the booty 
 i even went as far as to stick my tongue in her butt 
 i heard a “oh” and then the worst shit <unk> happened 
 she farted 
 i jerk back 
 mind you we’re still in the shower so i’m thinking the water mixed with the fart and i have nasty fart water in my mouth 
 no 
 i spit the water out and it’s not just water 
 she pooped in my mouth 
 it wasn’t a lot but that’s no excuse 
 she started apologizing but her <unk> turned into straight laughter 
 she wouldn’t stop laughing 
 i was so angry i didn’t know what to do 
 tl dr : i tried to eat the booty like groceries 
 it didn’t work 
 today my wife decided that it would be a nice idea to take a shower together 
 we do it all of the time and it is a nice way to kick start our night together after work 
 it was a typical shower which consists of her using all of the water with me being left in the cold waiting for my turn in the warm water 
 after a while she decided to <unk> the water and let me have my turn 
 i grabbed my body wash off the shelf and proceeded to drop it 
 this is where i fucked up 
 i quickly bent down to grab it 
 i bent at the knees remembering that it 's bad for you to bend down to grab something only using your waist 
 i was soon met with a painful sensation that i had never experienced before 
 the small <unk> pull valve that changes the water from the faucet to the shower head penetrated my virgin ass 
 the pain was unreal 
 the water changed from the shower head to the faucet 
 i shot up trying to get away from the metal knob that just violated me 
 upon standing up the shower resumed 
 i stood there in shock looking up at my wife 
 she witnessed the entire thing 
 she wo n't stop laughing at me about it 
 it hurts to sit 
 tl dr : showered with my wife trying to put something in her 
 ended up with something in me 
 edit : <unk> 
 it figures that my most successful post to date is about something metal entering my ass 
 the steve <unk> video : i have not seen it i swear that this is true 
 i 'm going to watch it with my wife tonight because if it is <unk> like some of you say she will get a good laugh from it.my girlfriend has been on holidays for the last couple of weeks 
 it kinda sucked because it was our five month anniversary which she took quite seriously 
 so we were texting and things started getting <unk> or at least i think they were and then she sends a message saying hey babe skype me i have a surprise for you '' 
 we have done skype sexy time before and that 's where i thought this was leading 
 so i flopped it out and skyped her my erect penis taking up the entire screen 
 then when she answered it was her entire family : mum dad and two little sisters 7 & amp 9 there yelling in unison happy anniversary '' i freaked out and slammed the laptop shut 
 i since have received two messages from my girlfriend soon to be ex i imagine saying what the fuck was that '' 
 and answer me '' 
 it is the a definite dumbest thing i 've ever done 
 i kinda wan na die right now 
 edit : i know it 's kinda weird that we celebrate each month but yeah i guess we 're pretty young 
 five months is pretty long for high school couples so yeah 
 i still have n't heard anything from her except another text just saying '' 
 i do n't have the balls to reply 
 update : so i decided to man up and text her back it was the most awkward conversation ever 
 but it ended with her saying maybe we should take a break when i get back '' i should change the title to tifu by showing my erect penis to my <unk> entire family 
 i downloaded it for him and put it on a usb so he could watch it when he had some <unk> 
 so he watched it tonight and when i got back in i asked him what he thought 
 really good but quite confusing at times though took quite a bit of effort to understand the direction but it was n't impossible '' i knew something was n't quite right 
 my dad is an intelligent man - he should be understanding this film with no problems whatsoever 
 i projected my disbelief to him - the plot is good it 's a good film 
 i do n't know how that was n't apparent to you '' 
 he replied : it was just quite <unk> at times with the dialogue the script was definitely lacking which was a shame because it could have been really good '' 
 i was still heavily confused - most people who have seen this film would agree it 's <unk> and exciting 
 i could not see what the problem was 
 i took the usb stick back and plugged it into my laptop and i decided to watch it again for the hell of it 
 then i realised 
 the download did n't have <unk> <unk> 
 **the man literally sat there watching apes grunt at eachother for the best part of 2 hours without a fucking clue what they were saying 
 ** sorry dad so this did n't happen today but happened earlier this year 
 i was due to attend a university for a guided tour and interview and we were allowed to bring a guest with us 
 i decided to bring my dad because he 's a fun guy to make the trip with and thought he might be interested in looking around 
 so i 'm filling out all the details on the online booking form and it asks who will be attending with you 
 now here 's the fuckup rather than typing in my dad 's name i enter my father '' 
 clearly i was thinking a tad too literally 
 so i forget about this for a few weeks and we finally end up going 
 when we get there they are calling out names and handing out <unk> badges in pairs one for prospective students and one for their guests 
 i receive my pair of badges one with my name on and the other simply with the words my father '' on 
 i show my dad hoping he 'll laugh it off and i can go explain and get a different name badge but instead he insists on wearing the badge all day kindly explaining to everyone how stupid i was.so this happend about a year ago but i felt like it would fit well here 
 my very good friend that i <unk> elementary school and high school that we 'll name levi '' was home for the weekend and i had n't seen him in about 8 months since he had been deployed to iraq for his second time since <unk> the us army in <unk> levi and i have always been close and for second we even considered being a couple i am a female but it just never worked out 
 but i wrote him letters all through his basic training and when he got deployed all through his first 6 months of that as well 
 he is an field <unk> man and from our letters back and forth i could tell that he was seeing some things over there but he never went too much into detail besides saying how bored he was and how nice the <unk> were near his camp 
 so anyways he gets back home and of course we all other friends of ours decide to go out and celebrate 
 levi and i have always been pretty heavy drinkers around each other 
 we always encourage each other to get way way way too intoxicated but for the most part it 's all been fun and games 
 so same thing tonight 
 we 're challanging each other to chug beer after beer and to attempt the line of shots call the three <unk> '' ... ... needless to say i puked all over the bar floor and we were asked kindly to leave the <unk> 
 so our group of friends are trying to walk to the bus stop and catch a ride home 
 i am walking with our good friend kendra borrowing a cigarette as levi is stumbling a few feet ahead of us 
 basically all i remember next is thinking to my drunken self how happy i am to see levi again and how much i missed him 
 i remember getting this bright idea to jump on levi 's back and try to get a <unk> ride from him something we used to do often in the <unk> of high school 
 i remember taking off cigarette still in my hand and flying at levi from behind 
 the next morning i woke up in the hospital i could n't see out of my left eye and my head was in so much pain i ca n't even describe 
 kendra and my dad were sleeping in the chairs right next to the bed and when i woke up they woke up too 
 they starting freaking out and a whole bunch of nurses came in and asked me a whole bunch of questions and then my mom showed up and finally i had to shout to every one to shut the fuck up and tell me what happened 
 kendra 's eyes got super wide as she told me you ran up behind levi and looked like you were trying to jump on him '' to which i <unk> and said yeah 
 i was trying to get him to give me <unk> back ride '' 
 she shook her head and continued with dude 
 he threw you to the ground 
 he punched you a whole bunch of times in the face and was screaming 
 it took <unk> <unk> and <unk> to get him off of you 
 they had to hold him down and call the cops 
 it was really really bad 
 you were bleeding every where '' 
 turns out that in my <unk> state i decided that jumping on a very drunk army field officer who has seen two tours of war in iraq was a super good idea and got my mother fucking ass beat 
 my eye socket was broken but other then that all the other injuries were minor scraps bruises and such 
 the police wanted me to press charges and had held levi over night but i refused as did my parents 
 we even issued a statement saying that what had happened was my fault and 100 % <unk> if i had n't been so stupid 
 my dad and my grandfather are both <unk> and seriously ... i should have known 
 levi would n't come near me after being released and caught the next flight back to his base 5 states away 
 he was almost <unk> discharged except that my dad and my grandfather both called his boss and explained that we were not mad at all or going to press charges that we just wanted to make sure he got to <unk> to help some of his ptsd 
 my dad also learned that levi 's team had lost 6 members his first tour of iraq in a shoot out something he has never told any of us back home which just makes me hurt for him knowing that he 's seen his own friends killed 
 levi still has refused to talk to me since that night minus a get well '' card i recieved with a note saying that i will never forgive myself for what i have done 
 please find it in your heart to forgive me '' 
 i have tried <unk> letters texts calls anything to get him to talk to me 
 so here 's my last shot 
 levi i know if you read this story you 'll know who you are 
 you 're the one who introduced me to reddit so i am hoping you can see this right now 
 it was me who fucked up not you 
 i know better then to come up from behind on someone who has seen what you have seen 
 i am so sorry 
 my eye socket healed perfect but i wish we could be friends again 
 so just know that tifu ... not you 
 i hope this does n't seem like i 'm karma whoring but i posted this to <unk> and was advised to share it with you guys 
 like most tifu posts this did n't happen today but in <unk> i was 16 and had been training kung fu and <unk> <unk> for about 2 years 
 my instructor told me i had a gift and to never use my deadly techniques unless it was a life or death situation 
 i fed off his praise and continued paying the $ <unk> monthly fees while believing i was some kind of caucasian jet <unk> 
 around this time the ufc began to become very popular in new zealand and everyone was talking about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 being the martial arts master i was i decided to rent some ufc dvd 's and <unk> his technique 
 his flawless <unk> were simply not impressive to my <unk> 16 year old brain 
 i thoroughly believed i knew how to <unk> him or basically any mma fighter for that matter 
 i began <unk> around school and to my girlfriend that i was going to be the next big thing in mma and that i was going to leave school to commence my career as a certified badass 
 i basically quit school for a month to practice kung fu in my garage in addition to the 5-7 pm class at the rec center 
 following the most cringy <unk> imaginable the opportunity to crush my <unk> came with an amateur mma fight at a <unk> bar in south <unk> 
 i was unaware at the time but this was actually a maori gangster <unk> which hosted incredibly illegal <unk> for anyone <unk> enough to fight for the $ 500 cash prize 
 my friends older brother who was a gang member got me a spot and basically told me he 'd murder me if i did n't show up.. like he stood a chance 
 fast forward to fight night i show up with my girlfriend and high school <unk> for support 
 the club looked like something out of a movie leather jacket wearing thugs everywhere and a <unk> <unk> dead center 
 the nerves sunk in but i remembered what my <unk> / part time kung fu master told me about fear and sucked it up 
 before my fight two huge guys were literally <unk> each other bare knuckle until once collapsed into a mutilated heap onto the canvas 
 then came my time to shine 
 i was announced as a kung fu fighter <unk> 'the soul eater and was escorted into the ring 
 my opponent was in his mid-twenties tall <unk> and well actually a fighter 
 needless to say my flying neck <unk> did n't bring me home the <unk> and i was hospitalized with a fractured jaw <unk> and bruised rib 
 worst part is i had to go back to school where everyone had some incredibly low resolution mobile footage of me getting rag dolled by an angry maori 
 and that there was the start and end of my fighting career 
 edit : wow i was not expecting this to get so much attention 
 i 'm thrilled so many of you found happiness in my <unk> beating 
 here 's some additional info for those asking 
 firstly i had never properly <unk> 
 my <unk> experience was more like a game of touch rugby between me and my master with whiny noises and elaborate fist flailing throw in 
 my garage training consisted of me punching holes in sheets of paper and dry humping one of those foam human torso <unk> or whatever 
 secondly i had never been truly punched let alone by a maori who may have been an escaped military experiment 
 my mother did n't know what i was up to until she was informed of my <unk> 
 she was furious at my master and confronted him during one of his classes 
 my girlfriend cried a lot and begged me not to fight again she was really concerned about my <unk> safety i guess 
 finally i honestly will try and locate the footage but i have n't seen it in over 5 years and now live in australia so do n't get your hopes up 
 i will try though 
 this morning i decided to rub one out before going on a family outing 
 i 'm in the shower and searching through some videos when my wife walks in 
 she sees i have the phone in the shower and gets mad 
 not because she knows what i 'm doing but just thinks i 'm wasting time on reddit when i 'm supposed to be getting ready 
 she opens the shower to take my phone and sees my raging boner 
 this does not go like it does in the movies i 've been watching 
 she reaches for my phone and i jerk back to exit the private browser 
 this is where she flips the fuck out 
 wife starts <unk> with all her pregnancy hormones 
 throws my phone across the room 
 starts screaming about me cheating and asking who i was talking to 
 she storms out and i go after her still naked and luckily grab a towel 
 she 's still freaking out and our 3 yo daughter comes in to see what 's wrong 
 i have to try to explain to her what happened with my 3 yo there 
 she does n't quite believe me 
 threatens to cancel family outing which involves my parents and sister 
 eventually she calmed down believed me and has been making fun of me all day 
 she 's gone to bed now and i 'm on the couch for the night 
 tl dr i tried to jerk wife went berserk at the canadian border driving to <unk> from seattle with friends : canadian border agent : gentlemen do you have any drugs <unk> or dangerous materials in the vehicle '' 
 i lean out the window towards the officer and whisper : 'yeah sure man <unk> need '' 
 result = a 4 hour delay for being a <unk> was cleaning my <unk> 
 son 's room and doing my annual <unk> of crap he 's managed to <unk> 
 i have this big pile of stuff to throw out in the living room when he comes in pulls some stupid paper butterfly out of the trash pile and tells me i ca n't throw this away because it was a present 
 he goes to a lot of birthday parties and gets a lot of goodie bags with this sort of thing so i tell him it 's junk and it 's going in the trash 
 besides it 's all bent up and i tell him like a <unk> that if he <unk> things he should take care of them 
 he leaves and some 5 minutes later he returns visibly distraught he 's clearly been thinking hard about this 
 he says it was a present ... for you '' 
 for father 's day '' 
 i swear at that moment i heard every angel in heaven slow clapping 
 edit : whoa go to sleep then to work then come back to a <unk> of comments 
 <unk> of some additional context 
 as some <unk> redditors <unk> noted it 's nowhere near father 's day so the t '' in this tifu is <unk> 
 this allows me to provide some more details 
 first my son is 10 now i was reminded yesterday of the incident which of course put the pit back in the bottom of my stomach again 
 i thought about adding the obligatory this was n't today '' disclaimer but after reading the sub rules i was convinced not to 
 following the no it 's a present for *you* '' <unk> i apologized then we <unk> out the <unk> in the butterfly and my son took it back into his room 
 he ended up wrapping it up for me on father 's day <unk> and he was so excited to see me open the present even though i had figuratively shat all over it 
 it was really sweet 
 here is a picture of the butterfly taken today 
 it is pinned to my bedside <unk> and has been ever since that father 's <unk> pasta was too hot to eat so i decided to blow on it 
 then i saw my can of compressed air sitting on my desk 
 i now have pasta all over myself the floor and the walls 
 i am not a smart man 
 i 'm a dad of a beautiful 3 year old girl 
 any dad of a daughter will tell you that bathroom stuff is part of the deal 
 if mom is not around or <unk> to one of the others i have to take my little girl into the men 's room 
 so this happened at a quiet little mom & amp pop restaurant 
 it was just the two of us in there 
 i wipe off and cover the seat so she can do her little <unk> ... but then i realize i really have to go 
 no big deal 
 i just place her in the corner of the stall and say do n't move '' 
 i start to pee 
 i hear the door to the restroom open meaning we are now no longer the only two <unk> 
 i hear two guys walk in 
 as one of the sets of footsteps draw near my little girl starts to back away from the door and ends up right next to me 
 she looks down at what 's going on with an open door '' policy on the bathroom at home and her two brothers ... it 's nothing she has n't seen before and loudly <unk> : daddy 
 look at your little penis '' 
 what ... the ... i hear the other guys in the bathroom kind of snort ... and then let loose in laughter 
 first of all ... wow 
 she 's never said that before ... or since 
 second ... what is here frame of reference 
 i did n't know what i could possibly say to make it any better 
 i kind of wanted to yell out <unk> 's just kidding ... it 's normal size '' but i figured that any remark trying to clarify my size would just come off as creepy 
 i just stayed in the stall until the other two guys left 
 i could n't face them 
 i 'm sure they were out there in the restaurant watching to see me come out so they could tell their wives about the guy who has a tiny wiener by three year old standards 
 tl dr my daughter <unk> insults my manhood edit : wow thanks for the interest everyone 
 also for those concerned about open door policy '' i guess i should clarify that it 's not so much a policy as a fact of life with 3 kids and 2 parents in a smallish house 
 everybody has seen everybody else 's stuff and it 's no big <unk> was not a good day 
 starts off with me in class as i feel the urge to shit i go 
 whilst i was shitting the lights went out some generator fail as i assume 
 and i think well fuck 
 i 'm still gon na finish but shitting in the dark is no easy task 
 as i 'm almost done i hear the door open as the room is filled with light only to be taken away 
 i hear a slight <unk> shit that was scary 
 i start to hear crawling of sorts 
 all of the sudden the lights came back and i find a kid with down syndrome crawling underneath the stall i 'm in looking at me 
 he goes **hehehehehe** '' in the most terrifying voice 
 after my initial scream i react the only way i knew i could 
 i kicked his face sending him into the stall door where he passed out 
 i quickly gathered myself got up and ran 
 i 'm thinking of dropping out 
 now this is i shit you not what happened 
 i am in no way making fun if people with special needs 
 nor should you 
 edit : it 's 11 am and i just got called into the principals 
 will update later update : 11:40 am got called into principals for a reason that 's <unk> with my story 
 i see down syndrome kid in the office <unk> a black eye 
 he points at me saying its him <unk> '' i shit you the fuck not 
 waiting outside principals again will update soon 
 update : <unk> am principal yelled at me for kicking down syndrome kid in the face 
 he still could n't help but laugh 
 got a saturday school but that 's about it 
 i left my principal in tears of laughter though 
 will be responding to most posts if you got any questions 
 update : <unk> pm got call into the office principal said he saw the reddit post and read over it 
 after further investigation '' of the comment section he has lifted the detention 
 reddit : 1 down syndrome : 0 and no i do n't know his username <unk> : im now playing dayz if anyone would like to play and hear a wonderful story of how i kicked a down syndrome <unk> <unk> edit** : fuck up of the week <unk> 
 damn did i really fuck up that bad 
 this is an unusual kind of fuckup 
 for the last decade or so i have been trying all the great chinese restaurants i can locate in an attempt to find a place that is as awesome as the one i fell in love with 25 years ago in college 
 over these years i 've been going to every different kind of chinese restaurant i could find trying to find something as delicious as what made me fall in love in the first place 
 i kept track of the different types of <unk> tried to learn how to cook it myself from <unk> and even recently took a chinese food cooking lesson 
 every time a fancy new chinese restaurant opened i would be there to taste the food going from restaurant to restaurant like <unk> charming went door to door looking for a certain foot 
 today as i was driving down the new street i saw a really crappy looking chinese place 
 one of those in the bad part of town that also sells french fries is all white and is really just a <unk> place 
 even though there are technically two tables in the place one is covered in magazines and the other has three kids under age 6 <unk> because they are stuck there 
 when i saw this place i said to myself i said fuck it i 'm never going to find anything great like they used to make it back in 'my day and i 'm hungry and lazy so i 'll just get some of this shitty chinese and be done with it '' 
 when i got home and bit into the first <unk> my dick got a little hard because of 25 years of searching i 'd finally found the perfect chinese food i had been searching for 
 the sauce was just perfect even though it looked so simple 
 hey wait a minute 
 the chinese place i fell in love with in college must have been a cheap chinese place that only college students went to 
 thinking back now it was in a strip mall next to a <unk> 
 what happened is that over the years as my income grew i slowly went to nicer and nicer chinese restaurants just by default - whatever i could afford -- and i eventually got used to the fancy ones that <unk> with <unk> and <unk> go to 
 in other words the reason i could n't find what i wanted all these years is that i thought i was searching for the best chinese food when what i really wanted was that same cheap <unk> chinese that i fell in love with so many years ago and was dirt poor 
 **tl dr current me '' <unk> past me '' and i spent ten years trying to find something fancier and more expensive than i ever wanted or needed 
 ** <unk> after this hit the front page : 1 i never heard of the movie old boy but will rent it now 2 there 's apparently an episode of himym about a burger that is similar -- i have n't seen that either 3 tons of you agree that hole in the wall places are often the best - including a bunch of you in china right now 
 4 many of you think i am probably am in love with msg 
 i am going to order some now from amazon and start <unk> with it 5 yes the journey was pretty fun but i am glad to have closure now and also to move on to a different obsession <unk> 
 *** just got back from the emergency room 
 what a night 
 some background : my wife 27 and i 31 have recently gotten into swinging 
 it 's been a wild and crazy summer for sure with enough sexual escapades for a lifetime 
 she especially has been having a blast since i 'm the only man she 's ever even kissed 
 we started out by meeting couples then got into going to some nice exclusive swinging clubs and private parties 
 tons of fun so far 
 only problem is that my erection usually does n't last for more than 1 to 1.5 hours but <unk> i can go all night - especially in a club full of beautiful naked women 
 so ... i got a little greedy 
 i saw a <unk> and told him i had <unk> <unk> 
 he prescribed various pills none of which seemed to <unk> my hard-on 
 so the next step was injections straight into the side of the penis 
 i called it viagra in the post title but actually it 's called <unk> 
 same effect though 
 i initially <unk> at the idea but after doing some reading on this particular medication it lasts several hours and makes your cock hard as a diamond i gave it a second thought 
 so i filled the prescription and decided to give it a try last night 
 to answer a question i 'm sure is many readers minds no it 's not very painful at all 
 so i got the wife on board for a night of <unk> sex injected myself and almost instantly got the <unk> and hardest erection i 've ever experienced 
 i almost did n't recognize my dick 
 walking around the house with my massive <unk> <unk> around was great 
 we had a great <unk> that had to be cut short to two hours only because she was getting sore ... and so was i ... ... and that 's where things got dicey 
 i came ... twice ... and it only got harder 
 i started pouring cold water over it 
 nothing 
 i took four <unk> pills as suggested online when you get an <unk> erection 
 nothing 
 i started <unk> major muscle groups doing endless sets of <unk> <unk> squats etc 
 also recommended online in order to <unk> the blood 
 nothing 
 three hours in it was starting to really hurt ... and i was starting to panic 
 knowing that the medication came with a warning that prolonged erections lasting longer than 4 hours require emergency medical attention i rushed to the er 
 telling the elderly hispanic woman in triage what happened was n't fun 
 i was writhing in pain at this point and my cock was so sensitive and painful i <unk> not walk and required a wheelchair* because the sensation of it rubbing against my shorts as i walked was incredibly painful 
 yes i was awkwardly covering up my erection the entire time 
 eventually i got wheeled into a room 
 i got two full <unk> of morphine before i calmed down a bit 
 40 minutes later a team of doctors and nurses came in 
 the resident doctor was a young cute indian woman who - unlike the others in the room who tried very hard to act serious - read me and the situation better and made it pretty clear that she thought this was all pretty hilarious and cheered me up immediately by turns making fun of me and being very vaguely <unk> 
 eventually they got a butterfly needle and proceeded to extract a <unk> amount of blood out of my cock as the doctors took turns squeezing my dick like a lemon 
 pics of cock and jar of blood below obviously nsfw : needless to say i 'll be doing this again starting at a third of the first <unk> 
 tl dr : wanted to be a sex god by <unk> an ed drug directly into my penis had to rush to the emergency room because it nearly exploded had to get all the blood drained and squeezed out of my cock 
 good times 
 edit : thank you for the gold kind stranger 
 and i 'm overwhelmed at all the <unk> and admiration for my dick 
 much appreciated 
 y'all should have seen it before it was drained 
 to clear up a popular misunderstanding though that is not blood covering my dick 
 it 's <unk> and <unk> 
 i 'm happy to report that although my dick looks like it 's been in a ufc fight very black and blue from all the squeezing and needles from last night it feels completely fine and i 've even been getting very hard spontaneous erections throughout the day today 
 alright reddit this actually happened today four hours ago to be exact 
 i 'm 28 years old and have a girlfriend 
 we have been together for about three years now and things are were 
 going okay 
 we are n't officially living together but most of the nights she sleeps over at my place 
 so after we had dinner i was watching some seinfeld on my laptop sitting on the couch when she drops herself besides me 
 she tells me she is bored and that she wants to do something 
 okay then i ask her what she was thinking about doing then not really paying attention since it was the answering machine episode and george 's song was coming up 
 she says oh i dunno haha we could watch porn together that would be fun right 
 so now she got my attention and i could tell this was n't something she just came up with on the spot <unk> she sounded excited and i could tell the whole i 'm bored '' thing was just a playful act to do some <unk> stuff 
 well okay why not '' i tell her 
 alright then she is all energetic and she jumps beside me on the couch in a playful manner smiling and all <unk> cuddling besides me 
 i do n't actually think she normally watches porn herself 
 obviously the reason she wanted to watch porn with me in the first place was the same reason you watch a bad horror movie together to laugh and make comments on everything that 's happening you know you watch it in a ironic way i guess 
 watching some cheesy porn scene and making comments on how <unk> the premise is some funny <unk> about the setting and maybe sexy talk you know good stuff 
 i should have put on a lengthy cheesy porn flick or something 
 this is very obvious to me right now typing this two hours ago this was not that obvious 
 this is where the fuckup starts 
 i have never 
 cringed this hard while typing something 
 so here i am laptop on my lap and my girlfriend next to me on the couch looking at the screen 
 i pause the seinfeld episode and open a new tab in the browser 
 sooo what do you want to watch '' i asked her 
 well i do n't know haha you are the expert here right 
 just do what you normally do haha '' 
 what the fuck woman 
 obviously there is no way she is going to be invited to witness the dark ritual that is my <unk> 
 oh sure let 's first watch some hardcore porn <unk> on an obscure subreddit whose url i know by heart to then proceed to <unk> to watch a video of a <unk> cum in the mouth of a woman 
 good idea fun times /s 
 so now i start to panic a little bit 
 okay then 
 let 's see <unk> '' i am not going to screw this up 
 i slowly type <unk> in the urlbar because in that moment for some reason i was certain that <unk> was the most normal porn website i could choose 
 what the fuck brain 
 i press enter and the website is coming up 
 i can notice she looks closer at the screen like she misread the name of the site the first time 
 so the website is loaded and we are looking at the homepage 
 we were going to watch something extremely vanilla or i would die trying 
 my mind is going <unk> : okay no lesbian stuff obviously 
 no <unk> i do n't want her to think i would like to try that with her 
 no threesome porn 
 no facial stuff she might think i 'm a <unk> 
 no mentions of <unk> race of <unk> i am staring at this homepage without scrolling and i can feel that she is kinda weirded out 
 i just ca n't decide what video to click on 
 i decide to use the search function 
 i type the most normal phrase i could think of : big tit has sex with man '' what in the flying fuck brain 
 big tit has sex with man '' 
 i can hear her reading it 
 holy shit this is bad 
 for some stupid reason i did n't feel that i could just tell her it was a mistake or make a joke out of it 
 no fun comments 
 just me looking at the screen silently and dead serious waiting for the page to load completely focused to make sure that i do n't click on something weird 
 so i click on a video in the list that had what i thought was a pretty normal thumbnail 
 it turned out to be some shaky homemade amateur <unk> of a married couple having sex in what i guess was their <unk> 
 i was staring at the screen with a complete <unk> with my two hands on the keyboard 
 i could feel her judging me 
 the <unk> was really weird 
 what could i say 
 should i turn the video off 
 what was she thinking 
 why was n't she saying anything 
 the video finally ends and i ask her if she wants to watch in bed 
 <unk> 
 she says well i think i 'm gon na head home actually '' 
 she left 
 no i 'm here in bed all alone typing this story 
 should i <unk> her 
 i really fucked up here i really we n't full retard 
 <unk> : gf wanted to watch porn with me screwed it up because i did n't want to watching something weird ended up watching something extremely weird 
 gf left 
 **update : ** hey guys 
 wow i really did n't except this to blew up like it did 
 i want to thank you all for your kind words and pieces of advice 
 i called her up the next day explained what went through my head like you guys <unk> me to and i guess she understood my struggle '' and everything is fine now 
 a friend of mine gave me this cool advice to watch taxi driver with her since in that movie there is a scene where robert <unk> 's character awkwardly takes a girl to a porn theatre for their first date 
 we might watch that later tonight maybe that scene will start a conversation about how weird and in hindsight how <unk> that night was 
 thanks again for the advice and i 'd like to wish you all a happy new year 
 so just to set the stage here my wife is currently surfing the red tide <unk> 
 during these monthly events my board is kicking it on the beach waiting for better days 
 so after watching the family friendly <unk> we 've been playing the scare game trying to freak each other out on random occasions 
 of course i am the master having got the kids and the wife numerous times and they have failed to scare me yet 
 but enough of me beating my chest lets get to the fuck up 
 so the 14 year old is grounded and stuck at home and the 8 and 9 year olds have just finished their homework 
 my gorgeous wife calls me saying that she is almost home and that i should get the kids out of the house and take them to the park where she will meet us later after she gets home and changes 
 thats when it hits me ... what a perfect opportunity for the four of us to scare the crap out of her 
 the first thing she does when she gets home is go to our closet to change clothes 
 so i <unk> the plan with the kids that we should pretend we went to the park but instead hide in the closet to scare mom instead 
 everyone loved the idea especially since it didnt involve them being freaked out for once 
 so we see her pull into the alley and we scramble into the closet and wait 
 im trying to get them to all stop <unk> as we hear the garage door close 
 then come the foot steps down the hall ... her purse hits the desk and we can hear her fumbling around the room 
 the dresser drawer opens and in the back of my head a brain cell lights up ... but no thats not going to happen ... and then it does 
 <unk> and moans start to fill the room 
 i look at the puzzled faces of the two innocent ones and the revolting shock of disgust on the 14 year old and did the only thing i could think to do ... hey angel we are in the closet and we were going to scare you 
 coming out in 1 minute '' 
 we are still trying to process this event 
 but needless to say im still laughing my ass off and she has this sheepish look on her face 
 not sure what we are going to say to the 8 & amp 9 year old ... and i think the 14 year old will never be the same again 
 so there ya <unk> towards door 
 girl caught my eye 
 got distracted 
 went into revolving door <unk> 'oh shit i 'm dick to ass with some guy who is already in here 
 he looked back at me as if i just shat in his <unk> and then we both shuffled our feet at <unk> speed because people were still entering the door in the opposite direction 
 i tried to laugh it off but i <unk> the laugh and just kind of did a <unk> laugh like it was some <unk> plot of mine 
 **edit : ** /u/markreadsreddit did a narration of it worth a watch haha 
 when i was in high school years ago my girlfriend and i would often fool around on the couch in her parents living room 
 her parents would always go upstairs to watch tv in the evening so this worked out perfectly for us 
 during this one particular evening we both ended up falling asleep with half our clothes off unintentionally and slept right through until the morning 
 i was shocked to wake up the next morning to the sound of her dad 's footsteps upstairs 
 i threw my clothes on in record time and tried to run out of the house but that plan did not <unk> 
 i did make it as far as the front door just as her dad was coming down the stairs 
 her dad is clearly surprised to see me 
 he slowly says to me : oh hello <unk> what are you doing here '' 
 ok it was 5:30 in the morning so this is what comes out of my mouth 
 i say : oh hi mr. jones i 'm just going out fishing for the day and thought i would come say hello to susan first '' 
 to my great astonishment he buys this explanation 
 he smiles wishes me good luck fishing and goes to read the morning paper 
 susan told me that years later she told her mom this story and the two of them still laugh at her dad for falling for this 
 edit : to all those who continue to send me hate mail about how my tifu post was n't actually today : take 30 seconds of your life and actually go and read the subreddit 's rules and regulations 
 particularly rule <unk> 
 <unk> i opened it 
 this was about 10 minutes ago and i’m now at work covered in coffee and grounds 
 i don’t know why i expected anything <unk> 'm an american who was living in <unk> at the time of this fuck up 
 i 've always been a big fan of going to the movies and i <unk> popcorn 
 the one thing that always bothered me about european movie theaters though is that they do n't give you butter on your popcorn 
 you can order it sweet or salty but not greasy 
 my wife 's cousins had traveled to my city to visit somehow they are always around for my fuck ups 
 and we decided to go see a movie 
 i was talking about the <unk> of american popcorn and they were making the <unk> fat american '' jokes about our cultural need to pour fat on everything 
 we were going back and forth and i got so worked up in my patriotic <unk> that i told them i would bring my own butter to the movies to demonstrate how great it was 
 i melt a stick of butter in the microwave pour it into a glass jar put the jar into the pocket of my <unk> and we head to the movies 
 it was the dead of <unk> winter and it took us quite some time to take the trams to the theater 
 by the time we get there the butter had <unk> to a <unk> that was glued to the bottom of the jar 
 no problem we buy a large popcorn and my cousin holds it while waiting for me outside the men 's room 
 i go into one of the stalls hold the jar by the rim and strike my lighter underneath it 
 unfortunately the lighter made quite a distinct sound and people in the bathroom heard it 
 the gap in the stall door frame was quite wide and a couple of people shot glances my way 
 i 'm not sure what they think they saw but it must have been weird to see a guy with a lighter under a glass 
 i heard whispers about <unk> '' and started to get nervous 
 was security about to get called on me for suspected crack smoking 
 fortunately the butter melted quite quickly and i decided to make a run for it 
 <unk> the jar was way too hot to hold anywhere except by the rim 
 so i did the only thing i could think of which was to hold the jar in front of me by the rim and <unk> walk out of the bathroom before my fingers burned 
 the crowd parted wide for me as i <unk> through the bathroom holding a mysterious jar of yellow liquid 
 people were equally stunned outside the bathroom when i emerged 
 an entire theater was emptying out in front of me and all they saw was a <unk> man running out of a bathroom and hurriedly dumping a jar of yellow fluid into a popcorn bag held by an <unk> <unk> 
 there were several pronounced looks of disgust 
 i ca n't say that i kept my head held high after that but i can say that i enjoyed the hell out of that buttered popcorn while watching that movie 
 good times 
 i still love popcorn but these days i 'm more into olive oil and <unk> yeast than butter 
 tl dr : my american love of grease makes <unk> think i 'm a <unk> who enjoys <unk> my food with <unk> time for some background and <unk> 
 my biology teacher we 'll call her kate '' is hot 
 i do n't mean this in a i want to have sex with her '' way but rather a i 'd like to unzip her genes '' way yes i got that off the internet 
 either way she has been at the school for five years and in that time the school has come to an informal consensus that her ass should be the mark to which other asses are compared 
 for example if me and my friends are checking some girl out we 'd say not as good as kate 's but not bad either '' 
 this leads us to today 
 my biology teacher who is awesome had previously told us that she liked to <unk> within her classes and i decided to take my chances in getting in a class with the hottest girl in my grade we 're <unk> 
 as such i walked up to my biology teacher and casually asked if next semester she could pair us together i 'm really <unk> from finals so my <unk> is turned off 
 at this she smiled and said you think she 's attractive do n't you '' 
 this is where i fucked up 
 i without looking at my teacher and <unk> this casual conversation with those that i have with my friends said well her ass is n't kate good but it 's ... '' at this she raised her eyebrow and smiled a bit at my embarrassment and then turned and walked away 
 i have bio tomorrow and do n't know how i can face her again 
 tl dr my bio teacher 's ass is the informal benchmark at my school for a good ass 
 accidentally let it slip in a conversation with her that i thought my classmate 's ass was almost at her level 
 edit : not going to share photo of teacher 's ass 
 do n't want <unk> 
 however this is roughly equivalent except blonde and white pants update : thanks for the gold 
 i did go to school again today and i did go to biology class 
 after reading all of your comments i decided to play it cool and bank on sitting next to the girl in my grade and it worked 
 she announced <unk> charts 
 also some of my friends discovered this and they loved the fact that kate good '' was now reddit 's benchmark 
 thanks for all the comments i work in it at a graduate school at a large <unk> university 
 after attending to a call i came back up the stairwell and as i opened the door i saw a yellow jacket wasp on the door frame next to the handle 
 keeping the door open because i did n't want the little asshole to get spooked and fly off i took my shoe off and <unk> him pretty hard perhaps a little harder than intended 
 he fell and i said to myself good job me you saved the school '' 
 almost immediately after that there 's a school lockdown 
 i 'm told to get in my office lock the doors and shut the lights off 
 there 's some important government people who work here so i figure maybe they do this as a drill every so often so whatever 
 but i 'm still kind of nervous 
 i texted someone up at the front desk wtf '' and they texted back there was a gunshot '' 
 i guess that staircase is pretty <unk> because the next thing i know i 'm trying not to laugh as police officer is questioning me getting my information and taking pictures of my kill like hes the fuckin wasp fbi 
 at some point i heard mention of a swat team on <unk> 
 it did n't even die it was still <unk> around as he was <unk> the crime scene 
 i ca n't work here anymore everyone 's calling me <unk> '' 
 i was just trying to help 
 <unk> swat <unk> 1 : update 2 : little back story i 've been dating my girlfriend for almost 4 years now and would never cheat on her 
 we have a very intimate relationship and live together 
 i am very close with her family who like me a lot 
 i naturally have her father mother and sisters phone number 
 we have been planning thanksgiving dinner for the past few days we switch off every year with her and my family with her family on where to have it i 've been out of town for the past week for work and have been <unk> through text with her and her family 
 this is where everything went wrong 
 i was texting my girlfriend and her sister 
 i was texting her sister about her staying out our place after dinner she did n't want to pay for a cab back would be $ <unk> 
 meanwhile my gf starts sexting me from home 
 giving me some nsfw pics and dirty messages 
 i am responding back and forth 
 she asks me show me what you 've go right now '' 
 right as i read that i got a call work stuff and have to take care of that really quick 
 mid-way through the call my gf 's sister texts me back about staying after thanksgiving 
 in my horny rage i did n't notice she had responded i just took a picture of my dick clicked the first option on my phone and sent the pic saying you think you can handle this '' 
 about two minutes later her sister texts me back i 've been wanting it for the longest time '' 
 needless to say my response to her was n't what she wanted to hear and my girlfriend is pissed 
 thanksgiving should be fun 
 tl dr : was sexting my girlfriend got a call from work mid-way through call gf 's sister texts me i do n't notice and send her a pic of my dick she says she wants to bang 
 thanksgiving is going to be a blast 
 *for all of you asking 
 my girlfriend is the hotter sister 
 * edit 1 : people asking if i told my gf 
 yes i did she was angry but understood it was a mistake and i did n't mean it 
 she 's more upset at her sister 
 edit 2 : to those asking if her parents know about this 
 no they do not we are going to see them next weekend though and we 're going to tell them then 
 i do n't like secrets 
 edit 3 : you guys seem very on the side of do n't tell the parents 
 this is n't my choice just so you know i am completely leaving this up to her 
 she said she wants to because she wants this out in the air 
 i told her we could do that with just us 3 talking 
 i 'll let you guys know how that conversation goes 
 **edit 4 : she has decided to not tell her <unk> after your guys comments 
 rest assured this will stay between the 3 of us 
 edit 5 : to those of you asking why did you tell your gf in the first place '' 
 you 've never been in a <unk> relationship 
 secrets are basically <unk> honesty is the best thing 
 in retrospect could i have kept this a secret 
 maybe but i 'm not willing to take the chance of her finding out down the line and being upset with me and losing her 
 edit 6 : front page 
 girlfriend is happy this experience happened now 
 you 'll all be mentioned at the wedding 
 edit 7 : a lot of people giving me shit for telling my girlfriend 
 calm down people i handle something one way you can handle it another 
 you never know what you 'll do until it happens 
 **edit 8 : for those wondering how the conversation went between my girlfriend and her <unk> 
 its as awkward as you can imagine 
 to the sisters credit she confessed that she actually is attracted to me and apologized for responding 
 i apologized for not looking who i sent it to 
 my gf and her talked privately for a while i left the room 
 all seems well they hugged and she 's staying for thanksgiving ... she 's on close surveillance <unk> : nsfl i 'm currently <unk> alot of my house and last night i started <unk> and pulling nails in our stairwell 
 so as a nude sleeper i hear my wife screaming at <unk> and being the good husband i am i fly out from under the blanket on my bed and start making my way down the stairs only to trip over the hammer my lazy ass left out 
 at this point i 'm in full <unk> mode and after falling for what felt like 15 seconds i came to a crashing halt but i could feel this overwhelming pain and started calling for help 
 when i started checking myself i realized what had happened my ballsack had caught a loose nail and torn completely open i had a perfect window into them and when i stood up one of my balls were falling out of the sack 
 here is the kicker on the way to the hospital i asked her why she screamed oh ... .i saw a spider '' 
 i just left the er with 18 stitches 
 edit : added nsfl tag edit # 2 : thank you for gold and thank you for the kind words the pain killers are working great and i get to take a week off work so do n't feel to bad for <unk> minor fuck up : i work in retail on the service desk i have for five years 
 it 's just a casual job while i study and the shop i work at is generally rather relaxed - not in terms of our <unk> but the attitude of the place - so i tend to have reasonable banter with my co-workers and managers throughout the shift 
 as with most australian banter all we do is shit talk ourselves and each other 
 so i 'm chatting with my manager as he walks past towards the home section 
 to <unk> : me : '' i wish you were as good at your job as i am at mine '' manager : mate you suck at your job '' 
 me : five years of sucking well spent '' 
 manager : i do n't know how that 's happened '' 
 me : yeah well i 'll keep on *sucking* as much as i need to to keep the job '' 
 and then the pause i realise i 've shouted this line as he 's now about i 'd <unk> 5 or 6 metres away 
 a fair few customers are looking my way a parent giving that awkward glare and slowly shuffling their kid along who seemed oblivious 
 fortunately the manager was laughing too hysterically to immediately kill me 
 **tl dr : ** i implied to all our customers that i give blowjobs to my manager to keep my job 
 did n't get punished got told to remember that i 'm too stupid to speak so <unk> this happened two days ago 
 i work at an art gallery and sometimes move around very expensive art pieces 
 well last week i had a terrible ear infection that gave me <unk> 
 i called in sick but my boss told me i had to come in 
 after taking a <unk> amount of medicine i felt alright as long as i did n't stand move or breathe slightly 
 my boss asked me to move a piece of art work and i obliged because i 'm an idiot 
 not only did i have to move the <unk> but i had to put it up high on the wall because of the way we place our art 
 i had to get on a ladder and everything was fine until i started to get dizzy and dropped the canvas 
 the <unk> popped open the glass shattered and the canvas had a tear in it 
 i was near tears and my boss runs in and starts freaking out 
 although i work in a gallery i had no idea what was and was n't expensive 
 this particular piece is worth $ 300k and the artist who is very well known was <unk> it to us 
 i have n't been to work since and my boss let me go home early that day 
 i wish she would have just let me take the day off 
 tl dr boss forced me to go to work i damage $ 300k worth of paint 
 edit : i have n't been to work since because i only work <unk> 
 this happened on wednesday 
 i have n't talked to anyone from the gallery since 
 update : i decided to call my boss and she said she 's setting up a meeting with the curator of the gallery and i should expect a reply on monday if i still have my job 
 might need to change this to tifu by getting fired 
 update part 2 : my co-worker just texted me and told me that the curator just got out of a meeting with the board of <unk> and they walked out of the meeting laughing 
 i might be safe 
 maybe 
 update part 3 : i just got out of a meeting with the curator 
 he told me to let him know if i 'm ever am sick and ca n't make it to work 
 i asked what happened to linda my boss 
 he said to wait for the employee meeting at noon to find out 
 rip linda 
 edit : update here 
 it was supposed to be romantic 
 it was our last night together before he left on a plane not to see me for months and we were about to get groovy 
 we were under the stars kissing and holding each other and spending a long time on the perfect foreplay 
 it was fucking amazing 
 we were ready to fuck like animals and to make sweet love all at once 
 we were naked and touching each other to build up <unk> and he began to finger me hard leaving me moaning but with an ... odd ... sensation as well 
 there 's something inside you '' he said 
 there 's nothing do n't stop '' i replied <unk> 
 no there 's something inside you 
 it feels plastic '' 
 horror <unk> my veins 
 it had been about two weeks since my period 
 but i knew then that i had left my menstrual cup basically a plastic cup for <unk> gunk not to be left in longer than 12 hours in for the past <unk> days 
 * <unk> i asked him to help me remove it so we could continue 
 mother of god ... it smelled like an <unk> decomposing body mixed with rotting <unk> <unk> and rotting eggs all in one 
 and the smell did not go away 
 i threw out the cup and its contents but the stench of 14 day old rotting blood and uterine gunk is not one that fades easily 
 i could tell my <unk> boyfriend was trying extremely hard not to lose his shit and vomit 
 but it only got worse from there 
 the stench would not leave and it was coming from my vagina 
 to try and bring the mood back i went to the bathroom to try and freshen up 
 he joined me perhaps to make me feel less disgusting 
 bad idea 
 with a feeling like an impending <unk> but somehow <unk> my vagina suddenly emptied a massive <unk> of this filth and it splattered a surprisingly large amount of brown rotted uterine filth all over my poor boyfriend 's leg ... he practically ran home 
 so i got off early from work today and came inside 
 my wife had been over at the neighbor 's place and was just coming back inside 
 i was just about to leave the bathroom right next to our back door and <unk> thought i could be really funny 
 so waiting for the perfect moment i opened the door and yelled right as she walked past 
 it was perfect 
 she screamed and jumped really badly and then began to laugh really hard as she realized what had happened 
 but there was one thing i had not taken into account during my impulsive decision 
 my wife was <unk> 1/2 weeks pregnant 
 keyword : was 
 yep 
 i scared my wife into labor 
 at first we thought it was just <unk> <unk> again but very quickly realized that this was the real thing 
 <unk> hours later and we have a beautiful healthy baby girl 
 everything worked out well but during labor my wife was not amused though the doctor was a little when she told him what had caused her to go into labor 
 still lesson learned : do not try to be funny by scaring your heavily pregnant <unk> happend just 2-3 hours ago 
 today is my first day of my internship at a supermarket 
 for my internship i need to do a research 
 they put me in an office with an one-way window that has a view over the store mainly the cash registers 
 i have a friend who works at this supermarket and this is how i got my internship at the store 
 after 2 hours of my internship i spoke with my friend 
 she told me that one of the cashiers thought i was cute 
 i was curious who it was because i never had a girlfriend before and have a low <unk> 
 she pointed out who it was 
 i was really excited 
 so i went back to the office and stared at her for a good 15 minutes through the one-way window 
 she sometimes looked at the window but i was like 'hey you ca n't see me through this window so i kept staring at her 
 i was pretty sure she was just looking at customers who were near the window 
 i left the office to go to the toilet 
 while i was heading back to the office i realized i could see through the window 
 welp apparently if you switch the lights on of the office the effect of the one-way window goes away 
 i have been basically staring at her with a creepy face for full 15 minutes and she knew 
 i bet she does n't think that i 'm cute <unk> have been playing a subtle and what i thought harmless prank on one of my co-workers for the last four and a half years 
 this guy let 's give him a fake name of <unk> is a bit of an <unk> but a good dude 
 he is very quiet and polite kind of keeps to himself but sometimes comes up with random and hilarious <unk> out of nowhere 
 i like him 
 about four and a half years ago i did this prank for the first time 
 he always has a post-it note pad on his desk 
 i turned to a post-it note a few pages is <unk> the right word 
 back and wrote the word fart '' 
 on the post-it 
 a few days later he got to that post-it note saw the word stared at it for a few seconds and said out loud to himself ... what '' 
 he then quickly removed that post-it ripped it into three pieces and threw it in the trash 
 so i have done this about once every two weeks for the last four and a half years 
 i ca n't even count how many times i have done 
 but literally every single time i see him find the post-it he does the exact same thing 
 in the same exact tone of voice to himself he says ... what '' 
 and then every single time he always rips it into three pieces and throws it away 
 nobody else has ever seen the post-it 
 he has never told anyone as far as i know 
 he just every time almost as if he is seeing it the first time says ... what '' 
 and rips it into three pieces 
 i kind of became obsessed with this 
 i just <unk> to see if he 'd ever do something different 
 well today he did 
 i saw him write a post-it note pull it off the pad and <unk> revealed the post-it i 'd written fart '' 
 on 
 this time it was different 
 he stared at it in silence for a solid five minutes 
 suddenly he shouted 
 this crazy primal roar sort of a shout 
 he picked up his computer monitor and slammed it into the floor 
 he held up the post-it note pad and screamed who is doing this '' 
 everyone stared at him in shock myself included 
 nobody said a word 
 after a moment he ran out of the office 
 i am mortified and full of shame 
 i thought it was a harmless prank but apparently it had been really <unk> him for the past few years and he just snapped 
 i want to apologize in person but i wo n't because i refuse to take responsibility 
 i do n't want people to think negatively of me 
 i think i will apologize anonymously and explain i meant no harm 
 i feel <unk> front page tifu i see involve sex 
 <unk> makes <unk> to this with tifu by putting my penis into my girlfriend 's vagina '' more and more i see tifu which just seem to be people either wanting to say they 've had sex or making completely fake stories with plot holes in their own stories 
 i get the weekend rule which is fantastic but what happened to this subreddit 
 before i had this account it was my first subreddit to browse and now it just seems to be kids acting like my example below 
 but since this is tifu i must provide a tifu : ex 
 tifu by being so <unk> better than you 
 i also had sex 
 with a girl 
 in her vagina 
 the upper one 
 she came 
 then her sister heard us having sex and insisted she join because im so good 
 then my already 12 inch penis grew 4 more inches before i became president of the world 
 tl dr - im better than <unk> so today i was clearing out a house i just bought when i was flipping the bed over i got i <unk> it 's an absolute hell hole thought i can flip this '' what a fucking idiot <unk> i stumble and i 've landed on literally 30 used heroin needles with all the old cooking spoons and empty bags i 'm now in hospital getting my blood checked making sure i 'm not gon na turn out like charlie sheen 
 fuck my life i 'm nervous as hell right now edit : hi guys thanks for all your messages just been reading through them at work cant believe how many people commented the comedy and the advice really has settled me so thank you reddit 
 i was in the hospital for 4 hours after taking 4 samples of my blood they 've give me an injection for hep b and now im having to go on a course of treatment just to be safe i find out in 2 weeks for my blood results 
 <unk> : just to clarify no guy called <unk> gave me the shot so this literally happened like thirty minutes ago 
 im walking to my buddies on campus and as i am walking this car proceeds to honk at me 
 per usual i flip them the bird and keep walking 
 not even thirty seconds later my mother calls me and says what the hell nick you just flipped <unk> your grandma '' 
 as it turns out my grandparents were in town visiting and they recognized me and <unk> to get my attention and a <unk> wave 
 little did they know when someone <unk> at you in <unk> it usually is not for those <unk> happened this morning 
 i 'm australian so it 's still morning and i 'm still shaking 
 for background i 'm female <unk> and work a corporate job at a big firm 
 i decided to work from home today 
 there 's lots of perks working from home one being that clothes are <unk> 
 i set up my laptop and sit it in front of my naked body 
 we just got this new program set up where any call that comes through to my office phone is transferred to my laptop and can be answered on screen using the <unk> mic 
 brilliant 
 lets test this baby out 
 i first call my mobile from the program and all works great 
 i then proceed to call my boss 45 year old awkward male from my laptop and like a baby <unk> using skype for the first time lean up close to the mic to test the audio 'hi boss 
 just testing the new program out 
 <unk> everything going 
 i do n't hear anything except slight background noises for a about 10 seconds then he hangs up 
 <unk> i 'll call my colleague mid 30s <unk> male instead 
 <unk> 
 can you hear me 
 a stumble of words come out from my mic i hear a faint gasp a laugh and then after a few seconds he too hangs up 
 i give up 
 maybe it 's broken 
 10 minutes go by and i receive a call from a lady that works in the project division 
 i answer with a 'hi patricia 
 there 's a long pause 
 i lean in further to my screen boobs <unk> above the keyboard <unk> i 'm working from home today can you hear me 
 i hear a 'oh my god then she too she hangs up 
 things are getting weird 
 not 30 seconds go by and i receive an email from patricia : <unk> sweetie put some clothes on 
 i want to die 
 i work as an <unk> and repair technician for a major <unk> company 
 i was working in suburban philadelphia installing service for one of our customers and while <unk> out the job i was deciding where i should drill a hole to bring in the <unk> 
 from the outside i saw that if i drilled to the left of an outdoor water <unk> i 'd avoid any electrical gas and water lines 
 so i grab my drill and go inside to start the hole 
 and in my head all i keep telling myself is to go to the left of the water pipe and i do just that 
 what i neglected was that from the inside of the house is have to go to the right side 
 after about 5 minutes of <unk> i punch through and immediately hear a very loud popping sound 
 then i see quite a bit of smoke coming from the hole 
 i then notice that my drill bit is charred and melted at the tip 
 i had just drilled into the back of the customers electric meter 
 i had to call the fire department and they sent 2 trucks 
 after all was said and done i had caused around $ <unk> in repair and <unk> 
 also i received a two weeks suspension but considering i hit the main electric line for the house i am just lucky to be alive 
 so today i fucked up by taking my wife to see ant man 
 yeah .. see we 're newly married but have been together several years 
 we 're moving house and i 'm under a lot of stress with new city new job and i was getting cabin fever and just had to get out of the house 
 i <unk> to my wife that we should go see a movie 
 there 's a new <unk> one that i want to see 
 and she happily agreed 
 i bought tickets and we went in 
 she was clutching my arm rather tightly and she cuddled in close when the title came up but i thought nothing of it 
 we 're very close and it 's not uncommon 
 you see at this point i had n't even thought about it ... my wife suffers <unk> 
 or a fear of ants 
 yeah .. she had seen my stress levels and put aside her darkest fear to accompany me to a movie willingly that <unk> her worst fear in detail 
 as a side note she thoroughly enjoyed it and buried her face in my arm any time she started to feel uncomfortable 
 so as a <unk> to her i felt i should share this story on reddit 
 i could ask for no better life partner 
 tldr : i took my wife to see the ant man movie 
 totally forgot she has a morbid fear of ants 
 **edit : ** i woke up this morning with front page of reddit .. thank you all for your kind words and great comments 
 my wife read through this whole thread and had one hell of a laugh and got itchy at the mention of <unk> .. thanks guys .. tifu by letting my wife read the comments on the thread i made for her to those asking <unk> it a good movie 
 i would have to say yes if you enjoyed the <unk> 2 and/or the iron man series it 's in that same sort of comedy style 
 very <unk> today i went to the store to get some <unk> as i 'm trying to eat healthier and needed some fruit in my life 
 on my way out i notice a homeless man sitting by the wall and thought i 'd be generous and throw him an orange so with a weak <unk> throw the orange goes flying through the air and hits him square in the face i quickly find out he 's blind after a lot of apologizing and offer to peel the orange for him 
 tl dr threw an orange at a blind homeless dude you can guess the rest edit : threw to through i suck at spelling edit2 : time to do the holy shit this blew up and rip my inbox edit3 : and i made my username for the <unk> <unk> because i am unoriginal it 's just a <unk> that it matched the story obvious throwaway for this one 
 so i play a game called <unk> : go '' 
 in this game you can <unk> your keys to the different types of grenades for fast access 
 as a result of this and all of the other keys in use all the keys that are available are super uncomfortable as a push to talk 
 then i had a great idea 
 i went on amazon and bought a pedal that i could connect to my pc 
 i could n't find the exact one but this is similar 
 paid extra for overnight <unk> and <unk> 
 i had push to talk bound to the pedal the next day 
 it all felt so natural 
 now i 'm 15 and just recently i got my learners permit to drive on with a parent or <unk> 
 my mom does this thing where she asks me to drive her to places to run errands or buy groceries so i can get a lot of practice in 
 one day she asked me to take her to the local grocery store 
 me being the kid that loves driving i agreed 
 now at this point me pushing down a pedal to talk to someone became complete muscle memory 
 around 2 minutes into the drive we have to stop at a red light 
 my mom starts talking to me about what car i want to get when i turn 16. i opened my mouth and it happened 
 next thing i know the <unk> of the car that i 'm driving is in the bumper of the car in front of me 
 needless to say i wo n't be driving my own car for a while 
 tldr : bound push to talk to a pedal on my pc ended up rear ending a car when trying to talk to my mom in the car 
 i walk into starbucks and take my place at the end of a rather long line 
 i notice in front of me a group of about 10 adult men who have down syndrome who are on a field trip '' and being <unk> by an older woman 
 the woman turns to me and says we are going to be a while why do n't you go in front of our group '' 
 she then loudly announces to her entire group that i will be skipping ahead in line and that it 's ok. i thank her and begin to walk up the side of the line looking at each man in line as i pass to <unk> whether he has down syndrome and continue forward to find where their group ends and my new place in line is 
 i lock eyes with the frontmost man who has down syndrome and slide into line in front of him 
 a few moments later i get a tap on the shoulder and the man i had moments ago locked eyes with begins to explain in a broken defeated voice that he 's not with that group 
 i respond oh i 'm sorry i thought you were ... '' and my voice <unk> off as i realize that i had mistaken this rather <unk> man as having down syndrome and pretty much everyone in starbucks saw it go down 
 he stood there uncomfortably shifting on his feet for a moment and then <unk> it for the door did n't even get his coffee 
 so awkward 
 i ca n't even imagine the damage i did to his self esteem 
 edit 1 : /u/cyae1 has contributed an audio narration of this fuck up edit 2 : i am very happy to announce that all feelings of shame i 've been <unk> today after this incident have been completely erased by <unk> kind <unk> of reddit gold 
 if it is ever possible to <unk> this reddit gold i have every intention of <unk> said <unk> to some retarded charity 
 edit 3 : i originally expressed it as being down syndrome '' 
 lots of people pointed out i should say a person who has down syndrome '' 
 so i fixed that 
 so this happened yesterday 
 i went out to get my hair cut at a local chain store that i go to on a <unk> basis 
 i do n't usually request a specific stylist so i log into the system and take my seat until i 'm called by a girl that i 've never seen before 
 i find out this is actually her 2nd day here 
 i pop a squat in the barber chair and we start to exchange pleasantries 
 she 's quite cute and we are actually hitting it off very well i know it 's her job to be pleasant 
 we talk about common interests an christmas shopping comes up and she mentions how she needed to this job to afford gifts for her family 
 so she finishes my cut and we go back for her to wash my hair 
 this is by far my favorite part of the whole experience 
 getting your hair washed by a cute girl is probably the closest i ever come to feeling like those guys in the movies who have beautiful women feed them grapes 
 idk the <unk> fits in my mind 
 this girl goes all out 
 perfect water temperature massages my <unk> and my neck 
 i 'm sitting here feeling absolutely amazing 
 she finishes up puts some product in my hair and i 'm feeling really good about how i look and feel 
 this girl definitely earned her tip 
 we walk over to the register and i swipe my card and await the <unk> on the screen to add the tip 
 my total comes to $ 16.20 
 $ 5.00 tip is more than fair especially since she went all out with the head massage 
 i punch in my tip amount and immediately hit the confirm button 
 as i wait for my recept i watch the girls eyes get huge and she looks at me in <unk> 
 she run from behind the counter and hugs me 
 i 'm <unk> 
 she starts getting teary eyes and stumbles over herself to say thank you '' over and over 
 i 'm thinkin man it 's just 5 bucks but i wo n't say no to a hug from a cute random girl 
 she hands me my recept and i start to make my way to the door when i realize what had happened 
 when i punched in the 5.00 i accidentally hit the 0 an extra time ... i tipped her $ 50.00 instead of $ 5.00 
 shit 
 at this point i need to make a decision 
 do i wreck this girls day by admitting i made a mistake or do i just eat the $ <unk> hair cut 
 i turn around and take another look at her 
 she 's still so excited looking close to tears 
 she 's probably thinking she 's so lucky that this guy just came in sat in her chair and just helped her make her christmas a little bit better out of the kindness of his heart 
 i look at my recept again and sigh to myself 
 merry christmas '' 
 i turn and leave leaving a little bit of christmas spirit and a nice chunk of my bank account 
 tl dr <unk> tipped my hair dresser $ 50.00 instead of $ 5.00 
 did n't want to ruin her christmas spirit let her keep it 
 edit : i 'm male stylist was female 
 edit2 : holy crap my inbox ... so to clear up a few things 
 i 've always gotten my hair washed after the cut 
 this helps wash away the hair clippings so you 're not itching all day 
 i do my hair stylists a favor by washing my hair before each cut 
 no i did n't shit on her chair 
 i go to a hair <unk> 
 i like it there 
 people are nice and a cut is $ 20 
 $ 16.20 with military discount 
 i find it insane that people drop <unk> every time they get a hair cut but that 's just me : as said above i 'm in the military so i get my hair cut every two weeks 
 thanks for all the kind words and encouragement to attempt to go on a date with this hair dresser ... if i can muster up the courage i might but i do n't know if i want to rock the boat at a place i enjoy getting my hair cut 
 also i 'm less than 8 months from moving not sure if <unk> the time to start a relationship 
 i 'm really glad some people can get a nice story from this and if i changed a few lives because of it that 's all the <unk> i need 
 i just want the world i live in to be a bit better 
 the $ 50 would have gone to buying fallout but i 'll be just fine picking it up after the new year 
 merry christmas ya 'll one more edit i promise 
 thank you all who are offering to purchase fallout for me i really do appreciate the offer but there are plenty of other people who would really benefit from your <unk> more so than me 
 you guys are awesome 
 so as i go to warm up my car this morning my neighbor comes out and asks if i have moment 
 we 're cool with each other so i figure no big deal 
 well he proceeds to inform me that while he 's happy that my husband and i have a great sex life that he would <unk> appreciate if we kept it down in the early evening hours since he had to explain the birds and <unk> to his <unk> last night 
 at this point i 'm confused 
 we did n't have sex last night 
 what is he talking about 
 then it dawns on me ... what they actually heard was us playing mario kart 
 they heard me screaming fuck me '' repeatedly while getting hit with a blue shell just before the finish line along with some other colorful language 
 tl dr my neighbor thinks we have a great sex life i just have a dirty whore mouth while playing mario kart 
 update : i let my husband know what 's up and he just about died of laughter 
 he is working second shift so i went over myself to clear the air 
 explained what happened to my neighbor he got embarassed laughed and said he wished he had thought of that in the moment 
 then he and his daughter could have talked about good <unk> instead 
 his wife is apparently still upset 
 i 've apologized and promised to keep it a bit more <unk> before bedtime 
 thanks for the gold kind stranger 
 edit : my name is n't jenny my number is n't <unk> and i have no need for a zach or mr. x. i am quite happily married to an awesome man 
 edit : my user name is completely irrelevant 
 i did n't make a dummy account because i did n't expect this to be seen by more than a few <unk> i had my first car couple months ago and been driving like an idiot sometimes 
 this morning whilst giving my brother a lift to school i stop at these traffic lights next to me comes a black <unk> and 2 men dressed in <unk> for fun i <unk> my engine and so did they when the light turned green i put my foot down just when i passed <unk> their blue lights come on and they stop me 
 i almost shit myself shaking i open the window and one cop comes up and says <unk> we 'd put our foot down we 'd smoke you and starts laughing whilst walking away 
 never going to drive like an idiot again i <unk> this happened a few years ago but definitely a fuck up 
 in grade school we were pretty messed up and racist kids 
 the mexican kids would always butt heads with the asian kids and that would be settled in soccer games 
 of course during the games obscenities would be thrown around 
 wo n't be forgetting this one anytime soon 
 my opponent yells at me hey i banged your mom last night '' like a typical middle schooler 
 i shout back yeah at least i have a mom '' <unk> 
 next thing i know he 's running off the field with his head in his hands 
 turns out his mom had gotten <unk> last week 
 later that week he <unk> me in the jaw i 'm a single guy and whenever my daughter asks what i want as a present i always say she should bring me back a pretty girlfriend 
 it 's like a running joke with her usual response being she better not be prettier than me '' anyway i was recently really ill with <unk> 
 like the most ill i 've ever been as an adult and after a week of it i decided to go to the docs to get some antibiotics 
 we 're the waiting room of the surgery and daughter is reading through the magazines 
 she 's holding up pictures of different women asking me how bout that one dad 
 or that one or that one '' i 'm like what for '' 
 thinking she means <unk> 
 she comes and whispers in my ear for a new girlfriend '' bless her 
 i tell her magazine people are not real and she needs to find me a real person to be my girlfriend 
 and that i would be really silly if i cut one of them out put it in my pocket and told everyone that she was my girlfriend 
 while we 're having this stupid conversation a large elderly woman shuffles across the waiting room and sits opposite us 
 she remarks about daughter and how cute & amp well <unk> she is ... <unk> looks at her then at me then back at her and says as loud as anything ... you ca n't have her as your girlfriend she eats too much '' 
 ... before i had even processed what she just said the stunned silence was broken by people giggling in the background and the woman just <unk> '' and turned away before i could apologise 
 i did say sorry ... to fucking harvard 
 so i found out i fucked up about an hour ago 
 my mom had to tell me because i 'm such a fucking idiot 
 i was all excited about finishing my application so i sent it to her 
 i 'm applying for a position in this <unk> lab at harvard medical school 
 i spent all weekend and most of today <unk> my cv and cover letter 
 there were some formatting issues i think because of the downloaded font i was using which made the document on my computer look different than the emailed version 
 because of this i did n't see that my highly <unk> stream of consciousness sorta high <unk> from last week rough drafts were still on the page yet to be <unk> kind of rough drafts that you never fucking show <unk> your extremely christian mother and dr. person from harvard medical school 
 but because i 'm an idiot and did n't notice the extra pages at the bottom of my screen dr. person will likely not be choosing me as his next lab technician 
 i 'll post some of the finer points below here in a second 
 **tl dr : sent my dream job 's boss my notes - including science is all around us '' - and other super <unk> shit 
 ** -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- my girlfriend 's favorite bit : my main goal in life is to be <unk> for a long time 
 specifically as a <unk> 
 however the exact place i’ll be working/what i’ll be doing remains to be seen 
 maybe research it like this maybe like that 
 i feel as though i am good at science and want to do science 
 so it seems like a good match '' 
 another : also i know that a lot of the science in the brain is controlled by genes 
 you likes genes 
 so it seems like a good match 
 you should hire me 
 i really want this job 
 i really want to go to <unk> '' 
 fuck me : my time working with dr. advisor has been hella helpful 
 i’ve learned a lot about lab work responsibility integrity <unk> <unk> <unk> growth etc…working with others meeting deadlines…something focus 
 also while working as his lab ta i learned hella shit about helping people 
 i’m super nice wanted to be a teacher and shit 
 plus im fast and i like <unk> 
 and i know lots about <unk> biology information swag 
 also i’m the <unk> vice president of the school neuroscience club '' 
 iv : i am fascinated with understanding higher level cognitive areas in terms of their molecular <unk> – including genetics shit 
 wondering if we gon na need some <unk> neuroscience up in this bitch 
 particularly interested in consciousness and attempting to <unk> it in terms of its molecular circuit <unk> 
 memory language and shit about '' 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - edit : thanks to the person that gave me gold 
 i 'm not sure what to do with it but it makes me feel cool so thanks 
 also i <unk> on my fuck up with dr. person : hello dr. person there seems to be a problem with the previous cover letter i sent you 
 i embarrassingly did not notice that my notes were underneath the <unk> 
 the formatting on my computer looked different than the <unk> i sent you so i did not notice any writing after my intended email 
 i apologize for the profanity and lack of substance 
 please find my cv also attached for convenience 
 my apologies again <unk> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- edit2 : thanks for all of the replies everyone 
 i am glad that a lot of you got a laugh out of my story and am equally glad for all of the helpful advice i 've received <unk> 
 always use fucking times new <unk> always save it as a pdf do n't be a fucking idiot 
 no reply from dr. person yet but he 's probably still busy talking with the dean of scienc about what kind of medal to <unk> me 
 i got ta go ace my scienc <unk> now 
 hope everybody has a good day 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- edit3 : hey interested people i 'm sorry but dr. person has n't responded yet 
 if he does i promise to let you all know 
 in the meantime i 've spent some time updating both my cv and cover letters and have <unk> a lot of the advice i 've <unk> sent that shit out in pdf format and got some standard <unk> fonts up in those <unk> 
 i applied to a couple of positions today and figure that the result has to be more positive than this fuck up 's 
 thank you all for your <unk> even the people that assumed that i 'm not cut out for this field 
 i know i 'm capable of better things but sometimes i just fuck up 
 it 's frustrating and makes me want to cry sometimes 
 but i 'm fucking back baby 
 and this train is on a one-way ticket to downtown <unk> - population : me and gf 
 happy friday everybody 
 i 'll let you know if anything interesting happens 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - edit4 : sorry for the delayed update everyone 
 so much to my surprise i have n't heard back from dr. person yet 
 sorry to disappoint 
 but on the bright side the job was posted again today so i reapplied btw the instructions specifically called for the <unk> to be in word doc form so suck it <unk> 
 i also <unk> made a twitter account a few minutes ago for the <unk> purpose of contacting steve <unk> @ <unk> to see if he could provide some scienc <unk> 
 other than that there 's really nothing interesting to report - got quite a bit of school shit to do and gon na try to coax my dad into giving me beer money for the weekend 
 sorry again for the somewhat <unk> resolution to my fuck up 
 i 'll let you know if things take a turn for the sexier 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- edit5 : <unk> everybody 
 i got a <unk> interview 
 not with dr. person but with someone at at an ivy league school 
 fuckin right 
 i 'll post more details after the interview 
 i do n't want to post any more details right now since the interviewers may use reddit find this and then worry that i 'm a complete fucking idiot half true 
 i also landed a couple of other interviews at less <unk> but still <unk> programs 
 i 'll post more info in the next few weeks 
 thanks for all of the support advice and <unk> about the potential of me being autistic i do n't think i am but i also do n't give a fuck cause my girlfriend is super hot 
 i 'll see you all in scienc haven 
 <unk> decided to go to a yoga class 
 ok. that’s obviously a lie 
 my gf talked me into it 
 she said something about how <unk> is a real turn on or people should be able to touch their toes without sweating and <unk> or some such <unk> 
 in reality i think she just didn’t want to go alone and taking me meant that there was no possible way for her to be the worst one there 
 and i’m obviously too dumb to realize all of this because it all just now occurred to me 
 damn it 
 anyways i went 
 when we arrived i was the only dude there 
 everyone else was in good shape female and wearing all of the yoga <unk> 
 yoga pants <unk> <unk> big shirts that still showed some part of their <unk> tops and bare feet 
 most of them were standing around on one foot with their other foot <unk> to their knees 
 they were probably drinking herbal tea and discussing their upcoming retreat to india 
 they were all <unk> and graceful 
 and then there was me 
 i looked like a guy at a pick-up basketball game that was about to get chosen last 
 i walked over to the lady behind the computer to pay up 
 the computer was playing soft world music 
 i paid my money and was given a yoga mat a towel a foam block a nylon strap thingy and a pillow 
 i was fairly confused by most of these items but i couldn’t help but be a little excited by the pillow and the prospect of a nap 
 when i walked in nearly all of the spots were taken 
 there were two spots together in the far back corner next to the door and the fan 
 perfect for the old cool down and escape routine i was already planning in my head 
 i put down my mat in its little <unk> mat parking spot and i flopped down 
 i left my brick nylon strap and pillow behind me 
 i kept my towel close by 
 when the instructor came in and sat down everyone got quiet 
 she spoke in a soft pleasant voice 
 she used words like energy spirit awakening inner and good morning 
 the first thing she had us do was make a <unk> hang loose hand gesture and then hold our noses between our thumbs and <unk> 
 then we were to alternate <unk> and take deep breaths in and out of one nostril then plugging it and breathing in and out of the other one 
 despite having a little cramp in my hand i’d give myself a solid <unk> for nostril plug breathing pose 
 after making sure that we got all of the snot out of our noses i’m guessing that’s what it was for we were told to get on all fours 
 once we were all into mount me pose we were to alternate between cow pose and cat pose 
 cow pose means you put your chest and belly down 
 being of a certain body type and having gravity on my side this particular pose was no problem 
 although the term cow pose does seem a bit mean 
 cat pose is where you arch your back straight up like a cat stretching in the morning <unk> 
 <unk> between these two poses made me look like a giant sweaty <unk> cat 
 i’d give myself a <unk> for yaking kitty flow 
 after yaking kitty flow we moved into child’s pose 
 having taught children for years now i’d say that this name is severely <unk> 
 child’s pose should either be having your hand out asking for candy pointing across the room because another kid did some stupid shit or <unk> around holding your crotch 
 this particular pose looked like a slave <unk> to their <unk> in old films about <unk> 
 we were told that if we ever need to take a break or if anything becomes too tough then we could always revert back to <unk> slave pose 
 this part worried me a bit since this pose wasn’t particularly comfortable 
 you are supposed to have your arms stretched out in front of you praying to the <unk> ra while also placing your ass on the heels of your feet 
 but for some reason when i try to sit on my heels it’s like i have a <unk> preventing me from going the rest of the way down 
 apparently my muscles are pretty stubborn 
 so after the 4th attempt of bouncing my ass at my heels and nearly <unk> forward head first into the lady in front of me i just accepted my version of egyptian slave with a floaty ass pose 
 next we did a plank 
 this is the top of a push up that you just hold for about forever and a day 
 once your arms start to <unk> pretty hard then you get to pick up one of your feet and point it straight up in the air at the ceiling 
 this is pretty smart because then your body doesn’t know which pain to focus on so you just <unk> in on not drooling all over yourself 
 once you feel like jelly you get to swing your leg that’s supposed to be <unk> positioned at 12 o’clock but in all actually is chillin more towards a shaky <unk> all the way up to you chest and place your foot in between your hands 
 having lost all feeling in my leg i let it swing freely 
 my knee struck me in the chest and my foot landed on my hand but my arms were thankful for the extra support of holding up my <unk> torso 
 from here you get to stand up in warrior 1 pose 
 you pretty much stand like <unk> holding up <unk> for all the animals in the lion king to see 
 from there you do a little <unk> and change to warrior 2 pose 
 this one makes you look like you are surfing a huge wave 
 you put both arms out and pop a super hard gangster lean to one side 
 you’ll know you are doing it right when it feels like your leg is being slowly <unk> off at the hip joint 
 your arms are also supposed to be stretched out and strongly <unk> at 3 and 9 o’clock 
 but that shit hurts 
 when was the last time you held your arms up longer than the few seconds it takes to get something off of a high shelf or display your enjoyment when going on a roller coaster 
 so after every few seconds i kept pretending like i had different itches all over so i could release the tension from my arms 
 i also wondered how many people would notice if i just dropped down to egyptian slave with a floaty ass pose 
 then we <unk> things down a bit 
 we laid down and just stretched our hand above our heads in <unk> <unk> behind me and i can almost get <unk> pose 
 after this we were told to hug our knees and rock back and forth 
 this one was my favorite because after all this punishment there wasn’t anything i wanted more than to get into the fetal position and rock back and forth 
 now that we were good and warmed up we started doing our <unk> sausage flow i may have <unk> her 
 this is where you stand up 
 a+ 
 then you touch your toes upper <unk> 
 <unk> 
 then you <unk> down to a <unk> plank 
 <unk> 
 then you do this sort of circular push up that ends with your head up and your <unk> <unk> forward like the little <unk> coming out of the ocean 
 it felt like a lap dance <unk> 
 then you stick your butt up in the air while on all fours then sensually rise up 
 then you just rinse and repeat 
 i’ll be honest i felt a bit like magic mike with a hard emphasis on the <unk> 
 the next thing we did was cross our feet and and touch our toes knees 
 at this point the gf assisted me by giving me my foam block 
 i would’ve <unk> it be about 2 feet taller but it did help quite a bit 
 this was the point that i started to notice how much i smelled 
 and despite being super happy to be right in front of the fan i also happened to realize that it was doing very little to keep me cooler while simultaneously wafting my stench through the whole studio 
 being super nice yoga <unk> they only gagged slightly 
 if anything it’ll prepare them for their indian retreats 
 after that we were told to get on our <unk> 
 <unk> that one 
 then we were asked to bend our legs and grab our ankles from behind 
 in my younger days we called this a flying squirrel 
 we would do this off the <unk> board all the time 
 apparently time has not been friendly to my joints 
 try as i might i was unable to grasp both of my ankles 
 i got one of them once but the little bastard slipped out of my sweaty hand as i <unk> at the other one 
 this is when the instructor came over grabbed my nylon strap and put me into <unk> pose 
 fucking embarrassing 
 it was like sitting on an airplane struggling to <unk> your seat belt and then having everyone watch as the stewardess brings your fat ass the seat belt extender 
 since i was all tangled up i was unable to just give up and enter egyptian slave with a floaty ass pose 
 i just had to fight through the pain 
 after that we were told to get the pillow out 
 finally nap time 
 but instead we were instructed to put it behind our butts and lift our legs straight up in the air 
 determined not to get strapped up again i fucking killed it 
 my legs were straight as <unk> for like a minute 
 let’s be real though they would drop considerably whenever the instructor wasn’t looking 
 but they were straight as shit when she was 
 after a whopping 75 minutes of <unk> pain we were finally able to quit 
 at the end everyone was given time to sit quietly and reflect 
 at the end of <unk> time or as i like to call it <unk> that i’ll never fucking do this bullshit <unk> time everybody did an asian hand <unk> motion and said the name of their favorite indian restaurant 
 i tucked my tail firmly between my legs and got the fuck outta dodge 
 yoga is not for everybody 
 <unk> <unk> up a yoga studio and got <unk> by my instructor for sucking at life 
 edit- whoa 
 thanks for the gold <unk> 
 that 's <unk> 
 i feel like <unk> <unk> 
 my wife and i have a 3 year old son who we love dearly 
 we often talk about how cool it would be if he were a twin 
 then we could have two of them 
 so i offhandedly told her that in a <unk> universe it’s likely we have died and our son is alive 
 if we could just figure out a way to get him from his universe to ours everyone wins 
 she’s been crying for two hours now over our <unk> son in another universe 
 and i haven’t even told her yet that <unk> can be gay 
 edit : alright alright 
 i get it 
 i need to watch <unk> 's been a long time since i 've been laid 
 like going on 12 months 
 lots of overtime not much money depression excuses <unk> 
 so i decide that i need to end the <unk> by any means <unk> 
 after some escort browsing which is a lot like looking through a <unk> turns out i pick one that does <unk> 
 i spend the next few hours cleaning up and start messaging 
 i put down a fake name and use a throwaway email generator 
 i use the name dan 
 turns out dan is also my upstairs neighbour 's name 
 i give specific instructions to text me when she gets here and to go to the side door 
 i hear a lot of door bells and people arriving turns out the folks upstairs are having a party 
 then i hear a lot of confused talking 
 then shouting 
 turns out the escort slipped in with them and was trying to flirt with dan 
 unlike me who was slipping into absolutely nothing 
 tl dr ca n't even get laid by paying for it 
 accidentally sent an escort to a married man 's dinner <unk> i had this idea to make an old school adventure game using the directory system on my computer 
 every decision you could make would be a different folder and each folder would then contain a few more folders to choose from 
 of course this meant making thousands of folders many of which would be <unk> and so i decided that the best way to make it would be by writing a brief little program 
 my proof of concept was a hedge maze without any decisions at each step besides north east south and west before i did that though i wanted to check that my code for making a large nested directory tree worked and so i wrote up my program 
 and then i <unk> it 
 and ran it 
 <unk> was only a few seconds into creating his hedge maze when i had the horrifying realization that i had told my computer to make a directory tree with a depth of 100 and was thus on my way to creating 4^100 nested folders 
 i immediately reset my computer but by the time i had <unk> it up again there were <unk> folders on my desktop 
 shift-del gave an <unk> time of 12 days to delete the thing so i just made sure it was n't being <unk> by the computer and set it as an operating system file so i 'll never have to see it again 
 nobody will ever know 
 but *i* know 
 i know that somewhere hidden on my desktop there are millions and millions of empty folders 
 : **edit 4 : ** thank you everyone who made suggestions on how to fix my ridiculous problem 
 the one that finally did the trick was cd blank <unk> blank hedge maze '' <unk> & gt <unk> which fixed everything in a mere five or so hours 
 i 've also edited my previous edit to say where my background 's from and give a <unk> version 
 thanks all 
 you make my mistakes a joy **edit 3 : ** here 's my wallpaper which is originally from the sega game streets of rage 
 **edit 2 : ** yes i tried <unk> /s <unk> and not just shift-del 
 the reason why i decided just to hide them all was because that was also taking a kind of preposterous amount of time 
 then again i have the patience of a <unk> so who knows ... **edit : ** proof 
 well kinda 
 my earlier attempts to delete got rid of around a million files so i guess you 'll just have to take it on faith that there were <unk> million and not just 32 
 <unk> : ** use at your own <unk> import <unk> import <unk> import <unk> import <unk> public class <unk> { final static list & lt string & gt compass = new <unk> & lt & gt <unk> n '' '' e '' '' s '' '' w '' public static void main string <unk> { file root = new file c : <unk> ... <unk> maze '' gogogo <unk> } public static void gogogo file root int depth { if depth == 0 return for string s : compass { file subdir = new file root s <unk> gogogo subdir <unk> } } } got back home in the early hours of the morning with no key 
 i live in a <unk> house and so usually use the back door as an entrance 
 so i went around the front of the house and proceeded to lift open a grate which i thought would lead into my basement 
 i opened the grate and slid through this really tight <unk> hole 
 got covered in cobwebs the lot 
 when my feet touched the ground i could n't see a thing 
 pitch black 
 i then stumbled into something metallic like a drum kit 
 i turned my phone light on 
 i do n't own a drum kit 
 shit this is n't my house 
 at that moment my next door neighbour comes running into his basement with a baseball bat ready to knock me the fuck out 
 the lights switched on and i 'm just stood there with the most sorry look on my face 
 he laughed it off in the end but i still felt like such an idiot 
 i am a travel <unk> 
 i just started my new shift at a hospital in texas 
 in the nurses station there is this grey button on the wall that kind of resembles a garage door opener 
 i asked a few nurses what the button was for and no one seemed to know 
 naturally i pushed it 
 nothing happened 
 no lights came off or on no secret doors opened up 
 i pushed it a couple of times really fast thinking something might happen still nothing 
 so i go and sit down to continue <unk> 
 within a minute four security guards came running one from each entrance 
 they were all sweaty and out of <unk> with panicked expressions on their faces 
 turns out that is the button you push when someone has a gun or bomb 
 you 'd think they would 've mentioned this in orientation 
 this happened about 5 years ago while on a family vacation in mexico 
 we were looking for things to do and my dad says he 'll buy my brother and i a snorkeling trip for the next day 
 we agreed had dinner then me and my bro go to the bar at our <unk> for some drinks 
 my dad <unk> us not to get too wasted because the snorkeling trip is booked for 8am 
 whatever dad 
 we get to the bar meet some girls one thing leads to another and i get absolutely hammered off tequila shots 
 blackout 
 wake up to my dad knocking on the door pissed off saying to get the fuck out on the boat 
 here 's where the story begins 
 the rocking boat scorching sun and cheap tequila hangover were bad enough then about two hours in i get the urge to explosively shit my shorts 
 no bathroom 
 i did n't want to move but i decided taking a good ole fashion <unk> is better than shitting on the deck 
 i grab some goggles get in the water and swim away from the group of people 
 i figure i 'm a good distance away dive down a little pull my shorts down and let loose 
 this was some next level shit 
 there 's shit floating all around me and <unk> when i realize that fish fucking love shit 
 tons of fish start <unk> at it and at this point some of the snorkelers are heading over since there 's so many fish 
 i panic because i 'm surrounded by my own feces so i just start <unk> the floating turds trying to break them up 
 this causes more fish to come and more snorkelers as well 
 before i know it i 'm surrounded by fish and snorkelers ... and we are all swimming in my shit 
 in the end i 'm not sure if anyone noticed my shit floating around but it was still embarrassing as hell 
 tl dr got wasted went snorkeling hung over explosively shit in the ocean causing fish and snorkelers to swim in it 
 edit : i realize all tequila is mexican i just meant local <unk> tequila for sure not for <unk> 
 edit : since a lot of people are seeing this post go <unk> go 
 <unk> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- disclaimer : this fuck up happened back in november on my brothers birthday 
 me and my older brother live in an apartment together in toronto 
 his wife goes to college in new york 
 it 's not too far of a drive but definitely not close enough to travel to often 
 because of this he does n't see her in person very often but they skype each other for hours every night 
 in november it was my brothers birthday and his wife decided to take a week off school to come visit and celebrate his birthday with him 
 a couple days before his birthday my brother told me to go stay with a friend for the day because he wanted to <unk> the day to just chilling '' with his wife 
 fair enough 
 i planned with a friend to stay with him for a couple days 
 on the morning of his birthday while he was still asleep so i left him a little birthday present 
 we have a board in the kitchen where we pin stuff like bills so i left him a note that said happy birthday big bro have fun '' and i also pinned a condom and a $ 50 bill to the board 
 and as a joke put 3 thumbtacks through the condom 
 my brothers a smart dude so i figured he would see the condom has 3 thumbtacks laugh and throw it away 
 i thought wrong 
 i leave for my friends house and everything goes as normal 
 i sleep over at my friends come back home a couple days later and celebrate my brothers birth week 
 a little over a month later on christmas day my parents are over and my brother makes an announcement 
 he tells us all that he is moving to buffalo to live with his wife who is now pregnant 
 knowing my brother i knew that he did n't want to have kids until he was at least 40 so after the announcement i pull him aside to congratulate him and ask for details 
 he tells me that the baby was n't planned and that when he had sex with his wife on his birthday the condom broke 
 i explain the whole thing to him and to my surprise he actually laughed 
 he was n't angry at all 
 after finding out his wife was pregnant he realized that deep down he really wanted a kid and did n't realize it 
 now his wife has a baby on the way he is moving to new york next month and i got ta find a new roommate to help pay rent 
 tl : dr <unk> my bro a condom that was <unk> <unk> he 's moving to the big <unk> since buffalo is n't the big city here 's a more accurate tl : dr gave a broken condom to my bro now he 's gon na move to buffalo obligatory happened a few years back when i was a kid after a long long flight through a few connections from <unk> my dad wakes me up telling me that the plane has landed and we take our things from the overhead compartment and wait for the signal that it is safe to leave the plane 
 the signal is given and we start leaving the plane to enter jfk and head to the security point to stamp our passports 
 everything goes well and after a few questions that the <unk> officer had asked my dad his passport was <unk> 
 the officer opens my passport and looks at me with a nice smile and says hey there ... la ... <unk> ... <unk> 
 what brings you to the states 
 with a big grin on my face i say i come with dad '' and he replies and what is he here for '' 
 and the most fucked up thing ever come out of my mouth 
 having english as my second language made me go with he is a terrorist '' with the grin going from ear to ear from the excitement that am speaking english to a native speaker 
 well what i meant to say if you did n't already get it is tourist '' ... from there on there was no more grin 
 we get pulled into seperate rooms and i get asked a series of questions 
 i kept using the word terrorist and it did n't help at all 
 someone who speaks arabic was brought and asked me what i meant when i called him that and i explained in arabic 
 he then laughed and the officer in the room looked at him <unk> 
 when he told the officer about the misunderstanding he laughed too 
 i get <unk> with my father after a while and he told me not to speak english until i learned it properly 
 tl dr : called my dad a terrorist instead of a tourist 
 got pulled by airport security <unk> we were the go boom '' <unk> 'll try to make this quick 
 basically i met this girl from tinder at a bar last night 
 we had great chemistry and ended up staying at the bar until close 
 during the date i asked if she had met up with other guys from tinder and how those previous dates went 
 she explained how during her last tinder date after a couple of drinks the guy asked her to come back to his apartment 
 she said no she was n't like that 
 the guy then proceeded to convince her that that 's not how tinder dates work '' 
 long story short she ended up leaving and did n't talk to him again 
 now i found this hilarious so throughout the rest of the night anytime she said no to any of my questions i would respond with <unk> that 's not how tinder dates work 
 ** '' me : you should buy me a drink '' 
 her : you should be buying me a drink '' 
 me : but that 's not how tinder dates work '' 
 me : want to play pool '' 
 her : no i 'm not very good '' 
 me : but that 's not how tinder dates work '' 
 me : want to take another shot '' 
 her : no i have work tomorrow '' 
 me : but that 's not how tinder dates work '' 
 you get the idea 
 anyways we both found this to be very funny and an easy way to lighten the conversation 
 it was all in good fun 
 so here 's the fuck up part : at the end of the night somehow we ended up going back to my place and getting in bed together 
 after some kissing play she took off my pants and started sucking my dick 
 after a minute of this i could n't resists myself and in one of my <unk> voices i said **now this is how tinder dates work 
 ** '' at first she started with somewhat loud <unk> nervous laughter 
 but then she stopped and could n't believe what i just said 
 and then it had killed the mood so much that she ended up putting her top back on and decided to quickly leave 
 leaving me laying in bed naked with a <unk> thinking about how badly i just fucked that <unk> yesterday 
 i could n't sleep so i wanted to kill some time on chatroulette 
 i met this cute girl from <unk> she was white but i did n't think about it 
 she could 've moved there later or something right 
 and one thing lead to another and she 's masturbating on <unk> on skype 
 she says that if i do n't show my dick she will delete me 
 i was just starting to get horny so why not 
 but i was smart enough to not have my face and dick in the picture at the same time 
 she lost the connection and logged on again 
 the first thing she does is send me a link to a youtube video 
 if you did n't guess it already the video was first me on webcam with my face and then me showing my dick 
 the title of the video was my full name with my facebook link in the description 
 if i do n't give her '' 630 usd she will send the video to all my friends and she listed up some of my friends on my facebook <unk> 
 since i 'm panicking i get my card and empty my savings just to please him 
 he ended up deleting the video but he wanted more 
 that 's when i blocked him and he stopped 
 the video is not online now at least not with my full name 
 **tl dr showed my dick on chatroulette and got <unk> for 630 usd** edit : i see a lot of the same questions asked over so i thought i 'd add an faq 
 <unk> exactly 630 usd and not a round number 
 * it was a round number in the original currency but i converted it to usd since most people here are from the states and/or knows how much a dollar is worth 
 *you actually paid the guy 
 fucking <unk> i was in panic a lot of you would 've done the same thing 
 he did n't give me a lot of time so i did n't have time enough to think 
 **i see a lot of good posts here and good answers to what i should do 
 i 've done everything i should to prevent the hacker '' from doing anything more 
 and you guys really helped me calm down and as you say the worst that 'll happen is that some of my friends and family sees it 
 they 'll forget about it sooner or later and after a few months it 'll only be a joke to us 
 but that would probably make it easier to track the guy too and i think he 's in way deeper shit than i am then 
 thanks so much for your help 
 **so this actually happened a few years ago but i want to share it any way 
 kinda long sorry 
 when i was in high school i took a class on graphic design <unk> and we used the computers in the school which always had the default school image loaded with a shitty green background not much on the <unk> side of things 
 so everyday when i would log on i would change the wallpaper to get the creative juices flowing and since im a fan of <unk> who isnt 
 i decided to set it to a picture of a sloth sloth pic i used all good i get my work done log off and i leave a happy man 
 until about 2 hours later when 2 of the vice principals vp1 vp2 pull me out of my shop class and bring me to the office 
 i was asking what this was all about but they would n't say 
 so i 'm sitting in a chair in the back room in the office when my graphic design teacher walks in along with a police officer and the 2 vice principals from before 
 at this point im thinking shit shit shit 
 the fuck did i do now 
 i 'm sweating and i look nervous as fuck because who would n't be 
 after a what seemed like forever of them just staring at me vp1 asks in a very angry tone so you like <unk> '' 
 and vp2 says because we do n't 
 now at this point i 'm confused as all fuck i have no clue what they are talking about 
 im just sitting there staring at them with this blank look on my face 
 my graphic design teacher was looking at me with probably the most disappointed look i have ever seen 
 i tell them i have no idea what they are talking about but they clearly didnt believe me because they started telling me that i could be expelled for this and that i sent a girl student home in tears 
 they tell me that this kind of sexist behavior will not be <unk> and that i should be in <unk> 
 i finally start to clue in as to what they are talking about and i ask them if this is all about the wallpaper i set this morning 
 they tell me yes and that this is very serious 
 i try to explain my self to these people but they are n't really believing me so i convinced them to show me this in person 
 we take a walk down to the class which was empty at the time i log onto the computer and lo and behold there is my beautiful screen <unk> but because of the size of monitor it had been <unk> 
 this is what the wallpaper looked like i actually start dying of <unk> partly because of relief but mostly because i realized their fuckup 
 they thought that the shoulder of the girl in the picture was a actually a <unk> <unk> area and that the sloth was a beaver since beaver can be used as slang for pussy 
 and when i logged out since the machine was not shut down the background remained for the next user who happened to be a very sensitive girl i guess 
 she was so offended that the police were called a little extreme if you ask me 
 so im sitting there explaining my self and almost dying of laughter and i made sure to show them the full image 
 vp1 sighed and <unk> and vp2 muttered i dont have time for this crap '' and walked out 
 i basically just got a stern talking to by my graphic design teacher about improper use of school computers and the whole thing was let go 
 i still laugh at this to this day 
 tl dr i set my wallpaper to a sloth but teacher thought it was a <unk> picture 
 almost got expelled when i was just trying to be creative 
 edit : thanks for the gold 
 & lt <unk> not actually today but recent enough my son now 3 then 2 and i went to play in the square had our usual jolly old run-around and all round fun time right up until he climbed down into a ditch and then asked me to lift him out 
 no problem i thought as i reached down took hold of his wrists and lifted him carefully in much the same way as i 've seen a thousand parents lift a thousand kids in the past the only problem being that for some reason i fucked it up and the next thing he was screaming like he had a broken arm 
 horrified at hurting my child i balled him up in my arms and carried him straight home apologizing all the way and <unk> him that daddy loved him and did n't mean to hurt him 
 turned out to be a <unk> no biggy but it was a shock nonetheless 
 anyway cut to later that night and the discovery that a child of two is more than capable of holding a grudge and being a <unk> little bastard because no sooner had i switched off the light and <unk> my head on the pillow lying peacefully on my side with my wife and son tucked up <unk> behind me than i felt someone move and realized my son was standing over me 
 i turned my head and in the half light could barely make out his eyes cold and without feeling 
 he opened his jammies and i had just enough time to cry out in horror no '' 
 before he whipped out his <unk> took a very <unk> aim and pissed all over my head 
 he 'd never done any such thing before and he 's never done any such thing since 
 it was revenge plain and simple 
 and it was a dish served ... <unk> 'm looking after my sister 's house for a few days while she 's away 
 been here a couple of days and i 'm settled in 
 it 's nice and sunny outside so i decide take the dog on a bit of a <unk> 
 it was lovely 
 sun beating down bluebells in the woods <unk> birds - it was a proper walk in the <unk> 
 happy days 
 got home and i 'm a bit sweaty balls are sticking to my leg so obviously i need to jump in the shower 
 ahh a nice relaxing shower '' i think to myself as i soap up and feel the hot blast of water <unk> over my shoulders 
 bliss 
 then i hear the dog going crazy downstairs barking and jumping around 
 so i jump out of the shower and open the window to see what he 's barking at 
 shit it 's a <unk> 
 i completely forgot my sister told me she had some parcels coming 
 i quickly wrap a towel around my waist run downstairs and head for the door 
 the delivery guy spots me through the glass and waits as i calm the dog down and tell him to sit 
 good dog 
 i open the door a crack and the dog gets a bit <unk> 
 stay '' 
 i tell him and he <unk> 
 good boy 
 your training is going well 
 you deserve a biscuit 
 i open the door to deal with the delivery 
 the guy hands me a parcel taps his touchpad a couple of times and gives it to me to sign 
 i stuff the parcel under one arm take the touchpad and look for where i need to sign 
 then i hear a woman talking 
 then a little girl 
 it 's the neighbour from a couple of doors down pushing her baby 's <unk> up the street and talking to her i 'm guessing 5 year-old daughter who occasionally plays in the garden with the pup 
 the dog hears his little friend and makes a bolt for the door 
 but i 'm too quick for him 
 i put my leg out to block his way 
 little shit <unk> his shoulders and rushes between my legs catching my towel over his head and ripping it away from my waist 
 so i 'm standing there bollock naked touchpad in one hand parcel under one arm my junk <unk> in the summer sun shouting for the dog to stop while my brain is trying to work out what the fuck is going on 
 too many things happening at once 
 confusion intensifies 
 delivery bloke bursts out laughing neighbour 's eyes lock onto my man parts jaw drops and she <unk> to cover her little girl 's eyes who 's standing there staring at my sausage with a look of utter <unk> on her face 
 i quickly drop the touchpad over the offending appendage shuffle backwards into the house pull the door to and gather myself as best i can 
 delivery guy who 's now in tears hands me the towel through the crack in the door and i cover myself 
 i sign with a x shout the bloody dog back inside look up and lock eyes with the neighbour again as i <unk> slink back into the living room 
 then i sit holding my head in my hands for about 20 minutes 
 but here 's the kicker 
 i opened the parcel to check everything is ok with the order arse 
 tl dr i answered the door in a towel and now i 'm probably a sex offender 
 plus irony is a bitch 
 <unk> edit : reddit gold 
 thank you <unk> for making this pill a little easier to swallow : edit 2 : yes i 'm a guy hopefully that 's now made clear in the second <unk> edit 3 : bluebells <unk> 
 <unk> 
 honestly you guys have sex on the brain 
 so i took the time to prepare a romantic <unk> place 
 it was beautiful with <unk> balloons red and white <unk> everywhere candles everywhere made her favorite meal made a <unk> with our favorite songs ... anything a girl wants in a relationship right 
 even though not all girls - hold on it was soo romantic spent half of my paycheck to rent the place and prep everything 
 i was so excited to see her reaction and my heart was going wild 
 it is my first time ever doing this so i did my best but it was all damn beautiful 
 so she gets led to the place by her sister she lied to her that there was bday party of another friend of her 
 she arrived read the card i prepared and she had <unk> eyes 
 then the door opened she saw me in the candle lit room with my <unk> - romantic as fuck - music was playing i invited her for a dance 
 she was really happy 
 everything went as planned ... dinner dance music ... she was excited and happy did n't know what to say etc 
 then i proposed and she said yes 
 but wait there 's obviously more 
 since you know she is a women and comes from another planet 
 the next day she said she was not happy with the way i proposed a romantic night with each other is what she apparently did n't want 
 she wanted me to call her friends and surprise her with them 
 we argued a lot she appreciated my efforts but did n't like it all 
 and i said that she apparently loves her friends more than me she said that it is n't true but it came out like that 
 she said i was being selfish by doing it my way '' and not how she imagined it 
 tl dr : apparently you should propose the way the girl wants it : edit : i took the night off to consider stuff 
 feeling heartbroken atm ... didnt sleep at all and got ta go to work 
 feeling shitty atm 
 oh and this girl is someone i knew a long time same neighborhood etc 
 she was a good <unk> we hung out a lot 
 this reaction of her was a complete other side of her <unk> we knew each other very good ... apparently not 
 most of our common friends took my side ... update : she isnt a redditor but <unk> she got linked this thread and said she didnt know she hurt my feelings 
 like ... seriously ... being a man doesnt come with feelings 
 got ta rethink all of this ... thanks for support guys and girls : the reality <unk> are right 
 i am gon na talk about this with her 
 <unk> : she sent me my favorite pizza to my work 
 i am in a <unk> atm 
 i will eat the pizza but wont return her calls/messages ... <unk> : a girlfriend of hers called me and said she wanted to be surprised in front of her friends 
 apparently a few friends of her got a proposal akin to that ... and my gf wanted the same ... and no she did n't mention it once that she wanted one like that and she knows i am more a romantic guy that likes to be alone with her because of intimacy ... she said it was n't a proposal she dreamt of and that i do n't respect her dreams and/or wishes and that i am selfish ... well this is from her friend ... i 'm gon na leave work in a couple of hours ... i will talk about this with her no need to run away atm tho <unk> : she just <unk> to me holy shit 
 <unk> was waiting for me at home and she made it all romantic and shit she cried when i arrived apologized and said if i wanted to marry her 
 ** **i am feeling strange things <unk> **i said no i am not ready yet i need time to truly understand you** she said ok '' and went to bed 
 hold me reddit i 'm on a strange roller coaster <unk> : we had a serious conversation 
 instead of hurting each other we had a good breakfast talk 
 she said it was the first time someone proposed to her ... it was <unk> first time too 
 <unk> <unk> it was a <unk> and a shock for her 
 i told her i was the one that got hurt a lot 
 we are still together 
 we are trying to fix things our way ... .so like a lot of people on tifu this fuck up did not happen to me today rather it happened quite a long time ago when i was eleven 
 i was a nerdy kid and in my first year of middle school i got picked on 
 nothing too crazy but it <unk> my self esteem for sure 
 what made matters worse for me was this girl in my year lets call her beth had a crush on me 
 beth was a little off more than a little off really and she was very vocal and persistent about her feelings for me 
 i really wanted her to stop but eleven year old me could n't muster up the courage to just tell her that all i wanted was for her to leave me alone 
 i tried to drop hints be <unk> shitty to her avoid her at all costs but she was not picking up what i was laying down 
 well one day me and beth are in the first period math we share together 
 beth 's sitting next to me and i 'm doing my best to ignore her and do my math homework 
 beth <unk> by this reaches over and starts tugging on my <unk> pencil 
 now it 's early i 'm not a morning person and i 'm pretty done with beth 's shit so i start trying to yank the pencil out of beth 's grasp 
 remember how i said beth was persistent 
 she refuses to lose this tug of war and we start yanking this pencil back and forth until i decide to just ... let go 
 big mistake 
 beth stab 's herself right in the goddamn face the eyebrow to be specific 
 the blood came pretty quick and beth starts screaming he stabbed me '' 
 the teacher comes over <unk> beth to the nurses office and tells me to stay right there '' 
 the <unk> five minutes between the teachers <unk> and return were some of the worst of my young life 
 the whole class is whispering and pointing and laughing 
 all i can think is about my <unk> reaction when he gets word that i stabbed a girl in the face and how no one is going to buy that i only kinda sorta stabbed her 
 the teacher returns and begins to write the <unk> looking referral i 've ever seen in my entire life when another teacher enters the room and tells her to turn on the <unk> 
 the first plane had hit the towers the <unk> are saying it must have been an accident and then boom the second plane hits 
 it 's 9 fucking 11. i 'll be honest i thought oh good '' 
 they forgot all about me 
 i did n't even get a referral 
 tl dr <unk> stabbed a girl in the face saved from punishment by <unk> bin <unk> edit- wow this blew up 
 a few things i wanted to address 
 first thank you for the gold kind stranger ... i will spend it on drugs 
 second to the people asking if i ever saw beth again the answer is yes 
 i never saw her again in middle school but two years ago i was working at a pizza joint 
 i come in from a delivery and i sign in at the computer and on the list of drivers names is beth 
 i look around and there at the cut table is a girl who looks very familiar staring at me 
 i dip the fuck out and manage to avoid her for roughly a week until she finally corners me 
 do you remember me '' 
 she asks yes oh my god i am so sorry '' i reply 
 they forgot all about me '' she says they left me alone in the nurses office for hours 
 i still have a scar on my eyebrow '' 
 i apologize again she <unk> me then two days later breaks her arm in a car accident 
 finally to all those asking if this is fake allow me to respond i originally posted this story thursday night but eventually ran into rule 11. so before i give an update here’s the original story 
 i’m not unable to sleep and typing on an ipad anymore so i took the time to clean up what had been a stream of consciousness 
 people complained about my use of first <unk> rather than <unk> so i fixed that a is now angie <unk> = heather l = lena if anyone wouldn’t have picked up on that 
 edit : i 've been narrated 
 big thanks to /u/cyae1 original story christmas night : this tifu is still developing but requires a little backstory first 
 i 've been working at my company for the past year it 's my first job out of college 
 additionally my office is blessed with a surprisingly high number of attractive women for a tech company most of them were business <unk> but i’ll take it 
 i 've become very close friends with one of them angie 
 it took me less than a month of working with angie before i was convinced she was the girl of my dreams 
 being the new guy and having to directly work with her daily i never tried to be more than friends in fear of the situation if she said no 
 she moved to a different team in june so we rarely see each other during work anymore 
 angie got engaged in july 
 when discussing it with her i made a comment to the extent of i 'm happy for you but sad that we never got to try <unk> '' 
 i was drunk and knew it was a fuck up immediately but i was glad to have it off my chest 
 we did n't talk for a few days and then i got a text inviting me out for drinks like a normal friday night and both went on like i never said it 
 fast forward to october and she catches her fiancé with an ex 
 angie is no longer engaged 
 she came to me crying and we just sat on my porch drinking for the night 
 she tells me she is done dating for a while 
 i recognized then that i loved her as my best friend and just held her for a few hours 
 we started spending a lot more time together but it was always just as friends 
 so that sets up my relationship with angie 
 other coworkers you need to know : heather and lena 
 <unk> been best friends since college and angie has kind of joined their little circle 
 both of them are attractive but i 've spent the past year unable to get angie out of my mind i 'm forever the romantic fuck me 
 i’m <unk> with them to the extent that they go out drinking with angie and me regularly but i don’t really talk to them much during the week 
 now for our company 's holiday party on december 6th 
 my company is a work hard party harder company 
 the amount of alcohol we drink is insane for the corporate world with over 2000 drinks served for <unk> people before the after-party 
 i went alone to the party and so did angie 
 we got drinking and midway through the party she gives me a quick kiss in front of heather and lena 
 the kiss throws me completely off as i 'm now wrestling with feelings i thought i had <unk> while being afraid of taking advantage of her since she was still upset about the breakup 
 the <unk> starts giggling and i’m thinking that that kiss might just be something heather and lena tease me about on monday 
 the night continues and the four of us share a cab to the after-party 
 angie sits on my lap for the cab ride and kisses me again 
 i was hard under her leg for the rest of the ride and only got a couple winks from her as acknowledgement of it 
 getting out of the cab angie whispers in my ear neither of us are going home alone tonight but first we party '' 
 my three companions all go towards the restroom and i make a <unk> for the open bar and swap over to vodka red bull to <unk> <unk> left of my inhibitions i 'm going home with the girl of my dreams tonight 
 oh how i wish we had just dropped off heather and lena and gone to my place then 
 with a few vodka red <unk> and angie’s comment <unk> in my mind they were able to coax me onto the dance floor 
 i know i ca n't dance so i actively avoid the dance floor 
 apparently i could dance that night though 
 spending the time on the dance floor allowed me to sober up enough to realize lena is dancing on me almost as much as angie 
 i decided to stop drinking then so that a i could remember everything from this night and b i was n't going to <unk> for angie 
 if only i had kept drinking 
 getting a straight red bull from the bar when i go to grab the girls more i returned to the dance floor to see them dancing together in a way that i will never be able to want to forget 
 i step back and watch for a few minutes 
 oh how i wish i had rushed back out there with their drinks 
 while watching i see heather kiss lena 
 i knew heather was bi but i never thought about lena 
 heather then kisses angie and i damn near dropped the drinks 
 i believe i operated with a low blood supply for organs above my belt for the rest of the night 
 when i get to them with their drinks heather <unk> hers and kisses me 
 i thought it was going to ruin everything between me and angie until angie ran her hand across my arm and i saw she did n't object 
 i 'm now convinced i 'll never have a better night than tonight 
 i pull away and suggest to angie we say our goodbyes meet outside and head back to my place 
 i knew what i was hoping for but only expected angie to join me 
 my life would be so much easier if i did not get what i had been hoping for 
 i say goodbye to a few important people and head outside to hail a cab 
 angie is standing there with heather and winks at me again right before lena grabs my ass and joins us 
 i get us a cab and again angie is in my lap 
 i get more than a wink this time as she would n't sit still and was effectively giving me a lap dance for the short ride home with constant eye contact 
 i think heather and lena were making out but i was n't paying attention to anyone other than angie 
 i do n't know how that cab ride could have gone differently but i wish they would 've fallen asleep or something before getting to my place 
 we get to my place heather and lena move to my couch as angie and i are tearing each other 's clothes off on the way upstairs to my bed 
 why could n't i have locked my door ... i 'm on top of angie when i feel extra hands touch my back 
 raw excitement and realizing that i didn’t misread any of the earlier <unk> cost me my condom 
 my last condom 
 angie whispers that she 's on the pill and it’s game on for a foursome i 'll forever cherish and regret 
 the next morning i wake up with 3 beautiful women in my bed and i felt like a <unk> god for the first time in my life 
 after brunch heather and lena both kiss me goodbye and get into a cab 
 once they had left angie kisses me and returns us to they had so rudely interrupted the night before ... angie and i have been dating since that night and she is everything i imagined her to be 
 i 've spent most of december thinking i 'm the <unk> guy on the planet 
 i got girl of my dreams and it got serious after a four-way 
 while most of the office now knows angie and i are dating almost no one knows the true events of that night so it has n't really changed anything at the office 
 i’ve been talking to heather and lena more often though 
 fast forward to tuesday 
 angie and i are driving to my parents for christmas we went to hers for hanukkah when i get a distressed call from heather over bluetooth so angie is part of the conversation too 
 heather is pregnant 
 i 'm the only man she 's been with this year so she hasn’t been taking the pill 
 fuck 
 angie is the first to start crying and i pull over before i am tempted to take the car into incoming traffic 
 we sit there and talk for a half hour before cooler heads <unk> and we agree that angie and i will leave early and be back early friday 
 we 'd have turned around immediately but keeping my parents oblivious will make it so much easier 
 angie and i talk for the remaining hour of the drive and she says she 's not mad at me since the four-way was her idea and we 'll get through this 
 my parents pick up that i was stressed but we manage to pass it off as stress from corporate <unk> 
 then there 's today 
 christmas 
 i get a call from lena when i 'm out alone with the dogs 
 lena is pregnant 
 she does n't know about heather or at least does n't mention it 
 what she does do is confess that she 's in love with me and wants to keep it 
 she wants me to leave angie and marry her before the baby starts showing or she 's going to claim i forced myself onto her while she was passed out at my place 
 i talk to angie and she 's in tears again 
 she hugs me and keeps saying <unk> get through this 
 i bring in my uncle also my lawyer to address her threat and says so long as heather tells my side of story i 'll be fine but we need to tell hr everything first thing monday 
 angie was holding my arm crying into my shoulder the whole time but she agreed 
 the last 48 hours has been an emotional roller coaster and it does n't look to be ending anytime soon 
 p.s 
 no i did n't bat <unk> let 's just say i did n't enjoy hanukkah as much as i wanted to 
 tl dr : corporate holiday party 
 infatuated with beautiful coworker who has two hot friends who are also coworkers 
 lots of alcohol 
 four-way 
 ran out of condoms 
 start dating the girl of my dreams 
 find out i impregnated both of her hot friends 
 one of them is crazy 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - additional info most of which was posted in comments of the old thread : * yes angie’s ass is kate good 
 * mentally i heard angie telling me she was on the pill to mean they all were 
 she thought they were too 
 * my best friend bought a pregnancy test and took it to heather on tuesday it was positive 
 * heather was supposed to start her period on the 10th she had been taking tests since the <unk> and first tested positive on the 22nd she called me when she tested positive the morning of the <unk> 
 * i went to the doctor on the 19th i need to check up with him again next month but i got a clean bill of health 
 * i came 3 times : in the condom in angie and on heather’s stomach 
 i apparently pulled out late on the last one 
 * on the last one lena had pushed me into her quickly afterwards 
 i had thought she was just trying to keep the party going 
 my mortality caused me to tap out shortly into round 4 
 * none of them are <unk> but angie gets a solid 9 and the other two are both <unk> 
 * the foursome was a result of heather joking about it on that bathroom trip and then angie convincing them to make it more than a joke 
 according to angie heather’s made the joke before 
 * heather is <unk> while i’m a developer but she would be my superior if we were on the same team 
 it can be assumed she makes more than i do 
 * lena is in accounting 
 i have no idea what she makes 
 * angie tried to talk to lena yesterday 
 she hung up when lena started shouting at her 
 * for what it’s worth i’m 24 angie is 23 both heather and lena are 26 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- i also want to include the comment that made me laugh the hardest on the last post : by <unk> & gt a and i are driving to my parents for christmas i 
 who the fuck is i 
 when was i introduced 
 oh ... never mind ... -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- update 1 : on friday angie and i talked to heather upon getting back in town 
 she doesn’t want to keep the child though she is going to ask her older sister if her and her husband want to adopt it 
 her sister is <unk> due to complications from her first child 
 if they say no she’s going to <unk> the pregnancy 
 she doesn’t expect assistance from me with either option though i volunteered to pay for the termination if that’s where it goes 
 she hadn’t talked to lena but is <unk> by her threat 
 apparently <unk> parents have been pressuring her to settle down and have kids while she’s young 
 her family is very religious and will likely disown her for having a child outside of marriage 
 heather told us that lena has had a crush on me for months i was just too obsessed with angie to see it 
 she’s been upset about angie and i being together 
 her self-image took a hit when i was unable to keep going while in her it was round four damn it 
 i was the first man she had ever not used a condom with and she blames heather for convincing her to do it 
 heather volunteered to talk to her as i wouldn’t be able to calm down lena without a ring 
 update 2 : angie accompanied heather to the doctor friday afternoon for a blood test 
 they got the results early this morning 
 heather is definitely pregnant 
 she’s going to wait a month to make sure there are no issues before making the offer to her sister 
 for now all quiet on the <unk> front 
 update 3 : heather talked to lena 
 it didn’t go well 
 at least heather recorded it 
 lena did get a positive result on the pregnancy test that heather brought with her 
 heather watched and knows it wasn’t <unk> with 
 fuck 
 lena is maintaining that i would be far happier with her than i would be with angie 
 she said that we’re destined for each other and the baby proved it 
 when confronted about the threat she turned on heather 
 she was yelling at heather for how much she drank that night and pressuring her into joining the foursome knowing her feelings about me 
 when heather informed lena that she was also pregnant from that night and was considering an abortion lena went full holier-than-thou and likely ended their friendship with some of the comments made 
 the conversation ended there with the situation involving lena <unk> worse now that heather ca n't talk to her either 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - update 4 : angie heard me listening to the narration again 
 she 's now reading the comments 
 so far she 's said i should n't have posted this but y'all are making her laugh so i should be ok. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - update 5 : a coworker just text me for frodo '' 
 tomorrow is going to suck 
 he 's enough of a friend that it wo n't be break room gossip but i 'm now considering who else could connect the dots 
 update <unk> : i 'm removing a couple comments because of this 
 he said he only made the connection because he saw heather kiss me but i 'm still going to cover my ass on this one 
 none of the comments i 'm removing include stuff that happened that night 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - update 6 : i have assholes for coworkers that are on reddit 
 i a four boxes of condoms were on my desk when i got in this morning 
 i 'm lucky that i got in earlier than my boss 
 other than a few for frodo '' 
 calls there was n't anything else said to my face 
 thankfully they 've <unk> angie so far 
 update 7 : talking to hr was n't as bad as expected 
 angie and i went to them as soon as they got in 
 they let us talk it was mostly me exempt for the parts where i was n't there like the restroom trip 
 we actually did manage some laughs from the guys in hr one of them had actually read this tifu 
 he said that i stopped short of <unk> the company so posting this does n't add to my situation 
 there is a good chance all four of us will end up on probation but if we can keep it civil and avoid additional <unk> we should be ok. they talked to heather and lena individually 
 lena went home for the day afterwards and i do n't know any more details about her 
 angie has been talking to heather since she got home 
 apparently she was told similar things by hr though the responsibility talk from one of her bosses was apparently very awkward

 tl dr <unk> : corporate holiday party 
 infatuated with beautiful coworker who has two hot friends who are also coworkers 
 lots of alcohol 
 four-way 
 ran out of condoms 
 start dating the girl of my dreams 
 find out i impregnated both of her hot friends 
 one of them is <unk> night i was at the bar and ended up bringing a girl back to my place 
 we hooked up for a while and when it was eventually over we both begin to fall asleep 
 after a little silence she leans over and asks do you reddit '' 
 a little drunk a little tired and really surprised a girl like her would be into reddit i reply with an enthusiastic yes 
 do you '' 
 the only problem is she did n't ask if i reddit she asked if i regret it '' as in regretted hooking up with her and my enthusiastic yes '' was not the answer she was looking for 
 she responded with an angry fuck you '' got dressed and stormed out before i could put two and two together 
 this just happened 
 my <unk> son wanted me to carry him to bed 
 i obliged as i often do 
 also often i tell him he 's getting so big that some day i wo n't be able to carry him 
 but today was different 
 inspired by one of the most memorable posts i 've read here as i laid him down i said one day unknown to either you or me i will put you down never to pick you up again '' 
 i thought it was going to go right past him like when i say he 's getting too big for me to carry 
 instead he looked at me from his bed tears welling up in his eyes and said in a quiet little voice daddy that 's so sad '' 
 i lost it 
 we both wept for about an hour until i held his little hand as he fell <unk> know those little things your parents told you as a child that you always just took as truth because they never got questioned 
 well one bit me in the ass yesterday 
 i am studying abroad in <unk> this year 
 it 's already been a semester and i am having the time of my life 
 i have been trying to learn and practice my french while i am here because well when in <unk> ... anyways i was feeling a little <unk> the other day missing my parents but my mom especially 
 then a great idea hit me 
 she always used to make me this french dish for breakfast when i was young 
 it was basically an egg on toast 
 i think it 's a pretty common thing 
 well she always called it mer-dwa-so '' which i always just assumed meant egg on toast '' or some shit in french 
 maybe i just assumed that was the name of the dish like it did n't translate to anything 
 i guess i never really thought about it at all 
 big mistake 
 i figured to myself hell this must be a french dish and it will remind me of home 
 i 'm going to go order it '' 
 so i went into a little café around from where i am staying and i went up to the lady and in french asked her if they had any mer-dwa-so you should have seen the look on her face 
 she basically just stared at me in disbelief and said what 
 so i repeated it 
 3 times 
 until i realized that i was saying <unk> <unk> '' which is literally bird shit 
 i left with no egg and toast 
 i called my mom and she explained to me in-between fits of laughter that they made that name up because it kind of looks like bird poop <unk> on a windshield the toast 
 she said they translated it to french because it sounded fancier and because you ca n't say bird shit '' to a child every day '' 
 thanks mom 
 that 's one less café i can show my face in 
 alright so i lost a bunch of weight recently 
 i was a big guy at the time of my wedding and as a result of the weight loss my wedding ring is now a whole lot looser around my finger 
 so perhaps thanks to my new sexy <unk> ... the missus and i were getting it on today 
 with a devious <unk> in her eye she suggested : how about anal '' 
 excellent plan of course 
 i got the lube and used copious amounts 
 now you 've got to take it slowly first gently with one finger ... then two ... and finally my index middle and ring finger were all lubed up and in there 
 good times 
 after my lady was sufficiently warmed up we were happily banging away 
 but as i slapped her fine ass i noticed something 
 something missing 
 hey my ring came off '' i said 
 probably on the mattress '' she replied 
 not on the mattress 
 on the ground '' 
 she asked now with a hint of <unk> 
 not on the ground 
 then it dawned upon both of us 
 & amp nbsp so my fingers went back in there 
 yet my monster dong ... had already pushed it far beyond reach 
 i spent a good 10 minutes with my hand up my wife 's butthole 
 i even tried to lighten the mood by doing my best gollum impression and <unk> : *** '' my <unk> 
 give it back to us 
 *** but she was not amused 
 we finally had to give up the search 
 she drank 4 cups of coffee over the course of the next hour and made her retreat to the bathroom with a box of rubber gloves 
 from the living room i heard an explosive splattering sound followed by a faint * '' oh my god ... '' * after half an hour of scrubbing she handed me my ring back without making eye contact 
 & amp nbsp so now whenever i look at my ring i 'm reminded of the <unk> i took to always be at the side of my lovely wife on the day of our beautiful wedding ceremony 
 and how this particular piece of <unk> was violently blasted out of her asshole amongst a torrent of diarrhea 
 so a bit of a backstory i 'm 29 and have had a slight case of <unk> 's since i was about 14 nothing too serious i can usually keep a lid on it but i slip up every now and then mostly when i 'm nervous or stressed 
 anyway my wife and i just finished moving across the country for her job and made a trip to florida this year to see our parents for father 's day 
 i 'm currently still looking for a job and my wife 's dad has never really cared much for me 
 so we arrive at her parents house for dinner and the topic of me being a <unk> comes up 
 here 's how the convo went 
 father in law : so with all this time at home you must be getting a lot of work done in the house right '' 
 me : well i 'm not very good at <unk> so we 're hiring someone to do the bathroom and porch '' 
 father in law : well then that must give you a lot of time to keep the cars in good shape and well kept right '' 
 me : honestly i 'm not great with cars either so we just stick to <unk> for that stuff '' 
 father in law : well jeez is there anything you do well '' 
 me thinking to myself : do n't say 'fuck your daughter do n't say 'fuck your daughter ... me : fuck your daughter '' 
 <unk> 
 her dad immediately got up and left the room without saying a word 
 i apologized later and he understood that i really could n't help it 
 my wife thought it was the funniest moment of her life possibly the most embarrassing for me 
 tl dr : i told my father in law that the only thing i do well is fuck his <unk> have a similar story to a recent post here but not quite as long as a 29 year one 
 also this was not today 
 my name is samuel but until i was about 10 i did n't realise this 
 everyone had called me sam all my life and that 's how i had learned to write my name 
 one day in primary school i was looking at the list of the class 's names in the wall to have stickers and stuff put next too if we had done well in something and could n't find my one 
 i did however see the name samuel and started laughing as i had read it as if it was pronounced samool '' and was looking around for the poor <unk> with that name 
 tl dr i did n't realise my name was samuel instead of just sam 
 thought there was a kid in my class called samool and felt bad for them 
 edit : man this blew up haha 
 my only proper post i 've ever made and it hits front page 
 also rip inbox : edit 2 : <unk> gold 
 thanks whoever you are 
 a few days ago i read a joke on reddit 
 the way i interpreted it completely literally it was slightly inappropriate but still amusing 
 in a rare attempt to be the cool mom '' i decided to share it with my kids 14 and 10 on the way to school 
 me : hey kids i have a funny but slightly inappropriate joke 
 think you can handle it 
 haha 
 both rolled their eyes since my jokes are generally of the benign dad variety 
 me : why did <unk> never have kids 
 blank stares 
 me : because <unk> came in * my brain : oh shit i get it now punch out punch out punch out 
 * a different ... mumble box ... cue shocked disgusted look from the 14 year old and utter confusion from the 10 year old 
 i tried to play it off without success 
 i think i 'll stick with the silly dad puns from now on 
 like most tifus this happened a few years back 
 i was at a free clinic for women to get a physical exam 
 they basically only check to see if you have scoliosis or not and clear you for all physical activity 
 after filling out my paperwork and waiting in line for about 4 hours i was finally granted my five free minutes in the office 
 i sat on the table in my t-shirt and shorts and smiled politely as the old man with the <unk> entered 
 he <unk> asked please show me your form '' 
 to which i replied by sitting up as straight as i could on the table 
 he looked at me and again he said miss i need to see your form '' 
 slightly frustrated i sat up even <unk> 
 when he again said nothing i asked how do you want to see my form 
 sitting down 
 standing '' 
 at this point the doctor is staring at me with a look of mass confusion 
 he asked me yet again to see my form and in a flustered panic i took off my shirt and stood there in his office showing off my perfect form 
 the doctor proceeded to burst out in laughter and through his cackling squeezed out the words your papers 
 i just wanted to see your papers '' 
 he told me in his 30 years of working that clinic a girl had never stripped for him when he asked to see her form 
 i never went back 
 moral of the stories if they ask to see your form they probably just want to see your paperwork 
 this actually happened this past weekend 
 my wife 's friend came over to our house to hang out and she brought her 3-year-old son to play with our 3-year-old daughter 
 the adults chatted in the living room while the kids were in the playroom next to us 
 my daughter loves to pretend to be different animals and <unk> their sounds and movements 
 for example she 'll say i 'm and horse '' and run around saying neigh neigh '' while <unk> about 
 well she runs to where we are sitting and does just that 
 i say well i 'm an lion '' and the i start making roaring sounds 
 shortly after our friend 's son runs in and starts making what sounds like meh meh meh meh meh '' 
 i was n't quite sure what he was pretending to be so i said are you a <unk> '' 
 the kids just laugh and run back to where they were playing so i think nothing of it 
 as i turn around i see my wife giving me a very hard glare 
 i 'm not really sure why so i just shrug it off figuring she thought i was just acting immature in front of our guest 
 after our friend and her kid leave my wife tells me our friend 's son has a speech impediment 
 he <unk> when trying to talk 
 the sound he was making was him trying to say something not an animal sound 
 tl : dr - i made fun of a 3-year-old for stuttering 
 tuesday i fucked up by posting this story without reading the sidebar 
 sorry 
 but alas it 's the weekend and anything goes so i 'm reposting it 
 today i fucked up big 
 oh man where to begin 
 it all happened so fast and fell apart so early 
 i 'll start by saying i 've been single for about two years now 
 i settled down early at 14 and then spent the next 20 years with the same chick 
 since she left i 've been forced to <unk> myself as an individual 
 i 'll get to the point 
 the one thing i actually enjoy about being single is the fact that i can fart whenever and however loud i want 
 i want to fart on my kids 
 no problem 
 i want to dutch oven myself 
 absolutely smells great 
 i want to hard fart on the couch 
 please do 
 two a.m. last night seven year old daughter grace has a nightmare and joins me in my bed 
 six a.m. half asleep and i make perhaps the worst decision of my life 
 i should mention here that i get the occasional bout of constipation 
 yesterday was day four so i decided to take a laxative to ease things along a bit 
 the instructions said take between one and three for natural relief '' 
 six p.m. last night i took the three and waited for my natural relief '' 
 back to six a.m. grace is the big spoon and i feel a hard fart coming on 
 half way between consciousness and slumber i push a hard one out 
 i feel a hot not warm hot and wet liquid thew shoot out of me 
 grace comes to and is covered from mid chest to knees in hot yellowish daddy shart 
 it shot clear through my pajamas 
 she wipes the sand out of her eyes and you can see it clicking on her head 
 she glances down and looks like she just found her <unk> <unk> head next to her 
 she immediately starts screaming 
 her screams turn to tears as she stands up in the middle of my bed dripping dad 's colon sludge 
 she 's screaming and crying i 'm apologizing and crying 
 all of this wakes up the five year old boy 
 he groggily stumbles into the bedroom and when he realizes what 's happening proceeds to full-on <unk> <unk> 
 i 'm now holding my still exploding ass grace is losing it on my bed and the boy can barely breathe as i make my way towards the bathroom 
 i get to the door where my son is and before i can waddle past him i notice his pants are wet 
 this boy laughed so hard and on a count of the early hour he pissed himself 
 david you 're <unk> yourself '' 
 i scream ironically whilst holding my shit filled jammies 
 he responds by laughing harder falling on the floor <unk> up into the fetal position and continuing to empty his bladder 
 i 'm in tears and covered in shit grace is in tears covered in shit david is laughing hysterically in a pool of his own piss and the dog starts to bark 
 my oldest daughter is home sick from school and wakes up in the commotion and is now watching all of this like a horrified deer caught in the headlights 
 90 minutes later david has finally calmed down everyone has showered and it 's fucking silent as i try to feed them breakfast 
 a quiet ride to school an hour late and we have to stop by the office to get a note 
 the attendance secretary asks david why he 's late and he busts out laughing again 
 grace looks at me and screams “do n't tell them anything '' and goes tearing down the hall towards her class 
 it takes another three solid minutes to calm david down 
 i 'm sure he went right in to class and told everyone 
 grace has n't said a word to me or made any eye contact with me since this morning 
 i think i may have really damaged her 
 i do n't know if i can somehow blame all this on being a single dad to <unk> some sympathy but i 'll try 
 i 'd hard being a single dad even harder to look your daughter in the eyes after shitting on her 
 ok now comes the really bad part 
 today is grace 's eighth birthday 
 update : grace said nothing to me on tuesday did n't look at me either 
 i gave her space and she kept to herself 
 not her brother or sister she did n't even want anything to do with the pets 
 the kids go with their mom on <unk> and i pick them up from school again <unk> 
 since her birthday fell on a week day we’re celebrating it this weekend and i need to make this one count 
 thursday morning i get a phone call from her mother that wakes me up 
 i 'm sleeping on the floor as my mattress is in the backyard waiting for a truck to take it to the dump 
 i ca n't tell you how much i dreaded answering that call 
 this is not going to be a positive conversation 
 i answer the phone to a good four seconds of silence 
 <unk> ” one one thousand two one thousand three one thousand four one thousand 
 <unk> the fuck would you let sartre sleep in your bed to shit all over our daughter on her fucking birthday asshole 
 ” wait what 
 did grace lie to her mother or does she actually believe that the dog did this to us 
 is her little eight year old brain too naive to comprehend her daddy <unk> all over her 
 i mean it was early 
 it was a confusing fucking mess but could she have been that confused 
 i never said i shit on her just apologized 
 i thought it was obvious 
 maybe she thinks i was apologizing for letting the dog sleep in the bed 
 my mind is racing as the ex continues to <unk> me 
 perhaps that’s why grace didn’t want anything to do with the dog and ignored everyone 
 i apologize to the ex and she finishes up yelling at me as i explain that i didn’t even know sartre was sick and maybe that’s why he jumped into bed to let me know he was sick 
 is this working is <unk> mom actually buying this shit 
 am i actually getting away with this 
 all of this rushes through my head as i put forth the sick dog hypothesis 
 i picked up grace today from school 
 she seems <unk> 
 she’s talked to me a little 
 just demands though “i’m hungry ” “can we change the channel ” that sort of thing 
 i don’t dare push the subject too hard after all pushing got me into this predicament in the first place but i’m kinda dying to know if she knows that it was me 
 how do you <unk> that subject with someone 
 should i count my blessings and let it go 
 do i just sacrifice the dog like that sartre taking one for the team literally not <unk> 
 the existence of the shit <unk> the essence of my guilt or something like that 
 maybe i’ll just save the ‘i shit on you on your eighth <unk> <unk> for her 18th birthday 
 fucking <unk> huh 
 edit : tl dr. i woke up this morning and covered my seven now eight year old in a hard shart 
 edit 2 : i 've tried to fix the formatting i wrote this in word and it got screwed up in transition edit 3 : holy shit thanks for all the gold i wish i could say i was proud of my first <unk> kid on the bus makes a funny face at me so i make a funny face back 
 we 're stuck in traffic so we get into a little contest and exchange funny faces for the next while 
 the kid is an amateur he just keeps pulling the same face 
 i 've got an <unk> full of funny faces so naturally i crush him and win the battle 
 i <unk> the rest of the bus in search of a more worthy opponent however i meet eyes with an elderly lady 
 her facial expression looks like she has just found out there 's been a death in the family and i 'm the one responsible 
 i can see the raging storm of anger welling up inside of her 
 her <unk> eyes are so focused on mine i swear i can feel my <unk> searing under the intensity of her glare so i break eye contact and look back at my buddy 
 to my horror only then do i realise that the child was never making a funny face at me 
 he is disabled 
 so first of all sorry for the shitty english it 's not my main language 
 this happened a year ago 
 i used to work on a it course as the it guy '' had a pretty good time there just fixing computers and you know ... doing the it guy '' job 
 when it happened to me and some other people were at the kitchen drinking coffee and just chillin a bit 
 i was going to stay the whole night working on a server <unk> and everyone else <unk> getting ready to leave then comes the conversation about marriage and this guy let 's call him mark was talking about his wife 
 we decided to ask his age because he looked like he was 16 years old well he was 17 ... no problem at all so the conversation goes on and he ends on the phrase i married her because she was pregnant '' oh that makes some sense then mark says but the baby died in birth and we decided to give him to the university for research '' after this phrase my mind full of dark humor replies well at least he reached college medicine right 
 everyone turns at me i can see some people holding <unk> and others looking in disgust i just realised what i 've said finish my coffee and rush to the it room 
 mark never looked into my face again 
 tl dr - told a guy that his dead baby could get a degree in medicine research 
 edit : grammar edit2 : thanks <unk> for an awesome correction on my post 
 edit3 : <unk> front page 
 thanks guys.so last night i was bored as fuck and i decided to get my wife 's waxing stuff and and try my luck at waxing my ass crack because let me tell you it 's a fucking jungle down there 
 i 've never waxed before and i did n't bother looking up how to do it because uh who <unk> needs directions 
 i plugged the machine in and it took forever to heat up 
 when it was finally ready i took one of those sticks and just went to fucking town on my ass crack and my gooch 
 i knew basically how this works so i opened the drawer to get a wax strip out ... and there were none left 
 i tried everything as a substitute i was freaking out i used : a shirt which now has ass hair on it an ace bandage duct tape after about 30 minutes the wax was dried and my ass was completely stuck together and i had made little to no progress so i had to do the unthinkable .. rip all of the hair out by hand for what felt like forever i sat in the shower ripping hair out of my ass crack with only my bare hands which also had wax all over them and were now completely covered with ass hair 
 this has to be the worst experience of my entire life and i 'm never trying to wax again kill <unk> is a <unk> fuck up as it is equally my husband and i 's fault 
 we have a <unk> mastiff <unk> mix that <unk> <unk> and eats all toys we 've ever brought home within a matter of hours 
 after many months of going through one or two $ 10+ toys a week we were feeling pretty discouraged 
 a friend recommended that we try ordering from a site online that <unk> about having <unk> dog toys 
 so we order a bone shaped toy for him made out of some hard nylon material 
 the toy has been here for over three weeks now and it still looks like brand new 
 he loves it we love it it 's great 
 from the second we got it we started calling it a boner '' instead of a bone because that 's funnier 
 go play with your boner pup '' 
 i 'm gon na get your boner '' 
 that 's a nice boner you got there '' 
 type of thing 
 well today my three year old daughter went to a little arts and crafts party at a local crafts store and she was telling everyone how daddy plays with the dog 's boner and how much fun it is to watch daddy play <unk> 
 i was mortified the entire hour long class and had some explaining to do 
 my husband and i have decided to make an effort to call it something else 
 edit : here 's a picture of my dog with his boner : obligatory disclaimer : this happened a couple of months ago 
 my friends encouraged me to post here about it and today i decided to 
 i know i know ... so a good friend of mine invited me to a <unk> themed drag show he was putting on as fund <unk> for a pretty bad flood that happened in our area recently 
 i accepted and showed up on time but realized pretty quickly that on time '' is early and no one really shows up early anymore 
 should 've known 
 after the obligatory hello 's '' and how ya <unk> 's '' to my buddy and the other folks running the event i found the bar and settled in 
 drink in hand i began scoping out the few people that had trickled in since i arrived 
 i did n't really expect to find anyone i 'd be into at this event but hey i 'd gone through a pretty bad break up a couple of weeks prior and was feeling desperate for some action 
 after chatting with the bartender for a while i finish my second drink 
 feeling a little loose i turn around to check out the new <unk> when i notice an old friend of mine sitting alone at a table on her phone 
 i walk over say hello and we begin to catch up 
 i had n't seen angela nope not her real name in about a year and find out she was in from out of town and meeting up with a few of the folks i planned on seeing this evening as well 
 score 
 we 'd always had a mutual attraction to each other but never acted on it since i had always been in a relationship 
 obviously i 'm thinking that should n't be a problem now 
 the night progresses and we meet up with all our mutual friends 
 we drink 
 we dance 
 we have a blast 
 everything is going well and her and i are really hitting it off 
 once the show ends someone suggests we go to another bar and as a group we all agree 
 everyone is already quite drunk so inhibitions are pretty low 
 angela and i made out on our way to the bar and i 'm feeling like a boss ass player 
 one or two bars later and we end up at an after hours dance club 
 it should be noted that angela and i pretty drunk at this point and i convinced myself that i 'm some sort of amazing dance god 
 she 's digging it even if i 'm struggling to keep from falling down so i go in for the kill 
 you <unk> ta come over <unk> my place '' 
 i asked right before the beat dropped so i never actually heard what she said but it was something along the lines of sure 
 i guess '' 
 fuck yes 
 i 'm da best 
 i call an uber and we start heading towards my apartment 
 she has us stop at a 7-11 to get her a toothbrush and i grab an ice cream sandwich 
 this night is going way better than i thought it would 
 we get home and our clothes start flying off 
 my buddy had given me a couple of viagra a while back so i pop one 
 i did n't want to get whiskey dick so it seemed like a good idea at the time 
 we start going at it and the viagra kicks in 
 my <unk> stark turns into iron man and for about 15 minutes we have amazing sex 
 i feel like such a boss 
 she flips over and prepares herself to ride <unk> cowgirl 
 i remember thinking hmmm 
 things seem a little dry down there '' 
 just before she slams down on the <unk> 
 you know that moment when you 're in so much unexpected pain that your brain does n't even really register it 
 you know something bad just happened but you do n't really feel it yet 
 that 's about where i was in that moment 
 i shout in pain and push her off 
 i look down at my boy and blood is shooting out of the front 
 literally shooting out 
 the viagra and high alcohol content are pumping out blood like the fucking <unk> <unk> 
 i run to the bathroom holding my junk and jump into the bath tub 
 she comes <unk> in after me <unk> what the hell happened 
 i <unk> her to shut up and take a deep breath before examining the damage 
 turns out her <unk> mount and lack of lube put an <unk> amount of stress on my bowstring <unk> is the technical term and popped the little guy right in half 
 so here i am sitting naked in the shower <unk> rock hard drunk and bleeding an impressive amount 
 she becomes hysterical starts crying and calls her dad 
 why her dad 
 well apparently he 's a doctor 
 apparently she thinks he can give her some advice or home remedy to fix my broken bowstring at 4 am in the morning 
 yeah 
 i do n't think so 
 you know what this guy says 
 why are you talking to me 
 take him to the hospital '' 
 thanks angela 's dad 
 real helpful 
 after about 15 minutes the bleeding slowed slightly but i 'm starting to feel pretty woozy 
 the shock of the situation finally subsides and i begin laughing uncontrollably 
 i think this is what 's happening to me right now 
 everything i 've done in life has led up to me boner bleeding in the shower 
 this is what i have become '' 
 angela puts some clothes on and grabs the keys to my car 
 she tells me to get out of the shower and meet her out front to go to the er 
 i tell her she better yelp the best one because i 'm not having some 4 star doctor handle my precious <unk> <unk> 
 she 's not very happy with me at that moment 
 as i <unk> out of the shower and <unk> put some clothes on i look around for the nearest object to carry my broken junk in 
 maybe a smart person would grab a towel but nope i grab a wide mouth mason jar that was sitting on the counter and tuck my dick and balls in that 
 why both 
 it was just more comfortable that way 
 the blood is n't coming out as much at this point but i still have an erection 
 pants pulled up to my thighs and holding the bloody mason jar between my legs i walk outside and get in the car 
 we drive the 5 minutes to an urgent care 5 star rated on yelp of course and i walk in there with all my glory showing and no fucks to give 
 there 's a few people in the waiting room but the guy behind the counter does n't want me sitting in there with them because my pants are n't pulled up so i get the <unk> treatment and see the doctor right away 
 i explain the situation to dr. ted while nurse caroline takes my mason jar and throws it away i mean i did n't want it back i guess 
 ted is in his late 60 's and and caroline is n't far behind in age 
 ted gets the thing clean and puts pressure on it when he drops the bad news 
 op the bleeding is n't really going to stop with out putting pressure on it 
 i do n't want to stand here all night and hold your glorious member so we 're gon na have to <unk> it up '' 
 nope 
 i ask if there 's anything else we can do 
 literally anything else 
 glue 
 bandaid 
 caroline puts pressure on it 
 no <unk> 
 in a last ditch effort i ask for some sort of <unk> but he explains that would be more painful than just getting the stitches 
 caroline holds my hand 
 i glare at angela 
 ted puts 3 stitches in 
 i cried 
 we all <unk> 
 angela and i drove back to my place in silence 
 she left back to her hotel shortly after we got back 
 we have n't talked since then but i like to think the conversation with her dad the next day was very awkward 
 three days later i got the stitches out 
 ted and caroline were n't there so i had to explain the story to a whole new set of people 
 they laughed a lot 
 i left them a 5 star review on yelp 
 tl dr i thought i was a boss ass bro getting a one night stand 
 ended up breaking my dick and going to the er 
 edit : thanks for helping me get to the front page all the kind words and of course the sweet sweet gold 
 i read all your comments and laughed a ton 
 my day has been made and i have a permanent smile on my face thanks to all of <unk> this happened last night ... i live in a dorm in college where the bathrooms are shared by both <unk> in groups of 10. there are 2 showers and 3 toilets so multiple people either gender can be in the bathroom at the same time 
 after my shower i was shaving my face in the mirror with my towel wrapped around my waist 
 while looking in the mirror everyday i 've notice myself getting a little chunkier and chunkier in the tummy area as the <unk> gone on 
 then as i 'm standing there shaving one of the <unk> girls i share the bathroom with enters 
 before we even make eye contact or say hello to each other i somehow instinctively sucked my tummy in to look a little <unk> and then it happened 
 my towel it must have been folded loosely enough just <unk> from the front and the towel just falls to the ground 
 sadly i was n't fast enough to <unk> it before it got to my <unk> ... there i am just standing there with my <unk> <unk> pinch and hairy ass 
 she was nice enough to act like she did n't see it though and she casually got in the shower like nothing happened 
 but she saw it 
 i know she saw it all 
 a few lessons have been learned from this experience ... i asked her if she thought cocaine was special ... i have an appointment with hr monday <unk> just happened unfortunately for me 
 so i 'm running across town to pick up my hastily abandoned car from its overnight <unk> near the pub 
 beautiful morning it 's 7am i 'm ahead of schedule so things are going ok. once in my car i remember some coffee left from the previous evening 
 oh good 
 cold coffee 
 it 's <unk> coffee and i 'm pretty sure their milk products could survive the <unk> <unk> so i 'm not worried and willing to take a few sips 
 ugh <unk> 
 but i need the <unk> 
 at this point i notice a little bit of extra ... texture in there though 
 did some crumbs from my granola bar get in last night 
 i <unk> the nearly empty cup and drain it 
 weird ... kind of crunchy 
 i 'm still not worried about <unk> milk at this point 
 the crunchiness is too <unk> too <unk> sounding to be a <unk> 
 i swallow a few more crunchy bits before thinking to spit one out and look at it 
 if this sounds naive please <unk> i was and am very tired and i was *really <unk> they were just crumbs 
 they were n't crumbs 
 they were <unk> 
 somehow my car has fruit flies and they were <unk> in my coffee 
 ew ew ew ew ew ew ew 
 tl dr drank a bug orgy by <unk> 
 i 'm a 23 year old dad 
 i like to be an active parent and play with my son ... and today things went wrong 
 we have these 3 really cool nerf swords that we play with every day 
 he has actually gotten pretty good at <unk> and <unk> my attacks and when he starts rushing me i have to try my hardest to not get hit 
 to spice things up we always do power struggles '' ... pushing our swords together and then wrestling to make it more fun 
 well today we did that ... but his sword gave out and cracked in the middle ... this led to my full force punch cracking him across the jaw and watching him go limp 
 i have never panicked so hard in my life 
 i felt sick <unk> a full grown man '' punching a child can lead to some terrible things such as <unk> or worse death 
 luckily he was only down and out for about 4 seconds 
 went to the hospital and he has no concussion or anything just a very sore little face 
 ice cream should cure the wound but nothing will <unk> the cracks put into the heart of a little boy getting fucking <unk> 'd like a little bitch 
 edit : ok some people are getting offended and threatening me 
 my son is loved healthy handsome as hell and there is nothing to worry about ... this is us proof '' because some people are asking : we are very happy and you do n't need to go calling the cops over a nerf battle 
 edit : why do you all like this so much haha 
 i 've had so many damn offers from this to help support my son and youtube <unk> and it is overwhelming 
 people are even making videos about it within 24 hours : i appreciate it everyone 
 have a good night - <unk> technically thursday now where i live but it did happen a couple of hours ago 
 anyways i recently discovered the subreddit <unk> 
 i read many of their success stories on not fapping and becoming more confident around women 
 i guess this happens because <unk> and hormones build up and primal instincts kick in more 
 so i thought id give it a shot since i never know what to say to the pretty girl that keeps sitting next to me in one of my classes 
 after about a week of holding it in i do realize a change as my 19 year old <unk> body is ready to fuck the nearest living thing 
 finally after much contemplating i get the balls to ask this girl out after class 
 to my surprise she said yes she even told me she had been waiting this whole time 
 after my little dance of victory i realized that the mission was accomplished 
 so my horny self begins to think that since i already scored the date i had no reason not to masturbate 
 but the problem was i was still inside the college 
 but i guess today i was so horny that i <unk> the fact of what a stupid idea masturbating in public is 
 i rushed to the bathroom into a stall and whipped my meat out and just went to town 
 i was so into it that even when i heard the bathroom door open i didnt stop i just tried to keep it quiet 
 this is the fucked up part 
 since i always masturbate in my room with a tissue i am kinda used to always unloading into the tissue 
 so without even realising that there is a toilet right in front of me i quickly yank some toilet paper as i feel the end 
 i end up having one of the most intense orgasms ever and im pretty sure i left a huge load in that tissue after a week of no fapping 
 thats when i heard a voice next to me just kind whisper hey do you have an extra toilet paper roll on your side 
 if you could pass me some you 'd be a real bro '' suddenly i just see a hand peek out under the stall 
 since i was so caught off guard without even thinking about it i put the wad of paper i just used in his hand 
 he quickly grabbed it and i started panicking since i realized what i had just done 
 then there was just silence and i just heard a faint uhh what the fuck '' 
 so i got the fuck out of there as i bolted out before he could see me 
 but hey at least i got a date friday 
 tl dr handed some dude my cum edit : fell asleep after posting this so i did n't get to answer your comments immediately 
 but i 'll try to answer as many 
 i 'm never going back into that bathroom 
 edit 2 : some of you said the no fap thing is <unk> and i agree but at least it worked 
 also a few you asked me to update on the date and to try to share this story 
 i will add an update tomorrow on how that <unk> out op is a <unk> edit : im so sorry guys 
 i totally forgot about updating this until <unk> pm 'd me 
 the date went okay 
 i did not tell her the story i couldnt find the right way to present it 
 i didnt make it to a second date but it gave me a huge confidence boost this is a repost 
 i posted it in the thread about tinder dates and i was a bit late 
 it has stopped gaining points but i am getting a dozen messages a day from people encouraging me to post it here 
 i hope that 's okay : - <unk> this did not happen today 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- okay ... this is gon na be strange 
 i use a wheel-chair as a result of a car accident 
 i 'm paralyzed from the waist down 
 i ca n't really feel '' anything below my nipples 
 i can move my <unk> just fine 
 i went on tinder and made sure my pictures showed the wheel-chair 
 i 've had bad experiences with online dating and <unk> remarks regarding my wheelchair during a date 
 so i always make sure they know upfront 
 well 
 one day 
 i get a message and this chic is really into my profile the movies and shows i listed the music i listed and <unk> my pictures 
 she says she 's a nurse and does n't judge people by their abilities '' ... <unk> i pretty much do everything in my power to keep talking to this woman 
 let 's call her jizzanthapuss 
 i talk to her everyday for a week 
 we say good morning and good night and talk throughout the day 
 it gets <unk> <unk> on both of our parts 
 on my part mainly because i wanted some booty and it had been a while 
 i was willing to work for it 
 **yada yada yada** i meet jizzanthapuss for our first date and it goes well 
 very well 
 i think i might have found the one '' -- i tell my mother during our weekly long distance phone calls 
 **yada yada yada** a month has gone by we 've went on a couple of dates and we talk every day -- practically every minute 
 i might be in love with jizzanthapuss 
 **yada yada yada** she asks why not come over to watch a movie 
 i agree and when i get there i quickly discover her <unk> has left for the weekend 
 yes thank you sweet sexy baby jesus 
 i am alone with her 
 in her apartment 
 watching a movie 
 i stay in my wheelchair and just get close to the couch and put my arm around her shoulder slightly squeezing every now and then 
 i notice she is getting fidgety looking around and sneaking glances at me 
 i realize she wants me to make a move 
 so i tell her to move over and i hop off my chair and onto the couch 
 <unk> <unk> the appropriate time has elapsed she is still close to me and reacting <unk> to the advances 
 it is now time for me to grab a boob 
 i slide my hand which was on her shoulder -- down a bit and grab a <unk> 
 i smile 
 now 
 let me tell you 
 i 'm in my <unk> 's i 've had plenty of sexual experience before 
 but never like this 
 she quickly flicked my arm away from her boob in a violent manner which almost worried me because i thought she was offended ... but before i could finish the thought she aggressively grabs me and begins to <unk> 
 all <unk> did i mention that 
 it 's pretty hot i kind of like her taking control 
 yes 
 jizzanthapuss you 're in charge now 
 now at this point she says my wheel-chair is in the way and wheels it to the opposite side of the room then comes back and sits on my <unk> me slips off her bra with one quick professionally graceful flick 
 her bewbs flop out and i forget how to math and read 
 she then slips off my pants and begins to ride me as she <unk> my nipples 
 technically i 'm not suppose to feel my nipples but boy did my nipples hurt from all the tugging 
 **here 's where things take a turn for <unk> now let me explain 
 i ca n't feel anything below my nipples but my body does give me signs 
 for example if i were to sit on sharp <unk> facing upwards or if a rock got into my shoe -- i would n't be able to tell <unk> exactly it is that there is pain 
 but my body gives me a sign for example a unique type of tingling which i 've come to understand and associate as the new feeling my body has <unk> to inform me of pain 
 i 've come to understand the new feelings i get for pain for going to the bathroom for being uncomfortable for needing to get off my butt from too much sitting 
 etc etc 
 and when i get these feelings i need to do something about it asap 
 so back to the apartment where i have <unk> <unk> in my face this tall chic riding me and i 'm practically in heaven 
 she asks me to bite her and i do 
 harder she demands and i comply 
 then i notice a surge of <unk> and tingling 
 it then turns into the kind of feeling which i 've come to associate with pain 
 very bad pain 
 but fuck this i 'm getting some ass 
 and <unk> are all up in my face as i bite and suck her nipples 
 let me die here 
 i 'll ignore the pain 
 fuck it 
 fuck it 
 fuck me jizzanthapuss 
 then i ca n't ignore it anymore 
 it soon turns into the kind of sensation where i know i need to do something asap 
 its too painful 
 furthermore another tell-tale sign i begin to sweat profusely on my left side 
 it 's like a <unk> it begins dripping 
 all the <unk> jizzanthapuss is really into it moaning and being louder than anyone i 've ever been with 
 eventually i simply ca n't take it anymore the discomfort is too much 
 and try to push her away gently both hands on shoulders slight push backwards so as to see if maybe her weight on my lap is what 's causing the pain 
 but she resists my push she 's like a solid rock 
 i ca n't get her to budge 
 she grabs a hold of my hair and <unk> it back while riding me and tugging on my nipples 
 now.. i have a lot of <unk> pain 
 i do n't like pain 
 i live with it 24/7 
 i understand some people have different '' sexual <unk> and <unk> and kinks 
 however you need to communicate 
 you ca n't just start introducing pain and hope it 'll be cool 
 i giggle nervously and tell her to take it easy a bit '' she then slaps me so hard and out of nowhere 
 i did not expect it at all not even a little bit 
 you know that feeling 
 when you 're <unk> and someone just knocks you in the head 
 her <unk> slap reached my forehead and everything went white for a second 
 now i 'm more pissed than confused 
 the pain is still there 
 i scream at her 
 what the fuck '' 
 and shove her off me and she <unk> down next to me on the couch 
 now that she 's off me i can see my left thigh is completely covered in blood 
 my first thought was she might have <unk> all over me 
 but why would i be in pain then 
 i look over at her and she 's holding a black <unk> which is covered in blood 
 i quickly put two and two together and conclude that those <unk> of pain had been from when she was stabbing my thigh with the pin 
 she then gets up and sits on my wheelchair which is at the other side of the room now i watch her for another minute or 20 
 and say what the fuck was that 
 i mean i 'm into kinky shit but what the <unk> fuck 
 and why would you stab me with a fucking pin 
 you 're fucking sick why would n't you communicate with me about that first '' 
 she casually says i <unk> '' and starts playing with her legs as she sits nude on my wheelchair 
 stretching them pointing her toes at me like a baby who just discovered her legs 
 was she mocking me 
 finally having had enough and having soaked in the situation and concluded it was n't a dream ... i tell her i 'd like to leave 
 and to please bring my wheel-chair 
 i 'm in pain and would like to tend to my wound and go home 
 she looks at me and says dead serious beg me for it '' for what i ask 
 she asks me to beg for the wheel-chair 
 at this point i begin to truly get scared 
 i 've known this chic for a month and here i am alone naked scared and bleeding in her apartment on her couch 
 as she sits 15 feet away from me nude on my wheel-chair and mocking me 
 why did n't i tell anyone about her 
 why did n't i tell anyone i was here 
 am i gon na die 
 i then shove my <unk> up my ass and beg her to bring my wheelchair closer 
 each round of begging she brings the chair a bit closer 
 until finally i was able to quickly lean forward and grab onto the leg part of the frame 
 she hops off and goes into the bedroom leaving the door open and seductively looking back at me with an invitation sexy smirk 
 i quickly ponder whether or not i should go to the bedroom and let her have her way with me 
 sure this is <unk> strange scary and <unk> for but she 's got a vagina that i have an invitation to play with 
 i decide against my brain 's many <unk> that i should leave right away 
 i pull up my pants hop on my wheel-chair and just wheel the fuck right out of there 
 this incident ... it kind of ruined sex for me 
 because now i need to be <unk> verbally humiliated and have my nipples clamped -- before i can even think about maybe cumming 
 **tl dr** met a girl on tinder chatted her up went on a few dates all is splendid 
 then i go to her house to watch a movie and have some sexy time 
 sexy time ensues and i discover she 's a freak who enjoys pain <unk> and blood 
 **edit # 1** i do n't consider this to be a rape 
 the sex was consensual and save for the first time i tried to move her away and her not <unk> -- the next time i shoved her off she did move and the sex did stop 
 the first time i did n't shove her off it was more of a can u <unk> move '' <unk> which she kindly shot down 
 i 'd <unk> it more as an assault 
 **edit # 2** due to popular request from this thread 
 i decided to go report this at the police station 
 i brought a camera with me and recorded how it went 
 & gt & gt **edit # 3** <unk> though 
 i 've decided to make an report to the ona <unk> nurses <unk> just to warn them about her character and to recommend they look into whether she is abusing <unk> as she may be <unk> upon the disabled 
 **edit # 4** thanks to everyone for the kind words about my writing style 
 i really consider myself a writer but have had writer 's block for the longest time 
 it 's lame but getting the compliments has <unk> my belief that i <unk> to continue my writing no matter what 
 perhaps i 'll turn this into a misery-esque based on a true story '' short novel 
 <unk> <unk> my girl and i have been together for 4.5 years 
 we 've been doing this thing right from the start where when we go to the gym together she does her own routine mostly cardio and i do my own routine mostly lifting 
 sometimes while she 's lifting <unk> in front of the mirror i 'll walk up and start hitting on her in a loud obnoxious <unk> way 
 i 'm not really big so it 's pretty funny to see me acting like a big tough <unk> and picking up on her by acting like a dumbass 
 typically it <unk> her but sometimes she plays along 
 it 's the best when other dudes are watching they 're always checking her out or trying to make small talk with her anyway 
 so i 'll walk up and be like <unk> sup girl you <unk> fiiiiiiine you got a <unk> '' 
 and she will act all <unk> and start chatting me up 
 yesterday we went to the gym in the morning and this fratboy starts talking her up 
 he is pretty jacked and confident 
 she plays along just chatting 
 after about ten minutes i walk up and do my routine 
 i basically jump in on their conversation and i 'm like oh yea <unk> girl 
 i seen you here yesterday too 
 i seen you here a lot '' 
 my fiancee smiles and is like oh yeah 
 i 've never seen you here 
 what 's your name '' 
 and we start <unk> and laughing while this <unk> <unk> just watches with disbelief 
 then after like 45 seconds i 'm like you wan na go grab some lunch 
 i 'm always hungry after the gym because i lift so fuckin hard '' and flash my 25 pound weights 
 she 's like oh that sounds good 
 if you want to come over to my place i can cook for you '' 
 so we start to walk off and the fratboy is like uh dude what the fuck is your problem '' 
 and i turn around flash a douchey smile and i 'm like oh sup bro '' 
 still in character 
 he 's like the fuck you <unk> me for dog 
 you interrupted me 
 that 's fucked up '' 
 i can tell this guy is about as smart as a six year old so i drop the routine and i 'm like hey dude relax this is actually my fiancee '' 
 but he does n't back off 
 he 's like i do n't care you never <unk> on another dude never 
 that 's some fucked up shit yo '' 
 at this point i 'm just standing there with my mouth open not even sure what this guy 's problem is and surprised he does n't get that we were joking 
 he turns to my fiancee and he 's like this guy 's a douche you should drop him '' to which she gets <unk> her father is some navy <unk> so she swears like a fucking sailor and says get the fuck over yourself you are n't going to pick up chicks in a gym '' 
 then he shouts fuck you bitch '' 
 right at her and throws up a middle finger 
 everybody in the gym stops what they 're doing and turns to look at the situation 
 my fiancee never one to back down from a challenge goes to flip the guy off and call him a name but i grab her and <unk> her out of the gym 
 neither of us were done working out but uh i think we 're probably gon na take a week off before going back 
 edit : **tl dr : ** some dude thought my fiancee was single 
 i walked up and introduced myself to her stealing her from him 
 he got super mad and flipped out 
 **edit 2 : ** for the people who are telling me i 'm a jerk i agree with you i think that actually most of the blame is on my shoulders not the fratboy 's 
 i humiliated a dude who was n't really doing anything wrong 
 just being a little douchey that 's all 
 his reaction was unnecessary but so was my trick on him 
 that is one of the many reasons this is a tifu 
 for the people who are calling me a <unk> for not <unk> a person in a gym with security <unk> uhh okay thanks for the advice 
 what would the judge have said 
 some guy said something mean so you tried to kill him with a <unk> 
 there 's no way i 'd come out on top after that 
 i did the right thing - i did n't escalate the situation further 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- **edit 3 : ** people are flipping out about this post it 's ridiculous 
 let me address some of the pm 's that are <unk> my inbox : 1. she was not wearing an engagement ring 
 at the gym 
 i have never seen someone wearing an expensive ring at the gym 
 perhaps i 'm being too incredulous but who would do this 
 are there married women reading this 
 do you wear your ring at the gym 
 should we 
 is this supposed to be a thing 
 2. there are people giving me relationship advice that <unk> to me they have never <unk> with a woman ever 
 you do n't own your fiancee 
 you can not control who she speaks to 
 and for those with zero self esteem a woman will not run off with someone else because they hit on her and you did n't murder him 
 and if your girl leaves you because you refused to get in a fist fight over <unk> shit* then trust me you are <unk> better off without <unk> 
 3. if a guy hits on your girl do n't take it as an insult 
 take it as a compliment 
 <unk> is not attractive and it will result in her cheating or leaving 
 i guarantee it 
 i advise you not to get into a fist fight with someone if they insult your girl 
 if they <unk> her of course they deserve to get batman 'd 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- **final edit : ** about 10 folks have <unk> 'd me calling me a beta '' for not <unk> this guy 
 trust me when i say that if you think in terms of alpha '' and beta '' i can guarantee you three things : a 
 nobody needs relationship advice from you 
 ever 
 b. you are single 
 and not by choice 
 1000 % guarantee 
 c. *you* are a beta '' 
 because only someone with no self esteem at all would have to <unk> men like this and then assert that they themselves are an <unk> know this is not how these things normally work but this literally happened 5 minutes ago 
 i just woke up from a crazy dream probably caused by my new anxiety medication 
 in my dream i 'm at a party trying to get some homework done like the usual college student 
 when my girlfriend nonchalantly tells me this guy from my <unk> class is trying to sexual assault her 
 as you can imagine i am pissed 
 i find the asshat and he runs away 
 i decide to shower in the rain then i confront him again 
 this time he tells me some details about the assault 
 at this point i am done dream me is jacked like <unk> and is going to tear this guy up 
 i throw my first punch but barely <unk> him i <unk> the dream physics 
 he goes to throw his punch 
 but before he even interprets what 's happening i perfectly execute the most <unk> elbow directly to his face i 've ever seen 
 i woke up to my girlfriend cussing me out like no tomorrow and refusing to acknowledge that elbow was meant for her <unk> 
 now i am typing this out as she is sleeping in the other room 
 obligatory <unk> n't happen today but when i was 9. this post was inspired by the recent askreddit thread about your first experience with the internet 
 anyway do you remember when there were those <unk> things way back 
 sort of like myspace but less focussed on the social aspect of it and more of a blog type of thing 
 well this happened around <unk> and a friend of mine was all hyped out about his own webpage 
 he would put pictures of cool cars and football players on there 
 as a result of this i was stoked about making my own page to put weird spongebob pictures and <unk> sets that i liked on there 
 well in <unk> google 's <unk> was n't that advanced yet and i stumbled upon <unk> images during searches on the 4th page of images 
 being young and innocent i thought these images were exciting and in its own way funny 
 in my <unk> i added some of these images on my website 
 i did n't know much about sex yet and it was a topic that i had not yet been <unk> about 
 i continued to add more and more search results of <unk> 'vagina <unk> on the webpage 
 now here comes the cringey part 
 my father had seen the website when it was still mostly a collection of cars and cartoons and thought it would be cute to show his coworkers my creation 
 however by the time he actually showed them the website i had created had literally become a collection of porn 
 it must have been embarrassing as fuck expecting an innocent list of cool cars but instead showing a full on porn site your son created 
 that 's when i got the talk about sex and internet safety and all that 
 tl dr : unknowingly created porn site dad shows it to his <unk> am currently 19. female 
 i have always had issues getting to sleep and to this day i still have n't had it sorted out ... so when i was 11 years old my dad took me to a sleep clinic to have some tests run on me over a few weeks and hopefully get some answers 
 well at the clinic they gave me a black wristband with a little black device on it and told me to wear it on my wrist for the next 2 weeks 
 i really do n't remember them telling me what it was and being quite young and well stupid ... i did n't bother guessing or even care 
 so at this age i was a pretty frequent masturbator ... i know it 's pretty young to start off but i probably did it every <unk> night just before i went to sleep 
 i continued this night-time tradition as usual even with this weird black thing on my wrist 
 2 weeks have gone by the wristband has been sent back to the clinic and my appointment there to discuss my sleeping patterns is in a few days 
 i arrive at the sleep clinic with my dad and we are brought into a room with a large screen inside displaying a graph 
 we sit down 
 the sleep pathologist 
 points to the graph and says : this graph displays your sleeping patterns over the last 2 weeks 
 pretty cool huh 
 we measured your heart-rate to see when you enter each stage of sleep when and for how long etc '' 
 so 
 i am looking at this graph ... and for those who have n't put 2 and 2 together by now ... buckle in 
 i look at how my heart-rate <unk> throughout the day ... and throughout the night 
 it is so obvious the spike in my heart-rate at around <unk> or whenever the fuck i went to bed back then 
 and so my orgasms in fucking graph form were on a screen and my dad and this fucking pathologist are all looking at it like : <unk> how interesting yeah wow well in the awkward cold white room i am sitting there and i can feel my face go red hot and i start sweating a bit and then the pathologist says : you know ... at night-time ... before you go to sleep ... if you ever hear any strange noises outside like rustling or even people ... do you get scared '' 
 i stutter : a little i guess yeah '' ... he explains to me that he thinks i might be becoming alert at night fairly often because i get frightened by noises happening outside ... and he points to my orgasms in graph form and explains that here i become alert 
 he tells me that in the future i should n't worry about scary noises or things that i hear because i am safe 
 so that was the most fucking awkward experience of my childhood and it is still so clear in my head ... i just hope to <unk> that my dad bought into the possibility that i was having <unk> heart-rate <unk> due to some fucking <unk> rustling in a tree outside or something 
 & gt & gt tldr : my heart-rate was measured over 2 weeks and my <unk> orgasms were displayed on a graph for my dad to see and a professional to point them out and discuss them as me being possibly frightened '' which might disturb my <unk> the obligatory this did n't actually happen today but tuesday 
 our kids finally went back to school after the break and we had the house to ourselves 
 husband was doing paperwork online before going in to work 
 he came out into the living room to talk with me 
 i decided i 'd try and be playful and take advantage of the empty house 
 i crawled seductively across the room to try and get him to play 
 well what i forgot is that it 's winter and there 's absolutely no <unk> 
 so static everywhere 
 once i got to him i was kneeling and he bent down to kiss me 
 i thought hell yeah 
 i am a goddess and this is going to be awesome '' 
 i mean we have n't had sex out of our room let alone during daylight hours for over 3 weeks because of the kids always being around 
 as he bent down his nose brushed mine 
 all of that charge i built up crawling across the room then jumped from me to him and went up through his eye 
 he said he actually saw the flash 
 the pain abruptly ended any desire right then and there 
 and not only that it caused his eye to <unk> for the rest of the morning 
 tldr : i tried to seduce husband by crawling across the floor but instead shocked him so bad that he was left with a <unk> eye and no desire for <unk> i work on the 4th floor of a building while our secretaries are on the 1st 
 so the routine is when i take a smoke break i stop on the 1st just open the secretaries door to say i 'm going to smoke '' so they know i ca n't take calls for the next 5 minutes or so 
 so that day while in the stairs i let my thoughts wander and come to the conclusion that i ca n't wait to finish work so i can take a shit 
 because you know there is no place like home for that kind of things 
 anyway my brain being in auto pilot mode from the routine i open the secretaries door squeeze my head and say i 'm going to take a shit '' 
 it is just when i close the door and hear everyone laugh inside that i realize what i 've done ... happened 3 or 4 months ago and they still have that little smile when i say i 'm going to smoke 
 edit : wow thanks everyone glad you enjoyed it 
 so yeah no harm done here everyone had a good laugh myself included 
 i just thought that the huge embarrassment was worth a tifu and a share : just a reminder to everyone including whoever actually owns this <unk> to log out after being done with doing <unk> on public computers 
 -- not the guy who owns this account 
 edit : owner here was super confused opening reddit and having tons of replies in my inbox 
 thanks to whoever made this post and did n't subscribe to <unk> 
 edit2 : soo 1st on /r/all 
 idk if this is the best or the worst way to teach someone about leaving their accounts logged <unk> she had <unk> for about a week that it would be a turn on if i urinated on her 
 she said she had n't done it before it would be a first for both of us 
 a couple of nights ago i finally did it in the shower on her leg but she quickly dropped to catch it on her face 
 surprised my stream <unk> but once you start it 's hard to stop so i resumed <unk> on her awkwardly 
 lo and behold she had to bang right then and there so we did and it was awesome 
 later when we were having dinner she casually mentions that it 's weird how my pee tasted a bit sweet so i jokingly ask her how she knows what it 's meant to taste like 
 she did n't answer so i left it 
 while cleaning up she breaks down and tells me that she 'd had several <unk> do it before 
 this was the last lie in a series that ended the relationship 
 so far not too bad right 
 at lunch today i was <unk> a buddy with the story of how i ended things with the <unk> <unk> and ended it with hey at least she thought my piss was sweet haha '' 
 buddy is a <unk> student and immediately took me to a clinic.. til i have diabetes 
 ~~_____________________________________________~~ edit 2 : honest question how does feminism slutshaming etc some into this 
 she <unk> me into doing something i <unk> will be from now on super uncomfortable with saying we could share a first time '' together 
 i wanted to make this work since i forgave her for such massive things in the past and now i 'm a dick for ending shit with her because she asked her ex pissed in her mouth while we we were together 
 i was trying to understand everyone 's reactions but honestly some of you can just go fuck yourselves 
 ~~_____________________________________________~~ edit 3 : the humorous op who is this girl '' 
 replies aside can people stop asking is the girl 's name <unk> '' 
 i 'm pissed at her for the toxic relationship but i 'm not going to leak that kind of info 
 <unk> but seriously stop ~~_____________________________________________~~ edit for responses : to the silver lining people i like you people : i am actually glad that i know about it now and at this stage i guess it 's better than going <unk> 
 thanks for the encouragement and information 
 to the kink <unk> i get your reaction : i have to <unk> state here that it had very little to do with her hiding that she has a kink but rather who with and when 
 more on this in the following response 
 to the <unk> <unk> your curiosity is justified : if you believe that her hiding her kink was the only reason i broke up with her then i agree it 's petty 
 but no 
 when we first started she hid from me that she was still sleeping with her ex 
 to this day i am unsure if they broke up before or after we began but i am sure that after we went official '' she slept with her ex again when i was overseas and <unk> got kinky then 
 fun fact 1 : i found out from his friend that they banged who was surprised she and i got back together '' 
 fun fact 2 : she asked her ex to piss on her face when i was overseas for work 
 to the <unk> <unk> suck my sweet dick : see <unk> 
 i was getting my hair cut by a quite attractive woman and my mind was starting to wander 
 when she was finished with the cut i meant to ask her for a blow dry but i slipped and asked for a blowjob 
 i quickly told her what i meant and she just laughed it off 
 to see the original click here i walked into work today at 7am after ruining a $ 300k piece of art last wednesday 
 i had a meeting with my curator that reassured me that i would n't lose me job 
 he told me that next time i was sick i should tell him 
 i asked him what about linda 
 he told me not to worry about her 
 i carried on with my day anxiously waiting for the weekly work meeting that linda usually heads 
 it usually starts at noon but the curator started it early cause some big <unk> was coming in 
 long story short he told us linda resigned and will be going on to <unk> and better things and we should all keep her in our thoughts 
 now the curator is in charge of everyones <unk> for time off and he has his <unk> which i 'm one of 
 now half of my co-workers hate me and i ca n't walk into a room without getting dirty looks 
 tl dr - rip linda and <unk> i begin i just want you to understand i 'm not from the states i 'm from germany and currently attend ohio state university 
 this is also a throw away cause i do n't want it linked with my main anyway in america the culture shock is insane and i picked up a lot on the <unk> anyway 
 i met a very beautiful girl here and we hit it off 
 we are practically dating but not official yet 
 anyway we were getting to know each other and i mean really know each other she asked me everything from sex life dating life <unk> <unk> dreams hopes etc and throughout these questions she asked me one question that i did n't understand was too embarrassed to answer but did anyway 
 she asked me vanilla or kinky '' i did not understand what this meant it made no sense vanilla is an ice cream flavor but kinky made it obvious it was a sexual <unk> i just picked vanilla cause vanilla seemed less dirty 
 i knew she was sexually attracted to me to ask that so i just went with it.. in my head i thought vanilla was pouring vanilla on her and licking it off 
 after our conversation i decided to pick up vanilla ice <unk> cause i thought she wanted me to lick it off her 
 the next time we had sex i planned on pouring it on her and licking it off cause i thought that is what she was hinting at 
 either way we met up in her dorm room and we were getting into it and i took out the ice cream from my bag it melted a little and poured a big scoop of it on her body and she goes what the fuck '' and i 'm <unk> a bit and she says what are you even doing ... '' she was a little more calm now and i explained the whole <unk> turns out that vanilla means <unk> for some fucking reason vanilla meant regular 
 i felt like a retard beyond belief ... she laughed for a good 5 minutes and went to take a shower and i 'm sitting there thinking my god what the fuck is wrong with me ... .she was very cool about it though.. and we were still together '' but i will never live it down 
 i later skyped my family back home in germany and my mom was dying of laughter and my dad sat there with the stupidest look on his <unk> and now i 'm here typing this 
 automoderator is threatening me so here is tldr '' tldr : got asked vanilla or kinky thought vanilla meant pouring vanilla on girl and licking it off 
 did as such and <unk> my self 
 edit : its the 
 ohio state university '' do n't hang me 
 edit2 : whoever gilded me thank you so much but it 's a throw away ... it was a beautiful afternoon i was at my mate 's house <unk> with about 5 others and we were playing football soccer for the american folk out in his <unk> 
 we finished a while later and absolutely knackered lay motionless on the grass 
 for some reason i felt this burst of energy that needed to be relieved after a while so i hopped onto my mate 's bicycle and started riding around the street <unk> to his house 
 i was picking up some pretty decent speed and decided to bike in the direction of my mates who were now sitting on the steps in front of the house and brake just before i hit them 
 pretty routine thing i 've done this before 
 it was all just some good friendly banter right 
 i started biking in their direction and hit the brakes about 5 meters before so i could stop in time 
 to my misfortune the brakes must have taken offense in my treatment of them and decided to just cease to exist 
 at this moment i knew i was fucked and tried to slow down with my feet but to no avail 
 my mates managed to move out of the way last second and my bike hit the steps just as i was in this awkward <unk> position trying to jump out of the way which could honestly not have been worse 
 i fell forward onto the steps the handle pressing against my abdomen and heard a fair share of <unk> the fuck dude before it hit me 
 i felt a searing pain explode all the way up my genitals 
 it ran up my entire body and all color left my face 
 i jumped up and sprinted into the house and to the bathroom for some reason deciding to yell 'i think i cut my fucking cock off much to the amusement of the others 
 this was obviously met with laughter that i could hear from the bathroom as i furiously tore my pants off which were drenched in blood 
 it was all a big fucking mess blood coming from everywhere but i had no idea if the johnson was still <unk> 
 i started yelling bloody murder and his father ended up driving me to the hospital 
 that was the most <unk> awkward and painful car ride of my life i shit you not 
 * end of the day i had cuts and bruises all over my bishop and my urethra decided to collapse on itself 
 i 'm <unk> for a month or so meaning i 'm basically peeing through a tube up my <unk> 
 apparently there could be permanent damage but its too early to tell if my <unk> will ever be the same again 
 oh and my cunt ex decided to confess how she no longer has feelings for me that same day 
 and she would n't believe me about my injury thought i just wanted sympathy 
 only gets better from here <unk> : tldr : broke my <unk> edit : jesus christ this blew up 
 thank you everyone for your kind words <unk> should have used a throwaway in hindsight ... edit 2 : <unk> i regret nothing 
 edit 3 : my gold cherry has popped 
 my knob and i thank you kind stranger 
 edit 4 : three golds 
 i am not worthy of this <unk> i 'm a cashier at a grocery store 
 one of my friends is a regular and we joke around a lot usually it starts by me refusing to ring up her groceries and we have a few laughs from there 
 yesterday was a fairly busy day 
 i see her get in my line behind the customer i was ringing up 
 i finish the transaction so my friend is next 
 i 'm still putting money in my drawer so without looking up i loudly say ma'am we do n't serve your kind here '' 
 usually at this point my friend laughs and makes a remark right back at me but this time there was only silence 
 i look up and see not my friend but a black woman with a shocked look on her face 
 my heart drops into my feet and i start to apologize but she puts her basket on the floor and walks away 
 the front end manager was running the next register over and saw the whole thing 
 i was fired on the spot 
 i tried to explain the situation but she just said punch out and leave right now '' 
 i later found out that my friend had forgotten something and had to get out of my line 
 the black woman took her place 
 if i had looked up i would have seen 
 <unk> hearing is next thursday 
 edit : gold on a throwaway account 
 i wish i 'd discovered this subreddit earlier because i have a sad amount of tifu stories and this one is my favorite 
 i had just finished taking my final exam and was walking up to my professor to hand her the paper 
 after i handed her my exam i started thanking her for teaching such a fun class it was a class about sexuality and i loved it and as i was talking to her i noticed her arm reaching forward - about to hug me 
 i had a rapid panicky thought process 
 oh my god i 've never hugged a professor before 
 is this allowed 
 is this <unk> a <unk> relationship 
 does this mean we 're friends 
 but i liked this professor and did n't want to be cold to her so i immediately raised my arms to hug her back 
 but i was so nervous so i sort of <unk> forward to hug her back 
 my arms were almost around her and her arm was hovering above my shoulder when i saw her face suddenly look shocked then she started to laugh 
 i looked over my shoulder behind me and i realized she had been reaching behind me to grab another student 's exam paper 
 i was mortified but my professor thought it was hilarious and ended up actually hugging me before i left the classroom in shame 
 she ended up choosing me as her ta later on in the year 
 edit : my professor did not choose me as her teaching assistant because i awkwardly hugged her 
 sorry i should 've been clearer that happened way way later and was intended to be a nice bonus to <unk> my <unk> story 
 and yes she is attractive but i would never never never ever flirt with her or anything like because i only see her as my professor 
 several years ago my wife and i were visiting a friend and her girlfriend for the weekend 
 on saturday night they threw a party with all of their friends most of whom were also lesbian couples 
 i saw that one girl had chinese characters tattooed on her <unk> so i asked to see them as i had recently been living in china 
 she was like oh they 're actually <unk> characters 
 this one 万 means 'man and this one <unk> means <unk> 
 basically i 'm trying to describe how all of us exist on a gender continuum between the two and <unk> parts of both into our identities to different degrees '' 
 i responded actually japanese characters <unk> and chinese characters <unk> are really the same thing 
 and i do n't think that one 万 means 'man 
 it actually means 'ten thousand 
 the correct character for man is 男 
 万 and 男 are n't that far off but the <unk> style on it would make it hard to replace ... '' i look up and this poor girl is literally in tears 
 the entire party had come to a <unk> as i <unk> embarrassed this kid in front of all her friends 
 she had had the tattoo done two or three years earlier and no one had ever caught it 
 i had to add on the bright side chinese does n't really have a <unk> so <unk> is a perfectly grammatical way of saying 'ten thousand women 
 make it a life goal '' 
 crickets ... edit courtesy of <unk> : tl dr : lesbian did n't check her facts and i gave her a life <unk> i was 18 i used to run food out to the customers for the local restaurant 
 but on my way to the table i happen to glance over to see a girl playing the virtual hunting <unk> game that you would see in the back of almost every restaurant 
 more particularly the shirt she was wearing 
 it was a workout shirt that had the holes for your arms cut down to about mid side leaving the entire side of her upper body exposed 
 how she only had a bra on underneath mixed with the way she was leaning left her entire boob just hanging out 
 when i saw this i walked over to one of my more favorite <unk> and said do you see that girl over there <unk> my head in her direction 
 she is hanging out if you know what i mean '' 
 she looked over at the girl and back at me and said you mean my daughter '' i was walking towards my bank to deposit a cheque into my account when i saw what i thought was two very small children about to cross a <unk> 
 i should point out i have to wear contact <unk> but they are not vital but to me everything past around <unk> just looks like a photoshopped blur i can tell what 's there but i ca n't make out distinct features 
 i walked faster to attempt to see whether they were just being stupid or whether they were actually going to cross 
 one of them took a step into the road to get a better look around a bus that was <unk> at the side of the road 
 this is when i thought to myself something really bad could happen 
 i started sprinting at them 
 they turned and looked at me and as my vision started to clear i had a surprise 
 looking back at me was a dwarf woman and what looked to be her grandson 
 i did n't know what to do so i just carried on sprinting and hopped on the bus 
 i looked at the driver and engaged him in conversation whilst the woman continued to eye me suspiciously 
 i whispered faintly i 'm just gon na confess i do n't have any money i just mistook that dwarf for a kid about to cross the road and it was just instinct '' .. the bus driver started giggling to himself and said he 'd drop me round the corner to spare everyone 's embarrassment 
 apart from mine 
 obviously 
 good guy though 
 edit : for all those criticising me about not wearing contacts i know the limitations of my eyes very well thank you 
 this is n't an everyday occurrence i wear them based on whether i 'll actually need them 
 they cost money 
 i 'm only slightly <unk> the fact i had to sprint to them should indicate i was at a distance that most people might have second guessed 
 edit 2 : thanks for the gold 
 much appreciated 
 this was n't today this was about 18 years ago but it haunts me every day 
 when i was about 6 i had a friend from school who was n't quite with it 
 i 'd been <unk> with him as a result of my mum and his mum working together 
 his mum was really worried about him and felt that he was acting strangely because he had no friends 
 when i say acting strangely he had recently collected all of his parents clothes in the front room and set them on fire then sat by the window waiting for superman to arrive 
 strange <unk> '' 
 so he 's at my house one day and we 're playing some stupid superhero game when he comes out with 'you know the flash 
 i can actually run faster than him 
 so i call bullshit and he says 'no seriously i have n't shown anyone because i do n't want them to take me away and do experiments but i 'll show you if you promise to keep it secret 
 so my 6 year old brain is now becoming slightly more convinced and he suggests as means of proof that we should get my hamster bring it to the top of the stairs throw it down and he would <unk> race down and catch it before it hit the ground 
 so off we pop hamster in tow he throws it down the stairs before he even takes one step it <unk> against the wall at the bottom 
 i stared at him for a few seconds in utter shock 
 i have a sobering moment of clarity thinking <unk> course he could n't do it why the fuck did i think he could 
 i burst out crying mum comes out sees dead hamster i never see that kid again 
 do n't even remember his name 
 fucking idiot 
 this actually happened years ago when i was in 1st grade however i just remembered it while reading another post and decided to share it with whoever gives a fuck 
 so in first grade some friends and i decided to dig a hole to china 
 we could n't let any of the teachers know our evil plan however so we decided to hide the hole when we were not working on it 
 we first dug under the home plate on the baseball field yet we soon found out the hole was too wide to hide under the plate everyday 
 we had been digging this hole for the better part of a week now so it was getting pretty big 
 so we made a <unk> out of sticks and leaves and put some of the dirt over it to hide the hole 
 it was actually a pretty good job too because evidently about a week later when the baseball team came out to <unk> by running laps around the plates someone fell into our pit of death and broke their leg and as they fell down in pain also broke their arm 
 they also had several sticks we had used to cover the pit stuck in their leg 
 needless to say we did n't tell anyone that we dug the hole and it is now our fault that <unk> hill elementary school does n't allow anyone to go onto the baseball field during <unk> 
 tl dr- dug a hole to china accidentally created a <unk> broke someones arm and leg while impaling them with sticks 
 edit - wow thanks for the gold and funny comments you filthy <unk> 
 so some questions i read : 1. how did we dispose of the sand 
 well we just threw it behind us or flattened out the pile when it was made 
 i do n't really remember any of the teachers giving a fuck because we used to play boys vs girls which is basically when a mob of boys with military ranks charge the girl groups that always played ... <unk> what the girls played ... but we would charge them and beat each other up in big fights for fun 
 i think they were just happy we decided to dig instead of murder each other 
 2. how did we dig 
 well to be honest with sticks and our hands 
 what took us 4 days i can do now in 30 minutes with a shovel 
 so piss off <unk> 
 edit - anyone who thinks that a bunch of little kids dug a hole deep enough for someone to fall into and break a leg and arm needs to go bury themselves 
 the hole was like 3 feet deep he fell in up to his thigh and the momentum of his run combined with the angle of the trapped leg caused the break 
 when he then fell he fell on his arm at a similar angle and the downward pressure caused either the radius or the <unk> to fracture as well i 'm not sure if it was compound or not all i know is that the fucker had a cast on 
 the sticks were stuck in his legs and some cut his <unk> this happened about 2 months ago i 'm a cook at a small family owned restaurant but i can fill in for the <unk> when they need which is what i was doing on that <unk> day 
 im a pretty quiet guy so <unk> and hosting is a bit out of my element so i was already uncomfortable enough as it was 
 then this middle aged overeweight couple came in looking for a table to sit at 
 these people were probably 300 lbs each keep in mind i would never judge them or make fun of them 
 i asked them as i ask all parties that come in how many people they had 
 this is where it starts to go south they said two but in a loud restaurant and being far away i somehow heard 5. they asked to sit in the bar but i told these two overeweight people thinking they needed a table for 5 that our biggest table in the bar was for 4 but they could probably fit '' 
 the man looked at me funny and said ok ... we will just sit here pointing at a booth that also seats 4. i said ok would you like me to get an extra chair to put on the end for more space '' 
 this time the man looked angry and said its ok i can fit my <unk> in here '' 
 at this point i was starting to realize something was up so i tried to explain myself by saying that i just wanted them to have enough space 
 this didnt help my case 
 the man now looked furious and asked what my problem was 
 i then realized what could be the problem and asked how many people were with them they told me 2 and i then apologized and explained my confusion 
 the man didnt think it was funny though and i avoided them all night 
 i did tell my manager what happened and she laughed her ass off 
 tl dr : thought a fat couple wanted a table of 5 when they only wanted a table for 2 repeatedly told them they couldnt fit at a table for 4. edit : <unk> happened in the last 24 hours 
 will provide proof below 
 so i just moved to a new area and i 'm pretty active in the online dating scene 
 i have an account on several different websites because why the fuck not 
 about five days ago i start talking to this girl who we 'll call heather 
 i 'm 24 and she 's 24. perfectly normal type of thing 
 we 've been texting for the last couple of days things seem to be going well and we were planning on getting lunch at some point in this upcoming week 
 i 'm looking for a relationship and heather seems to be as well so we 're on the same page about our intentions 
 however i will sometimes browse the older women anywhere from mid 30s to upper <unk> on the website and if i 'm intrigued enough i 'll send them a message 
 well last night i was browsing through older women and ended up finding a few that caught my eye so i send them a message which basically reads hey 
 this is random but i thought you were cute 
 i know i 'm out of your age range but do you have any interest in hanging out with a younger guy '' 
 one of these women jane sends me a message back that reads i 'm flattered but you 're as old as my daughter 
 perhaps i should introduce you two '' 
 oh '' i thought 
 that 's nice but a little strange '' 
 still i did n't think much of it 
 i had n't heard from heather since yesterday evening so i sent her a text several hours ago asking how her day was going 
 here was her response i guess heather and i are n't getting lunch <unk> 
 tldr : i was hit by a <unk> bullet while trying to <unk> <unk> 
 edit : caught a few <unk> edit 2 : for those saying i 'm a douche bag for talking to other women ... i had n't even met this girl yet and had only been texting her since like thursday 
 you all need to relax 
 edit 3 : a few more details 
 i talked to both on different websites 
 so it was super unexpected 
 i also live in a major city so the odds of this happening are extremely <unk> 
 and no i 'm not posting a picture of the two 
 this is a fuckup that spans nearly two years 
 a while back i had a spine surgery <unk> adolescent scoliosis 
 it meant my back literally started twisting 
 painful shit and the worst case the surgeon had ever seen 
 anyway <unk> my parents agreed that for actually going through with it *the surgery did have a small chance to completely <unk> me from the waist down which probably would have <unk> into me having to go to <unk> as <unk> from payday 2* they would buy me a gaming pc 
 not some <unk> <unk> <unk> no but certainly a <unk> 
 so for the past two years i 've been playing with it talking to friends on it and doing relatively <unk> screenshots in garry 's mod 
 however despite its <unk> as a 'gaming pc i was slightly <unk> by how it performed 
 it was ... average 
 it was only today that i realized something i 'd done wrong 
 in a moment of irritation whilst the display kept freezing up and frames were terrible i looked online to see if there was a means of fixing it 
 and there it was a diagram of the back of a pc 
 sweet let 's do this 
 you had the integrated processor with its own built-in graphics right ... ... and the two <unk> <unk> at the bottom of the pc 
 i then checked my pc 
 i 'd had my display connected to the wrong place 
 <unk> two years 
 *** i took this as nothing major and changed where it was plugged in 
 then i loaded up payday 2 and was <unk> brought to <unk> when i saw the incredible 70fps i was getting on <unk> <unk> 
 **tl dr** : my pc hid its power level from me for two years because i 'm shite at plugging things in 
 **edit** : right let 's clarify a few things 
 no i am not an advertising agent of any kind 
 i 'm a teenage lad with a job <unk> shelves in a supermarket 
 no i am not retarded 
 to those who have said i 'm mentally retarded because the surgery <unk> my <unk> failed i think you might need to rethink that statement 
 i do n't know why it would n't <unk> the graphics cards over the integrated graphics 
 it was <unk> they were on the system and for the whole time i had n't connected them properly i was installing driver updates with no problems 
 it only properly began using them when i plugged my monitor into the graphics cards 
 to me 70fps on payday 2 is fucking amazing probably because i 'm used to it going at about <unk> 
 garry 's mod was an alright benchmark for graphics since it was able to <unk> more advanced lighting with few problems 
 any other games i played in the time i had n't connected my graphics card normally got put on the <unk> settings and reached relatively high <unk> 
 the surgery went fine 
 i am now worth <unk> more because of the metal and i work long shifts and do construction work from time to <unk> acct 
 when i was 7 an older cousin informed me that it was common courtesy to after using a public restroom for # 2 leave a <unk> size amount of toilet paper around the handicap bar so the next person would have one ready when they go 
 now 22 first big boy job do this every day in the public bathroom 
 think all of my coworkers are rude for not leaving me any 
 someone sent an email around requesting the courtesy <unk> me to stop wasting paper 
 i reply what about courtesy paper '' to <unk> at which point i discover that i was <unk> for 15 years 
 also whenever i spotted courtesy paper i happily used it for 15 years 
 say what you will reddit 
 edit : spelling 
 e2 : wow 
 pictures to follow on <unk> 
 check back <unk> : hey guys here 's an imgur album 
 enjoy 
 i do n't usually use imgur so please let me know if i tifu 'd again 
 <unk> : wow 
 reddit gold 
 thanks anonymous user 
 i thought this would just get a few upvotes and laughs 
 did n't realize i would make it to the front and get gilded 
 <unk> : please do n't forget to leave <unk> <unk> so i 'm a short white girl and i work at a chinese restaurant 
 part of my job is putting food in boxes for you at the end of your meal 
 i do n't know why i 'm not supposed to let you do it but i 'm not 
 in any case a few nights ago i was <unk> up some food for a table of huge black dudes 
 as i was putting their <unk> <unk> in one box i was thinking ahead to where the rice would go 
 some people are particular about separating food though i prefer to conserve boxes and just put all that shit in one cuz who are you kidding all chinese food tastes the same after a night in the fridge so i decide to ask these guys what their preference would be 
 what i meant to say was would you prefer to <unk> the brown and the white rice '' 
 instead what i said was would you prefer to <unk> the brown and the white rice '' 
 they bust out laughing and i was really embarrased and if you were wondering they were cool with putting all the rice in one box 
 tl dr : was racist but it was cool this happened this past thanksgiving weekend 
 <unk> : i 've been helping my gf move apartments this past week 
 we found a pair of handcuffs in her closet a gag gift from her best friend which i silently decided to keep for a rainy day 
 <unk> : fast-forward to this past saturday night my girlfriend and i were headed to bed one thing lead to another and our clothes came off 
 using my noggin to think <unk> i decided to bust out the handcuffs - nothing crazy or anything - but long story short my girlfriend 's hands were chained to the bed post above her head while i went about my business which went well for the both of us thank you for asking 
 finally it came time to remove the handcuffs ... which is exactly when i realized that these were n't exactly toy handcuffs there was no quick-release button usually reserved for the toy variety and they appeared to be made out of hardened metal and that in my infinite wisdom i had taken them without actually having the key to them 
 <unk> : commence about 2 full hours of me apologizing profusely to my gf looking up pick your handcuffs with a bobby pin videos on youtube which surprisingly were of no help at all for some reason and trying to <unk> the links and finally the cuffs themselves with metal cutters to absolutely no avail i realized that i had myself in somewhat of a pickle 
 throughout all of this my girlfriend bless her heart was in surprisingly good spirits about the whole thing despite her hands being chained to the post above her head which was very uncomfortable and lacking somewhat in the clothing department 
 <unk> : having exhausted all <unk> options and not wanting to call a specialist i decided to break out my small <unk> rotary <unk> with a spinning bit meant for cutting through tiny bits of metal 
 long story short after convincing my girlfriend that i would be safe about the whole thing and that she should remain still i gave her safety goggles and covered her hands with cloth i was able to cut through the links that hold the handcuffs together but not through the cuffs themselves 
 freedom from the <unk> at last 
 <unk> : at this point we decided to get my gf dressed and call a 24-hour locksmith 
 the cuffs around her wrists were n't an emergency but by no means comfortable for her and i was feeling really bad for her at this point 
 locksmith did n't show despite repeated calls and we ended up falling asleep for the night handcuffs and all 
 <unk> : got dressed and headed for the nearest sex shop to buy another pair of handcuffs complete with key from pictures online the key seems pretty <unk> 
 girlfriend decided to come with me since she was up by this point and wanted to come along for the ride 
 of course the sex stores near us were closed on sun so we had to head a bit farther for some luck 
 <unk> : sex shop had plenty of handcuffs - though none with our exact brand 
 apparently the ones on my gf were very old and from a company that was no longer in business ... great 
 we bought the set with the <unk> key and tried it in the car 
 no luck 
 apparently while most handcuff keys look the same the specific sizing <unk> by brand 
 <unk> : found 2 more sex shops still no luck yes we did a lot of driving 
 decided at this point to call more <unk> although this was a slightly more embarrassing prospect for my gf ... no luck here as they were either 1 somewhat hesitant about the situation potential <unk> or <unk> 2 thought it was a prank or 3 had some unprofessional response like what 've you been foolin around '' 
 in a rude way which made us uncomfortable 
 <unk> : decided screw it we 're going to the police / fire station 
 this was by far the most embarrassing prospect for my gf but with all of our options exhausted we did n't want to go to the hospital and i figured the police might have a matching key or the fire station could cut them off 
 <unk> : the people at the fire station were very professional and had a matching key 
 my girlfriend came into the station after i gave her the ok and they took them off 
 i guess the handcuffs we used were somehow <unk> and their key worked perfectly with them 
 i asked the helpful fireman an older gentleman if he had seen this predicament before - he said no gave us a <unk> smile and did n't ask us any questions that would make an <unk> situation even more awkward 
 i was somewhat surprised that they did n't run our information but i guess my girlfriend did n't look like the felon type 
 very very nice people overall 
 <unk> : took my girlfriend out to sunday brunch 
 it 's the least she deserved after being <unk> by her bf on a sunny thanksgiving weekend 
 the end 
 **tl dr** : handcuffed my girlfriend to the bed 
 firefighters had to save her 
 edit : proof edit 2 : more pictures / link to the actual handcuffs model edit 3 : the comments got me researching the handcuffs a bit more and i realized that they have a built-in <unk> mechanism here is a picture of the double lock on my set the holes on the side along the black part are the double locking mechanism 
 i am thinking this could possibly explain why i had so much trouble picking the lock using the bobby pin approach given that my first course of action was <unk> to engage the double lock using a pin thinking it would be some sort of quick-release mechanism similar to the <unk> button on your <unk> 
 oh well the stupidity continues 
 tried the <unk> technique on the broken cuffs today - it worked very well 
 wish i had known about it earlier 
 ps looked closer at the <unk> on the cuffs 
 it says <unk> handcuff <unk> fond du <unk> <unk> '' 
 a quick google search tells me the company might still be in business although their actual website is n't working 
 girlfriend is in good condition and we had a good laugh about it all 
 thank you for reading yall 
 edit 4 : first gold 
 thank you now off to figure out exactly what it does this actually happened last night 
 for those of you unfamiliar with the game seaman '' it 's a <unk> <unk> game for the sega dreamcast in which you raise small talking <unk> into two <unk> frogmen 
 the little dude asks you questions about your personal life and you respond to him via an attached microphone 
 he remembers the details and mentions them in future conversations 
 you have to play it once a day or he dies and you have to start from the beginning 
 anyway i had just met this really cool but shy <unk> girl last weekend and we hit it off 
 she shares my love of video games and is actually really good at them 
 she 's also gorgeous which is a plus 
 i asked if she wanted to come to the house and meet my roommates and hang out 
 she showed up and we smoked a little weed 
 being baked i decided it would be a good idea to play some video games 
 i just remembered that i have n't fed the seamen yet so i asked her if she wanted to see one of the <unk> games ever made 
 she said yes so i powered it on and fed the two frogmen 
 what happened next left me aghast 
 i told her watch this '' and then turned on the mic and said hey what 's up seaman '' 
 the frogman replied * '' hello it 's good to see you home tonight instead of out on a weekday 
 a few days ago i asked you if you had someone special in your life and you told me you did n't 
 so tell me do you now have a special <unk> in your life 
 * this question came outta nowhere and caught me off guard 
 the girl 's face was <unk> red 
 uh yeah '' i responded 
 * '' so you do have a lady friend 
 so let me ask you is she the one 
 * <unk> do n't know '' i replied 
 i just met her '' 
 i do n't think the answer registered with frogman 
 * '' <unk> just answer the question 
 let me ask you again is she the one 
 * i do n't know '' 
 frogman with a shitty look on his face said * '' you know you really should n't stay with someone just because it 's convenient because then you 're wasting your time 
 alright i 'm all talked out for today 
 * he then hopped off 
 she looked pretty creeped out by this point 
 i said so yeah i told you it was a weird game '' 
 **tldr : talking virtual frog totally killed the mood 
 ** *** update : wow did n't expect this kind of response 
 also thanks for popping my <unk> cherry internet stranger 
 since so many have asked i 'm still talking to the girl who saw this post and thought it was pretty funny 
 she also wants to play the game now so maybe i can show her my seamen again 
 many have doubted the <unk> of this fuck-up and have even doubted the existence of such an old game with such an advanced ai 
 the ai '' is not advanced and just gives <unk> answers to simple commands 
 about 90 % of the shit seaman asks you are <unk> questions 
 a user mentioned they had found the question that i was asked by frogman 
 he gives a different response in this scenario since the player states he is still single 
 i decided to read a faq about this game to find the exact <unk> and this question apparently leads into a conversation in which seaman asks to be set free to find his true love '' which means i can finally wash my hands of this slimy douchebag frog 
 many have asked how to play this game 
 it 's only on dreamcast 
 i think the only <unk> that supports the microphone is <unk> which still ca n't run seaman as far as i know 
 hello redditors 
 well this story did n't happen today not yesterday but it happened about 8 years ago 
 just to give you a little background about me 
 my name is dylan i 'm 22 years old and i live on the beautiful island of malta 
 i would also like to apologize on behalf of my vocabulary punctuation spelling mistakes & amp structure <unk> 
 this is my first time writing on reddit 
 hell this is my first time in a long time since i <unk> writing but enough about me and lets get into the story 
 i was 14 at the time and my parents were invited to attend a wedding 
 i had just started to earn the trust of my parents 
 it was a very rare occasion to be left alone at home 
 i mean my parents had it coming right 
 so without any hesitation i decided to throw a house party 
 called up my best friend brian and told him everything i had been planning 
 i continued to invite 4 other close friends of mine - bogart charlie tom & amp eric 
 we were all too much excited about this party 
 we had started preparing from weeks before 
 you see we had never been to a house party let alone host one 
 the day had arrived 
 brian and i started doing preparations for the party 
 we went to a local bar and bought a pack of pint plastic glasses orange and pineapple juice 3 packs of cigarettes some snacks and a 75 cl bottle of j & amp b and a 75 cl bottle of <unk> vodka at that time the drinking age was 16 years old 
 no one asks for i.d 
 here in malta no one gives a fuck really 
 now keep in mind that none of us had ever really drank alcohol before apart from the occasional beer that we used to split between god knows how many people and a few sips of cheap cooking wine 
 brian bogart and i are neighbors 
 we literally live a few seconds from each other 
 charlie tom & amp eric lived about 20 mins from my village so they had their parents dropping them off at my house 
 we all agreed to tell our parents that we would be meeting at my house and that we were going to watch a movie at a cinema which is about a 30 minute walk from my home 
 the clock struck 8 p.m. and my parents were gone 
 my friends started arriving one by one 
 i put on an <unk> cd i burnt into my hi-fi <unk> it was some <unk> music played by <unk> <unk> if i remember correctly 
 i remember it was <unk> at that time because it resembled something out of my gameboy 's music 
 i started pouring about a quarter vodka in each glass mixing it with orange or pineapple juice 
 we <unk> the drinks and i yelled the last one to down this glass is gay 
 now looking back iv'e got ta say bogart really took that to heart 
 he downed that pint of vodka in mere seconds with everyone following afterwards 
 big surprise i downed it last 
 i still get nauseous by that horrible taste of vodka 
 straight away we started to get drunk 
 one glass would of made that night epic for all the right reasons not for the wrong ones 
 we chatted a bit laughed and pulled some pranks on each other whilst sipping on another pint of vodka pineapple 
 we proceeded to take the party to my parent 's room i do n't know why 
 grabbed a pack of playing cards started shuffling them and we started playing poker 
 well some card game that resembled poker at least 
 this is when shit stared hitting the fan 
 we had almost finished the vodka bottle only a couple of shots left so to make things interesting anyone who lost a hand had to take a shot of vodka mixed with j & amp b whiskey kids do n't 
 worst 
 idea 
 ever 
 we were all pretty drunk already 
 bogart got a really <unk> streak 
 he lost hand after hand after hand 
 oh my god i swear iv'e never seen anyone drink as much as he did in the space of 10 minutes 
 all <unk> started breaking loose in my parents room 
 charlie spilled a whole bottle of orange juice on to my parents bed sheets brian and tom laughing their asses off eric was running through my parents drawers i was too drunk to give a fuck and bogart was hopping on my parents bed like a 6 year old 
 all of a sudden we hear a big strange bang 
 bogart miss timed a jump and ended up landing on the back of his head on the wooden drawers 
 he was just out of it 
 do n't think he remembers anything from that point on 
 we really did n't know what had just happened we did n't see him hit the back of his head we just saw him on the floor dazed 
 he started slurring his words 
 he 's just really drunk '' we said and continued with the party 
 my parents had a secret stash of porn in their room and i started showing them to everyone 
 someone had the most brilliant idea of putting a porno in the dvd player for bogart to watch so he can start to sober up 
 i gave him a roll of toilet paper put in the dvd and left him alone 
 it had started to get late 
 we already had been drinking for about 2 hours or so so we stopped drinking since some parents were going to pick some of my friends up in an hour or so 
 we smoked a couple of cigarettes and i decided to go check on bogart as he had been there for 15 mins or so 
 in fact he was so quiet that we had totally forgot about him 
 as soon as i opened up the door i hear a loud smack 
 his head was standing in front of the door 's path 
 the door vibrated with the <unk> effect 
 he was unconscious 
 he could n't talk he could n't walk 
 he was out of it 
 he was passed out like it was new years eve in <unk> a couple of seconds later charlie opens the door while bogart was still laying on the floor 
 bang the door hit him square on his head again with a bigger impact then the one before 
 at that point seeing the state he was in lying on the floor naked drooling out of his mouth jizz on his <unk> we sobered up just by looking at him 
 it stated hitting me 
 it was getting late and he was still unconscious 
 what are we going to do 
 so we carefully picked him up which proved to be quite the challenge we put him in the tub and started washing him with cold water just to try to wake him up 
 reality was starting to hit hard 
 we started panicking 
 he was n't waking up he just laid in tub motionless 
 eric started smacking him in the face whilst letting his head hit the tub every time he slapped him 
 when all of a sudden he opened his eyes and stood upright in the tub 
 we were jubilant 
 we started clapping <unk> each other on the back we even started chanting his name 
 the look on his face was n't quite just right though 
 about 10 seconds after ... he threw up on his bushy penis 
 closed his eyes and went unconscious again whilst hitting his head on the tub again as he leaned back 
 about 5 minutes passed and bogart 's phone stated ringing 
 it was his mum 
 some <unk> background on his mum 
 we were all scared shitless of bogart 's mum 
 i really do n't know her that well to say anything bad about her i 'm sure anything she did she had her reasons for it but i had seen a younger bogart get a couple of the loudest yells iv'e ever heard and quick <unk> from her when he was n't <unk> 
 let me put it this way 
 she burnt all of his pokemon trading cards when we were younger just because she heard someone say that they were the devil 's playing cards 
 he had a 1st <unk> charizard 
 she was mad in my books 
 so bogart 's phone started ringing and we were in panic 
 what are we going to do 
 what are we going to say 
 i gave the phone to tom and told him to stick to the story 
 tell her we were at the cinema 
 this is how it went 
 tom picks up phone - hello '' 
 bogart 's mum - bogart 
 can i speak to bogart please '' tom - well bogart ca n't talk to you at the moment 
 we were at the cinema watching a movie 
 during the <unk> yes we have <unk> in the middle of a movie in malta he told us that he was going to buy a coke and some snacks 
 he said he would be right back 
 the movie finished and bogart never came back to his seat 
 we went looking around for him until we found him laying next to a garbage skip unconscious 
 now we 're at dylan 's house 
 bogart 's mum - <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 she hung up 
 we just kept staring at tom 
 his <unk> just made this whole ordeal worse 
 all shit started breaking loose 
 in a space of a minute we hid all of the evidence 
 the alcohol the cigarettes cups 
 we washed bogart no one wanted anything to do with his now <unk> bushy penis so we left that as that 
 we picked bogart up off from the tub and dressed him up 
 charlie and eric bailed out 
 they said each of their parent 's had arrived simultaneously but we all know you guys were scared shitless 
 to this day i have n't seen a more dramatic scene then what was about to occur 
 much more drama then a <unk> <unk> movie 
 we hear four loud knocks on the door 
 the door never had received such a banging 
 i went to open the door whilst diarrhea <unk> out of my shorts 
 as soon as i opened she rushed in yelling where is bogart 
 she ran through the house 
 found him in the bathroom just unconscious as he will ever be 
 she grabbed him by his shirt and lifted him up against the wall like it was nothing 
 what did you do '' 
 <unk> in the face* what did you take '' 
 *harder slap in the face* 
 what did he do 
 where did you find him '' 
 we kept sticking to our stories and told her what tom had already said to her 
 she dragged bogart through the corridor put him right next to the door when bogart 's father arrived 
 the man was inflamed 
 his face all red <unk> his teeth together 
 what a sight that was 
 one handed he grabbed him by his shirt pulled him up he did n't need a wall to support his dead weight and started smacking him all over the face 
 bogart 's dad in a <unk> tone - <unk> did <unk> <unk> '' 
 <unk> <unk> '' bogart 's mum - <unk> do n't hurt him '' 
 she had already slapped a tooth away after some more yelling his dad picked him up and lifted him on to his shoulder opened the door and his had <unk> on the side of the solid wood door 
 all in total he hit his head five times not to mention all the slapping on his face 
 i thought to myself that it was finally over 
 once again i was sadly mistaken 
 brian tom and i started to clean up the house 
 we went and threw all of the alcohol cups juices & amp cigarettes in a field a few minutes away from my house 
 bogart left his wallet and phone behind so we went to give bogart 's parents his stuff back only to be greeted by blue flashing lights 
 bogart was getting <unk> into an ambulance and that is when we all realized that his condition could be worse then we had thought 
 it was really a heartbreaking site 
 neighbors gathering outside his mum crying her eyes out and his dad is still in shock 
 brian went to give them his stuff back 
 they gave us this horrible stare like they were saying this is all your fault 
 suddenly i was struck with this <unk> amount of guilt 
 tom decided to sleep over at brian 's house and i went back to my house to finish cleaning up and get some sleep 
 it was about 1 am and my parents still have n't arrived back home yet 
 i was in bed but my thoughts war n't allowing me to sleep 
 i felt like my mind was going crazy from all the guilt and worry i was feeling at the moment 
 i hear the telephone ringing 
 i picked it up and it was the doctor examining bogart at the hospital 
 he told me to explain in detail what had happened 
 he obviously did n't buy it 
 he told me it would be near impossible to lift bogart for that distance 
 he knew what he was talking about because we found it hard to lift him from the tub let alone lift him for a 30 minute walk from the cinema to my house 
 still i kept to the story and he ended hanging up on me 
 it was getting late and i managed to fall asleep barely 
 even in my dreams all i saw was guilt 
 i woke up at about 8 am and i find my mother in the hall way 
 the first thing she said was what is this smell of alcohol in the house 
 i could n't keep it in 
 i told everything that had happened the night before 
 better to tell her myself then to be told by someone else 
 my mum got all hysterical on my ass 
 very dramatic woman my mum 
 even remembering back i get agitated 
 my dad got woken up by my mum shouting at me 
 he seemed quite disappointed at me for not keeping my word about being left alone for a night 
 he seemed more disappointed by the fact that we woke him up at 8 am on a sunday though 
 being born as a christian i had n't went to church in a few years 
 i called up brian and told him to meet me outside so that we can go to sunday mass 
 at that time i thought that maybe going to church would help in relieving me of this guilt i was still carrying 
 desperately i pull a 5 <unk> note from my <unk> 14 year old pocket and put it in the collection plate to make things right with god again 
 haha 
 just about as the mass was finishing i get a call from my dad to meet up with him for a second 
 i got into the car and he explained to me that this stuff happens when you 're young 
 that i needed to learn from my mistakes and not repeat them 
 to not feel so shitty about my self for what happened to bogart 
 that he should of never drank that much in the first place 
 he told me sounds to me you guys had a pretty solid night '' 
 from that moment i was relieved of all my guilt 
 i had never been treated like that from my father 
 he realized that i was growing up and that he could n't treat me as if i was a child anymore 
 from that point on i had a different relationship with my dad quite different from the earlier 14 years 
 as for bogart well.. i was told that he ended up in the hospital with a grade 3 concussion alcohol <unk> and a tube coming out of his mouth and penis 
 in the end he <unk> safely within a day 
 brian got his internet connection <unk> as a request by bogart 's mum 
 she said brian was a bad influence on bogart and she did n't want him to communicate with him anymore 
 his dad plugged in the internet connection back again after 2 hours 
 everyone else received a call from bogart 's mother telling everyone 's parents what had happened the night before 
 i ended up getting away <unk> free <unk> i had already spilled my guts out 
 hope i did n't <unk> you with this long story for whom ever managed to read all of this 
 tl dr : threw a house party 
 5-7 shots of vodka mixed with j & amp b underage guest gets fucked up penis vomit & amp concussions <unk> & amp hospitals and a penis tube 
 edit - wow 
 we made it to the front page guys with 2500+ upvotes 
 i would of never have imagined such a huge feedback 
 i love you all guys 
 for the positive comments the negative ones and those that are just plain weird 
 thank you 
 some of you really lifted me up today 
 because of you guys i now know that maybe i stumbled on a talent that i had gave up on 
 i 'm my biggest <unk> and i do n't belief in myself enough to have that role 
 i ca n't stress enough how much this feedback means to me 
 it truly makes me jubilant inside knowing that i made someone laugh today 
 but also try to learn from my mistakes so you would n't have to be in the same situation yourself 
 things could of ended much much worse 
 looks like i fucked up a bit 
 forgot to mention that all names used in the story were all fictional due to keep all people involved in the story anonymous 
 sorry if i <unk> anyone 
 i know how you all love bogart 's name 
 i picked bogart just because i thought it would stand <unk> and it did 
 for all the haters this story is 100 % real 
 i wish that i was capable of writing a fiction story great as this 
 a huge surge of comments are coming in 
 i ca n't keep up 
 i will reply to many of them when i get the chance 
 i will be posting other crazy shit that happened to me on /r/tifu 
 so till next time redditors 
 lets hear it one more time for bogart 
 edit - thank you who ever gave me reddit gold 
 really appreciate it 
 this happened only a few short hours ago 
 being a teenager i had all of my <unk> with the outside world removed 
 i 'm at a friends house supposedly doing homework but i just had to get this fuck up out there 
 we 're coming up to the end of the school year 
 in just a few short weeks i 'll be graduated from high school 
 leave it to me however to find the best way to get into the most possible trouble 
 my friend and i always hang out 
 we 've been best friends since i moved here last year 
 he has his license and i do not 
 just got my learners driving permit here in canada so i 'm still a year away from driving 
 but would that stop me from getting my own vehicle and traveling the roads 
 no and this is why i 'm a fucking idiot 
 it was late night on monday 
 no finals for the whole week just free time to do whatever the hell i wanted 
 so i call up buddy comes and picks me up and we go driving around 
 as we 're driving i mention to him i 'm thinkin about trying to get a vehicle to boot around in 
 he thinks this is a great idea but being that we 're kids with no much money and my mom would likely go <unk> <unk> on a bitch we were n't sure how we would do it 
 than *click* i have an xbox 
 maybe someone would trade their shitty old truck for my xbox <unk> 
 so we go back to my place type up the ad post it and wait 
 not even 12 hours had gone by before i got a reply 
 an old guy wanted to trade is <unk> ford <unk> van for the xbox 
 fuckin sick 
 so tuesday night buddy and i go to meet up with the van man 
 there it is in all it 's glory 
 <unk> red square no back seats no middle seats just a driver seat and a passenger seat 
 it ran 
 it drove 
 like a dream 
 only <unk> <unk> on the thing 
 no need to see anymore of this i 'm in 
 he takes the xbox 
 gives me the keys to the van and away we go 
 for the next week days i drove that thing around 
 loud and proud 
 we managed to find a license plate that someone must have thrown away or stolen so we used that as the plate for the van 
 yup were idiots 
 on wednesday night we went to the salvation army where people typically take all the shit they do n't want anymore and dump it there 
 there was a couch probably <unk> years old and when we saw it we knew we had to have it 
 we threw it in the back 
 we now had our own party bus <unk> with old ass couches made of dust 
 but it was missing something 
 it needs exhaust 
 and that 's what led to the fateful thursday night 
 buddy came over with a hack saw 
 we caught the exhaust off and my god 
 the sound 
 so loud 
 so proud 
 so wonderful 
 we took er out for a test drive around the block once we chopped it 
 as we were driving i decided i needed to turn around to go to the store we just passed 
 so i made a turn and headed there 
 however there was a car behind me now not far 
 i panic 
 maybe it 's a cop 
 so i turn left 
 he turns 
 i turn right 
 he follows 
 i make a left into a cul-de-sac 
 he drives passed 
 buddy and i quickly throw it in park get out and start to walk 
 not even 2 seconds after we got our and closed the doors the car came back around the corner 
 it was a cop 
 he got out of his car and asked who drove the van 
 i told him it was me 
 he looked up the license plate as we stood there 
 he gets out of his car walks to me tells me to out my hands behind my back and they arrest me 
 turns out the license plate we used had been stolen off another vehicle and was being used by bank <unk> as a false plate on their car 
 they had thrown this one away and stolen another one and we happened to be the idiots to find it 
 and use it 
 so the best part of it all is the <unk> walk home for buddy 
 since he did nothing wrong the cop told him to leave 
 basically just grabbed whatever he had in the van and started walking home 
 just the thought of some <unk> '' blonde haired giant walking down the road with a <unk> ... it was awesome 
 so here i am 
 3000 $ in tickets mom is possibly <unk> over the idea of murdering me buddy walking down the street with a saw and an 80 % chance of never driving till i 'm old enough to use my brain 
 hopefully keep everyone updated 
 tl dr : i 'm the reason people are worried about the next generation of adults 
 edit : apparently people want proof 
 im wearing a winter jacket and pants because that fuckin thing is <unk> is my first ever post on reddit after being a serial <unk> so forgive my <unk> else i inevitably do wrong 
 in true tifu fashion i 'll start by saying this did n't happen today but 16 years ago when i was in <unk> 
 i had n't got around to making a reddit account back then 
 the fu happened during playtime one day i was happily playing with a tray of beans the easily amused child i was 
 i was temporarily unsupervised and in a moment of pure genius i decided that i would insert one of the beans - into my <unk> 
 i did a good job of it too none of the staff noticed 
 the day carried on like any other i went home had tea went to bed bean lodged in my nostril 
 noses are warm <unk> places 
 the perfect location for a plant to grow 
 long story short the bean <unk> in my nose for a good few days until my mother noticed a small green shoot in my nostril 
 i grew a bean 
 in my nose 
 my mother took me to the <unk> where the presumably confused doctor removed the bean shoot & amp all from my nose with an evil looking <unk> hook 
 i was terrified of the doctors for a few years and i was put under constant <unk> in playtime <unk> i try my hand at <unk> again 
 tl dr - invented facial <unk> edit : new tl dr edit : front page 
 holy crap thanks for the upvotes everyone 
 thanks for the gold kind stranger : so i was <unk> with this girl i knew for a while and things were getting a little heated 
 i get a snapchat from her with her showing her tits 
 the only reasonable thing to do was to send her a dick pic 
 so i send her the dick pic with the caption you like '' 
 and after maybe an hour without a response i text her asking if she did n't like my last snapchat 
 she says she never got a picture back 
 so now i 'm like fuck fuck fuck who do i send that dick pic to and i go to check my history and the most recent update was the snapchat from the girl showing me her tits 
 my stomach <unk> sunk because i knew what i did 
 i go to check my mystory and there it was 
 for those of you who do n't know what a mystory is you basically post pictures to it and everyone in your snapchat contacts can see it which includes about 50 of my friends and family almost all of which saw my dick 
 tl dr : sent a picture of my dick to my friends and <unk> by <unk> my starbucks barista 
 i ordered my drink and looked in my wallet for a cash tip 
 i had one $ 10 bill and one $ 1 bill 
 i accidentally grabbed both and put them in the tip box 
 i immediately said oops 
 my bad '' 
 and took the $ 10 out 
 another customer in line saw this and accused me of stealing the $ 10 out of the tip jar 
 i did n't hear him and walked off to go look at clothes with my daughter the starbucks is inside a <unk> 
 suddenly i had 3-4 customers yelling at me accusing me of taking the money 
 an employee came out from behind the counter and confronted me about stealing it 
 i said no it was a mistake 
 i put two bills in on accident 
 she said okay and walked away 
 every single customer was now staring at me as i stood there waiting for my drink to be made 
 one woman was staring and staring and staring and would n't stop 
 i finally said why are you staring at me 
 do you honestly think i would steal out of a tip jar '' 
 she gave me a nasty attitude and the other customers started cursing at me 
 then the <unk> all started talking trash about me 
 i started crying saying i did n't take it out 
 i finally put the $ 10 back in the tip jar and yelled there 
 is everyone happy now '' and left 
 as someone with severe social anxiety and panic attacks based on exact situations like this this was my worst nightmare 
 i 'm never leaving my house again 
 **edit** i ca n't thank everyone enough for the overwhelming support that i 've gotten over the past 22 hours 
 i 've never had reddit gold so i 'm pretty sure this is the best day of my life 
 definitely of 2015 unfortunately i 'm about to lose my mother to <unk> so right now my anxiety level is at a 10 and 2015 has been honestly the worst year of my life 
 i have contacted corporate and waiting to hear back 
 through your support i did get out of the house today although i went to a completely different mall in another town and did n't have a panic attack 
 again i am thankful for every comment and message that i 've received 
 i 've never felt more support and love like this before and it 's bringing me to tears so i 'm gon na end this now 
 : i 've been married for almost two years 
 last weekend i decided i wanted to <unk> up our sex life 
 my husband works away from home one weekend a month and i figured i would surprise him on sunday evening when he walked in the door after having been away 
 i bought some fun lingerie applied some porn star makeup curled my hair and put on some hooker heels 
 we have a door in the kitchen that leads to the driveway so i knew he would be coming in through that door 
 i figured what could be sexier than my tired husband walking in the door after a long weekend of working to find his wife all dolled up and cooking dinner 
 here 's where i fucked up 
 my husband called me to let me know he was about 5 minutes away 
 in my <unk> i grabbed the first vegetable near me and began chopping 
 it was an onion 
 my husband walked in the door to find his wife all dressed up and apparently bawling her eyes out over the cutting board 
 my porn star makeup had run down my face and i could barely keep my eyes open 
 what 's worse is i managed to roll my ankle while walking in my hooker heels to the kitchen sink 
 he did n't know whether to be concerned or turned on as his half naked wife limped around the kitchen with tears running down her face 
 in my flustered state i blurted out something along the lines of i 'm making dinner 
 tl dr tried to surprise my husband by being sexy 
 he thought i was having a mental breakdown 
 so i moved from north dakota to virginia 
 i have been applying to jobs for months 
 i <unk> got a single call 
 well i dont know if anyone actually did call me but this entire time i was using the phone number that ive always had in north dakota 
 it turns out when i <unk> my phone in virginia they gave me a new phone number 
 ive been applying to every single job with the phone number i no longer <unk> happened less than twenty minutes ago 
 as i sit here typing with trembling fingers in the classroom where i teach <unk> to adults i can not help but think that this is one of my most embarrassing teaching moments 
 today i decided to wear my favorite <unk> pencil skirt to class 
 this morning was a rough one the type of morning where you barely drag yourself out of bed ... and of course we were completely out of coffee 
 so i <unk> dressed myself <unk> my outfit efforts in the mirror for a split second and dart out the door late as usual 
 when i get to class my students were waiting patiently at their desks 
 not wanting to waste any time i walk up the the board and immediately begin to write and lecture 
 about five minutes into my lecture one of my female students from colombia says excuse me <unk> ... '' irritated at the interruption i retort yes student 
 remember i 'll leave time for questions always '' 
 no <unk> um ... how do you call ... '' 
 zipper '' 
 say several other students to help the first 
 i turn around like <unk> and feel with my hand that although the clasp still held the zipper that ran from the top of the skirt all the way to the bottom of my butt was as wide open as the great <unk> 
 i casually zip it up thank the student <unk> continue my lecture as if nothing had happened 
 as soon as i get the class quietly working on an assignment i slip off to the bathroom to assess the damage 
 in the mirror i pull the zipper down like it was and lift my arm <unk> myself writing on the board 
 to my horror my open zipper and closed clasp created a little <unk> from satan that revealed my blue g-string and ass cheeks in all of their pasty glory 
 i am now back in class red-faced and knowing that the memory of this will keep me up at night for years to come 
 **tl dr if i do n't zip the zipper their teacher 's a stripper 
 ** update : class just let out 
 the last student out of the classroom just said blue is a good choice '' 
 <unk> and darted out the door 
 edit : i was really hoping that my 15 seconds of fame would be from something more <unk> than *this* crap but <unk> la <unk> 
 beside the haters the overwhelming majority of hilarious comments has made me feel a lot better 
 <unk> : pics or it did n't happen '' 
 is reddit 's version of hey girl bet you ca n't touch your elbows together behind your back '' 
 technically it was last night but it crossed over into this morning so it <unk> 
 and it 's not some <unk> i got laid but then x happened '' 
 i 'm actually ca n't recall ever having felt this worthless in my life 
 she drove we chatted i made my interest apparent 
 she seemed to <unk> 
 as the night went on and the liquid courage started <unk> everybody up she started getting kinda flirty and <unk> with a lot of people 
 should have been my red flag to get the hell out 
 nope 
 we ended up at another house with two guys who we had been hanging out with at the party 
 me and guy # 2 played <unk> while she sat on the couch with guy # 1. they ended up making out 
 i figured they were going to have sex and i would just have to live with it because she was my ride home 
 guy # 1 gets up and taps guy # 2 on the shoulder and whispers something into his ear 
 guy # 2 sets his controller down tells me it 's all you dude '' 
 she 's on the couch <unk> and the three of them all head down the hall into the same bedroom 
 i was still in denial until i heard the bed shaking and her squealing 
 i sat numb for maybe five minutes before going outside and smoking cigarettes until they made me sick 
 tried to go back inside and lay down but i made it maybe five minutes before i decided i had to go home 
 it was about a two hour walk 
 i 'm pretty sure i 'm not leaving my bed today 
 tl dr - got to hear my crush banging two guys at once and had to walk home 
 edit - to the people who keep calling her whore '' slut '' bitch '' etc i do n't agree with you and you 're really not helping anything at all 
 edit 2 - she keeps trying to call me 
 i really see no benefit to anyone in answering 
 edit 3 - there is just no way i 'm going to be able to keep up with all these replies 
 i 'm going to call her and add an edit here later 
 edit 4 - i 'm familiar with the red pill and i wo n't be joining them so you can save those suggestions 
 edit 5 - tifu by calling my former crush back the night after having heard her bang two dudes in the other room 
 claimed she wanted me in there too 
 so i asked the obvious question and she says she was drunk and it did n't work out the way she intended 
 decided to just go with it when i did n't get involved 
 passed out when it was over 
 was worried about me never meant to hurt me bla bla bla 
 it helped nothing at all as i do n't really know what i can believe and what i ca n't 
 i 've seen a few suggestions implying that it may have been rape or that i should have tried to save '' her 
 the fact is that she practically led <unk> down the hall she was visibly damn happy and sexual pleasure has a pretty distinct fucking sound 
 i was n't going to sit around and listen for it to go south nor was i going to burst in to what was pretty clearly a consensual sexual encounter that i did n't believe myself to be welcome in just to make sure everything was okay 
 if you guys want to start barging into the room anytime you hear people fucking at parties be my guest 
 i 'm not doing that though 
 whatever 
 fuck this noise 
 told her i do n't hate her but i do n't think we should talk anytime soon 
 apparently now i have a party to get to tonight 
 you guys are certainly free to keep bitching about what a whore '' she is if that 's what you want to do though 
 edit 6 - i 'm reading all your replies but sadly it 's just impossible for me to reply to everyone 
 you guys are great though 
 thanks for being awesome <unk> actually happened this afternoon 
 not very much backstory needed for this one however i guess i should explain myself 
 firstly - i 'm lactose intolerant 
 really badly lactose intolerant 
 if i have cheese whey pretty much anything with milk <unk> in it i 'll start blasting with wind like an involuntary ass trumpet 
 diarrhea happens occasionally as well 
 the issue is that i really really like brie 
 secondly - i was home alone today 
 my girlfriend had gone out to lunch with her friends and i thought i 'd surprise her by cleaning the house whilst she was away 
 who knows 
 it could have led to some grateful sexy times 
 at it turns out though this was never to be 
 before i started i spotted some brie in the fridge 
 it was n't long into vacuuming that i started feeling churning 
 i farted a few times relatively mildly before an epiphany hit me : why do n't i vacuum away my farts 
 the smell will be contained inside the bag and potential embarrassment in the future may be avoided 
 without further <unk> to <unk> <unk> i undid my pants the next time i felt another gas wave hit me 
 so began the biggest mistake of recent memory 
 it turns out that between the negative pressure of a vacuum and the positive pressure of a fart that the effect was stronger than anticipated 
 as the fart arrived the gas was rapidly <unk> into the vacuum tube - along with the end <unk> of my large <unk> 
 unsurprisingly this hurt a fucking lot 
 i immediately turned off the vacuum and tried to push my sphincter back inside my ass - turns out that does n't work and it also hurts a fucking lot too 
 not long after my girlfriend arrives home 
 i avoid explaining why i 'm in the bathroom for a while but eventually i come clean 
 she laughed way too much before realising shit was serious 
 i 'm in hospital now being <unk> for surgery to <unk> my ass 
 seriously people - as smart as you might feel about vacuuming away your farts just do n't do it 
 tl dr - i <unk> out my rectum trying to contain a fart 
 edit <unk> : i just logged into my throwaway after being off reddit and high on medication 
 just checked this 
 goddammit 
 edit : spelling okay so this was about 6 months ago but my boyfriend just reminded me of it 
 stayed round his house and he climbed out of bed over me because there 's a wall on his side 
 i 'm a ridiculously heavy sleeper but he actually woke me up for once 
 my face felt all hot and wet so i stumbled out of bed half awake to go and use the bathroom to investigate what was up 
 i was leaning on the wall with my cheek resting against the corner of it because i felt a little <unk> so my face was kind of peering round the wall at the bathroom door 
 i could n't remember where the light switch was so i just waited in the dark 
 boyfriend opens the door the light makes me squint so i cover my eyes and then he screams 
 it was the most terrified scream i 've ever heard and looking back on it it 's pretty amazing that a 6'2 '' bearded tattooed guy can reach that note 
 turns out i 'd had a bitch of a nose bleed in my sleep and my whole face was covered in blood from where i 'd most likely <unk> it in my sleep on the pillow 
 it had also <unk> from my face onto my white nightie and that combined with my insane bed hair meant that i looked pretty fucking terrifying 
 i 'm no longer allowed to wait in the hall if i want to go pee after him 
 he also refused to face me when he went to sleep for a while ... and he had to scrub my blood off the wall 
 tldr had a nose bleed without realising waited to use the bathroom in the dark boyfriend came out and screamed when i had blood all over my face in the hall when he thought i was <unk> i fucked up by getting my dick and balls waxed 
 i have a girlfriend and we 've been dating for a month exactly 
 i commented on how beautiful her pussy was and how smooth and she said it was because she gets waxed 
 she told me it hurt to have done and i joked with her about how next time she goes i would get one to show <unk> 
 so the day comes when she 's going to get waxed and she calls ahead and asks if they wax men and they are like sure 
 this is where my plan fell through because i was 100 % sure they did n't do this sort of thing for men 
 but they do 
 yay 
 we end up going to the salon and i 'm very nervous but i figure i 'm going through with it 
 she gives me an out and says i do n't have to but i tell her i told you i would so i 'm doing it 
 so this actually attractive woman in her late 20 's comes and gets me i was expecting some woman in her 50 's with a <unk> accent and hands bigger than mine and takes me in the back and tells me to get naked 
 which i do and she asks me to get up on the table 
 i lay down on the table with my male bits dangling out 
 my nuts for some reason decide to hang down to my knees which they do n't tend to do very often so in that <unk> i feel <unk> 
 she starts putting wax on the lower part of my stomach and rips 
 holy fucking mother of all that is evil who the fuck does this to themselves i think as a mixture of pins and needles covered with burning lava <unk> me as this tiny women hurts me in ways i never thought someone her size could 
 then she keeps doing it and it does n't hurt any less when she said it gets better she was a fucking liar 
 then something strange happens she starts grabbing my dick and moving it around to wax around it 
 obviously my penis is confused about whats going on it 's been around wax before in a different type of setting and it thinks this is the right time to show off 
 so here i am with this woman <unk> my penis as it slowly decided to become erect because when you have hairs ripped out of your body that 's the time to get erect right 
 this is one of the least <unk> moments of my life to be honest 
 she starts to do my nuts well when i said it could n't hurt worse i lied 
 it hurts worse and this woman has a strange habit of slapping me after she pulls a slab of wax up she lightly keeps slapping me where ever she just ripped my hair out as if to say bad boy bad boy for letting me do this to you and she does this on my nuts 
 not pleasant to have the hair ripped off your scrotum then have some obviously <unk> woman start slapping them playfully afterwards 
 fuck me this could not get worse it does though 
 the bottom inch of my penis has hair on it so obviously that shit has to go 
 so she rips the hair out of my penis and slaps it and well that was n't so bad really 
 my penis has been confused by her holding it so much 
 she does it again and bam she rips that shit off then slaps it lightly again and my penis is thinking shit that actually was kinda nice 
 next thing i know mr. happy is jumping around spitting cum all over the place 
 the nice woman starts to laugh and puts her hand under my penis catching most of my cum still laughing so hard i think she 's going to cry 
 i apologize and apologize and apologize and apologize 
 she is still laughing and takes a towel and cleans me up and she tells me i did n't do anything wrong it 's a natural reaction all while <unk> my cock 
 i 'm like cool so other people have done this 
 she laughs and says hell no you 're the first one but still you 're alright do n't be embarrassed 
 she has me get up on all fours and then she waxes my ass crack and the rest of my balls 
 yeah that was actually the <unk> of my day 
 so she keeps waxing going over little bits as she feels around my nether regions and finally she finishes the job and you would think my penis would just stop doing this shit but no it stays erect the whole time even after cumming 
 she finishes by putting oil on me at the end and massages it in even my erect penis jerking it for a bit and then just like that it 's over 
 she takes a towel and wipes off all the oil and other stuff off me 
 she gives me her card and tells me to come back when it 's grown about an 1/8th of an inch for another wax 
 i say for sure 
 i 'm never going back again ever obviously 
 she takes me up front to pay and my new girlfriend is waiting and she asks me how bad it was 
 i say it was n't so bad 
 the first of many lies i will take to my grave over that day 
 i tipped the salon woman $ 20.00 for being cool and not <unk> out and having me arrested 
 sometimes i hate my penis 
 the woman who waxed me tells my gf i was awesome during the whole thing and that she will love my new look 
 which was true she loves it and it 's not so bad being bald down there 
 but at what cost for my <unk> 
 scarring some poor salon worker for eternity seems like a big price to pay 
 tl dr : promised to wax for gf stimulated by pain and cums over 20 something woman waxing op 
 tips $ 20.00 to stay out of jail 
 credit to <unk> for brilliant tl : dr. thanks for the gold kind and generous redditor 
 that was so awesome to whomever gave me it 
 thanks for the positive <unk> i was at my local climbing gym and talking to one of the guys down there who i know half well and in conversation he revealed he did magic 
 as most people would be i was pretty interested so i said something along the lines of 'go on show me your magic then 
 so this guy replies 'no it 's embarrassing man 
 but i <unk> him into it 
 so he takes me over to his locker and reaches into his bag and pull out what i assume is i do n't know a special box of cards or some props to do a magic trick with 
 it was n't 
 it was a box of magic cards as in a card game i 'd never heard of before and now this guy thought i was some sort of expert on the matter because i 'd been pushing him for about 5 minutes to show me 
 i ended up spending half an hour pretending i had a clue what the fuck he was showing me as he pulled various good 
 cards out of his deck 
 tl dr : asked a guy to show me his magic 
 he did 
 oh boy he <unk> was driving home on a small <unk> street and noticed some <unk> practicing right off the side of the road 
 they were straight ahead and i had to make a left turn 
 i was still kind of glancing back at them while making the turn and did n't see caution sandwich board thing construction workers use to mark their work area 
 i ended hitting the sign and sinking my front left <unk> into a <unk> full of hot <unk> 
 i 'm thinking i 'm going to get my ass kicked by some construction workers when one of them approaches me asking me if me and my car are ok. i told him i was fine and very sorry 
 he said do n't worry about it 
 we were watching them <unk> i play <unk> 
 and i want a <unk> as do many others 
 unlike many others i can afford to waste money on it 
 well a few days ago i know i know today i fucked up not a few days ago i fucked up get outta here op 
 i was over at a friends house and we were goofing around in steam 
 at some point i noticed that a particular knife skin the <unk> <unk> | damascus steel had one offer on the community market which was considerably cheaper than the other offers like <unk> cheaper than the average price i think 
 obviously i jumped on the opportunity or rather i asked my friend to jump on the opportunity for me because he was logged in at that time and i feared that switching <unk> would mean someone else buying the skin before me 
 so he bought the skin for me his account got charged i gave him back the money by sending him a paypal transaction 
 end of story right 
 wrong 
 the thing i fucked up was to write damascus '' as the transaction comment and nothing else 
 well that little innocent keyword triggered the <unk> <unk> of paypal froze the transaction for manual review and after the manual review failed as well they froze my entire paypal account 
 now i have 14 days to give paypal a written explanation on why i used the word damascus '' in my transaction or lose my paypal account with all the money that 's still on it 
 tl dr : wanted to be a cooler <unk> ended up on the t side 
 edit : i 'm from germany not the us which with the current political <unk> might explain why they take closer looks at transactions that mention syrian <unk> 
 who knows 
 edit 2 : edit 3 : i 'm happy to announce that all limitations on my account have been lifted and that the transaction has reached its destination 
 surprised that they managed to sort that out in under 24 hours but i guess transactions like these might be <unk> for review.my brother is currently 7 and i told him this lie when he was 4. it all started when i saw a moth in my room and my brother comes in 
 he asked me what was it and brilliant me thought : this is a perfect time to prank him 
 i start hyperventilating '' and told him to run out of the room 
 we run out of the room and i told him : that a moth 
 moths are like <unk> they suck the blood of people and kill when people they are asleep 
 he gets scared like any 4 year old would and runs into his room 
 each time he sees a moth he literally run full speed yelling bloody murder to his room and locks the door 
 his favorite attire is <unk> because moths ca n't get the his neck 
 fast forward to an hour ago 
 my mom gets a call from school asking her if she can pick my brother up because he had a panic attack 
 apparently today the schools science teacher brought a ton of butterflies to show kids how <unk> turn to butterflies 
 when he saw them he started running and screaming around the room telling everyone to save themselves because moths suck blood and kill people 
 the whole class started panicking and started running and screaming 
 i think it 's time to tell him that moths do n't suck blood or kill people ... update : due to popular demand i wo n't tell my brother the truth 
 you sick bastards as with all good fuck ups this did n't happen today 
 it happened yesterday 
 i am a twenty year old female and it was my first flight alone 
 i have <unk> before but always sandwiched between a <unk> baby brother and a fidgety little sister 
 meanwhile my parents would sit in the row ahead never looking back as they try to simultaneously ignore us and pretend the pint sized asian <unk> is not their creation yesterday was a toss up 
 instead of siblings i was sandwiched between an elderly married man and an elderly businesswoman as we <unk> in the sky towards san <unk> 
 the man read his book and the woman <unk> with a <unk> 
 i have an old nintendo gameboy color and pokemon crystal 
 the save file is corrupted but i decided to see how far i could get in the upcoming 3.5 hours 
 being a considerate chair neighbor i pulled out my earbuds and plugged them into the bottom hole thing 
 i turn on the game and then slowly increase the volume 
 it 's odd i 'd thought the music would be louder as the classic pokemon music can be almost piercing on full volume but i shrugged it off 
 it is an old gameboy after all 
 cue the classic pokemon music and the dramatic fight scene <unk> 
 a little while into the game i 'm level seven with my <unk> but my neighbors seem distressed 
 the man kept glancing up and me and glaring his fingers <unk> against the book he was so gently holding minutes ago 
 maybe an hour in businesswoman looks irritated 
 she cast a glance at me and kept <unk> in her <unk> seat so i sent her an empathetic this flight sucks i know the seats are uncomfortable '' look 
 two hours in and i was conquering the game 
 <unk> training meant i was <unk> frequently with the classic <unk> bu bum bu du bum bum '' music 
 the music still was n't playing too loudly but that was fine 
 i was starting to get sick of the <unk> music 
 i rolled the music down to zero and went to unplug my earbuds 
 it was n't fully plugged in 
 my stomach <unk> and i could feel a flush rising 
 dear god <unk> and businesswoman must hate me 
 i sank into my seat and tried not to look at them 
 2 hours 
 two hours they and the whole plane had to hear me play pokemon 
 there is no way to apologize 
 the only solution was to feign sleep for an hour 
 **tl dr : i unwittingly shoved <unk> down the ears of an airplane full of people for two hours <unk> <unk> shit i drop my shame off here and go to explore <unk> and now look at this lovely shit show 
 you 've popped my gold cherry ... twice 
 the hell is wrong with all of you 
 taking pleasure in the pain of the older ... op uses shame **i am 25 years old and i died in a <unk> 
 which then caused me to hammer fist my glass desk 
 ooops 
 the game i was playing was <unk> of the <unk> edit : for all those asking about what i looked like <unk> desk if you want to purchase one and smash it for fun 
 e i do n't have a picture for that 
 but here is the link for edit2 : thanks for all the upvotes guys did n't think my rage would make it this far 
 maybe i should play more shitty casual '' <unk> and smash more desks this actually happened over the weekend 
 the drywall behind the tiles in my bathtub rotted out the tiles fell off into the tub and broke 
 as i am a single father engaged but she 's not really a step mother '' my sons are older 17 and 18 i 'm super busy all the time 
 it has taken forever to find time to schedule a guy to come out and patch up this hole 
 finally i get a guy to come out last friday afternoon 
 he starts to get to work and has to pause to run out to his truck to get another tool or whatever he needed and came back had it all patched up within half an hour 
 a few hours later my fiancee tells me she needs to go to the emergency room 
 she has had bronchitis for damn near a week and was afraid it had progressed to pneumonia 
 we go to the er they get her a chest x-ray some breathing <unk> and a prescription for antibiotics 
 we get home around 3:30 am 
 i get my fiancee into bed then nature called and i head to the bathroom 
 i hear my cat crying 
 he 's a big <unk> <unk> and the biggest baby ever 
 he sounds like a baby kitten when he meows and i hear him crying his little kitty eyeballs out 
 i figure the big dumbass a has gotten himself locked in a cabinet - again <unk> i mentioned he 's a big dummy 
 so i 'm frantically checking all the cabinets in the bathroom the kitchen under the kitchen sink and he 's nowhere 
 his crying is getting more and more pathetic 
 that 's when i realized the crying was coming from inside the wall 
 the best i can figure this dumb little shit had crawled inside the hole in the wall while the <unk> was outside and remained in there hiding somewhere while the guy did his work 
 so here i am at 4 am with a cat stuck inside the wall meowing in the most heartbreaking and pathetic way he possibly can 
 the only choice i had was to take a hammer to my freshly patched up <unk> wall in the bathtub and break him out 
 pictures of the little shit here : pulling the big dummy out of the wall 
 he 's out 
 guess i 'd be agitated too if i had been stuck in the wall for damn near 12 hours 
 this happened a few months back 
 <unk> 
 so i am addicted to candy crush on my iphone but refuse to pay for any extra lives or power ups or whatever 
 this means when you 've played 5 turns you have to wait a few hours until they refill and you can play again 
 i was doing this like a <unk> for several years : play 5 turns wait a few hours play 5 turns wait a few hours etc 
 then i heard about a <unk> where you can reset your phone clock forward an hour and candy crush thinks it 's time to give you another life 
 <unk> 
 free lives 
 i did this a few times in the evening 
 this was fine until my phone alarm alarm went off in the morning at 6am my usual time to get up and start getting my 8 year old son ready for school 
 i go shake him awake 
 he 's strangely difficult to wake up this morning 
 i shake him harder 
 finally he half opens his eyes and says <unk> it morning already 
 he drags himself out of bed and <unk> to the living room where i put some cereal in front of him and he turns on a netflix cartoon 
 he is still half asleep trying to eat his cereal and i think maybe he 's getting sick he should n't be this tired '' 
 then i open up my computer to read with a morning coffee and i glance at the computer clock 
 <unk> 
 it took a moment to figure out that my <unk> alarm had gone off at 3:00 thanks to my candy crush phone-time clock cheating 
 i sent my poor kid back to bed for a few more hours of sleep 
 i was already awake by then though so i just kept on reading reddit 
 so last night i am in charge of doing my 5 year old girl 's bed time while mum takes baby to sleep 
 while picking a bed time story i go through the pile of recently acquired library books and see one titled ghost <unk> and the incredibly revolting ghost '' 
 it looked a bit above her pay grade and i question who picked it out and if she thought it might be a bit too scary for her 
 she says no and being a bit hyped up from the weekend and feeling playful she <unk> that it might be a bit scary for me and comes up with a game on the spot : a scare test 
 she turns out the light and <unk> on me 
 now i should mention we have black out blinds and with the light off the room is completely dark 
 what follows is 5 minutes of us turning out the lights and trying to scare '' each other i the dark : throwing fluffy toys sneaking up behind monster '' drool wet <unk> 
 after a while of gentle <unk> i figure its time to end this and get to bed 
 on my turn i go silent 
 after <unk> daddy '' 
 *silence* <unk> '' 
 *silence* where are you '' 
 *silence oh this is good 
 * dad '' 
 *silence yeah i 'm in the zone * footsteps towards the <unk> <unk> for it oh i 'm so going to win this 
 kneel down so i 'm at head level wait for it wait for it ok she 's right in front of me lets do it 
 * lights on : <unk> '' 
 <unk> '' 
 <unk> so yeah bedtime was delayed for a <unk> change 
 she 's probably not going to trust me for a while and as a bonus we woke the baby too ... -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - update and edit for an <unk> which apparently is really important : for anyone <unk> about any psychological scarring 
 i was <unk> today by my girl jumping out from under the dining table when i got home from work today 
 apparently she wanted to get me back and hid under the table 
 being that she had decided that quite a while before i got home she 'd turned under the table into some kind of den with books pillows and snacks 
 so everyone is laughing and no-one was <unk> 
 for anyone asking about my wife 's response 
 luckily she was <unk> with <unk> the baby and fell asleep doing so and thus did n't hear the details till the day after where upon it was <unk> that no harm was done and thus i did n't need to be castrated or otherwise mutilated 
 <unk> credit goes to /u/cyae1 this morning i decided to got to one of those fancy <unk> places where they have about 10 people cleaning and drying your car after it gets out of the automatic wash. i drive a large pickup truck a 4 door nissan <unk> and i keep the rear seats up so my dog has more room 
 so after they were done drying the truck they waved me over and i started to drive away i got about a half mile down the road and i see someone in the rear of the cab still drying the inside of the windows 
 it scared the shit out of me and i screamed then the guy screamed and i ended up <unk> on the highway and cut off a car in the next lane 
 there happened to be a police officer behind me who saw it all and turned on his lights and pulled me over 
 the good news was the cop believed me because the truck was still dripping and the mexican dude had a spray bottle and rag 
 the police officer gave me a written warning and had a good laugh 
 i tried to give the <unk> a ride back to the car wash and he just said to me no <unk> '' and turned and quickly walked away 
 credit goes to <unk> written warning : www.imgur.com/a4uyf12my boyfriend 's neighbors just had a baby 
 the husband came outside to say hi 
 he said his wife was out to dinner with her friends so he was watching the <unk> 
 thinking that was a cute nickname for a newborn i said it 's okay all babies come out like that '' 
 he meant the movie 
 <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this fuck-up actually happened just a couple hours ago ... so as many of you might know mcdonalds is doing the promotion of paying with love i happened to be one of the lucky <unk> '' of this promotion 
 it was great a $ 15 <unk> 's food binge for free man i coulnd't believe my luck 
 they said all i had to do is call a family member and tell them i love you '' 
 the start of the fuckup is calling my mother who knows that i had a <unk> history with depression and suicidal thoughs from high school <unk> the second fuckup is starting the call with i love you 
 she immediatly started to freak out mostly because i 'm over 1000 miles away from her and the closest family is about 300 miles away from me and was pretty scared that i was about to commit suicide 
 over the course of the next 15 <unk> i was on the phone <unk> her that i indeed was n't about to kill myself and make sure that she was n't on the next plane to arrive and come to visit 
 afterwards she also mentioned that it had given her a small asthma attack but nothing her <unk> could n't handle overall it was n't the worst thing that has happened and the <unk> manager that was helping me thought it was so funny she <unk> for the other guys meal i was with along with handing me a handful of free sandwich <unk> because it was the best laugh she has had at this job 
 **tl : dr** : went to <unk> to get free food and nearly gave mother a <unk> **edit** : thanks to <unk> for fixing the tl : dr and holy shit did this blow up i 'll be doing my best to reply to most if not all of the comments 
 front page as well 
 sweet 
 posted this about an hour before i went to bed so i was n't able to reply to everyone 's comment that is going to happen asap 
 for everyone saying the manager was <unk> an asshole <unk> after the fact i thought it was pretty damn funny myself not only did it make her night a little more entertaining/interesting i got more free food then i <unk> <unk> i was going to get 
 **edit 2** apparently this has made radio stations across america and several websites quote this word for word 
 i guess everyone was just waiting for it to backfire and it did 
 also thanks to the redditor who gifted <unk> technically this fuck up has been going on since i purchased the blinds three years ago but i just realized today that they do not work properly 
 my room is essentially <unk> all the way around with about two feet edit : definitely not two feet i 'm no good with <unk> it just comes up to pretty much my hip worth of wall so the <unk> section comes up to maybe my hip 
 i have these awesome <unk> type blinds that i love because they do n't block the sun out entirely they let a bit in which is nice to wake up to ... and should have been my first hint 
 as my other fuck ups will tell you i like to be naked and i 'm very comfortable with my body 
 so i live alone and naturally i walk around naked a lot and get changed in the middle of my room 
 the windows look out onto an alley of the condo building where the parking garage also is 
 while changing i often look out to see who is parking in our building and i notice the cars always slow to almost a stop then continue 
 i figured there was a speed bump or something 
 fast forward to early this morning when i accidentally left my bedroom light on when i left 
 i walk out the side door walk down the alley and turn to look back at my room - - with the light on you can see every detail of my room 
 you can literally see the <unk> on my wall where i 'm meaning to hang a picture 
 so all and all i 've been dancing naked getting changed and doing god knows what else in full view of everyone driving down the alley ... oh and the giant apartment building across from the condo 
 tl dr : blinds do n't work when the light is on i 've been exposing myself to potentially hundreds of people every day for three years.i 'm a 21 year old girl 
 i 'm also a student 
 i like the colour blue and rabbits for their long ears 
 i am a quiet person and i tend to be socially awkward and constipated 
 i live in a student housing building where i have my own tiny room 
 i share the kitchen and the bathroom with another girl i 'm mostly friends with 
 this girl lets <unk> her as a sometimes takes me to parties and other activities with her friends 
 she often tells me only hours before which can cause <unk> with my schedule 
 i was very constipated and i had not pooped for four days 
 in order to to solve this situation i bought a pack of d ... <unk> which according to the instructions should start working 6 hours after beeing taken 
 my belly was bloated and as i considered the problem to be severe i took three pills at about 4 pm 
 when i came home at 7 pm my roommate offered to take me with her in an hour 
 1 had never taken a laxative before i used to take only dried plums <unk> juice <unk> husk soda or sugar-free food wich would usually restore the normal order within a day 
 i thought that the contents of my bowels would just move down faster and remain at their solid consistency 
 i expected to feel the urge to go after 6 hours and i thought that i would either be able to stay after a visit to the bathroom or that i could easily make it home 
 when i went to the bathroom before we <unk> i did not feel the urge to poop despite trying 
 i had no reason the expect the events that were to come 
 the party took place in a neighbouring block of <unk> 
 about thirty people attended and it was fairly crowded 
 i generally enjoyed it but remained in a quiet corner and did not drink 
 my misery <unk> at about 9 pm 
 at first it was just a little cramp and i just thought that my period was about to start early 
 five minutes later it was as if something was moving inside my belly 
 it could feel the right side becoming lighter while something was flowing to the left side 
 i still did not feel any pressure 
 there was just this tense feeling and my lower bottom started to get somewhat warm 
 it remotely felt as if i was getting horny but i had just been looking at a bottle on a desk for the last minutes 
 then suddenly a <unk> feeling of something pushing against my rectum became urgent 
 i stood up and made my way towards the bathroom but this just increased the pressure 
 upon reaching the bathroom i soon found it to be not <unk> : on completely drunk guy was sitting on the toilet with his pants down and someone was laying on the floor and in the shower 
 i was not drunk i had decency so abusing the sink was out of question 
 as is rushed out of the bathroom i came to the realisation that i only had few minutes to find a place to relieve myself 
 i rushed out of the flat and began to search for something 
 there were no secluded corners or cabinets 
 then i noticed that that block had the same layout as our block and that our block had escape stairs from the floors 
 after a short run i reached the door to the stairs that is hidden behind a corner 
 it was just a short run away but i was not sure that i was going to get there in time 
 when i tried to open the door it would n't 
 after a few seconds of shock i realised that i was pushing instead of pulling 
 once i got out i <unk> my action 
 the platform has a floor that is <unk> a <unk> grate 
 the stairs down were blocked by a door that only opens <unk> 
 if i went down there i would not get back up again 
 i also would have not be able to get back inside as the door to into the building could only be opened from the inside 
 i could have gone onto the stairs upwards but i was afraid that someone could see me there 
 my butt was hurting badly 
 the pain was similar to a muscle that is strained after lifting something heavy 
 the pain was stronger than my desire to find the least problematic place 
 i lowered my pants and went into a squatting position 
 it was a quiet slightly rainy night 
 i could faintly hear the music from the flat i had just run out of 
 from my position on the sixth floor i could <unk> the area 
 noone was there 
 i just stopped holding it in and the thought of the relief that was to come was only disturbed by the smell of cigarette smoke 
 it was as if my butt was forced open by a garden hose that was hidden inside it 
 there was a continuous and heavy flow for at least ten seconds 
 there were a few tiny solid pieces that caused pain as they hit my butthole while exiting 
 i was shaking so much that when i began to pee it would not even flow continuously 
 although i was not completely empty and a burning feeling arose in that region i felt light again and my bloated belly was turning into its graceful skinny figure again 
 suddenly there was a voice : „did the <unk> tear or something 
 a second voice apparently a girl added <unk> neck is <unk> 
 i realized that i was caught 
 i put my hands on my <unk> to increase the pressure to finish as soon as possible when a voice down there said <unk> is up <unk> 
 a flashlight flashed up from below i was scared and then the second wave came out of me 
 below me a scream rose through the night : <unk> thats <unk> 
 <unk> 's shitting on <unk> - <unk> dude do you see that 
 that 's a <unk> 
 i quickly wiped with a tissue that i already had at my hands 
 the flashlight from the platform on the floor below me was still lighting up 
 they could see enough to make a rude comment about my <unk> 
 i put another tissue over my butthole like a pad put on my pants again and rushed back inside 
 the flat was only a few doors away 
 i had left the door open so i left myself back inside 
 i had only been gone for a few minutes and as i knew only few people noone seemed to have noticed that i was gone 
 i was planning on leaving as i was not feeling well 
 i went to pick up my <unk> that i had left at the place i had been sitting at 
 when i was about to get out 
 someone was yelling outside and knocking at the door 
 i rushed back as far as possible 
 someone had opened the door 
 the person that opened the door started screaming against the people yelling from outside 
 alarmed from the screams the people from inside the flat rushed to the door 
 the situation turned into chaos 
 standing outside were the people i had just pooped on 
 as everyone who is screaming <unk> while beeing covered in poop they <unk> to be crazed and their attempts to come in were <unk> off with a broom 
 within seconds the whole floor showed up 
 the situation did not calm down the people outside were looking for the person that did this 
 i did not see them but i heard people saying that the were covered in feces 
 i went onto the balcony when someone from the <unk> flat went into their balcony and started yelling down for help 
 this attracted further audience from outside 
 the people outside could be convinced to return to their flat 
 i used the first opportunity to escape 
 many people were rushing up the stairs to see the <unk> situation and despite looking very normal i expected any of them to identify me as the culprit 
 when i returned to my flat i cleaned myself up and pooped some more 
 my roommate returned two hours later she showed me some photos she had made of the poor people below me 
 i had completely hit them – two guys and one girl 
 i went to bed shortly afterwards 
 rumors about the event spreaded quickly on facebook 
 my unintentional victims apparently gave a description to the building management that caused amusement – they were looking for a girl with a blue skirt when interested people asked for a more precise description the word <unk> was used in official notices 
 luckily their description was not correct they mistook my blue shirt for a skirt 
 tl dr : i took a laxative <unk> the effects and my poop got over other people 
 <unk> update & amp further details : ** it seems that i have avoided all suspicion so far 
 when time has passed i will probably tell my roommate who is by the way <unk> as my best friend 
 as far as i could find out my poor victims were slightly drunk and can not remember every detail 
 i know their names and their door numbers and in the next days i will send them gift cards for the <unk> <unk> 
 pictures of them were deleted off facebook and other social media 
 one of their friends has commented on facebook that they wish their identities to be kept secret 
 this has not stopped people from spreading the news 
 i heard people talking about the incident when i went to my classes but as it is with rumors the details are changing and sometimes obscure <unk> are made 
 i do n't know if it is true but it was said that my poor victims made it into a flat and - as noone wanted to get near them - managed to corner the people inside there before they could convince them that they had nothing to do with their misery 
 it also appears to be that there were multiple parties on that floor so the <unk> are not even sure where the culprit came from 
 i 'd like to thank the kind stranger who gifted me gold and everyone who gave me suggestions for my health 
 i strongly suspect that the cause for my constipation was my period which started early today 
 i still have classes for today and as cramps wo n't be the only <unk> there is a small <unk> which will hopefully not realize itself that similar events are going to occur 
 i 'm a kindergarten teacher that started the school year last week 
 everyday the students have a 10 minute snack time 
 during this time i play read <unk> of children 's books on youtube while i walk around assisting in opening milk <unk> and such 
 we just got done listening to a read <unk> of green eggs and ham and i saw a <unk> for the giving tree 
 i asked my students if they have ever heard of this book and they said no 
 hooray 
 i get to be the one that introduces them to one of my favorite books 
 so i click on the link and continue walking around doing my snack time duties 
 after about a minute into the video i think to myself huh ... i do n't remember this part '' 
 then the bomb drops at <unk> i rushed to the computer to turn it off but it was too late 
 some students were screaming some were crying and i was ready to sign a letter of <unk> 
 i called all the parents that night and told them about the mistake 
 fortunately they took it well but i 'm pretty sure i ruined the giving tree for my students 
 = so like most this did n't happen today 
 or yesterday 
 not even this year 
 in 2010 it was the second quarter of my freshman year of college 
 it was a pretty typical friday night : i found myself playing beer pong with a person i did n't know and i house i 'd never been before and drinking something that i was n't quite sure of 
 we had been playing for what seemed like an eternity when i notice two girls from my dorm walk into the room 
 i am shitfaced by this point and i call out to them despite not knowing them very well 
 they come over and we talk about dumb shit such as what 're you drinking do you know of any other parties etc 
 one of the girls is maybe the most beautiful girl i 've ever seen sober 
 the other is ... <unk> we 'll call her <unk> so at some point in the conversation a asks her friend if she wants to go dance 
 she says no since she and i are having an intelligent conversation about the finer points of beer pong 
 i ask a why she does n't just go ask a guy to dance with her 
 she says that she 's afraid of being turned down 
 this is were i fuck up 
 quick point : i can barely stand straight 
 i start laying down the most <unk> speech i have ever heard 
 i tell her to go out and dance and if guys do n't want to dance then they are <unk> idiots since they do n't know what they 're missing 
 she is a strong independent beautiful woman who does n't need the <unk> of any man to have a good time 
 i continue for about 15 mins of <unk> <unk> 
 afterwards she looks at me i can still see the <unk> of admiration in her eyes and says wow thanks <unk> 
 would you want to go dance with me '' 
 nah '' 
 and i turn around and keep playing beer pong 
 tl : dr i helped a girl with her confidence only to immediately <unk> her doubts and <unk> it 
 edit : wow this blew up 
 i 'm glad some many people find humor in my moment of <unk> 
 edit 2 : the <unk> : thanks for the gold stranger 
 i feel <unk> superior to everyone else already.tirfu 
 i had to go i mean really go ... explosive <unk> churning in the colon so time was of the essence 
 the seat was up so i threw it down with my foot while getting the belt and trousers open relief is seconds away and the panic of possibly shitting my pants is almost gone 
 i spin around and drop on the seat 
 i did n't count on the slow closing seat ... you know the kind that makes the seat and lid not slam down on the porcelain when you drop it 
 sat too fast scrotum got caught between the seat and the bowl causing me to scream and instinctively try to jump up which caused all of the waiting terror to release immediately 
 it did so as i was standing up which painted the back of the top of the toilet tank with a jackson <unk> masterpiece 
 oh and i bruised my <unk> in the process 
 fml today ... i apologize in advance for the sloppiness i 'll update when i get to my hotel 
 i 'll cut to the chase by saying that once i got boarded on my flight to florida i started to get a little hungry 
 no big deal i thought since i have some sugar less gummy bears to eat 
 i know it sounds gross but i 'm <unk> to eat healthier 
 well once i <unk> the 1 pound bag of them immediately the teenager next to me asked if he could have some 
 i did n't care because i talked to him once we were <unk> and he seemed pretty chill plus that bag was one pound and there was no way i was going to do it by myself 
 we 're going to town on this bag because they are n't that bad actually 
 i 'm sitting in the window seat and this kid is sitting next to me in the isle seat and across the isle is his little brother less than 2 years old if i had to guess and his mother next to him in the window seat across the plane 
 the toddler is getting all curious so the the teen next to me begins to tear the bears in little pieces to let him have some 
 again i did n't really care because the whole family was pretty chill 
 by now all three of us are eating some and the bag is running low 
 the teen showed no signs of stopping so i just asked if he wanted the rest 
 he agrees and takes it while i try to get some shut eye 
 the teen follow suit and asks his mom if she wants to keep tearing the little bears up to feed to the garbage <unk> of a toddler 
 the mom starts <unk> on them while simultaneously feeding the toddler some 
 i did n't think much of it because i started to actually fall asleep 
 i woke up with the worst feeling in my stomach not 30 minutes later 
 i take the small blanket i had off over my face and all three of the family <unk> are nowhere to be seen 
 at this point they could have fallen out of the fuckin plane and i would n't have cared <unk> my stomach was feeling like it was hitting the abort button like i was having the <unk> 
 i get up and make my way to the bathroom at the front of the plane and i spot the teen that was sitting next to me banging on the door actually fucking crying 
 i start to put two and two together that it might be the gummy bears since we all are some 
 well after banging on the door the mom and toddler finally come out in a rush with the mother looking like she just served in <unk> 
 she 's sweating like crazy and starts asking me what the fuck i put in those gummies 
 i told her straight from up that i had no idea what is going on because i had just bought the bag and did n't do anything to it 
 the absolute second i finish my sentence the baby shoots liquid diarrhea out of it 's ass like it was being paid to do it 
 i ca n't handle shit and some of it even got on my forearm so start to puke 
 mid projectile vomit the teen comes out sweating bullets and i rush in their 
 i sit on the toilet and enter <unk> when my ass opened 
 i swear i lifted off the fucking seat while simultaneously blowing chunks in the piss station to the right of the toilet 
 once i 'm done throwing up i can hear the complete chaos unfolding outside the door 
 the toddler is hysterical the mom i 'd shouting and the stewardess is trying to calm everyone down 
 i clean up as much as i could and step out of the bathroom and as soon as i did the most <unk> smell hit my nose 
 i assess the damage done by the <unk> squirting baby and it was a lot worse than i thought 
 not only did the baby manage to shit out of it 's <unk> and onto my forearm but also all over the seats in the first row 
 thank god no one was sitting there as i make my way back to my seat not wanting to look the shit covered mother in the face i notice the baby also left a trail of turds all along the isle leading to her seat 
 i got back to my seat and everyone is looking at me like i opened fire on a bag of newborn puppies 
 i apologized more than i have ever in my life 
 and explained that i did n't know that gummy bears could do that 
 the plane made an emergency landing and everyone got off the plane because the smell was too much 
 i went to the airport bathroom to freshen up and once i got back i look at the plane i had just gotten off and they literally had guys in <unk> suits going in with cleaning <unk> 
 i have never been more ashamed in my entire life and i 'm literally shaking right now 
 tldr : i shared sugar less gummy bears on my plane 
 little did i know they are laxatives and me and three others shit like out lives <unk> on it and create a huge mess 
 edit 1 : i 've been talking to police getting this figured out 
 the mom thought i had put something in them to make us react 
 i 'm telling them the story and how sugar less candy can act as laxatives 
 til i will edit/update <unk> we saw star wars with a couple friends this evening and went out for some drinks afterwards 
 while sipping our drinks we discussed the movie and our reactions 
 while doing so our neighbor who has n't seen the movie yet texts the wife asking how the movie was 
 so my wife writes a response text which is excellent & lt spoiler & gt & lt spoiler & gt '' where there is a massive spoiler inserted in the & lt & gt 
 she shows us what she 's writing on her phone we laugh and say do n't send '' 
 thinking she is joking 
 she sends 
 it gets kind of quiet and i very calmly tell her that was a dick move in front of everyone 
 the neighbor instantly responds with some very pc sad texts 
 like major bummer did you really just tell me the truth 
 : she tries to laugh it off our friends kind of laugh it off 
 then the texts keep coming 
 this is our neighbor who feeds our pet for us while we 're out on vacation so we know her pretty well 
 wife shows another text worse than bummer one and tries to laugh it off again 
 i again say it was really a dick move and we should probably just apologize tomorrow again in front of everyone and she <unk> 
 she explodes about how she does n't care tells me to get a cab ride home and leaves me there 
 our friends kind of do the awkward <unk> of the drink and i strike up a conversation about something unrelated to move it on 
 i hang out with the friends for another hour or so one gives me a ride home and that 's that 
 except it is n't 
 i get home see the wife is asleep and then go outside to apologize to the neighbor 
 when my neighbor answers her door she is obviously sad and when i apologize for the text she starts tearing up and making excuses for my wife 
 i say sure it may be true the wife is not a <unk> star wars fan and may not understand these things but she should n't ruin the movie for you and gave several good <unk> reasons to still see the movie 
 i get back into our place and the wife is up because obviously she was n't sleeping 
 we argue and we fight mostly because i embarrassed her in front of people by saying it was a dick move '' 
 normally to keep a balance i will <unk> on some of these things but i stuck to my guns that she should apologize to our neighbor the next day 
 the wife does n't want to plays the victim card about how we already bought our neighbor a christmas present and it gets pretty ugly from there on out 
 divorce is threatened lots of back and forth and i 'm on the couch writing this 
 tl dr : i fucked up by saying it 's a dick move to <unk> star wars in front of our friends 
 **edit : ** thanks for listening to my rant 
 no we 're not getting divorced and yes some of you are right in assuming that there are some social problems where she was not treated well growing up but she 's getting better and is worth the trouble 
 we sorted it out and ended up buying <unk> tickets for the neighbor and her bf the next day to make up for it.so this happened last night 
 i went out for a meal with some friends then went back to drink at theirs 
 a lot of drinking occurred 
 at about 2am i realised that i was pretty much unable to focus on what was going on around me so promptly got a taxi home 
 now the fuck up 
 i was starving and my incoherent brain wanted pizza i vaguely remembered a dominos deal going on so i grab my laptop 
 i order a large mighty <unk> then change my mind 
 i change my order to a <unk> hot 
 then a <unk> passion then a texas bbq then a <unk> 
 this went on for a while 
 when i finally settled on one i sat on the sofa and went to sleep 
 this morning i wake up to 7 missed calls and texts from an unknown number and flatmates woken up by knocking at 4am 
 i missed the order 
 i 'm pretty annoyed but hey its <unk> right 
 wrong 
 i ordered 8 large pizzas thinking i was changing it each time 
 i then slept through the delivery and never saw the delicious pizzas 
 this is quite possibly the single worst thing that has ever <unk> i wore pants which is not unlike any other day in my life 
 however today i wore these new dark jeggings do n't judge me i had recently purchased 
 i checked myself out in the mirror then headed to class 
 little did i know the <unk> awaiting me 
 in the middle of class my legs started to kind of feel tingly and my feet were numb 
 i looked down and noticed my feet were a <unk> color kind of like <unk> 
 this was not surprising to me because i have raynaud 's <unk> which means that sometimes my extremities do n't get enough <unk> so they turn funny <unk> and go numb 
 i 'd seen this several times before had the doctors check it out and they said i was good so why worry about it now 
 i did n't think much about it until i got home and i realized my feet were <unk> numb even after three hours 
 normally it goes away very fast 
 i touched my legs and realized they felt cold to the touch 
 this was when i took my pants off and discovered that both of my legs were purple 
 i 'm talking <unk> 
 straight up <unk> 
 like the kind of purple that makes you instantly <unk> 
 i immediately freaked out and began slapping my legs like an idiot making this god awful <unk> sound trying to determine if there was any feeling there 
 i could n't really tell because they were a little numb 
 i started doing squats and moving <unk> no change in <unk> 
 i began running scolding hot water over them thinking somewhere in my brain that the hot water would help the blood return to the surface of my skin and change the color 
 at this point i was 100 % convinced that i was going to lose both of my legs and have to use a wheelchair the rest of my life 
 after the last two months of <unk> house i was sure this had to be like some crazy cancer or weird disorder and that my legs were going to be <unk> due to lack of oxygen or blood or whatever it was 
 i started to cry and was thinking about how to get help and whether or not i should call my mom 
 how would i even explain to my family that i was going to be crippled for the rest of my life 
 i started having a full-blown panic attack <unk> and crying and freaking out like a rabid <unk> 
 i looked back down to realize that the bath water was now a light shade of purple and my legs were less so 
 i blinked a few times then i scrubbed my skin roughly and more purple came off 
 after much vigorous scrubbing and water the majority of the purple washed away 
 my new jeggings which i had not washed yet had dyed my skin while i was wearing <unk> nothing more 
 the fact that they had been cold and numb was just related to the <unk> but was n't serious 
 and i felt like an idiot 
 **tl dr but you ai n't got no legs <unk> <unk> edit : i did n't expect this to get any real attention so thank you to everyone who shared in my shame 
 it 's comforting on some level to know that many other people had similar experiences 
 shout out to all the raynaud 's <unk> you the real <unk> 
 and to the people who complained about the tl <unk> do you know what it 's like not to be able to use your legs 
 but seriously go watch forrest gump and enjoy the day 
 edit 's edit : thank you to the person who gave me gold 
 here’s a little background on me 
 i 'm a 27 year old who is white and gay 
 i 'm not what you would call a stereotypical gay 
 i 'm not <unk> i do n't have a <unk> and i have horrible fashion sense 
 despite this being 2015 and it not being a stigma to be gay where i live i have still not come out at work 
 i 'm also a natural flirt 
 it 's not sexual it 's just my default setting 
 i work in a pretty small office setting 
 it 's just me my boss and five ladies 
 i have a great relationship with everyone in the office especially a girl named vee 
 everyone calls us the office couple '' 
 vee is a beautiful black woman and if i was n't 100 % <unk> for the other team i would probably be all over that grand slam style 
 i keep my office life and personal life separate 
 i 'll go out for after work drinks with the girls but really nothing further than that 
 i have a wonderful boyfriend but he has never stepped one foot into my office building or met any coworkers 
 yesterday at lunch a couple of the girls came up to me and asked if i would ask vee out 
 they spent all lunch trying to convince me saying things like ... '' she 's single '' and you two are such fun and so cute together '' and she told us she likes you '' 
 you know the basic high school bs you hope to escape in the adult world only to realize that nobody changes 
 trying to escape this horrible <unk> i said something that would <unk> into my biggest regret : i 'm just not into people like her '' 
 now i know what you are thinking and trust me i 've thought about it constantly over the past 12 hours 
 why did i say the word <unk> 
 i could have just said i 'm just not into <unk> no need for the people part 
 i 'm an idiot and i fucked up that 's why 
 i thought i was being clever and putting water on the fire without admitting my <unk> 
 <unk> 
 ** what do you mean you 're not into <unk> like her '' 
 she 's just not my type ok '' 
 no not ok you said people like her 
 what do you mean 
 is it because she 's black '' 
 what 
 of course not 
 i have no problem with vee being black '' 
 then what is it 
 why are you being such an asshole '' 
 it 's just ... just ... i 'm gay '' 
 do n't pull that gay shit on me 
 you 're not getting out of this 
 you 're always flirting with everyone we know you 're not gay '' 
 i ran out of the lunchroom 
 went to my office and shut the door 
 i stealthily left at the end of the day without anyone seeing me 
 it 's the next day now and everyone is giving me dirty looks 
 now despite actually being gay and attempting an actual come out '' at work no one will believe me 
 vee has n't said a single word to me 
 **tl dr : no one believes i 'm gay so that makes me a racist 
 ** edit : update : this happened years ago when i was in college and still haunts me to this day 
 i had been casually dating a girl for a few months not being careful enough and she became pregnant 
 she decided she was going to keep the baby 
 we were both terrified because we were still in college not committed and not at all ready for that 
 a few days after taking multiple pregnancy tests we were having sex and something just did n't feel right 
 the texture was different kind of like anal but ... sticky and chunky 
 i pulled out and looked down and saw this bloody substance all over my junk my stomach and the bed 
 neither of us had any idea what it was and did n't think much of it assuming it was period remnants or something 
 a few days later she went to the doctor to get a <unk> on the pregnancy 
 when she came back and told me the news it was then that i realized that the substance covering my body and her sheets was my <unk> <unk> work in the it branch of a large company wich manages 4 hospitals and a lot of smaller <unk> 
 the ceo clicked on a mail containing the new <unk> called <unk> <unk> and his pc immediatly came to our offices 
 luckily we have great relationship between co-workers 
 and so we are joking about the dickhead of our ceo who managed to get this virus with a <unk> file 
 with a live <unk> 's boot cd we discovered that luckily only the files in the shared folders were encrypted leaving a lot of file untouched 
 so we decided to clone this hard disk on another one format the original disk to <unk> windows and copy back the good files 
 so now i 'm in front of <unk> ghost 32 with the 2 disks connected and had to decide wich disk to use as source and wich to use as destination 
 you probably guess where this is going 
 i had no other relevant information but the brand of the 2 disks and my <unk> brain <unk> them 
 time <unk> 20 minutes the clone is done and i boot the original disk before formatting it to save the files and the pc configurations 
 on the windows logo screen i immediately start jerking to why the pc of the ceo was still <unk> and had a very strange pc and login names 
 in a split second the realization kicks in : i copied <unk> the disks and completely lost the pc configurations and the good files 
 i immediately go to report to my boss who had to call the ceo and fake that all the file were lost with the virus to cover me 
 tl dr my boss will never trust me again because idiot me erased ceo hard <unk> 'm doing this from my phone so forgive me 
 so last night my girlfriend said she 's going to sneak me into her basement so we could cuddle and watch a movie 
 i had no plans to sleep over but as the night went along we both got sleepy and i figured why not 
 she brought me a blanket and pillow and we snuggled on the couch until she left me to go sleep in her room a little later 
 a little context : she 's chinese 
 she left to go sleep in her room so that when her parents wake up they would find her in her room 
 she also said no one comes to the basement so you 'll be fine '' 
 well about an hour ago i was startled by lots of movement upstairs 
 my ears were glued to the sound of steps walking all over the house 
 suddenly one heads downstairs 
 luckily the couch is facing away from the entrance so i hid under the sheets and waited while someone i think her dad turned off the <unk> and continued to do some other stuff 
 i swear my stomach started to make small noises just to spite me 
 after he went back upstairs i ran into this closet and just waited until i realized i really needed to take a shit 
 assuming her dad coming downstairs was a one-time thing and was n't going to happen again i ran to the nearby bathroom and kept the lights off while i silently pooped 
 thump thump thump ... good god the sounds of steps came again 
 but they would n't be coming to the basement bathroom would they '' 
 boy was i wrong 
 her dad tried to open the bathroom and when he could n't he went away for a second and came back with a key i think 
 i grab onto the knob and hold the lock down while he pushes from the front 
 looking back from 20 minutes into the future this is kind of funny but at that moment my mind was racing with all the potential situations as to his reaction to finding a brown man sitting on his toilet 
 granted he knows what i look like ... but still 
 luckily her dad gave up and went upstairs 
 in this time i decided fuck it and ran to the closet after <unk> 
 i did n't wipe and holy shit was that a good idea 
 he came back almost immediately 
 i 'm sure he was stupefied as to why the bathroom smelled like shit and how the door was open 
 now i 'm in the closet 
 thank fuck my shit was solid 
 so here i am guys 
 i 'm in the closet right now with a poopy ass 
 her dad is watching tv on the treadmill here 
 he probably noticed the blanket and pillow but i kind of thought ahead last and kind of left my shoes in a hidden corner 
 hopefully he wo n't see them because technically he could if he looked properly 
 i tried messaging and calling my gf but she 's passed out and her phone is dead i think 
 also i read a similar tifu a while back where people suggested ordering pizza to act as an escape but i do n't know if that 'll work because her mom and brother could still be upstairs 
 she said they should all be gone by 11 though 
 that 's ... two hours 
 the funny part is i 'm 23 and she 21 and this is a very high school thing to do 
 okay that 's not that funny 
 there 's just a lot of cobwebs here and i do n't like spiders 
 help me reddit 
 keep me company in the hour of my doom 
 # <unk> tl dr : snuck into girlfriend 's basement and slept over now smelling like poop and hiding in the closet from her dad who used to be in a chinese gang 
 edit : just so you guys know i 'm not black i 'm indian 
 update # 1 : tv is off and i think he went upstairs 
 i 'm still staying here 
 i promise you i 've learned from my mistakes 
 update # 2 : girlfriend is awake 
 <unk> rescue mission 
 update # 3 : she 's scoping the situation upstairs and is going to come down in a bit 
 update # 4 : she has n't come down yet but i hear voices upstairs and i feel like he 's asking her about why there might be a pillow and blanket downstairs ... update # 5 : victory is mine brothers and sisters 
 he left to go to work and i am now enjoying a welcome coffee from my lovely girlfriend 
 update # 6 : i did n't think a 6th update was necessary ... but guys ... obviously i wiped before drinking coffee 
 one of my cousins lost her left middle finger in an accident a few years ago 
 the other day she posted a photo on facebook of her <unk> hand nails after she 'd have them painted 
 in my <unk> state i decided to leave a humorous comment 
 the next morning i checked my phone to see numerous angry comments 
 confused and unable to remember what i 'd written i went to the photo 
 turns out that i 'd written do you get a 10 % discount '' 
 next time i meet with her should be ... fun 
 i posted proof in the comments earlier on but i think it 's been buried 
 here it is <unk> the how to count '' edit : a lot of people seem to be confused as to why a 10 % discount is necessary and not a 20 % off 
 to clarify most people get both hands worth of nails done at once 
 you have 10 fingers 
 10 % of 10 is 1 
 <unk> is <unk> the number of nails that she needs done 
 edit : thanks to both users for gilding me 
 i 've remove your names to ensure that this post is n't removed again 
 sorry but thanks so much 
 also someone did a reading of this 
 it 's on youtube with the same name as this post but i ca n't link it <unk> at the request of the mods 
 this whole sequence of events took place in less than 10 seconds 
 reflexes fuck you 
 there 's a short but in this case crucial moment between wiping your ass and dropping the paper in the toilet bowl 
 as i was wiping my ass i sneezed 
 a slimy drop of snot landed on my upper lip and instinctively i put the paper i was holding on my nose to wipe it off 
 my body 's way of saying wtf bro you put shit on your nose '' was instant puking which landed on my hands and in my lap 
 now i 'm standing up screaming out my disgust with pants around my ankles shit on my face and puke all over 
 wife comes banging on the door wondering what 's wrong 
 my instant thought is she must never know '' 
 in my stress i reach for the door to ensure it 's locked so that she ca n't make any rescue attempts 
 of course i trip fall face first on the door 
 this does n't calm my wife but leaves vomit all over the door and a hurting nose which i instinctively grab to acknowledge the pain 
 it 's all a mess like taken from a <unk> version of faulty towers been spending the last half hour showering cleaning the bathroom and making up half ass explanations to my wife 
 i still smell the shit in my nose 
 i was in class where i was randomly partnered up with a girl to do a group project 
 i have never said a word to this girl but she is a smoking hot 10/10 
 so we talked after class and decided to stay after school to work on the project to get it out of the way 
 so i arrived home late since i stayed at school and my girlfriend asked why i was n't home at my normal time 
 not in a paranoid type of way ... but just curious about where i was 
 so i told her oh i have a group project to do and her and i decided to stay after class and get it done '' she jokingly responded oh so she 's your side ho now '' 
 i said no she 's way out of my league '' she said then how are you dating me '' 
 i said because you 're in my league '' 3 hours later ... .the bedroom door is still locked and i want to go to bed 
 update : she unlocked the door called me a moron threw a glass of water on me and i better do something special tomorrow night 
 we have been dating for 6 years and practically <unk> happened a bit ago 
 i 've wanted to put some distance from the event because you never know who 's a redditor out there 
 the company i worked for was an advertising company 
 so needless to say their website consisted of posting all of their work 
 about a hundred or so video files 
 and it was my job to convert them and put them up on the website 
 here 's where it gets a little tricky 
 the website was hosted via a server that we also used to send out clients <unk> 
 problem is i was new and did n't know that 
 i assumed the website linked back to some other server not the server we regularly deleted media off of via ftp 
 in case you do n't see where this is going i had to free up space on the server via an ftp 
 so i selected a bunch of files and hit delete 
 then i see it 
 a folder marked website 
 and then it was gone 
 my pulse starts to race i can feel the color drain from my face 
 i go to the website and start clicking around 
 it 's all gone 
 every file 
 just a <unk> <unk> with a line through it 
 even worse i found out we did n't have back-ups for any of it and this was work going back to when the company started 10 years ago 
 when i say back-ups i mean the converted files 
 the files needed to be a certain size <unk> etc to play on the website 
 i could n't just put them up there raw 
 also they were scattered around in the <unk> 
 also they each had specific <unk> code that linked them to the site that i did n't know 
 long story short i spent the next week <unk> converting and resorting the entire website 
 no one ever found out but there was a very close call when the owner of the company brought up the site in a meeting with a client 
 luckily he clicked on one of the only files i managed to restore at that point 
 i spent that entire week horribly anxious not sleeping well 
 tl dr : did n't know our company was hosting their site off a server we used via ftp to send clients materials 
 deleted the content and spent the entire week fixing it 
 edit for clarification : i knew that the video files were on the server but i was only told to put them there to send to the web designer 
 i had absolutely no idea he was hosting off our server meaning all of the video files on the website linked back <unk> to the ftp which made little to no sense to me 
 therefore i did n't think anything of quickly deleting files off the ftp we normally deleted from 
 edit 2 : we were not a web design company so i do n't know anything about web design 
 i merely was tasked with <unk> the files and sending them 
 we outsourced the task of web design to a particularly inept individual 
 ***edit 3 : the website was set up by an outsourced web designer not affiliated with the company 
 i do n't know where the website itself ran from 
 for the videos however they were instructed to put all of the video files into a single folder on a server via the ftp 
 he linked directly to that folder for all the videos 
 this was not my design this was someone else 's 
 *** **edit 4 : ok now i see why everyone 's having a problem with this post 
 you have to understand we just called it the ftp '' meaning we were uploading to a server via an ftp transmit 
 so when i say we threw it up on the ftp '' it means we used transmit to upload the files to a folder on a server 
 there 
 that should clear things up 
 sorry for the massive confusion 
 ** fixed instances of this in the post edit 5 : the video files for the website were in the same location as the places we put the videos we sent to clients 
 they were in a separate folder yes but still in the same location 
 we were always scrambling for server space so we would have to delete things here to make room 
 this particular day i was being <unk> by my boss to make room very quickly 
 so i just selected a bunch of items for delete not knowing at all that the videos for our website were <unk> there as well until it was too late 
 it was common practice to delete things from there except nobody gave me the <unk> there was anything to avoid 
 we only used the ftp to transmit files so while i had transmitted website files before i thought it was simply a <unk> not that they were being hosted from that server as well 
 my friend was complaining how bad fallout 4 looked on her ps4 
 i jokingly told her that she should plug her **galaxy <unk> to upgrade the graphics and i even showed her a video how the ps4 can use the hardware of a smartphone to improve <unk> 
 she believed it and told me she 'll try it soon 
 i was internally laughing about the <unk> of the situation on my way out i told her do n't forget to charge your phone in the microwave first for 1 minute before plugging it in your ps4 google it if you do n't believe me 
 i left while having a laugh thinking that she 'd figure out its all bs i mean the microwave your <unk> thing ... everyone knows that 
 4 hours later about 30 minutes ago i got a phone call from her brother telling me the said friend cooked '' her phone and she is yelling like a <unk> that she will murder me 
 i switched off my phone i logged out of everything on my pc ... guys ... i am terrified ... i 'm home from college for winter break and this fuck up starts november first when i started growing the <unk> <unk> beard for <unk> and deciding to rock it as well as not cut my hair for a couple months ... because why not 
 basically i look this fucking guy well my mother was busy so she told me to go pick up my little brother from school 
 i hopped in the car and drove to his middle school and pulled up in the line of cars where parents wait to pick up their kids 
 apparently there 's a new system because i did n't see a guy <unk> cars when to move and i accidentally cut off a school bus that was trying to get past 
 the guy came over and knocked on my window and said first time 
 we take turns here sir 
 you have to wait for my signal '' 
 so whatever i stay in line and kids come out and their parents take them away 
 i did n't bring my phone because he usually comes out right away and i thought i 'd be home in five minutes 
 ten minutes pass 
 where is this guy 
 fifteen minutes 
 <unk> is he doing 
 twenty minutes 
 by this point i 'm straight staring at the front door watching all these other kids come out 
 i ca n't even text my brother 
 now the security guy from before seems to be watching me <unk> and so are a few of the other teachers waiting inside to make sure all the kids make it home safely 
 and i 'm staring back at them like do n't hate me cuz i 'm <unk> 
 then it hits me ... my brother does n't go to this fucking school anymore 
 he was in eighth grade last year and is now a freshman in high school 
 i 'm at the wrong fucking school 
 so i just ... pull away and leave 
 from their point of view a haggard bearded guy they had never seen before who was coming to pick up a kid for the first time '' just waited in front of the school for half an hour watched all the kids intently as they came out had what must have been a frustrated look on his face i think i sighed a few times as i got more and more pissed at my brother being late '' and then just fucking left 
 tl dr : i can never go back to that school again edit : not that i would ever have to ... edit 2 : i 've been narrated 
 for the past 6 months my best friend has maintained an excel doc on his laptop to keep track of every time he masturbated 
 he did this at the <unk> of his girlfriend 
 when he confided this to me i could n't believe it 
 but apparently 7 months prior she had caught him masturbating in his kitchen which is weird i know and got very angry and disturbed 
 she insisted that he keep a log of every time he masturbated 
 so for 6 months he 's had an excel doc <unk> every time he <unk> 
 it had the following columns : date time location what i masturbated to if online pornography he had to include a hyperlink to the video and notes 
 so the other day my friend left his laptop open 
 he left went out to get beer 
 i saw the excel logo on the bottom of his screen and i wondered if it was his <unk> masturbation log 
 it was 
 i had to peek 
 then i go the idea to prank him 
 i knew his girlfriend <unk> the log at the end of every week 
 so i <unk> up a bit to make some edits to his entries from a few days ago to make it look like he masturbated to some weird ass shit 
 here are a few of the entries i inserted : what i masturbated to : your friend ashley 's facebook album of her at that beach in mexico 
 included a url for the album 
 notes : she 's very sexy 
 i imagine her often when we make love 
 what i masturbated to : youtube video of a mouse caught in a glue trap 
 included url to vid notes : <unk> 
 what i masturbated to : imagined what it would be like to have sex with a <unk> in a factory farm 
 notes : first time fantasizing about <unk> i am into it 
 what i masturbated to : just a link to a gay porn video something with cock '' in the title notes : very nice 
 and a few more things like that 
 saved the doc 
 so i thought it was a pretty funny prank 
 well ... turns out he never noticed the entries she saw them and she 100 % thought that he entered them 
 apparently she absolutely refused to believe somebody pranked him and she was completely disgusted 
 crying and shouting i hear 
 she thinks he 's a complete <unk> 
 she broke up with him 
 my friend is furious 
 but he has no idea it was me who did it 
 he constantly leaves his laptop open he has a lot of people over the entries were from earlier in the week 
 i do n't think he suspects me 
 but he 's really angry and also down in the <unk> about it 
 his now <unk> told her friends about his sick fetishes '' and obviously the rumors are starting to spread 
 i want to admit it was a prank but i wo n't 
 i feel so awful 
 i am thinking of sending an anonymous email to her telling her it was a prank but not revealing my identity 
 tl dr - tifu by accidentally getting my best friends girlfriend to break up with him when i as a prank edited his masturbation log '' excel doc that she forced him to maintain 
 it was n't today but i mentioned it in a comment and some people wanted a story so here i go 
 in high school one day i was waiting for my mom to pick me up because my car was in the shop and while waiting i was really bored and picked up a leaf and was just fucking with it 
 at one point i rubbed it against a wall and some of the chlorophyll rubbed of and onto a the wall 
 i thought to my self oh that 's cool i 'm gon na make a square '' 
 a few seconds later while i 'm making my square the school cop runs up and grabs my arm and <unk> it behind my back and handcuffs me and throws me in his car screaming at me while he does 
 luckily my mother was there to get me already and when the cop told her i was about to go to jail for rubbing a leaf against a wall she demanded we see the principal first to tell her why that 's stupid 
 we told her the circumstances and how i had no malicious intent that it was just a guy being fascinated by something he learned at school 3 years ago my principal said and i quote well you may know that was chlorophyll but some of our less <unk> minded students will see that and think they can write on walls that 's why we have to suspend you for writing <unk> '' tl : dr i thought science was cool and looked at chlorophyll and got suspended because some kids do n't pay attention in freshman <unk> happened a good long while ago now so not really today ... it was april when i started this journey 
 during the winter i became a member of a magic mushroom forum and was learning all i could about growing magic mushrooms 
 i tried it once before and grew only a yellowish green mush that smelled of sweaty socks but this time would be different 
 i had a spore print sent to me and was off to the races 
 i had tried mushrooms once before about 10 years prior and the experience was rather enjoyable 
 i have had way too many bad experiences with lsd to ever think about trying it and from what i remembered the mushroom experience was much less <unk> and harsh for me than the majority of my acid trips had been 
 after following every tip i could gather and about a month and a half of waiting i have viable mushrooms drying in the food <unk> 
 the whole journey from spore print to fruit was done for reasons i don’t yet have a great grasp on 
 i was thinking at the time that growing them would <unk> some <unk> meaning into my experience 
 it had been a long long time since i had taken any illegal substance and i wanted it to be special in some way 
 growing them myself was an attempt at providing that i guess 
 the night i took them i really wasn’t planning on doing so 
 i was <unk> out of my wits and chatting with <unk> friends 
 i told them i was going to eat my mushrooms but didn’t know how much to eat without a scale 
 i took a few pics of my intended dose and posted them and immediately got advice to cut that dose in half 
 so with my wife asleep i went down to the kitchen and made a concoction of purple <unk> and powered mushrooms and <unk> it down 
 i came back up and told the <unk> that the deal was done and that i was taking shower and would be back once the fun started 
 in the shower about 5 minutes when i felt a rush like i consciousness was being pulled away from my body 
 i was fighting to keep it with me 
 it felt as though is i had let it fly away i would have had a full out of body experience but for some reason i felt compelled hold on to it 
 i quickly turned off the water and looked down at my feet 
 they seemed miles away 
 that is when it hit me that the shrooms were kicking in 
 out of the shower and i put on the same clothes i came in with and headed up stairs 
 the shower is in the basement of the house and there is a door at the top of the stairs 
 opening the door the light from the kitchen blasted my eyes and i got a good gauge of how far along in the experience i was 
 i would see that the kitchen floor looked smooth and had a liquid like texture 
 but before i could survey any more my black cat ran down in the basement 
 i didn’t want to forget about him down there and it never really thought that i could just leave the door open and shoo any members of our herd that wandered down there after my trip 
 i trudged down the stairs after him and scooped him up and started back up the stairs 
 half way up a brown blur flew down the stairs as another cat dove to the basement 
 i tossed the black one in the kitchen and went after the brown one 
 while s picking up brown one the black cat came back down the steps again and i scooped him up too 
 now i am carrying 2 cats up the stairs 
 at the top of the stairs the door is wide open and i see our other 3 cats had come to investigate the commotion 
 as i made the final push to the top they all jumped into action like they planned it in advance 
 i started laughing hysterically let go of the cats in my arms and sat on the top step as i watched all the cats bounce down the stairs 
 i found the whole situation so funny 
 here i am coming up hard on mushrooms 
 i can feel the confusion building every second and now i have to figure a way of getting all 5 cats out of the basement 
 by the time i had collected myself and <unk> a plan my face was hot and objects were starting to move 
 the time dilation had manifested and minutes were seeming to take longer and longer 
 my plan was to go down and capture one cat at a time and usher them up stairs 
 once i got to five the task would be complete 
 i raced down and grabbed the first cat i came across 
 and ran to the up to the landing and toss it pretty forcefully up the last 3 steps into the kitchen so it would get the point that i didn’t want them down there 
 back down i went and did the same thing…that’s 2 down and 3 to go 
 i was getting more confused by the minute and on the fourth <unk> had forgot how many cats i had previously ushered up the stairs 
 <unk> <unk> on my way back down i decided to count the cats down stairs and that would let me know how many were upstairs 
 unfortunately the whole time i had neglected one key detail in my <unk> <unk> door was still open 
 just as i reach the basement floor the whole heard can <unk> down again 
 plan a was an utter failure 
 formulated just as quickly as plan a was plan b. cats have got names right 
 i will count the cats as i bring them up and remember the name of each cat so that i don’t lose track like the last time 
 <unk> 
 i thump back down the stairs and grab <unk> the black one and take him up stairs 
 he quickly tries to run back down and i push him back and close the door 
 back down stairs i grab another cat 
 <unk> <unk> i think as i put her up stairs and close the door behind me 
 at this point my mind is worn out 
 things are moving very well and walls have waves in them and on them 
 it is all but impossible to keep my mind on the task at hand 
 those 2 things coupled with the fact that the time dilation is making the last 5 minutes chasing these beasts feel like i have been at it for hours is making this <unk> <unk> about as much as my brain could handle in its current state 
 i <unk> on trying to complete this task and grab another cat but again at the top of the stairs i forgot where i was in the order 
 i put that cat up stairs and tried to count the cats up there to give me an idea of how many were left 
 but of course they are not in the kitchen anymore 
 and again it escapes me that if i just keep bring up cats until i run out of cats to retrieve i will be through with this <unk> fuck 
 unable to think pass my current predicament i race around up stairs looking for the cats that had been brought up and they are nowhere to be found 
 my state had grown worse and i start thinking that maybe they got outside 
 but there was no way they could get out because no one opened <unk> ... ... 
 the <unk> 
 i forgot the close the basement door 
 fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck 
 ran back into the kitchen and down the stairs for the 50 <unk> time and <unk> they were all 5 of <unk> safe and sound 
 i had found the missing cats 
 <unk> 
 they weren’t <unk> wife would have killed me if they were gone 
 me all high and shit and the cats go missing 
 i might as well pack my shit and go 
 what a relief 
 i love my <unk> 
 <unk> * <unk> <unk> 
 are we still in the basement 
 fucking cock sucking son of a bitch mother damn shit <unk> i am done 
 my mental ability is gone 
 each trip up and down felt like an eternity i had only just enough energy left to get up stairs to the couch 
 i kneel by the couch and think about what i am going to do 
 i am mentally exhausted because apparently counting to 5 is impossible while on mushrooms 
 my mind racing to come up with a solution to this impossible problem and never once did i think of just leaving them down there until they found something more entertaining to do than drive me out of my fucking mind 
 the white flag was up 
 it was over 
 i needed the big gun 
 it was 2 or 3am and she had to get up and go to work in the morning but i had no choice ... i needed an adult 
 i have to wake my wife 
 she would make it all better 
 she will tame those damn <unk> and all will be fine ... ... but it wasn’t fine 
 i went up stairs to our room and woke her in the <unk> way possible 
 by jumping on the bed and yelling <unk> 
 i took mushrooms 
 5 cats in the basement and i can only count to 4.” not the way i had envisioned it going down in my head but i was happy to get that much out without forgetting the reason i woke her up in the first place 
 sleepily she marched down the stairs and i lead her to the kitchen where the basement door was still wide open 
 all i could do was stand at the door and point down the stairs 
 i think i may have whimpered a little too with my gesture 
 she was not amused 
 i thought i was finally going to get closure 
 she would get the cats from the basement and i would be saved but <unk> <unk> turn to <unk> as she said the only words in the word that could crush me into an even more pitiful state 
 <unk> get <unk> she said 
 she didn’t understand that i was fighting this fight for what seemed like days now and wanted nothing more than to curl up in the corner and cry until i fell asleep 
 she had no clue how close i was to a break down 
 tears welled up as crossed the threshold of the basement door and <unk> again into my personal hell 
 i scooped up a kitty and carried it slowly up stairs setting it on the kitchen floor 
 one my wife said in a long drawn out voice like she was talking to a 2 year old 
 back down i went and grab up another <unk> of <unk> and <unk> up the stairs only to be shamed again by a long drawn out 2. by the third cat short audible <unk> <unk> sounds were coming from me as i was almost to the breaking point 
 my wife had begun to laugh at me and seemed to laugh harder each time i came up even more beaten than before 
 when the last cat came up i was greeted by a sighing <unk> and a <unk> was that so <unk> from my wife 
 i tried to apologize but she waved me off with a stern <unk> talk about this in the <unk> and walked up stairs to bed 
 the cat ordeal was over but the trip was far from it 
 i was <unk> grateful to my online buddies who talked me into <unk> the dose because the rest of the night was filled with confusion and mind fuckery and intense time dilation 
 not really a bad trip as bad trips go but not at all enjoyable 
 i think i can cross <unk> off the list of viable boredom relievers 
 i won’t be doing them again anytime soon that is for sure 
 tldr : ate magic mushrooms for the first time in many years and chased cats out of the basement all night until i gave up and got my wife to tame the beasts 
 update : wow <unk> the front page got <unk> was a good day 
 thank you for the gold whoever you are 
 i am at work and will get to the few questions when i get home 
 the best part is seeing all the comments of people who can relate 
 update 2 : <unk> things first 
 i have 6 cats now and 2 large dogs 
 my wife is a vet tech and was coming home with a new animal every 6 months to a year 
 every time a <unk> mother got hit by a car i got a sob story a new cat 
 now i think she hit her limit seeing that we have 2 <unk> that hold <unk> of litter each and she is cleaning them out twice a day 
 i told her that she was heading to <unk> cat <unk> status and she stopped collecting them 
 but i really think that if i didn’t say something that i would be swimming in cats right now 
 she has a <unk> next as to why i didn’t leave the cats down <unk> was <unk> of looking past the task at hand and <unk> focused on getting the cats out of the basement because of the effects of the mushrooms 
 under normal circumstances i would have been able to get them up there just by shaking their treats or chasing them with the spray bottle or just left them down there with the door open 
 unfortunately i couldn’t even consider any other options 
 that was my job and it had to be done 
 the mushroom gods had spoken 
 to people giving me advice on how to have a good trip ... you make the mistake that most drug users do 
 you assume i am a <unk> at insert drug here and just need your <unk> 
 let me assure you i my drug dick is bigger than most 
 the number of different substance i have taken is quite extensive 
 my <unk> experiences are in the 50+ range 
 i have given the same advice to other people countless times 
 sometimes you just say fuck <unk> eat that shit 
 sometimes it’s good and sometimes it’s bad 
 for me the majority of my lsd experiences were tough to get through 
 so much so that the mere thought of taking it again gives me anxiety 
 i will not be taking it <unk> feel free to eat my share along with <unk> 
 i wouldn’t say i am 100 % done with shrooms 
 but given that their effects are similar to <unk> stars would have to <unk> so perfectly that having another <unk> experience was the only practical option in that moment 
 it will only be a once in a lifetime event 
 so the chances are next to none that i will ever eat them again 
 i have to say again it is good to see all the people telling of their own <unk> experiences 
 the movement is still alive and growing every day 
 it may not be in our <unk> but someday people like us will be able to experience any substance they want without fear of imprisonment 
 i hope i am here to see that day even if i am too old and <unk> to take the journey myself 
 so this was on valentines day and i was making my girlfriend a nice card because she always liked me making her stuff instead of buying her stuff 
 she was really happy reading the card until 20 seconds in she just looked at me with angry eyes 
 she threw the card at me and said seriously '' 
 i felt strange that she did such a thing 
 at first i thought she was mad because the card was n't good enough but it did n't really make any sense to me so i picked the card up and read it 
 everything was normal until the last line 
 if i was asked to put a price tag on you i could n't because you are just too worthless '' i do n't know how i could fuck up something so simple 
 i meant to write priceless '' 
 even after i explained it to her she was still <unk> about it and i basically ruined our valentines day 
 tl dr : told my girlfriend she 's worthless '' instead of priceless '' i do n't usually open doors for anyone but recently i 've been trying to be more chivalrous because thats fucking awesome 
 what better way than opening the car door for my sweet mom 
 i park the car like a boss turn it off like a light switch get out like i 'm about to finish go to her door like a graceful <unk> and open it 
 what i saw was my portal to this world 
 she was in a dress full on commando 
 she did n't notice that i noticed but i noticed that i noticed and i did n't want to notice that i noticed 
 but i did 
 now i 'm scarred 
 tl dr : spawn point located 
 & amp nbsp edit : <unk> q & amp a** is she hot 
 & amp nbsp she 's my mom and i 'm not into wincest sorry bros. that 's a no & amp nbsp how 's the <unk> 
 & amp nbsp did n't see it long enough to notice and glad it 's that way 
 & amp nbsp continuing the <unk> 
 & amp nbsp yeah of course 
 & amp nbsp also thanks for the laughs you guys provided i hope you all have a great day 
 & amp nbsp edit 2 : thank you to <unk> for the narration 
 i am a 21 year old guy 
 today i was returning home from a dinner party when along the way i met this girl on the bus 
 before moving ahead let me bring to light the fact that she is very good looking drop dead gorgeous if i may say so 
 so we were standing on the bus due to the lack of empty seats and she was right behind me 
 for some reason the driver <unk> hard and we were all pushed ahead 
 the girl almost fell on me and i picked her up and asked her if she was okay 
 she smiled and replied that she was and we got talking about stuff 
 she was a student and so was i and we both talked a bit about studies and all 
 we <unk> a bit and hit it off and also exchanged numbers 
 i was happy about being so lucky ... after a great time i arrived at my stop and bid adieu to her and said i will keep in touch 
 she smiled and waved me goodbye and i got down 
 i started walking home from the stop feeling lucky about having met this absolute <unk> of a woman ... then out of habit i checked my back pocket 
 my wallet was gone 
 for those wondering i tried the number and it was a <unk> obligatory this did n't happen today '' announcement 
 this happened several years ago while i was in high school 
 my freshmen year of hs i had a science class in the very back of the school that was two connecting <unk> for <unk> and the other was a lab 
 after our first test of the year those who finished first were sent to the lab room so we would n't have to sit silently 
 the lab had a bunch of breakfast bar type of tables and each one had a gas line with a nozzle sticking out for the <unk> and stuff 
 the teacher told us not to worry about them since the gas had been cut off years ago due to low use 
 so i was done before any of my friends and started messing with the nozzle trying to see how it worked 
 and then it snapped off 
 i spent a while trying to secure it back but it was broken 
 so i set it back on so it looked right but would fall off if it were <unk> at all 
 the next year they stopped using those two classrooms because they were so far in the back and they had rooms in a better place so i never thought about it again until my senior year 
 fast forward 3.5 years i 'm a senior sitting in my first block <unk> biology class 
 the fire alarm sounds and the principal gets on the intercom telling everyone to calmly go outside 
 we all get outside take attendance and then are <unk> into the field house for a couple hours 
 right before they sent us home the principal addressed the school and told us that the gas lines had been turned back on this morning but no one knew there was a broken nozzle so the gas leaked and filled a large portion of the school before a class noticed the smell 
 **tl dr** my fuck up took three and a half years to catch up with me but when it did it leaked gas into my high school and caused a school wide panic and evacuation 
 just as a preface i am a college student and a year shy of being the glorious <unk> so naturally like every <unk> college kid i have <unk> a fake id 
 anyways so earlier this morning i went to the gas station to buy beer for the upcoming week since it it going to be a hectic week i knew the only time i could go would be this morning 
 i walk into the gas station and grab a case of beer and proceed to the counter 
 i plop the beer on the counter and am asked for my id 
 now before i continue i need to preface that i have terrible handwriting 
 like that of a second graders 
 no idea why the elementary school decided i should pass but they did me wrong 
 anyways so just remember i have terrible handwriting 
 i give the id to her without fear and just wait for it back 
 she takes a look at it and tells me to get out the store 
 confused i ask her what the big deal is and she tells me that my id is obviously fake and that i need to get out now 
 i have never ever had this problem before so i tell her that its not fake at all and she turns it around and points to my signature 
 she says there is no way someone has that bad of writing except for someone trying to forge a signature since it obviously was n't natural 
 without hesitation me and all my brilliance decide to pull out my real id to prove that hey its a really good fake id and i just have really bad handwriting 
 i point to the signature on my real and she just gives me that oh my god i ca n't believe we let people like you breed '' look and starts to just laugh 
 needless to say i am having a dry week and living a life without any fakes from here on out 
 tl dr : forrest gump and i compete for last spot in the <unk> so every year i prank my stepdad 
 it 's become a point of contention in my <unk> because he 's a very angry person and my goal is always to make him angrier 
 i 'm terrible i know 
 year to year the pranks have gotten worse and worse last year i glued the milk carton to the top shelf of the fridge and he pulled the carton and the shelf along with it ripping the carton and milk/other wet goods went flying all over the <unk> 
 i 'm glad i was n't in the house for it 
 anyways this year i decided i 'd be a good <unk> and do something nice for him but only at the cost of doing something extremely mean first 
 the setup : i backed up his laptop to an external hard drive 
 he 's not the most tech <unk> so he wo n't really notice any of the fuckery i 'm about to perform on said laptop 
 i then installed that old ass <unk> buddy virus on his laptop 
 afterwards i took a <unk> peeled it open and emptied the contents on some rolling paper and flattened it out after <unk> it with the quick fuse that holds <unk> together 
 i <unk> up his enter key and glued it to the bottom of the key 
 i let the fuse just barely stick out from under it so i could reach it 
 this was all done the night before 
 the action : i came over my parents house early in the morning saying i needed to print a report and that i 'd use his laptop because it was easier 
 i opened it up hiding the fuse with my thumb and called him over 
 what the hell is that '' 
 he said pointing at the dumbass looking purple monkey 
 i told him it was a virus that certain fake porn sites can give you and he got all super defensive saying that he does n't watch porn 
 not sure if he does do n't care enough to know 
 i told him i could fix it and that he should go make some coffee 
 so i walked with him in the kitchen and had the screen block his view of my hands 
 as i pulled my lighter out of my pocket i just said ah i think i <unk> oh shit '' and boom his keyboard literally exploded 
 keys went flying and i ducked 
 i had n't expected it to be as big of a pop as it was 
 i must 've laid out the powder wrong or something 
 or maybe the glue ignited 
 i have no clue 
 he dropped to his knees and was holding his head talking about taxes and other important documents i had just ruined 
 his shock quickly became anger as he pushed me away and saw his now dead laptop 
 i ran out of the room into the garage and honestly i was giggling like a little kid 
 i could n't help it 
 he stormed after me and found me in there at the table he usually drinks at with a brand new laptop i got him as a <unk> birthday gift 
 i 've never seen him go from being so angry to confused to extremely happy 
 it 's usually the other way around 
 anyways that was my <unk> morning 
 tldr : i 'm a jerk and prank my stepdad too much 
 did a great prank with a surprise gift at the end 
 he hates me less 
 edit : thank you so much for the gold 
 you guys rule 
 update # 2 update can be found here holy fuck reddit this might be my biggest fuck up of all time ... there 's this girl i 'm friends with that i 've known for maybe 8 months or so who i 've grown really close to 
 the thing is though that i live in sweden and she lives in america so our communication is limited to snapchat and <unk> do n't judge we 're 15 so emotions are hard to recognize through text 
 now ever since we started talking she would many times mention that she was going to the oncologist and having a session 
 now for those of you who do n't know an oncologist is basically a cancer doctor but since i 'm not a native speaker i <unk> word up with <unk> 
 this was supported by the fact that she had braces 
 there were several hints that proved that an oncologist was n't <unk> a dentist 
 she once said she had cancer but i assumed she was joking because we had joked about <unk> before this 
 she brought up the cost of her medical visits to the oncologist as extremely <unk> several hundred thousand much but i knew health care in america was expensive as shit so i just assumed that this girl went to a <unk> expensive dentist her parents are <unk> 
 ofcourse a normal person would realize she had cancer but me 
 nah i 'm retarded 
 fast forward to 3 hours ago 
 we had been talking for a bit and she sent me a picture of her smiling with braces telling me she was at the <unk> and that she 'd be back in 2,5 hours 
 i told her good luck and watched a movie until she texted me i only have 5 months left '' 
 i assumed she meant that her braces were coming off and i said congratulations finally 
 : d '' this is ofcourse bad enough but the fuck up does n't end there ... ... '' she said and me thinking it was a joke about her dying said r.i.p girl 
 i bet you will go to <unk> '' bad joke regardless she just said fuck you <unk> i thought you were my friend ... '' then she blocked me 
 me not realizing what just happened was kinda laughing to myself thinking she was pretending to be angry we often did this 
 my friend asked what was funny so i showed him the convo and he just looked at me like i had killed someone 
 dude ... you realize an oncologist is a cancer doctor right '' 
 that 's when i realized i had fucked up 
 tl dr told a <unk> ill girl that she would go to hell 
 this happened just now a long time ago i installed my cloud to butt chrome extension which replaces the word cloud with butt and i totally forgot about it 
 i 've been on the look out for a second hand iphone for the past few days and was wondering why so many people were talking about the new ibutt storage feature 
 every time i asked about it on <unk> they were rather confused and sometimes thought i was just fucking with them 
 eventually i got sick of it after finding nothing about this ibutt online and decided to contact apple 
 the help desk did n't take me seriously at all and of course every time they asked if i meant icloud all i saw was ibutt confusing me even more 
 i left the heated discussion with the poor lady when it suddenly dawned on my how much of an idiot i am 
 edit : wow this blew up over night all these inboxes are a pain in the <unk> her pictures were pretty she seemed normal 
 i had n't done the tinder thing before so i did n't know what to expect but when she invited me over to her place i figured i 'd scored pretty hard 
 i showered groomed and drove the 20-30 minutes to her address 
 i 'm not even worried about safety she 's just a small girl right 
 i 'll be fine 
 my concern at this point is whether i 'll measure up 
 i get there and i 'm wondering if i have the right place 
 it 's completely <unk> 
 the grass has n't been cut in <unk> years 
 the walls needed a fresh coat of paint a decade ago 
 are ... are the windows boarded up 
 i check the <unk> for the house number and check the message again - yep this seems to be the right place 
 i guess it 's just a crappy old house 
 i knock and after about a minute she comes to the door 
 unpleasant surprise <unk> : she looks 15 years older than in her pictures and haggard like she has n't slept in a week haggard 
 i do n't know what the fuck she 's wearing but it looks like a vague attempt at sexy 
 like i bought this <unk> print dress at walmart 15 years ago sexy 
 i 'm already thinking about how to get out of this as she invites me inside 
 it 's even worse in here 
 the paint is peeling everywhere it 's dark and <unk> 
 it smells quite unpleasant 
 she invites me into her room which is lit up like a cheap brothel 
 she sits down on her bed and asks if i mind if she smokes 
 smoking in your house 
 that 's a bit gross but it 's not really a surprise at this point 
 i say sure 
 and that 's when she pulls the meth pipe out of her bag 
 it all clicks 
 the garden the paint the boarded up windows the smell her appearance 
 this is a crack den and she is a crack whore 
 now i 'm afraid 
 what is this house 
 are we alone 
 are 4 <unk> going to jump out of the other room and <unk> me 
 so i nope 'd out of there as fast as you can say oh holy fuck nope '' making some vague excuse about getting cold feet 
 she was n't really bothered she was higher than the <unk> state by this point and rolling around on her bed 
 i drove home feeling dirty and showered again 
 and that was the story of my first ever tinder date 
 **tl dr : went for a booty call ended up in a crack den 
 ** <unk> 
 fucking jenny 
 **so this story of mine happened about a year ago and i do n't think i will ever forget what happened that day 
 i used to work at this certain coffee <unk> ya know the one that pretty much rules over the world 
 my store had this regular customer that would come in every single day and there was always something to yell at us about 
 her coffee was burnt the tables are gross it 's too loud we 're all out to get her etc 
 she was really <unk> and freaked out if you so much as got a <unk> of water on the side of her cup 
 after about two years of dealing with this woman <unk> my tongue and trying my best to give her the best experience '' she can get even harder since i was a supervisor one day i just snapped 
 i saw her in line and immediately <unk> myself for impact 
 i tried to do everything for her the way she wants it and of course it backfired 
 she usually liked to put her lids on herself so instead of <unk> it on i just set it on top and informed her of what i did 
 she asked me why i did that and i told her that i 'm just trying to be convenient to her 
 this bitch just started <unk> at me telling me i 'm trying to burn her on purpose and get her sent to the hospital and how she 's going to complain to corporate as she always does 
 i literally lost it at her ungrateful attitude 
 she said how about you just get someone else to take care of me '' 
 here 's my fuck up i responded with how about you stop being such a <unk> <unk> '' 
 instantly my store got quiet and at this point i 'm on a fucking roll so i 'm just yelling at this customer venting all of my two years of pent up <unk> 
 my other supervisor had to drag me off the floor to calm down and i just turned the keys over and left 
 several customers actually <unk> for me when i was on my way out saying they were proud of me for sticking up for myself 
 i 'm just like yay there goes my fucking job '' even though i felt amazing about it 
 i called my boss and told him what happened his only response was oh boy ... '' as this kind of thing was inevitable 
 in the end i got a <unk> and did n't lose my job even though she was doing her damn hardest to get both me and my boss fired 
 this lady has a track record in our entire district of being a cunt and this final issue was enough to get her banned from every store in our district 
 i fucked up big time but amazing things came out of it 
 moral of the story do n't take anyone 's shit 
 tl dr : cursed out a customer almost got fired ended up getting her banned from our district 
 edit : wow you guys are awesome 
 first big post and i made the front page 
 i got gilded too which is wicked sweet 
 it 's been a bit of a hectic day for me so this cheers me up a lot 
 i 'll get to responding to some of you guys later tonight when i get home 
 edit2 : for one this incident is n't fake 
 it actually happened 
 and for those of you who are saying it 's not a fuck up it is 
 fuck ups do n't always have to end in some horrible manner 
 i made a terrible decision out of anger and really should have gotten fired 
 i put myself and my boss in a tough spot and while it felt <unk> it also hit my pride that i allowed this woman to get under my skin like that 
 so no i won '' that fight but only because of the mercy of the <unk> for obvious reasons 
 today was supposed to be a nice trip to the beach with my boyfriend sister and her husband 
 for reference my sister and i are 14 months apart in age she is older and we look enough alike that more than once in our life people have thought we were twins 
 when we were younger we played it up and dressed alike and everything 
 as we have gotten older we no longer dress alike however because we both have very thick black curly hair we still style our hair almost the same way 
 today we both had it pulled back in <unk> <unk> even using the same <unk> lol totally not planned either 
 i say that to say that i honestly believe that my bil thought i was my sister 
 we had <unk> a cabana that not only had table and chairs but also had two changing rooms 
 my bil and sister had gotten there first and had all of our food set out and my bil had already changed and was in the water 
 my sister was in her bathing suit and said she was going to run up to the restroom before she hit the water 
 my b/f forgot his phone so he ran back to the car to get it 
 i went into the changing room and had put on the bottom half but did n't have my top on yet and i was bent over looking away from the door when i feel hands on my hips 
 thinking this was my b/f without looking i grabbed his hand and pulled his hands up to my breast and pressed my butt firmly into his crotch 
 i could start to feel the movement of his rapidly awakening erection when i hear my sister yell what in the fuck is going on '' 
 i quickly realize that this is not my boyfriend but my sisters husband and by this time he was no longer halfway up but had a massive erection that was going up my butt well not really but it pretty much gave me a <unk> 
 side note : i do n't know how my sister can walk he let 's go of me and he looks confused and starts apologizing profusely to both of us 
 saying he thought it was her did n't even know we were there yet etc 
 my sister starts bawling and runs back to the bathroom 
 i quickly am putting my top on and wanted to crawl in a hole and die 
 i went to the bathroom and tried to talk with my sister but she was n't having it 
 i kept trying to tell her that i thought it was my b/f and he thought it was his wife but the more i tried to explain that the <unk> it even sounded to me 
 my b/f shows back up and is confused has hell about why everyone is pissed off 
 i left my sister to go back to the cabana my bil was there and he was pretty much mortified 
 he said he was sorry he though i was her and he hoped i would not hate him for it and that he would never disrespect either my sister or me by doing that on purpose 
 i told him he did n't have anything to apologize for any more than i did for grabbing him 
 i told him i thought he was my b/f and we both talked about how we were going to help my sister understand that this honestly was a mistake 
 she finally came out but by this time she wanted to go home 
 i begged her to stay and that i did n't have some long drawn out plan to steal her husband 
 i told her i love my b/f and i love her how could she think i would ever do anything to hurt her 
 ultimately she stuck around but was <unk> the rest of the day 
 my b/f was finally told what happened and he at first thought it was funny then when we get to the car he started asking why i thought my bil was him when he had n't even changed <unk> yet 
 then the rest of drive home was in silence and once we got home he started asking about if i had feelings for my bil 
 ugh ... .. finally after several hours i got him past his <unk> and am now typing this in bed 
 so i have no idea if there is going to be any long term problems from this 
 my sister i think still does n't believe me 
 i sure as fuck hope she does n't take this out on my bil 
 i am hoping things are n't going to be awkward with my bil either and ultimately i hope my b/f can just forget about this 
 good god what a fucking mess 
 tl dr while changing into bathing suit bil comes from behind me and grabs me on hips me thinking it is b/f pull his hands from hips to breasts and firmly plant buttocks into <unk> causing erection and <unk> live in <unk> 
 here two languages kyrgyz and russian are spoken simultaneously by locals and often mixed together 
 the word for <unk> rink in russian is <unk> '' while the word in kyrgyz for <unk> is <unk> '' 
 today was my day off and i wanted to go ice skating 
 when trying to find out details about the local skating rink i forgot the kyrgyz word for ice rink and tried to use the russian one instead and i asked an old women in a store : men <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> kirip <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> '' 
 which translates to : how much will it be to go on the big penis downtown for an hour 
 i am no longer allowed in the <unk> this actually happened a few months ago when i started my new job 
 so i 'm an intern at a small <unk> company 
 i 'm here to write code but because there 's not a lot of work going i frequently leave the building to go for smoke breaks 
 the building we 're in has a couple of other companies in it 
 some of the other people are really nice but some see others as competition and treat people accordingly 
 so first week i hold open a door for a woman who works on the floor below us 
 she tells me that it 's offensive for someone to hold hold the door open because shes a woman i just leave it and tell her i 'd do it for anyone she 's pretty pissed so i took the stairs instead of taking the elevator with her 
 here the tifu really begins 
 so a few weeks later i 'm coming in from a smoke break i was on my phone trying to get my auto correct to work 
 i walk through the door and see someone coming towards the door so as i always do i hold it open 
 now this morning i was particularly annoyed tired and stressed 
 i peek up from my phone to look at who 's coming and it 's her <unk> door assault 
 so i simply let the door go and get into the elevator 
 she must n't have been looking as she got to the door because she walks straight into it this big ass fire door 
 she breaks her nose and falls backwards just as the elevator door closes 
 i saw her hit the door and fall backwards because fire doors close slowly to avoid slamming 
 according to my boss she was bleeding pretty bad 
 i feel like a total ass for the whole thing but everyone i work with thinks it 's pretty funny 
 i tried apologizing to her a few days ago in the staff room and she ignored me completely 
 still feel very bad and i no longer take my smoke breaks for fear of <unk> someone 
 tl dr : broke someones nose because they did n't like having doors opened for <unk> like to lift weights before i go to work and since i 'm an early bird i 'm usually at the gym around 4 or 4:30. it 's a smaller 24/7 gym with card access and i 'm usually the only one there that early 
 i enjoy being alone because i like to dance and enjoy my music but obviously would n't if others were around 
 i 've danced countless times in the morning in between sets but i realized yesterday sorry meant to post yesterday 
 i have been fucking up for a while 
 rather than going to the gym in the morning yesterday i went after work 
 staff was actually there normally it is to early and staff is n't around and the girl at the desk looked at me and started whispering to her coworker 
 i shrugged it off and got into my workout 
 as i was leaving both girls stopped me and said hey can we talk to you for a second '' 
 i was not sure why they needed to talk to me and i 'm pretty shy but reluctantly agreed 
 once they pulled me aside one of the girls said so do you always dance when nobody is watching '' 
 i was literally frozen 
 how 
 how could they know 
 before i could even respond she said we noticed a couple months back when checking camera footage that you come in and dance in the mornings during your workout 
 it is hilarious '' 
 i could <unk> utter a response which mostly sounded like haha yeah i did n't even think about the cameras '' 
 tl dr - i go to the gym early when nobody is around 
 i get into my music and dance because nobody is there 
 realized yesterday for the past couple months the staff has been <unk> watching my <unk> '' 
 might have to switch gyms because of embarrassment 
 edit : wow i appreciate all the comments everyone 
 a little more background might clarify why i feel this is a fuck up 
 i am not a confident guy 
 part of the reason i go to the gym early is because i do n't have a huge audience 
 i got comfortable having no audience and let loose more than i would normally 
 while i was flattered many in the comments interpreted the girls reaction as flirting it was and still is very uncomfortable to me 
 i hope i do n't sound like a bitch 
 i have laughed at the irony of the situation but i 'm very anxious about returning during the day 
 also ... this is n't fake i 'm a 21 year old male the dancing was not good and included <unk> such as the lawn mower <unk> <unk> and the running <unk> much i thought that school started the day after labor day like it normally does 
 decided to check my school email today and found that it had already posted its lab tech schedule i.e 
 one of the work study program that i 've worked for the past two years as well as a couple of other emails from my professors about class stuff 
 & gt executing <unk> did n't have the time to check the calendar though because my dad needed me to help him with some house <unk> stuff then went straight off to work 
 come home from work and check the calendar on the website : & gt fall semester begins : <unk> 1 mom 's pissed i feel the magnetic pull of my face to the nearest flat object and i 've probably got a mountain of things to catch up on before work at 4pm tomorrow 
 fml 
 <unk> situation update : just checked in 
 went fairly smooth 
 does n't make up for the fact that i missed at least two days worth of teaching but at least i did n't get dropped altogether 
 thanks for the kind words from some of you guys 
 note to self though : *never* post on a large sub again 
 inbox freaking exploded on me & lt & lt so i have back and neck problems and often will ice my neck with ice packs and such 
 well last night i could n't find our ice packs and was too lazy to make my own so i grabbed a frozen bag of peas 
 i settled into bed with it on my neck 
 i fell asleep like that and woke up hours later laying on top of the smashed bag of peas and my bed soaked in <unk> juice all the way down into the mattress 
 tl dr i <unk> my bed 
 this actually happened about two weeks ago 
 my sister recently died at the age of 32. we were very close 
 her funeral was held at the <unk> church she was married in 
 right before they started the service after the viewing i went to give my sister a kiss one last time 
 when i went to stand up i tripped over the <unk> they put out to kneel on 
 falling forward i put my hands out to <unk> myself which happen to be on the inside of the casket on the ledge next to the hinge of the lid 
 it pushed the casket backwards 
 luckily no major harm was done 
 the men put it back upright fixed her hair and placed her gifts next to her again 
 i swear if she were here she would laugh so loudly 
 my mom was so upset she was hysterical and my step dad held back a chuckle 
 this is my life 
 edit : wow 
 thank you all so much for your show of support 
 it means a lot that you shared your experiences and laughs 
 it was a funny moment for me and i still get teased that i <unk> 'em dead 
 just fyi she died of complications from vasculitis 
 in the end her heart just was n't strong enough to keep going 
 once again i appreciate all the well wishes okay it seems that i must post that this was n't today but like 18 years ago in hs 
 i was set up on a blind date by a buddy of mine 
 i was the quiet but funny and nerdy kid who was essentially the king of the band <unk> 
 she was a conservative and quiet girl about my age from the rich part of town 
 we talked on the phone for a few days as was the style at the time and i worked up the <unk> to ask her out on a <unk> 
 she said yes 
 i picked her up and after some basic pleasantries with her mother we drove off in my car 
 where are we going '' 
 she asked 
 well shit 
 i had n't actually connected the idea that i needed to plan 
 normally i just <unk> it 
 so ... i <unk> it ... where nobody can hear you scream '' i replied 
 i chuckled and kept driving thinking that she got my joke '' 
 a minute of awkward silence later and i asked where would you like to go '' 
 home '' she said with the defeat in her voice that you 'd expect from a 10 minute <unk> 
 <unk> date ever.let me start off by saying for someone who is in their early 20 's i know basically nothing about computers 
 i know how to google things download shit and watch porn but compared to my 60 year old father i am mr. robot 
 you should also know that my father loves printing shit 
 he probably loves printing shit more than he loves me 
 he probably loves printing even more than the dog i know he loves more than me 
 he is also extremely <unk> challenged 
 though i do n't blame him for not grasping <unk> technology he is of the generation that did n't have a computer in front of them their entire lives 
 so whenever he is having trouble with that plastic piece of shit '' he looks at me like i am a test tube baby formed from the dna of steve jobs and bill <unk> and i offer my technical savant abilities ... & amp nbsp it all started when i hear him <unk> away to himself about the computer being the shits at printing '' and lord fuck 
 google is fuckin slow today '' 
 i ask him what the problem is and he says that google is very slow today and he ca n't print something if he ca n't google it 
 i do n't bother to try to explain that the google search engine <unk> on the internet connection for it 's speed and that it 's just the <unk> that is slow as it never sinks in 
 he gets up and offers me the chair and asks me to try and fix the laptop before it meets it 's maker '' to which i reply who 
 <unk> <unk> 
 he tells me that 's racist and goes outside for a smoke 
 when he comes back in i 've got the internet network set to that of the previously shut off range extender that he always manages to turn off when vacuuming and it has significantly improved the speed 
 i also have the window 10 upgrade in process ... & amp nbsp so everything is fine the upgrade is doing something but you can still use your computer while it is getting ready and he gets back to printing the <unk> or whatever it is that he does 
 after a while he goes to his bedroom and starts yelling at the news and i take this opportunity to finish installing windows 10. it begins and it looks like it is going to take a while so i head over to my buddy 's house 
 i come back later to find the laptop on the floor the printer in the sink and a brand new laptop on the desk in place of the old one 
 wtf 
 & amp nbsp apparently while i was gone windows 10 started and my dad attempted to get on the computer 
 it clearly did n't work out too well based on what i discovered 
 when i asked him about it he just said that was a piece of junk when i went to log on it had a virus it was hacked i could n't print anything '' 
 he also <unk> explained how a hacker named cortana was taunting him so he threw the laptop on the floor and went and bought a new one ... he asks me if i could set up the printer to the new laptop which i am pretty sure came with windows 10 ... instead i picked the old laptop miraculously still working up off the floor put it on the desk connected the printer and restored it to windows 7. i brought the new computer he had bought back to the store and gave him the money back 
 we have n't really discussed the days events yet but i ca n't wait until it 's not too soon to tease him about cortana the hacker and to ask him why the printer was in the sink 
 we did manage to <unk> something today though google is a little bit faster now because of our range extender 
 you 're welcome for the speed bump google 
 & amp nbsp tl dr otherwise reasonable 60 year old man gets angry at computer for taunting him throws it on the <unk> : 4 year old birthday party 
 all girls except one boy 
 the boy found a black witch cape in the closet and proceeded to cover his head and chase the girls around the house and yard 
 he quickly got named the black man 
 the girls started screaming things like run from the black man '' 
 and get away from the black man '' 
 received two phone calls from concerned parents after the party 
 edit : not in <unk> waiting for my coffee and got shat on by a minor bird 
 two girls walking past saw and started laughing 
 one said getting shit on means good luck '' 
 she did n't look too bad so quick thinking me goes okay what 's your number '' 
 turns out she thought that was even funnier and just laughed in my face ... so now i have bird shit in my hair and feel like <unk> because my boyfriend is a redditor 
 the other night my boyfriend told me he wanted to try anal 
 i 'm all for trying things for my man but my butt has pretty much been a <unk> <unk> 
 it got me thinking about my butthole and what it looks like i know that 's weird 
 freshly out of the shower i laid down on my bed spread my legs and started looking around down there to see what it looks like for him 
 while i was doing this i had to fart 
 my curiosity already <unk> i decided to watch myself fart 
 this would n't have been a problem except last night i took a laxative to help persuade out 4 days of poop 
 i thought i 'd gotten it all out of my system but the <unk> of <unk> shit that sprayed out of me <unk> i was mistaken 
 for a stunned moment i sat there with diarrhea all over my hand my hand mirror and my bed 
 the worst part is that my bed is completely bare right now because it is laundry day 
 cheers 
 **tl dr : ** i pooped my bed while i was awake.this literally happened a few minutes ago and i may be in need of searching for a new job pls <unk> 
 i created a project at my work that allowed all of our products to be linked up to android apps that our customers can use to control them 
 today was the day i was presenting this to upper management 
 before starting my presentation the ceo of my company stopped in and decided he was interested in my project 
 the presentation goes well and is very well received 
 everyone thinks its a great idea to link our products up to apps instead of <unk> them via switches and push buttons 
 the final slide of my project was titled why android initially '' this is where things went very very bad 
 i presented data showing that android based devices currently hold & gt 50 % market share and apple is only around <unk> % 
 i then proceeded to tell everyone 82 % of new phones being <unk> right now are android based 
 i also explained that development for android was much easier than ios 
 after i finish making these points my ceo just responds with well 82 % of people are stupid '' 
 obviously thinking it was a joke and he just liked apple more i responded back with looks like we have a fanboy in the room '' 
 the room went dead silent for the remainder of my presentation 
 i finish up the presentation thinking it went quite well and the ceo storms out 
 one of the <unk> in the meeting pulls me aside and politely <unk> me in on the fact that our ceo is one of the largest <unk> of apple 
 i kinda just left work after that one ... & amp nbsp tl dr : shit on apple in front of my ceo who 's one of the biggest <unk> in the company and called him a fucking fanboy edit : rip inbox edit2 : in the presentation i talked about expanding to ios when the time presented itself 
 for now having the fully designed android app fits everyone 's needs 
 that 's why the slide was titled why android initially '' edit3 : yes i own an android 
 would i call myself a fan boy 
 maybe 
 i just prefer superior hardware for lower costs and open source 
 whatever platform offers me that is the one i 'll choose 
 i stated the android facts not to <unk> apple but to show the <unk> of having the android app 
 an ios app could not be created in near the time i made the android app because i would have had to learn other languages etc 
 it was also just flat out not needed initially 
 this happened yesterday 
 so i was lying on my bed in my room at home reading when i heard the front door open and my flatmate come in with a girl 
 he clearly did n't think i was home because they immediately went to his room which shares a wall with mine 
 i was mildly amused by this so i decided not to go out and ruin their fun 
 before long they start getting down to it and since they did n't think i was home they were n't shy about being vocal 
 he was grunting away and she was moaning pretty loudly shouting his name etc 
 all this noise started to turn me on so i started masturbating figuring that this was better than porn because it was real-life 
 eventually the girl started moaning even louder which i took to indicate that she was cumming and there was some definite <unk> as well so it did n't take me long to finish either 
 satisfied i went back to my book 
 after about half an hour or so i was bored of being confined to my room so i went out into the lounge not really caring if i 'd embarrass them we 're all adults we can just laugh it off 
 i walked into the lounge to find my flatmate sitting on the couch watching tv with his arm around my little sister 
 christ 
 what have i done 
 edit : wow this really took off 
 thanks to all who have commented 
 i tried to reply to a decent number but there are way way too many for me to get through 
 if you desperately want to grill me for details as some seem to want to or you want an update feel free to pm me 
 no insults though hopefully : 
 so as the story goes my girlfriend and i have been dating for almost 5 years but just moved in together about 6 months ago 
 she is very smart clean fun and generally just an <unk> good person to live with 
 until about 5 months ago.. she typically wakes up earlier than me and hops in the shower right away so by the time i get up she is finished in the bathroom 
 one morning as i was getting in the shower i noticed some brown ... stuff near the drain of the tub 
 i thought nothing of it really and made a note to clean the bathroom later that day as it had been a couple weeks 
 the next day i hopped into a freshly <unk> bathtub and to my dismay there again were <unk> of some brown material in different areas of the tub floor 
 concerned and a little disgusted by this mysterious matter i rinsed it away the best i could 
 it could n't be what i thought it was right 
 maybe we had mice 
 yes mice 
 i should tell my girlfriend to pick up some traps on her way home 
 fast forward a few weeks completely empty mouse traps zero evidence of <unk> activities yet still almost every morning i was met with a greasy brown substance hastily mashed around the shower drain 
 i planned my words carefully it was not my intention to embarrass her as i would expect this type of behavior would indicate some type of <unk> mental disorder or strange fetish that i was somehow unaware of 
 whatever her reason we would work it out together and move on with our lives 
 the moment finally came after dinner tonight 
 i took a deep breath put my hand on her knee looked her in the eye and asked <unk> have you been pooping in the shower '' 
 a mix of confusion and mild amusement crossed her face and she responded with um excuse me 
 is that a serious question '' 
 i guess my uncomfortable body language made her realize that i indeed was serious and she immediately became alarmed 
 i explained the strange matter that i would find in the tub every morning and it did n't look like residue from any of the products that she used so i could n't imagine what else it could be 
 there was a pause before she began giggling hysterically 
 i use my morning coffee grounds as a face scrub '' 
 the amount of relief that washed over me was intense but i was only able to enjoy it for a few seconds before she stood up and said <unk> how long have you been suspicious exactly '' 
 a couple weeks after moving in was the first time i noticed why '' 
 ** '' ... ... ... you thought i was shitting in the shower and you waited 5 months to confront me about it 
 ** edit : to those of you saying i 'm stupid for not being able to tell the difference between coffee and feces you are n't understanding the <unk> that was in question 
 it was never a massive clump of grounds but more like a half of a teaspoon of an oily residue 
 maybe i am <unk> <unk> but some of you are way too angry about it too : buck up kiddos 
 edit 2 : <unk> 
 some of these comments and angry pms make me feel like i posted to youtube accidentally 
 <unk> 
 my dog was inside 
 she stepped on the lock button 
 i am now in the parking lot waiting for my brother in law to arrive with my spare <unk> was in the kitchen reading the paper at the table and my one year old was sitting in her high chair at the head of the table 
 everything was fine until she started to try and rock back and forth in her chair when she tipped back a little too far and started to fall backwards 
 like a cat i <unk> out of my chair towards her to save her from falling 
 except ... that 's not what actually happened 
 it did happen in my head ... as i was dreaming it 
 what actually happened was my wife was happily sleeping next to me while i was dreaming this and was rudely awoken by the force of both my hands slamming into her skull 
 i found out this morning that when she asked 'wtf was that for i muttered something <unk> and rolled over and went back to sleep 
 tldr : dreamt i was saving kid 's life 
 punched my wife in the head 
 so over the past few weeks my girl has been <unk> so being the considerate individual i like to pretend to be i 've been offering to drive her to and from work 
 it 's about 7 p.m. and i 'm on my way back from work 
 i give her a call to double check what time she would be done for the night and we <unk> that i 'll pick her up at 9 oclock 
 my exact words were absolutely i 'll be there at 9 '' 
 rookie mistake not leaving room for error 
 exactly 50 minutes later my phone <unk> for a reminder notification 
 tip off for the wizards / <unk> game is in 10 minutes '' 
 fuck 
 my mind is racing 
 did i buy tickets 
 oh my god 
 is it february 
 how could i have forgotten mr. curry was coming to the district tonight 
 i call my buddy tim immediately 
 tim 
 where are you right now '' 
 to which he replies i 'm on my way to class what 's up '' 
 tim is in law school at <unk> so thankfully he 's already in the city 
 i remind him about the game and the tickets we purchased way back in december and we both panic for a split second 
 tim asks so what do we do 
 are you coming '' 
 i tell him about my prior arrangements with olivia to get her at 9. i say i ca n't go right 
 i ca n't just leave her stranded at work right 
 ... here 's my thought process : well sure i can 
 olivia is understanding 
 she knew about the game and would want me to go 
 i 'll just call her a cab to make sure she gets home safely 
 there 's no way she would be that mad at me '' 
 brilliant 
 time to execute said plan : i send a flurry of texts to liv the first being this : fuck olivia the basketball game is tonight '' 
 the second : i literally just left my house i 'm already 10 minutes late but tim and i decided that we are going to go anyway 
 we both forgot we have no idea how and i 'm sorry that i ca n't come pick you up '' 
 now you may be thinking why are you speaking in run on sentences man 
 ever heard of punctuation '' 
 yes i have 
 however at this particular moment in time i was using my <unk> function because i 'm flying down the <unk> and i have no hands to text 
 i make it to the city scoop my buddy from his apartment then make it to our seats in time for the second quarter 
 at this point it 's about 9 oclock and i have n't heard from olivia yet 
 tim 's asking me how angry she 's going to be and i assure him it 's a <unk> 
 it was odd that i had n't heard from her yet so i step out to try to call her again 
 she answers : - '' hello '' 
 - '' hey 
 liv i 'm so sorry 
 did you get my messages '' 
 - '' yeah i got your message 
 fuck you too 
 have fun at the <unk> 
 <unk> 
 bewildered i call her back 
 i assume she 's upset because i did n't come to pick her up so i tell her i 'd call a cab for her to get back 
 i quickly realize that was n't the problem it was the first text i sent her 
 she thought i meant to send that to my buddy tim essentially saying exactly what the text said : fuck olivia 
 the basketball game is tonight '' 
 when what i meant to say was fuck olivia the basketball game is tonight '' 
 we laughed about it this morning 
 i apologized profusely for the mess but i 'd probably do it again to see <unk> drop another <unk> points 
 tldr : i accidentally told my girlfriend to fuck off abandoned her at work and went to the washington wizards game 
 music for your time : well then i hope you guys are ready for a sob story 
 as is custom with these things it should be noted that this did not in fact happen today it happened on new year 's eve <unk> so to get the formalities out of the way : yes i do mean blown it off as in i now only have 1 hand 
 yes i was stupid and i believe i got punished enough for that 
 and yes i am typing this with one hand 
 anyway me and my friends have always been fans of fireworks 
 it started young with my dad having connections left and right and getting all the illegal fireworks that 10 year old kids could ever want 
 i still think it is beautiful stuff even after what 's happened 
 but i digress 
 this particular <unk> we were messing about with something called cobra 8. they 're basically big <unk> sticks that blow like fucking grenades so you can see why they 're illegal 
 these things are made in a factory in <unk> or something where i heard they are actually legal 
 the thing is that when you light the fuse you have about 10 seconds before the fuse runs out 
 once that happens a warning flame burns for another 10 seconds and then it goes off 
 that 's if you get the original product however 
 sometimes you 'll get <unk> which do n't have the warning flame and shorter <unk> 
 this was unbeknownst to me the case 
 as i placed one of these things on the driveway my friends were talking to eachother about the immense blow they were about to experience 
 i got my lighter and tried to get the fuse going 
 next thing i know i 'm sitting on the floor ears ringing and a weird tingling sensation in my right hand 
 the thing had gone off with my hand and face right over it 
 eardrums ruptured and hand ripped clean off 
 this however i did not realise yet 
 funny thing is when your hand get 's ripped off you expect excruciating pain but i did n't realise what had happened for a few seconds 
 i was sitting on the ground thinking <unk> happened '' 
 as my friends started pulling on my shoulders 
 their mouths were moving and they looked visually shaken 
 i could n't hear them all i felt was a ringing noise and a tingling hand which started tingling more and more 
 one of my friends pointed at my right arm and i decided to look at it 
 that was the most shocking moment i 've ever experienced 
 it was gone 
 ripped off 
 a bit of bone and some flesh was all that was left of my hand 
 i tried moving my hand but of course it did n't move 
 it was gone 
 now that i was looking at it suddenly i could feel it 
 my wrist right where the hand was blown off started hurting more than anything i 'd ever felt before 
 i started screaming and desperately <unk> at the missing hand with the other hand 
 the next thing i remember is when i was in the hospital after my friends had taken me there 
 as it turns out i had actually gotten lucky 
 remember how i said i was hovering over with my hand and head 
 if my hand had n't been in the way my head would 've suffered considerably more damage than just burst eardrums 
 fast forward a year and i still have n't quite gotten over the loss of my hand 
 my passion was playing the piano and i was just starting to learn guitar 
 neither of those <unk> is now possible and i spend many a night crying while listening to old piano <unk> i made 
 to <unk> things it 's the dominant hand i lost so a lot of basic things like writing took months before i could do again 
 i fucked up 
 and now i 'm suffering the consequences 
 please be careful with illegal fireworks 
 especially with the fake stuff 
 tl dr : got an <unk> of heavy illegal fireworks blew my hand off 
 ca n't play piano anymore 
 edit : this account is a throwaway obviously 
 the reason is i have an account i use frequently but i do n't want to infect it with the stigma of this story 
 edit 2 : thanks for all the support guys : d you all are <unk> actually happened today yay 
 so my aunt and uncle just had a baby boy a week ago 
 they also have two daughters a 4 year old and a 2 year old i 'm a 26 year old guy so my cousins are a lot younger than i am 
 because they had their hands full with the newborn and two young daughters i volunteered to take my 4 year old cousin to the park for the day 
 she 's very attached to me and love spending time with her 
 when i got to their house she was eating so i just hung out at the house for a while 
 as she ate my cousin told me about her new friend mimi '' and my aunt filled me in that mimi was my cousin 's new imaginary friend 
 i thought nothing of it as many young children have imaginary friends 
 enter the fu 
 so i start to ask my cousin questions about mimi 
 my cousin answers them with an adorable <unk> as if mimi is a real person 
 she tells me all about her curly hair and how she wants to go visit mimi at her house 
 i asked her where mimi lives and she said that she 'll show me on the way to the park 
 this is strange because as a 4 year old i did n't think she would actually be able to point out a location of where mimi lives let alone tell me it 's on the way to the park '' 
 anyway so we head out a little while later and as we 're driving my cousin starts telling me from her car seat <unk> superman this is where mimi lives '' 
 i look to the right but there 's nothing there 
 no the other side '' 
 i look to my left and nearly crash as i realize she 's pointing into a cemetery 
 cousin you 've made a mistake mimi does n't live here '' i say trying to laugh it off 
 yes she does 
 she told me this is where she lives and sleeps '' 
 tl dr cousin may be interacting with a spirit 
 i will be crying myself to sleep tonight 
 *edit : well i have had quite a few people ask me to go to the cemetery to investigate 
 my initial reaction was : ya 'll stupid 
 but the next day i 'm off from work is friday so we 'll see 
 maybe then 
 * edit 2 : i 've provided the name of the cemetery to a fellow redditor who said <unk> will look up the <unk> and see if there is a mimi 
 let 's be patient 
 edit 3 : a very caring redditor has looked up some info about the cemetery and came back with this : there is a single mimi buried in that cemetery 
 she was 37 at the time of her death in <unk> that said there are <unk> <unk> there so it 's likely we could have a match on any name your niece gave you 
 still i 'd also think there would be more than one mimi 
 i 'm happy to do more research on her if you like '' 
 so there is a mimi 
 we will see 
 i will go back and talk to my cousin again 
 edit 4 : just wanted to add that i 've never had a post blow up and get this much attention before 
 this is so cool 
 thanks reddit : d edit 5 : ok so i 'm going to see my cousin friday and ask her a few more questions and maybe visit the cemetery 
 i just want you all to know that in reading all of your comments and they mean so much to me 
 thank you for all of this attention i had no idea this post would blow up like this 
 i wish i could respond to and thank you all individually but know that i 'm trying my best to respond to as many people as i can 
 if i miss you i really am sorry 
 thanks again reddit you 've made my week : edit 6 : i think i need to clarify 
 i will be visiting the cemetery alone 
 i am not taking my 4 year old baby cousin to a cemetery 
 friday edit 1 : ok everyone i want to thank you all for being so patient with me and getting so invested in my post 
 this has literally made like my month lol i want you to know i will be posting an update today sometime which will include details about my visit to the cemetery info found by the wonderful u/gutterpeach about the mimi buried in the cemetery as well as any conversation i may have with my cousin 
 i am going to try my best to visit her and speak to her one on one and get some more <unk> however i do ask of you to be a little more patient because today is in fact the most important holiday in my religion so i also have to visit other family members and i 'm not sure what my aunt and uncle 's plans are 
 but i will do my best to find some time to go visit them when i go to the cemetery 
 again thank you all so much for this opportunity 
 lastly just wanted to thank the splendid u/gutterpeach again for all her hard work in <unk> the <unk> that is mimi 
 for more of her amazing amazing work i would definitely check out her sub <unk> 
 talk to you soon 
 friday edit 2 : this massive fuck up actually happened yesterday but it didn’t <unk> on me until now that it would be horribly right for this sub 
 so last night my wife decided to make turkey a la king for dinner since we had some frozen leftovers from thanksgiving 
 it’s important that i note we also had a full size ham also in the freezer that my wife was planning on baking for christmas eve dinner 
 so my wife was in the kitchen listening to music and dancing around like the causal <unk> she is and i was in my office playing some fallout 
 after listening to all the commotion my wife was making i decided that it would be a great time to sneak up and scare her a thing i do regularly because my sense of humor is perpetually that of a middle schooler 
 i creep my way down the hall and around the corner to the kitchen moving silently like a ninja in the night 
 she suspected nothing 
 i get to the kitchen and see that my wife is <unk> around in the fridge with both the its doors wide open 
 our fridge is rather old and the freezer is on top so with both the fridge and freezer doors open it was impossible for my wife to see me <unk> up on her 
 the scare was going perfectly 
 i moved up and crouched right behind the freezer door and stayed perfectly still keeping a manic look on my face that resembled the one jack <unk> makes in the shining 
 after about four seconds my wife swings the door shut and immediately throws her hands up and screams seeing her <unk> of a husband with a <unk> grin on his face 
 i then hear a loud thud and an audible <unk> 
 it sounded like someone threw a bowling ball on a bag of <unk> 
 my wife immediately lets out an agonizing scream which quickly transitioned into a tidal wave of <unk> profanity 
 i apologize like quicker than charlie sheen in confession and move around the fridge to see what she dropped 
 that’s when i saw the blood 
 she was wearing these pink fuzzy socks and the one on her right foot was immediately soaked in blood with some amount of skin and bones protruding out 
 she was moving the frozen ham out of the way to get the leftover turkey when i scared her and the ham fell on her foot 
 i lost my shit 
 my wife was crying and screaming and i ran around the kitchen like a turkey with its head cut off looking for my phone 
 after a few seconds obligatory <unk> felt like <unk> i grabbed my wife’s iphone and called for an ambulance 
 the ambulance came and took her to the hospital all the while her cussing me out like a sailor in heat and me frantically apologizing and trying to explain to the ambulance drivers that i did not take a sledgehammer to my wife’s foot and was actually just a complete fucking moron 
 now she’s scheduled to have surgery tomorrow and our plans for taking a new <unk> cruise are cancelled 
 also her father is going to come by and have a chat with me tomorrow morning 
 tldr it wasn’t the <unk> who ruined christmas this year 
 edit : <unk> 
 so this happened yesterday at lunch 
 i am an intern at a big engineering company in another country this summer 
 i am an incredibly difficult person to embarrass but 24 hours later and i am still blushing at this situation 
 i female emailed the director of engineering male and i asked if he wanted to grab lunch one day before i leave this summer 
 we proceed to exchange some brief emails about when it happened yesterday same day as the emailing started - all very quickly 
 the emails were in spanish 
 i am not <unk> but i am learning 
 this is a critical detail 
 so we finish emailing and we meet at 11:30 to go out to a restaurant and we have a nice lunch we talk the entire time in spanish slowly and it was very fun and interesting 
 then as we are right about to reenter the work building on our way back from lunch he stops me and speaks in english weird considering the past 1.5 hours were in spanish so i felt immediately like he wanted to make sure i understood his next words clearly 
 he says you know you said something really funny in our emails ... and he flips through his phone and shows me my last email to him 
 i know it 's not what you meant to say and i appreciate you are trying to learn the language but this does not mean what you think it does ... '' and he points to the last line of my last email to him which reads : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 i meant to say i am excited for us to eat lunch together '' 
 apparently as he described to me that actually means : <unk> am excited for us to eat each other out sexually for <unk> 
 i told the director of engineering at a global engineering company this 
 wow 
 well we clarified things and had a chuckle and i think we <unk> the situation pretty well ... <unk> needless to say i am still <unk> embarrassed 
 **tl dr translated spanish incorrectly and offered to have oral sex for lunch with the director of engineering of the company where i intern 
 **last night my husband dan '' and i celebrated new year 's eve with his family 
 we were both drinking and just having a good time 
 after counting down the new year we went inside and his mom told us just to sleep in his sister 's room 
 the alcohol intensified both of our <unk> so we started making out 
 things began to escalate and dan said hey let 's do butt stuff '' 
 so in my drunken state i replied why the fuck not '' 
 he started trying to put it in but between being intoxicated and it being too dry it just was n't going to happen 
 dan started looking around his sister 's room for some lotion and found two bottles 
 there was a tube of lotion and a squirt bottle so he went with the squirt bottle out of convenience 
 he put the lotion on his dick and slowly started to put it in 
 i was drunk to the point that it did n't hurt too badly and it was going in fairly easily 
 around a minute later the lotion started getting really cold to the point it burned 
 i yelled at him to stop and he pulled out 
 we both started writhing in pain 
 turns out he used fucking <unk> lotion 
 my vagina and ass burned like a bitch and he ended up burning his penis and penis hole 
 on the bright side the next morning i was putting the tubes of lotion back in place and low and behold the tube of lotion '' was actually <unk> paint 
 so i guess it could 've been worse 
 tl dr : got drunk got fucked in the ass and now my shit is minty fresh 
 <unk> : to the ones who found this fuck up as hilarious as i now do thank you 
 to the ones calling me a <unk> for trying something with my husband i hope you spend your year being fucked in the ass by a <unk> based paint 
 it 's <unk> on black friday and a few buddies of mine were getting breakfast at a restaurant before heading out climbing for the day 
 the restaurant is busy and full of middle aged people we assume are out for the day to enjoy a nice morning meal before enjoying the cold but sunny day 
 it 's a small town so anyone who wanted to do some crazy black friday shopping probably drove out of town 
 i was wrong 
 as we 're eating i looked across the street at a local shoe store that a woman just unlocked and walked into 
 she was getting the store and cash register ready and i realize it 's an old ex girlfriend from early high school who got surprisingly attractive 
 i decided to step out of the restaurant for a second and walk over for a quick chat and see how she 's been doing 
 i 'm dressed in dirt bag climber style cut off jeans with long <unk> on underneath <unk> ripped shirt etc and look a little ridiculous as i approach the store entrance 
 i knocked on the glass and she looked over and took a second to realize who i was 
 she smiled came over and unlocked the door to let me in and give me an awkward hug 
 at that moment i 'm giving her a hug her eyes lit up 
 i turned to see every fucking person in the restaurant comes running over and through the doors of the shoe store 
 she obviously still did n't have the register ready an open sign on anything ready for the epic retail workers nightmare of black friday 
 they came pouring in her face is going oh god no no no no no no no '' 
 and all i say is shit i 'm sorry 
 i 'm headed climbing now good luck '' 
 and walked out 
 i returned across to the now nearly empty restaurant to visit my friends 
 dude we just saw that all go down 
 you just ruined that girls day '' 
 moral of the story black friday is a terrible day to get a retail workers number 
 this technically did n't happen today but i still felt like sharing it 
 i recently accepted a job to act as a substitute teacher at my local high school 
 i was relatively new to teaching so it was a pretty <unk> experience for me 
 i entered the classroom and immediately introduced myself 
 i realized that i was stuttering so i just began lecturing math 
 at this point i have n't spent anytime time trying to get to learn the faces and names of the kids 
 <unk> minutes into the lecture i was getting a little bit more comfortable and started <unk> the class 
 i noticed a kid sleeping at the back of the classroom and said hey can you please stop sleeping in class '' 
 the kid did n't respond at all 
 so i walked over to the kid and as i was walking i realized that the kid was n't really sleeping 
 he was asian and had really really small eyes 
 he then realized that i was talking about him and said who me '' 
 the whole class <unk> out laughing 
 he 'll probably be made fun of the rest of the school year 
 tl dr : called out an asian student for sleeping in class turns out he just had really small eyes 
 he 'll probably be made fun of the rest of the school year 
 edit : wow did n't think this would explode 
 i felt really bad about what happened 
 regrettably i never really had the chance to correct it 
 i learned my lesson ... i guess i 'll donate to charity 
 happened recently 
 the wife has <unk> off a couple of kids so her stomach is ... not <unk> 
 anyway we were getting a bit froggy and instead of thinking with my smaller brain my actual brain decided it would be funny to knead her stomach like a big lump of dough 
 what are you doing '' 
 kneading the dough '' 
 if looks could kill i 'd be dead twice 
 **tl dr** : <unk> her dough **edit** for the record i love my wife 's body 
 i also love the pun thread and all the great comments 
 if i could change one thing about this whole <unk> it would be this : the tl dr would 've simply said <unk> 
 so this actually happened today 
 i work at a <unk> owned by a fairly large player in the game 
 to give some back story we are employed as <unk> <unk> '' for about 4 months of the year to help out with the <unk> part of their season 
 its good money i take about $ 1800 aud clear a week for a <unk> hour week but overall its pretty mundane work 
 the permanent staff call us insurance <unk> '' - basically making sure the wine does n't go off heat up to much and add bits and pieces to stop it from doing the <unk> mentioned 
 at one point in the wine making process the grapes that have been sitting in their <unk> for days are pumped to a machine that gets rid of all the skins and seeds and crap a press leaving only the juice 
 the juice is then <unk> back into its original tank like a massive super soaker to push the seeds and skins to the first machine until its only just the juice going around and around 
 to start this process off a little bit of finished wine is used for the super soaker but this also means that the crappy grapes and stuff is connected to the finished wine 's tank 
 onto the fuck up - so one of the <unk> had just started this whole process using the finished wine to begin 
 he then called me on the radio to shut of the valve to the finished wine and swing it '' so that just the juice from the unfinished wine is being used 
 now i 've done this a hundred times but as i walked up to the tank i only saw one tank tap and thinking that 's odd '' i turned the tap on and as always just walked away to continue my other jobs 
 a couple of hours later my supervisor calls me into his office and asked : supervisor : did you swing the tap on tank <unk> 
 me : yeah 
 supervisor : did you close the finished <unk> tank 
 it was then to my horror that i realised what i had done ... at the end of the day i pushed through 20,000l of unfinished wine that was eventually destined to be about $ 5 a bottle cost making that a $ <unk> loss ... bad ... but in the big scheme of things ... not the worse 
 however i pumped that 20,000l of unfinished cheap crappy wine ... into <unk> of $ 15 cost a bottle wine ... making a total loss of $ <unk> 
 i find out if i keep my job tomorrow night ... my only saving grace all depends on if i 've totally ruined the wine or if it can be re sold as some thing cheaper ... tl : dr pumped <unk> of crappy unfinished wine into <unk> of finished wine costing about <unk> <unk> if it cant be resold ... edit : words ... <unk> to l ... update : well ... i 've kept my job 
 my saving grace was one of two things : one : i 've never screwed up before this year or the previous year i had worked here 
 two : as <unk> pointed out the <unk> of wine i put into the tank did n't change it enough to have to create a new label for it but it will more than likely change the price point it is sold at and that wo n't be known until <unk> down the process when they get a couple of wine peeps to taste it and say if it 's any <unk> other <unk> <unk> than last years label 
 so at the end of the day i could make the company money or i could loose it but luckily the wine is not a total wrote off 
 sadly this means no chateau tifu though credit to <unk> for the name 
 my supervisor especially at the meeting i had earlier where i recieved a first and final warning is still a bit pissed but had a great laugh at some of the wine puns here so thank you guys for <unk> the mood for me 
 a couple of the wine <unk> came out and had a chat to me and have told me there have been much bigger <unk> in the past which made me feel slightly better 
 oh and thank you for the gold <unk> so this actually happened 3 years ago when my daughter was 4 years old 
 it was a situation that started out terribly but actually ended up being a funny story my wife and i can now laugh about ... until today 
 we adopted our cat from a local shelter before my daughter was born 
 he was an orange kitten named six 
 the shelter had named him six because he had six claws on one of his paws 
 we adopted him and changed his name to chase because that 's all this cat did 
 he chased his own tail dogs birds other cats etc 
 i work from home and every day i would drop my daughter off at preschool where she 'd stay for 4 hours 
 when i returned to the house after dropping her off on this day i opened the door to the house and chase raced outside 
 i did n't think much of it because he 'd frequently go outside in the <unk> and come back home around <unk> time 
 a few hours after sitting at my computer working i got up to get a drink out of the kitchen 
 i glanced out our front window and noticed a dead orange cat in the middle of our busy street 
 my heart sank and i ran out to it 
 it was definitely dead and i was so freaked out i panicked and ran into the house and grabbed a shoe box and put him in it 
 i called my wife at work and she was devastated 
 chase was really more her cat than mine as he always preferred her lap and never really paid much attention to me unless he needed something 
 she told me she was leaving work early and would pick up some <unk> and we could have a funeral for him after we picked up our daughter 
 i did n't really know how we were going to tell our daughter 
 she was an animal lover and chase slept with her every night 
 my stomach hurt just thinking about how this was going to hurt her 
 so my wife comes home and she is crying and i ask her if she wants to see him 
 she tells me she ca n't bear the thought of seeing chase dead and just wants to go pick up our daughter so we can honor our precious cat and put him to rest 
 when we pick up our daughter she can see her mommy has been crying and immediately asks what 's wrong 
 my wife can barely get out to her what has happened before breaking down again so i end up having to tell her and my daughter starts crying in hysterics before i can even get all the words out 
 now call me a puss if you must but seeing my daughter cry like that made me cry 
 we get home and while my wife continues to console my daughter by looking through old pictures of chase i go out to our backyard and choose a spot to bury our beloved kitty 
 i dig the hole and go inside to let them know i was ready for our <unk> of life for chase 
 i bring the box out and my wife and daughter are following close behind and my daughter is clenching a photo of him to her chest while sobbing 
 i feel horrible 
 i hug our daughter as she <unk> on my chest and i start to tell the story of when we first adopted chase 
 my wife and i are huddled with our daughter staring down at the box in the ground when all of the sudden an orange cat walks up and rubs his side along my wife 's leg 
 i stop talking and my wife grabs the cat and yells oh my god 
 it 's chase 
 what the hell '' 
 and looks at me like i am the <unk> of the earth 
 did n't you check the dead cat for the six claws '' 
 i did n't 
 honestly as weird as it may seem it did n't even occur to me in the slightest that this might not be our cat 
 it was the same color and size and i was so freaked out i did n't even consider for a minute that it was n't him 
 my daughter was beyond thrilled chase was still alive but sad that someone had lost a kitty 
 so we ended up having a funeral for a cat that somebody had lost even though we never ended up finding out who 's cat it was 
 we had put up <unk> throughout the neighborhood with information 
 a few days after this happened i got a collar with tags for chase so i never have to worry about this reoccurring with us or some other idiot for that matter 
 now my daughter is in 1st grade and today she brought home a <unk> where on one page they had drawn a picture of a day that they felt very sad 
 my daughter drew a picture of me my wife her chase a box and above it her teacher narrated the drawing with the day my dad lied and told me my cat died even though he did n't '' 
 tl dr i thought our cat had died although he had n't and my daughter still hates me for it 
 there was a field trip today and i was in the lab browsing reddit 
 long story short they left without me 
 thanks reddit 
 edit : the teacher didnt attempt to make any contact with meso i 'm new to this accounting job and fresh out of college 
 i 'm not used to waking up earlier than <unk> and now i have to wake up at 6. unfortunately i 'm in the habit of sleeping after midnight so i 've been getting less than 5 or 6 hours of sleep most days 
 it 's not too bad but every day i get very tired at around 11am and 4pm 
 well thankfully my company is very chill 
 they encourage you to get up and walk around take a 10 or even 30 rarely minute break no problem 
 obviously do n't abuse it be reasonable but a 15 minute break every 2 hours is very reasonable 
 so i started using 2 of my breaks every day to take a nap 
 except there are n't any safe places to nap in this office 
 there are conference rooms but i ca n't just take those because if someone needs them then it 's a hassle 
 and i ca n't just sleep at my desk because that 's not the best idea obviously 
 so there 's 2 bathrooms on this floor 
 one is a normal bathroom with stalls and everything 
 the other is a private room 
 great bathroom cleaned <unk> daily 
 there 's also a very nice chair in it 
 not sure why but it 's a very comfortable leather chair 
 if the door is closed at all then it 's being used 
 so i go in there if i feel too tired and take a 15 minute nap 
 now this bathroom inside a customer support center 
 the other bathroom is very close by 15 second walk so i 'm not preventing anyone from going to the bathroom 
 so i go in set an alarm and sleep 
 i 've done that at least 10 times now 
 i always woke up on time everything seemed fine 
 today i woke myself up 2 minutes before the alarm rang 
 i was snoring pretty loud 
 i do n't normally snore but i guess when sitting up on a chair snoring is easier 
 the fan in the bathroom is pretty loud and people in the customer service center are all talking anyways so i thought nothing of it 
 well when i came out of the bathroom today one of them joked at me and asked had a nice nap '' 
 to which i replied haha <unk> 'd you know '' 
 she told me that i 'm actually snoring in there every single day 
 so every day i slept in there my loud snoring was heard by the entire customer service team above all their talking above the bathroom fan 
 and then they would hear a quiet alarm ring a fake bathroom flush and then me walking out 
 i think i 'll start sleeping a bit more at home now ... **tl dr slept in the bathroom at work during allowed breaks 
 everyone heard me snore every time 
 **on the train on my daily morning commute i met my former teacher who was currently chatting with another middle aged woman i 'd never seen before but i just sat down with them and casually joined the conversation 
 at some point stranger asks my former teacher : btw did you know that x and y are getting married '' 
 – both x and y being former classmates of mine 
 and without further reflection i <unk> what 's been word on the street for a while : ah yeah that 's because x is pregnant <unk> '' 
 silence 
 dumbfounded and sort of sore stranger turns to me : oh good that <unk> get to know that too '' 
 turns out stranger is x 's mother <unk> so i am the mother of a 12 boy 
 today we were just hanging out and i thought we could catch up on some holiday movies on netflix 
 so i say there is n't anything on tv you want to just netflix and chill 
 i had heard the saying on tv and social media a lot 
 his face turned bright red and he replied what the hell is wrong with you '' 
 i get mad at his response and ask him why not 
 basically we have a 20 min conversation about in my mind why i 'm not good enough for him to hang out with and in his mind why i 'm not good enough to have sex with 
 i said things like do n't you love me and want to spend quality time with me '' 
 finally he embarrassingly explained what it meant ... i said do not tell your father '' 
 edit : changed capitalization did n't realize i had n't <unk> not as well 
 tl dr : today i unknowingly asked then begged my son to have sex with me.so 4 years ago i bought the star wars <unk> called something along the lines of the old republic 
 shortly after the release it turned free to play but you were still able to subscribe at a monthly cost which would grant you something called cartel coins 
 i was absolutely certain that i had turned off my subscription i was 13 at the time but as it turns out my older brother wanted to play the game today for some reason he then burst out laughing telling me that ive got around <unk> cartel coins the real money currency just for the sake of scale <unk> cartel coins cost around 55 dollars 
 tl : dr i wasted around <unk> dollars on a game subscription that i did not even know that i had acquired edit- you were supposed to make me feel good about myself not make me <unk> fu actually happened on halloween but i 'm just getting time to post it now 
 i do n't go out on halloween because i 'm in my mid 20s and i 'm just not into going out on the same night as people who rage and get drunk on a holiday that was intended for children to enjoy 
 my neighborhood gets slammed with kids and i enjoy handing out candy anyway so no big deal 
 kids start showing up at around noon and throughout the day i handed out over <unk> goodie bags that i made up with 4 pieces of candy in each 
 it was intense 
 the last of the kids showed up at around 10pm right around the time that the <unk> started running around with shaving cream <unk> <unk> 
 my neighbor across the street lost his cool and ended up calling the cops on the kids and they came by and parked two marked cars at the corner of my block for about an hour then they left 
 right around this time i notice my neighbor to the right is having a party 
 rather their high school age daughter is having a party 
 these kids are all wasted carrying on but whatever 
 i was young once 
 as long as they stay over there it 's cool 
 so around <unk> i decide to go out into my back yard to have a cigarette but i walked through my front door to bring some trash to the cans and i was going to go through my gate into my backyard 
 as i 'm turning the corner i hear a radio 
 now i 'm a cop 
 i know what a radio sounds like 
 i hear keys <unk> and i hear a radio 
 it 's dark though and i ca n't really see but i make out the <unk> of a cop walking into my neighbors back yard 
 the keys the radio the shoulder patches from the local pd and the reflection of the name badge that i caught a glimpse of made me sure that this was a cop 
 i 'm thinking in my head that these cops came back that were parked at the end of the block and noticed this party and were walking around my neighbors driveway to see what was going on in the back yard 
 i decided to go inside and watch what was going on from the window 
 all of a sudden there are about 15 kids in the street in front of the house and i see the cop under a street light on his phone 
 he 's sitting with a kid who is clearly black out drunk who ca n't move 
 i assumed he was calling to make sure this kid had a ride home and was going to be okay 
 i can hear his radio and i notice he has a gun a nightstick the whole deal 
 it 's <unk> to me now that he 's there clearing the party out but i do n't see a radio car anywhere 
 i 'm thinking okay maybe the call came over the radio and he knew my neighbors so he was coming by after his shift to tell them to cool it or something 
 i then start hearing one of these kids asking the cop to mace him 
 i 'm sitting here thinking okay now i 'm sure this is n't a costume 
 costumes do n't come with mace 
 i decided to go into my backyard where i could get a better view and hear them better 
 so i 'm sitting there and i decide to break out my camera and start filming this because if this cop maces this kid he should n't be a fucking cop 
 one of the kids in the group says something about the kid being 14 and then the kid is asking for more vodka before he gets maced 
 the cop then starts warning him that it really hurts and it is n't going to be funny 
 the kid keeps pressuring him and finally he folds 
 he maces this kid in the street in front of this house 
 the kid starts screaming in agony my neighbors daughter starts telling everyone to get back into the back yard and this cop starts going with everyone 
 i 'm sitting in my back yard and i 'm fucking <unk> 
 i ca n't believe that i just saw a fucking cop mace an intoxicated 14 year old 
 he should have been making sure they were n't in the street carrying on at the very least 
 he was now going back into the party though which was really freaking me out because now i 'm thinking that he 's at a high school party drinking with his fucking <unk> 
 having just seen him mace someone i 'm thinking that it 's only a matter of time before he hands his gun to someone to see '' and he have a national news story about cops again 
 i decide to call the local pd 
 i tell them who i am where i live and what i 'm seeing 
 the guy on the phone freaked out 
 he said that there would be cops there in 5 minutes 
 4 <unk> cars pull up to my house and i 'm already standing outside 
 i show them the video of the cop macing the kid and they go to my neighbors house 
 my heart is racing at this point because i ca n't believe what i just did 
 i 'm thinking i should have gone over there before calling the cops but i work in a different department and a lot of the guys out where i live do n't like people from my department and being that he was drinking i thought he would just tell me to fuck off 
 about 45 minutes go by and they have this cop in handcuffs and they 're taking him out of the house 
 they come over to me with his gun belt and tell me they want to show me something 
 his gun is fake 
 his radio is real 
 his mace is real 
 his <unk> pouches are empty 
 his keys are just his keys 
 his baton is real 
 i 'm confused as hell and i asked them what the fuck is going on 
 turns out this kid 's dad is a cop in the department 
 he 's 19 and knows my neighbors daughter from his high school 
 he thought it would be a good idea to take his dads uniform and gun belt and wear it as a costume 
 the local cops told me that i should have gone over there and seen what was going on before calling them 
 they ended up charging the kid with <unk> the <unk> of a minor for macing the drunk 14 year old 
 at least that 's what they told me but they 're probably going to bring him in and then make his dad pick him up 
 i 'm sure his dad is going to be in a fuck ton of trouble for letting his kid go out there with one of his <unk> and his <unk> 
 now my neighbors think i 'm a douche bag for calling the cops on their party and getting their daughter 's friend arrested 
 they 're pissed that i called the cops on a party they do n't believe that i thought the guy was actually cop 
 now i have to worry about my <unk> getting <unk> or worse 
 the local pd thinks i 'm a douche bag for turning in one of their cops even though he was n't actually a cop it 's the principle 
 all in all a pretty <unk> halloween 
 tl dr : saw a cop at my neighbors house late on halloween night 
 neighbors 18 year old daughter was having a party and all kids were wasted 
 watched cop mace a drunk 14 year old 
 called local pd 
 turns out he was a kid wearing his dads gear 
 local pd and neighbors pissed at me 
 edit : used the wrong they 're '' 
 had to fix it before the grammar police called me in 
 edit 2 : everyone is asking for the video 
 here is part of it 
 i had to cut the end off because i started talking and i mentioned the name of the police department and my neighbors address 
 i do n't want that shit online so i 'm not posting it 
 unfortunately that was when there was most of the screaming 
 my iphone sucks at video in low light but you can see what 's going on 
 last edit : thanks for the gold 
 my inbox is over loaded 
 i 'm getting pms calling me a cunt and a piece of shit 
 i 'm getting messages saying good job other one 's saying i 'm a nosy piece of shit 
 some of them are saying i 'm bad for not charging the kids all with <unk> others are saying i 'm bad for getting involved at all 
 make up your fucking mind people 
 **last last edit** : i 'm getting tons of crazy pms 
 i 'm getting people asking me to do interviews for <unk> i 'm getting people from <unk> pressuring me to send them photos of my uniform and police id i 'm getting people going through my post history and trying to identify me and i 'm getting people threatening to <unk> '' me and post all my info online 
 i did n't think this post would blow up the way it has and unfortunately i 'm getting way more heat than i am comfortable with 
 in retrospect i probably should n't have even been posting on reddit but i 've seen other cops from my department do it so i thought it would be okay 
 i 'm really second guessing that thought process now 
 it 's for that reason that i 've deleted my post history and i 'm going to be deleting my reddit account 
 i do n't want to get into trouble for this and i do n't want to have some of the local cops knocking on my door or <unk> asking me questions because of some article they read in the paper or on facebook 
 thanks a ton to the people who gave me gold sorry it 's going to go to waste 
 i also want to say thank you to all of the people who left positive comments and to all of you who support your local law enforcement 
 i 'll leave this post up though so people can continue to enjoy it 
 right off the bat two thing 
 1 as with all things this did n't happen today but a couple of weeks ago 
 2 i 'm on mobile so things might be a bit <unk> with the formatting 
 last weekend my sister and her husband were heading out of town and i got to be the responsible uncle for my 10 year old niece who we 'll call emily 
 which is super awesome 
 i get to see my sister and brother in law a lot so i 've built up a pretty good relationship with emily over the past few years 
 so saturday morning they drop her off at my apartment give hugs all around and hit the road 
 emily gets a bit flustered but does that worry me 
 fuck no 
 i 'm the cool uncle and i got the prescription for this panic attack 
 i pack her up into the car and we hit the mall 
 we grab breakfast and spend all day hitting one shop right after another 
 by the time we get to <unk> she 's on cloud 9. we waste the whole day away and get home 
 as soon as we get through the door she <unk> on to the sofa and is out like a light 
 i grab a blanket and cover her up 
 so i waste a bit of time playing halo keep an eye on her make sure she 's alright 
 about 5 she wakes up and i go ahead and make dinner 
 and then smooth cool uncle strikes again 
 boom 
 ice cream for desert 
 and what goes good with ice cream 
 movies 
 blazing <unk> 
 loves it 
 <unk> 
 even more 
 princess <unk> 
 fucking rolling 
 i 've got this kid in the palm of my hand 
 10 o clock rolls around 
 bed time 
 she 's begging and pleading do n't make me go to sleep 
 more movies '' 
 and yes i want to be the cool uncle but i also have to be the responsible uncle 
 so i call my sister 
 emily wants to stay up and watch movies what do '' 
 and she says it 's fine as long as she gets plenty of sleep before they come get her tomorrow night 
 i 'm digging it so i tell emily to go pick out another movie and go back to talking to my sister 
 how 's the trip 
 everything alright 
 blah blah blah '' 
 as i 'm still on the phone emily comes running back up to me movie in hand 
 and out of all the movies on my shelf which one does she pick out 
 poltergeist 
 what fucking 10 year old wants to see poltergeist 
 so i go back to talking with my sister 
 uh there 's no way i can let her watch this '' 
 and she responds no it 's ok but if she gets too scared movie goes off and she goes to bed '' 
 and against my better judgement i let her 
 i did tell her it was a scary movie before we started but she just have me that thousand mile smile and said she wanted a scary movie 
 alright kid 
 to my surprise she did fairly well through most of the movie 
 she huddled into her blanket and let out a few gasps and yelps every now and then but every time i asked if she was fine she just smiled and said yeah more movie 
 until 
 the pool scene 
 for some reason the skeletons in the pool freaked her the fuck out over the rest of the movie 
 so i took my sister 's advice i turned the movie off switched it over to <unk> and tried to call her down 
 and here 's where the fuck up comes 
 as i 'm calming her down she keeps talking about how scary the skeletons were and she hated skeletons and started crying a bit so i 'm trying to talk her down and thanks to you fuckers i say the first thing that pops into my mind 
 it 's ok honey skeletons are fine everyone has a skeleton inside them even you '' 
 and in that moment 
 as her eyes got wider and wider and tears starting flowing like <unk> falls 
 i knew 
 i fucked up 
 almost instantly she 's in full panic mode 
 shaking full on bawling screaming and then she <unk> 
 ice cream and pizza melted together into the <unk> of my sofa 
 i 'm in full lock down mode now trying my best to take control of the situation 
 it ai n't happening 
 so i have to call my sister who instructs me to take her to our mom 's house so she can take care of her 
 i bundle her up as best as i can and she is dead silent for the entire car ride over 
 i passed her off to my mom and went back home to salvage my couch 
 sunday my sister called and said she picked her up and emily would n't say a word about anything that happened all day saturday 
 she told me she was n't as mad as she should be because i did get the go ahead from her for a scary movie but i was a dumbass for telling her she had a skeleton 
 <unk> 
 friday i got a call back from my sister telling me emily would n't stop talking about going to the doctor to get her skeleton out '' leading to several conversations about why emily had to keep her skeleton inside her 
 followed by my sister telling me that she tried to bring emily back over to my apartment and was met by several <unk> 
 tldr : mr. <unk> scared my niece with too much <unk> and reset three years of trust <unk> 
 edit : i saw a couple of people mention why she freaked out about skeletons being inside of her at 10 years old 
 i called my sister and asked her to pry a bit more info out of emily 
 apparently she took what i said to mean she actually had one of the skeletons from the movie inside her 
 like a pile of fresh fleshy bones just hanging inside of her 
 i would have thought that through a bit more that night if i had n't been freaking out myself trying to calm her down 
 so thankfully she is n't freaked out about her skeleton it 's just <unk> movie skeletons she has a problem with 
 double edit : obligatory <unk> thanks for the gold 
 triple edit : i 've gotten quite a few replies asking if she 's special '' 
 she is not 
 she was just freaked out from the movie and misunderstood what i said which freaked her out even more 
 i 've gotten an update from my sister and it seems she 's already starting to understand what i was saying and she does not have a poltergeist skeleton inside her 
 just her normal old skeleton she was born <unk> begin i masturbated at work 
 yup do n't blame me 
 my girlfriend decided that sending me an exposed picture of herself was a good idea 
 like any other straight man a naked picture of your so gets you a tad frisky 
 in combination with the animal urge i also needed a shit so thought i could kill two birds with one stone 
 the bathroom i went to has two cubicles and three <unk> 
 i take my seat in the first cubicle and when the coast is clear do my business 
 i. <unk> 
 a lot 
 i 'm not talking your <unk> <unk> i 'm talking <unk> <unk> 
 i cleaned up as best as i could and <unk> up my trousers 
 as i was leaving and washing my hands i passed one of my senior managers a nice bloke but stern 
 we greet each other as we pass and i walk off checking my phone until he rushes back out of the bathroom and says to me with no <unk> whatsoever what is that mess '' 
 i freeze and accompany him as he walks me back into the toilet and asks which cubicle i was in 
 i realised i could get out of the sticky situation and replied that i was in the second cubicle 
 he drags me to the second cubicle where someone had previously been and had there was smeared shit on the toilet ring with a puddle of piss on the floor 
 tldr - sticky situation turns shitty real quick 
 edit : i should add i cleaned up my jizz perfectly i just froze and though i had n't 
 edit2 : disclaimer - not only straight men can get that frisky feeling from a picture of their so 
 throwaway because boyfriend knows my reddit account 
 bf and i are both 19 and we have been dating for three years 
 tonight i went over to his house to play some steam games i finally got a job and decided to play some games that he recommended and he wants to test them out on his new laptop 
 he decides to show me surgeon <unk> 
 having had brain surgery a few times i am absolutely terrified of anything having to do with my noggin organ 
 but i say oh fuck why the hell not 
 it 's <unk> right 
 no big deal 
 after a <unk> dinner of corn dogs fresh from the oven i turn my head and he says hey <unk> look '' 
 i turn and he has the poor patient 's brain <unk> about the tool tray and the screen is positively <unk> with blood 
 i manage to vomit all over his new laptop his jeans and his <unk> 
 the dog managed to move away 
 he projectile <unk> into my hair 
 reddit tifu bad 
 edit : jesus fuck reddit 
 front page 
 i love <unk> up i was a stereotypical boy 
 played with little toy guns and cars peed standing up via a spectacular penis loved shop class had a <unk> with my female teachers ... you get the idea 
 having the appropriate amount of external <unk> holes and <unk> my gender and sexuality were always strongly male '' 
 then puberty hit 
 while i 'd always been attracted to women and still am i developed a sexual interest in men as well 
 it grew over the years and was kind of awkward you know that weird feeling that you get when dealing with people you 're attracted to 
 well i started having that with almost everyone 
 my platonic <unk> felt ... uncomfortable ... and by my early 20 's i 'd pretty much stopped developing new ones 
 around this time i took the plunge and with the help of the internet started having sex with men 
 i 'd been having sex with women since i was 17 and it was great but for the first time since i started dating i was single and there was just something about being penetrated that i really enjoyed 
 sometimes it was a good experience other times it was terribly painful 
 i chalked it up to welp that 's <unk> for ya '' and took it in <unk> 
 in my mid 20 's i was hospitalized with severe pain in my lower intestines 
 i never had any intestinal problems before but suddenly i was passing blood with my stool and thought that i 'd somehow <unk> my colon 
 since i had n't had anything inserted in a couple years at that point i was clueless as to what could have caused it and a little embarrassed it turned out that my mother was the only person able to take me to the hospital and she insisted she stay until they figured out what was wrong 
 nothing more uncomfortable than looking your mother in the face while a nurse inserts a few fingers into your ass to see if some foreign object is jammed in there 
 i ended up spending most of my hospital visit sedated due to the ridiculous amount of constant pain 
 after a week i was discharged with the <unk> of an <unk> colon and put on an appropriate diet 
 somewhat regularly since then i 've noticed blood when i poop 
 this is regardless of being penetrated or not 
 for the last decade i thought this was just a normal thing due to colon <unk> 
 this morning i woke up feeling rather horny for buttplay and being unable to locate my <unk> decided to <unk> the old <unk> 
 i 've literally never put my own fingers in my ass beyond the very first knuckle so this was a new one by me 
 for the most part it felt like any other rectum ... except for a <unk> '' spot about two inches in 
 at first i thought this was an <unk> and i 'd have to abandon ship but there was no blood ... and rather than hurting when i poked it it felt good 
 could this be my male g spot '' i 'd heard so much about 
 i continued to <unk> with cautious curiosity slowly building confidence and speed until the neighbor 's dog startled me and ... ouch 
 my finger went through '' the soft spot 
 i pulled it out immediately 
 then came the blood 
 i was concerned but there was n't really any pain after a few minutes - i still went to the hospital though 
 i decided to give a fake name due to the circumstances and as a result the doctor did n't have my old records 
 she asked me some routine questions and i explained what happened while i was being cleaned up we made some <unk> and joked around a bit to lighten the mood while she got the glove and lube ready then in went her fingers 
 she pretty quickly found the spot which was n't sore at all by this point and a strange look came across her face as she asked me did you have gender <unk> surgery at some point '' 
 i assured her i 've always been male - having gotten my penis into a variety of embarrassing situations as far back as i can remember i think i 'd be aware if it was n't around at some point 
 she assured me that in her professional opinion i have a vaginal tube which opens to my rectum and that although she was n't a <unk> she was pretty sure what i 'd poked with my finger was a sort of hymen 
 she asked me if i wanted x-rays to confirm 
 being rather surprised and poor i passed 
 besides i know where to go for answers 
 it all makes sense now 
 i could never figure out why my mother was so <unk> about being present during my hospital visit for intestinal pain all those years ago 
 while when i was a child my parents and the doctor would step out of the room and talk after each physical i had prior to coming back in and telling me i was <unk> healthy 
 i do n't know that this changes anything about my self-image - i 've always been pretty comfortable with my sexuality and feel gender identity to be a rather secondary aspect of my personality 
 i still feel just as male as i did yesterday 
 nonetheless i intend to confront my parents about this over the weekend and figure out wtf is up 
 although not an <unk> lie i feel this would be a huge crime of <unk> on their part and if it 's the case that i was surgically altered to emphasize one specific gender i 'm going to be rather pissed 
 **tl dr** : *i accidentally discovered i may have been born an <unk> person and my parents may have actively hidden that from me for my entire life 
 * edit : fixed 
 narration by cyae1 edit 2 : i will certainly be updating after i speak with my parents and probably again after i see a specialist and find out more technical details 
 edit 3 : i may have popped my own cherry but to the two of you who popped my gold cherry ... thanks : i feel <unk> for not saying something sooner but wanted to pay it forward prior to acknowledgement 
 part 2 is here 
 you can stop flooding my inbox with requests 
 so the story goes ... i 'm male and i posted i 'm pregnant '' 
 on my facebook wall for april 1st and things <unk> out of control 
 but first there are a few things you should know about me 
 1. i 'm 100 % male testicles penis and everything 
 2. i have a gf that my family does n't like 
 3. my family is extremely conservative 
 so later in the day my mother calls and when i pick up she is hysterical screaming and is basically <unk> me 
 i 'm bewildered and entirely confused so try i ask her through the screaming what did i do wrong 
 she says you got your girlfriend pregnant '' and that 's when it dawned on me 
 my little super obviously a joke facebook post on april first saying i 'm pregnant '' 
 actually tricked my family leading them to chain call each other to gossip about how i got my girlfriend pregnant 
 long story short my whole extended family is pissed off at me and thinks i got my girlfriend pregnant i almost got <unk> and i won april 1st this year 
 fml ... <unk> so this was a year ago but since i am new to reddit i thought you 'd all enjoy this 
 i teach acting for a professional actor training program in theatre and i had a class of <unk> high kids last year 
 so one day i was teaching the concept of <unk> and that words can mean just about anything you want them to mean 
 sometimes it 's not about what you say but how you say it 
 to which a boy student replied : you mean like innuendo '' 
 me : not where i was going but yes just like innuendo '' 
 multiple students in unison : what 's that '' 
 me : oh no well it 's when you say something that is not sexual in nature but by the way you say it it sounds sexual 
 same boy student : yeah like saying 'that 's what she said ... '' group of students : i do n't get it '' 
 this is when i really start to realize i might be in trouble me : sighing well when someone says something not sexual you can blurt out that 's what she said ... '' at the end and it kinda makes it dirty 
 giggling girl student : oh my god that is awesome '' i 'll tell you if these students grabbed onto any other of the concepts i teach as fast as they got this my teaching tactics would be of legend 
 these kids turned into the most dirty <unk> sexual <unk> <unk> the rest of class 
 they were fully loaded with an amazing new skill ... and i was fresh bait 
 me to student : i need you to be bigger '' 
 random student yells out : that 's what she said '' 
 me to another student : you are rushing this moment 
 slow it down '' 
 random student yells out : that 's what she said '' 
 etc 
 you get the idea 
 so here is when this comes back to bite me 
 fast forward a week 
 just before class one of my students comes up to me 
 she is the normally really quiet one 
 shy 
 completely unassuming 
 sits in the back 
 rarely talks 
 the kind you usually forget about you know 
 she comes up to me with a <unk> grin on her face and says : soooo i kinda got into trouble this week 
 i got my first detention '' me : oh wow really 
 what did you do '' 
 she then proceeded to tell me this amazing story while i stood in complete shock girl student : so i was in band the other day she plays the <unk> and our teacher was working with us on group sections in class and when he was working with mine he got really frustrated and shouted <unk> this harder 
 to which i accidentally blurted out that 's what she said '' 
 the entire class stopped talking and went silent 
 my teacher then told me to see him after class and then gave me detention '' 
 i stood in silence not knowing whether to feel proud or afraid for my job 
 stunned i asked her do you even know the meaning of what you just said '' 
 girl : yep '' 
 then she walked away outside of the fact that this might have been the best delivery of that joke i have ever heard thank god she only got detention ... and i still have a job 
 kids today are messed up 
 tl dr : taught my teenage students about that 's what she said '' helped one student earn her first detention like a boss 
 edit : cleaned up formatting 
 edit 2 : just a small bit of perspective 
 many of my students are homeschooled 
 they 've spent much of their lives training in dance singing acting etc 
 for many this class is their only real regular social outlet 
 sweet 
 front page 
 thanks guys for valentine 's day my boyfriend wanted to go to an adult store and buy some things to <unk> our sex life 
 i being the <unk> girlfriend that i am was totally down for it 
 among many other items we purchased two different butt <unk> one was a ball and one was a christmas tree shaped plug 
 both of these are not supposed to be able to be sucked up into your butt 
 bullshit 
 so we used the christmas tree shaped one first 
 he put it in and went back to having sex and i could feel him hitting the butt plug when he would thrust and it felt great so i was like heck yea 
 then i did n't feel the butt plug being hit anymore 
 i told my boyfriend it fell out and we stopped and searched the floor under the bed even out into the hallway and bathroom thinking maybe he kicked it when it fell out 
 we did n't find it 
 we chalked it up to the room being dark and figured we would find it later 
 so he grabs the ball shaped butt plug 
 he attempts to put it in 
 the ball has a flat circle shaped stopper that is supposed to prevent it front sliding all the way in 
 i lube up the butt plug and tell my boyfriend to shove it in 
 do n't be shy 
 so he does and got way too excited 
 he starts screaming 
 i had no idea what was going on 
 i was screaming at him to tell me why he was screaming 
 he tells me the butt plug went all the way inside me 
 i start crying 
 he 's running around saying things like why 
 oh god why 
 and he 's apologizing 
 i 'm yelling at him and asking him why he did this like he purposely did it but i was freaking out 
 i am squatting on the bathroom floor trying to push this thing out of me 
 i have two fingers in my butt and i 'm desperately trying to get a grip on it 
 i 'm crying still 
 the boyfriend is asking me repeatedly if i got it out i 'm yelling at him to shut up 
 total chaos 
 i pushed like i was giving birth and i finally got a grip on the ball part and pull it out 
 it was foul 
 i take a steaming hot shower 
 i am so relieved 
 beyond relieved 
 my boyfriend now knows that sexy time is done 
 so he starts cleaning up our bedroom 
 i asked him to find the other butt plug the big one 
 he comes into the bathroom and very timidly tells me he has torn the room apart even taken the mattress off the bed frame and can not find the butt plug 
 i knew what he was suggesting 
 i squatted did an internal check nothing 
 he told me to get dressed and took me to the er 
 so we tell everyone at the er what 's going on 
 one nurse says to me ... my husband begs me all the time to do that and i tell him absolutely not 
 this is why 
 so they have me change into a gown and then the er doc comes in 
 she says ... i heard the story are you sure you searched everywhere 
 we told her yes and then i told her my butt keeps clenching itself and i feel like i have to poop 
 she told me to try but nothing came out 
 they did an x-ray and it did n't show the butt plug 
 the doc also did an internal exam and could n't feel it 
 she said she believed it was inside of me because my butt kept clenching itself 
 she told me that some companies design the butt plug to show up on x-rays for this reason but others do n't and <unk> and rubber and silicone may not show 
 she told my boyfriend that she hopes we had fun and are happy because i 'm going to have to go into surgery 
 she said they were going to admit me and get me into the operating room <unk> 
 dude i was like dry <unk> 
 i was beyond freaking out 
 i all of a sudden felt like i had to poop again 
 the doc told me to try but not strain 
 i sat on the toilet and rocked back and forth and prayed like i 've never prayed before 
 i pooped 
 the nurse had given me a plastic hat shaped tray to put in the toilet in case i pooped out the butt plug but i did n't put it in the toilet 
 so after i pooped i looked in the toilet and it just looked like a huge turd 
 so i was bummed and figured it was just poop 
 as i 'm reaching down to pull my pants up the toilet starts to flush on its own before i can really inspect the poop 
 i had to make a split second decision 
 find out for sure if the butt plug was in there or let the docs go in me and find out 
 i reached my bare hand into that toilet faster than i 've ever been capable of moving before 
 sure enough i felt the <unk> butt plug 
 it was completely covered in poop 
 it was the most disgusting thing ever 
 so now i 'm carrying this giant poop covered butt plug in one hand and trying to pull up my jeans with the other and my hospital gown is falling off 
 i drop the butt plug into the sink wash my hands like 5 times get my pants on 
 i run out to the er desk and announce that i 've pooped it out 
 they give me gloves 
 i go back in and attempt to clean it off 
 i washed the skin off my hands 
 i went back to my er exam room and got dressed 
 my boyfriend was like yes 
 we 're leaving 
 i was like ... i want chinese food now 
 the doc came in and asked if i pooped and i said yep the but plug is right there 
 she removes the paper towels and <unk> it 
 she was shocked by the size 
 the nurse came in and i was like ... i 'm not trying to show off but it 's over there 
 she was like ... by all means show it off i want to see 
 my poop covered butt plug was on display and the whole er staff was rushing to see it 
 i felt like a superhero 
 the doc was like ... you literally just saved yourself from going through surgery 
 i was like ... that 's how i roll 
 we left the er got chinese and i gave my boyfriend head to make up for the interruption earlier 
 happy valentines day 
 p.s 
 - i took a pic of the poop covered butt plug 
 they actually asked me if i wanted to keep it haha 
 my boyfriend was like ... burn it 
 discharge papers for the skeptical 
 found the box while cleaning up our room this morning 
 it looks like someone tried to rob us my boyfriend went crazy trying to find the missing '' butt plug 
 <unk> '' the one i was able to get out myself : tl dr : ended up spending valentines night in the er due to a butt plug stuck inside my <unk> this happened around a month ago but i only just gained enough confidence to post it here 
 i 'm a <unk> 18 year old from <unk> and my 5 year old cousin and i like to take walks along the boardwalk at <unk> harbour 
 during these walks he likes to drop behind me a bit and then run up to me 
 when i hear him coming i spin around and grab him spinning my cousin through the air and back down in front of me 
 anyway i heard my little cousin running up behind me so i turned around and swung him up into the air ... only to hear <unk> a raspy voice exclaim : put me down you giant fuck '' 
 i saw the little person 
 everything went into slow motion and at the arc of the swing i let go causing him to eat the boardwalk 
 needless to say he was n't very happy and i had an angry crowd demanding i explain myself 
 tl dr - mistook a little person for my 5 year old cousin swung and accidentally threw him much to his <unk> 
 edit : holy shit i did not expect this to blow up overnight thank you all 
 and whoever the amazing soul was that gifted me gold please contact me so i can thank you properly 
 also thank you for letting me come home and laugh my arse off at these <unk> 
 i love you people of <unk> was taking a two hour history final in a tightly packed room 
 the desks were barely a foot apart 
 somehow the desk behind me was pushed up to my chair and the girl behind me was bending down over her exam 
 i straightened up and stretched my neck by moving it back and looking at the ceiling in a swift motion to crack my neck 
 my head nailed that girl on her head and she was so surprised she slammed her head into the desk 
 she down fell out of her chair holding her forehead and somehow pulled the desk down on top of her 
 she was alright and finished her exam 
 first time posting on tifu edit : and i was very very sorry 
 edit : diagram edit : because people doubt the existence of stretching <unk> 
 i stretch this way because it <unk> my neck and cracks it 
 i have horrible <unk> so leaning my head back kinda <unk> the orientation 
 plus it feels nice 
 just lean your head back all the way and stare at the ceiling for a few seconds 
 edit : because too many people are hurting themselves 
 to do this correctly just lean your head all the way back and stare at the ceiling 
 tl dr during an exam i <unk> a girl behind me by stretching so as to crack my neck she ended up on the <unk> was about 2 weeks ago but new info about the story made me want to post it 
 i work at an <unk> waste water treatment plant and one of the things we need to monitor is the gasses in the manholes outside 
 our meters test for h2s co o2 and lel lower explosive limit of <unk> 
 for testing these manholes we have a little air vacuum that we use to pull air from the lower <unk> of the holes to test 
 high h2s levels are deadly 
 here 's 2 pictures of what our equipment looks like now i was working 5 days in a row with 12 hour shifts and i like food 
 the day before my shifts i made a nice triple batch of chili not just any chili though spiced italian sausage with extra hot seasoning and extra beans kind of chili 
 you can probably guess what that does to the <unk> system ... on the 3rd day of work after eating maybe 2 bowls of chili a day i went to take manhole readings on the street with my vehicle 
 i have the gas meter hooked up to the vacuum and the vacuum is pumping whilst sitting on my lap while the hose is falling between my legs 
 feeling a nice fart coming on i give a nice push letting out the <unk> of the chili only diet of the last 2-3 days 
 the vacuum hose sitting between my legs picks up plenty of the gasses and sends them to the gas monitor 
 the monitor is astounded at the levels of gas it 's receiving and goes berserk with its alarms 
 all of the gasses that it monitors were over the reading levels except for o2 that went under level and threw the entire monitor out of <unk> so i could n't take my manhole readings 
 i shut it down and set it to the side for later 
 now today i 've learned that the gas monitor that i had farted into needs to go back to the company to get recalibrated because our <unk> are n't making it work properly ... my farts potentially killed a 700 $ piece of equipment ... tl dr : my manhole smells worse than the others ... <unk> we have the monitors fresh air calibrated daily and have them recalibrated elsewhere by the <unk> head every 2 months 
 we keep the monitors calibrated properly so the readings are on point 
 found the reading limits for the gas meter h2s ppm : <unk> co ppm : <unk> o2 % : 0-30 lel % : <unk> as for the levels of gas it recieved from my concentrated fart i do n't remember what some of them were but the lel % was at 100 % and the co went over range 
 good grief gilded 
 thank you kind stranger 
 really enjoying most of the comments too : p ok my first ever post but this has to be the funniest most awful mistake i have ever made 
 i was composing a message on fb to my sister in law with a pic of her wedding dress in it from a dress fitting she had 
 i could not find where my photos were on the family laptop so went in to a folder that was marked <unk> downloads thinking it might be in there 
 no mini pics appeared on the screen just little text boxes 
 i clicked on the first one and it opened up straight into the fb message to my sister in law but i didn’t know that yet 
 i was shocked to see a pic of my husband holding his bits on screen but remembers the pic from previously 
 he had an infection and sent me a photo of the infection because he was doing an awful job <unk> it over the phone 
 i suddenly remembers i was composing a fb post to my sister in law ... .. there is was in all its glory ... of course she was anxiously awaiting the pics of her dress and so obviously opened it the second it came in to her in box 
 i laughed then i cried then i screamed and then laughed again 
 i then explained the pic as she had seen it but not replied 
 we laughed about it 
 when i told my husband what had had happened he stood up and said for fuck sake and went to the pub 
 he later saw the funny side but for the last two days he has been letting off loud cringing noises at random 
 ok reddit unlike other stories this happened today 
 like a few hours ago 
 grammar sucks i 'm sorry 
 so i live in the great state of texas where everybody and their mother has guns 
 so i 've been wanting a <unk> for a while and was a little short on cash so i decided to sell one of my guns and go buy my <unk> 
 anywho i find a buyer and decide to meet up at a local chicken place parking lot 
 cool 
 i get to the parking lot of the place and see two gentlemen in a vehicle and they look like they 're waiting for something cool i found the buyer 
 i pull next to the driver side and get off my truck and look at the driver and say hello 
 he replies and says hello as well 
 ok so this whole time i 'm thinking he 's buying the gun so i open my back door and proceed to pull out my gun 
 the look of horror on this guys face as i try to hand the gun over to him and jokingly said go ahead and try 'er out there 's a round in the chamber was a joke chamber and tube were empty ok ... so now the passenger is <unk> something and the driver is just staring at me with his mouth open 
 so i asked you got the money right 
 then boom it clicked 
 i got the wrong guy 
 shit shit shit i said i was sorry and noped the hell outta there 
 eventually the guy who was gon na buy the gun called me telling me that he saw the whole thing happened and gave me an extra $ 5 for a giving him a good laugh 
 edit 1 : gun was empty <unk> 've waited 16 months since marrying my wife to get my us permanent <unk> 
 i was finally travelling today to <unk> everything 
 i hand him the sealed packet that he has to inspect he looks it over <unk> silently 
 all of a sudden he extends his arm towards me hand up palm facing me 
 without thinking i high five him 
 his hand is limp 
 i knew immediately i had done wrong 
 a look of confusion and anger flashes across his face 
 those in the queue behind me fell silent 
 follow me sir '' 
 turns out he was about to demonstrate how i give my <unk> correctly 
 i finished the process in a locked room with a different officer and no doubt a lot more questions than i would have otherwise had to endure 
 edit & amp bonus tifu : so when i had to go to the embassy to present my evidence for them to make a final decision i had another fuck up 
 i do n't know if anyone has been to the us embassy in london but they have a little security room outside the building with an xray and guards etc and big heavy doors 
 i 've just been through the xray and i 'm struggling with my belt and my bag and i 'm pushing on the heavy door with a single finger and it wo n't open obviously so naturally i start looking for a door release see a switch on the door frame press it and all the lights turn off 
 fucking great 
 i was convinced they would decline my green card on the grounds of stupidity 
 edit : for those wondering green card and permanent resident are the same thing 
 edit : please <unk> tag me as the inappropriate high five guy or whatever you want and say hello to me when you see me in other subs 
 makes my day when that happens so this story actually happened yesterday for what it 's worth 
 i 've been on a new <unk> <unk> for the last few weeks and every now and then i get really hungry 
 i 'm obsessively counting calories so i was <unk> the cabinets looking for something <unk> to eat 
 entire can of <unk> jalapenos for only 40 calories 
 bingo 
 so i eat the entire can of jalapenos and go about my day 
 two hours later i 'm browsing the internet on the couch when i suddenly realize i must make an immediate <unk> to the toilet as bad things are about to happen 
 i pull down my pants just in time to unleash a torrent of pepper oil diarrhea 
 my stomach is churning and my asshole is on fire 
 i sit on the john for a while until the pain subsides 
 as soon as a i stand up i realize that i 've shit not <unk> the toilet but rather all over the back of it 
 fuck 
 now i suddenly understand how it happens 
 <unk> i 'm one of those people 
 * horrified by the mess all over the toilet and all over my backside i tip toe out of the bathroom to the cabinet under the sink and grab a baby wipe in one hand and a <unk> wipe in the other 
 cue the fuck up 
 <unk> back into the bathroom i promptly forget which wipe was in which hand 
 the mistake is readily apparent once my anus is ignited into a <unk> agony that <unk> the deepest <unk> of hell 
 <unk> a steak knife up my ass would have been a walk in the park compared to this <unk> 
 so i start screaming and my partner comes running only to find me clutching my shit-covered butt in a shit-covered bathroom sobbing 
 a bit much for a month old relationship ... tl dr - confused the wipes wrecked <unk> <unk> are a lot of <unk> cats near where i live 
 one of them who some of my friends have named troubles is actually quite friendly unlike the others 
 i 'm walking to work about a 2 min walk from my front door and notice troubles sitting on the dirt path <unk> 
 he sees me and meows 
 i of course meow back at him which leads to him walking over to me 
 i start petting him and he rubs himself against my leg <unk> etc 
 20 minutes go by and i 'm still hanging out and playing with troubles 
 i am now late for work 
 i get to work and understandably my boss demands to know why i was late 
 i 'm then berated for being a child '' after i explained that the reason i was late is i was distracted by a cat 
 tl dr : i a 23 y/o man was late for work because i could n't resist playing with a friendly kitty 
 edit : i left early for work because i was gon na make coffee there so even after 20 minutes of pussy petting i ended up only being about 5-6 minutes <unk> this actually happened yesterday 
 my husband and i were making dinner and started <unk> 
 i tried to pinch <unk> butt he pinned my arm and started <unk> me and i went to slap him lightly on the cheek 
 as my hand was approaching his face i suddenly remembered i 've been growing my nails and they 're long enough to do some damage 
 i did n't want to hurt him 
 so did i stop my hand 
 of course not ... it was too close to stop the contact so i did what any sane person would do 
 i curled my fingers in so they would n't scratch him ... <unk> a fist ... and punched my husband in the <unk> night i meant to go to bed early because i had to get up this morning at five to help my grandpa sort calves we were selling 
 i went to bed at 1130 but proceeded to browse reddit until four 
 i only got like 30 min of sleep and ended up being exhausted during the sorting 
 i was so tired that my reaction times were crap and did n't get out of the way of an angry mama cow soon enough 
 she <unk> me up against the <unk> and cracked 4 of my ribs 
 : i guess this gives me time to play fallout 4 for the next few weeks ... tl dr : stayed up too late reaction time was crap broke ribs.debated about creating a throwaway for this one but decided to kind of just embrace my past 
 so like a lot of tifu stories this happened a while ago 
 this was eight years ago when i worked at a <unk> movie theater in orlando 
 it was a summer day and i was tearing tickets 
 usually <unk> switched off after two hour shifts but i enjoyed getting paid to just stand at the podium doodle on theater schedules and pretty much do nothing so i usually volunteered to just rip tickets for my entire eight hour shift 
 anyways it was summer and it was a particularly hot and <unk> day in florida so a lot of the female customers were wearing short shorts tank tops etc 
 like any horny seventeen year old male this was all rather relevant to my interests and i got to the point where i needed to release the tension that had built up throughout the day 
 towards the end of my shift i took a fifteen minute break and went into one of the handicap restrooms to jerk off the nice restrooms with a single toilet sink and where you can lock the door 
 now when i do the deed i like to be laying down 
 don’t ask me why it’s just something i’ve always done since i was little 
 i guess i like to be able to stretch out my legs and i can also finish quicker that way 
 since time was of the essence here when i got into the handicap restroom i laid out on the floor and proceeded to jerk it 
 they cleaned the restrooms regularly and i’m not much of a <unk> so the fact that it was a restroom floor wasn’t an issue 
 anyways i guess in my haste in getting in and getting off i didn’t properly lock the door 
 to this day i don’t know why the door didn’t lock 
 i can only assume i didn’t turn the <unk> all the way 
 about half way through my jerk off session the door opened and one of my female co-workers came in to clean 
 now i was laying on the ground along the wall that the hinges to the door were closest to so when she opened the door and pushed it <unk> she didn’t see me at first because i was hidden on the other side of the door 
 she managed to enter the restroom without seeing me laying there on the floor behind her with my pants down 
 i knew i was dead in the water and it was only a matter of seconds before she would turn around 
 so i had to think fast 
 at the time i had recently watched some <unk> <unk> about kids with epilepsy 
 as the girl turned i started convulsing on the ground and pretending to be having a seizure 
 the girl yelled “oh my god ” as i just lay there shaking violently on the ground and staring off into space 
 she ran out of the bathroom and started screaming in the lobby for someone to help 
 as soon as she stepped out i quickly pulled up my boxers to at least <unk> my penis 
 luckily the sheer terror of the door opening killed a good 75 % of my erection on the spot so i like to think it didn’t look like i had a boner 
 on the bathroom floor i <unk> how to proceed 
 i knew people would be entering any second 
 i then realized i was at the point of no return 
 the assistant manager of the theater soon burst into the bathroom and i continued to <unk> on the floor 
 he kind of just <unk> by my side and put his had on my shoulder as i continued to shake there like an idiot 
 i mean there wasn’t much he could have done 
 an ambulance arrived in literally three minutes 
 when the paramedics came in i decided it was time to <unk> out of <unk> and so i stopped convulsing and just started to <unk> on the floor and pretend to not know where i was 
 they put me on a stretcher and wheeled me through the lobby to their vehicle 
 a good sized crowd had formed at this point 
 they were about to take me away in the ambulance but i got off the stretcher and insisted that i was fine 
 i made up some story about having had seizures my entire life and that this happened to me a couple times every year 
 i kept insisting that i was fine and was able to talk the paramedics into leaving 
 the theater had my mom as an emergency contact so she eventually came and took me home 
 i could never tell my parents what really happened so to this day they think i really had a seizure 
 in the following months i had to take several <unk> tests had to do several <unk> at the hospital and was put on a few <unk> that i only pretended to take when in reality i flushed the pills down the toilet 
 thank god for health insurance 
 in retrospect it would have been better to have just gotten caught jerking off then to have had to go through all the lies doctor <unk> and medical bullshit 
 this is where the true tifu aspect of this story lies 
 after a while it looked like <unk> <unk> was just a freak one-time thing and it finally all kind of just went away 
 i ended up working at that theater for another couple years and people were always really nice to me and thought i was just some poor <unk> who had a seizure while trying to take a shit 
 tl dr : pretended to have a seizure to get out of getting caught masturbating at <unk> dad is a professor at a university and not originally from the usa which means he 's twice over not hip with lingo 
 therefore he <unk> all his hip lingo from my two brothers and me 
 so being great sons we decide to mess with him and tell him <unk> tips is the new way of saying connecting on linkedin 
 you know let 's touch tips '' = connect with me '' have we touched tips '' 
 = have we connected on linkedin '' 
 etc etc 
 fast forward to yesterday when he 's meeting a younger guy to work in his lab ... i get an angry call from him later saying that he ended the interview with something like all sounds good have we touched tips '' 
 so this actually happened on monday do n't kill me 
 i 'm from britain and i 'm currently in sixth form junior and senior year for any confused americans so in college you get <unk> which basically are periods where you can do whatever as you do n't have a lesson and they 're usually an hour long 
 in my case i had three <unk> in a row so me and my friend decided to go out shopping for a little while and then come back for our last lesson 
 anyway 
 skip to three hours later and we were making our way back to college near our college there 's a church 
 this is where it gets bad 
 i looked over at the church and saw that there was a family walking out of it they were <unk> dressed so i 'd assumed they 'd just come from a wedding as a large majority of the family were n't wearing black 
 and me being me i ca n't keep my <unk> shut and exclaimed congratulations '' 
 to which my friend turned to look at me in sheer <unk> 
 not knowing what she was so shocked about i looked towards the family who 's jaws had practically hit the ground 
 it was only then i saw a couple holding a large framed picture of a little boy 
 i walked as fast i could not bearing to look at the couple who i could now hear sobbing hysterically 
 tl dr - thought a funeral was a wedding accidentally congratulated a couple on their sons funeral 
 edit : so i was reading through the comments and could n't help notice how many people were confused about if i was a boy or a girl i am a <unk> was just in a silly mood and thought it would be funny to mess with my waitress by faking an australian accent pretending it was my birthday asking her a bunch of stupid questions about her life about america etc 
 she liked me so much that she wound up <unk> next to me for a picture and giving me her number 
 she wants to hang out on thursday 
 if i do n't blow her off then she 'll eventually learn that i was being completely fake when we met 
 i 'm such a piece of shit 
 : alright 
 10 minutes ago i was doing my mom a favor by taking all personal files from my mom 's old computer to her new one 
 nothing special she has zero <unk> about technology 
 thing is she <unk> what she want to send to her new computer 
 she said movies '' so i go onto the movies folder to throw the movies over to the usb 
 thing is it 's a very old computer so i <unk> to go into the folder 
 accidentally open the first video sees my mom in a <unk> with her ex boyfriend and another lady friend that i grew up with 
 all of this while my mom 's so watches right beside me 
 quicky closes the computer and i quickly walk out of the living room with the husband being completely silent and my mom does n't understand what just happened 
 i 'm currently in my room listening to music 
 **tl dr : cleaning mom 's old computer accidentally finds a porno with my mom her ex and a woman i grew up with 
 ** edit 1 : currently on a silent train with my gf on my way to my grandparents 
 thank you for all of your texts you 've made me laugh frustrated and terrified 
 edit 2 : i 'll be out of town for two days hence no contact with my mother or her so 
 posts an update on sunday edit 3 : <unk> hello mom edit 
 i 'd never have this freaking picture in my head without you 
 edit 4 : a lot of people ask why i looked at the file 
 she had two <unk> of the hdd and i did n't know which one contained files so i had to check for it 
 also rip inbox 
 edit 5 : i just got home and i found a note which said we 're off <unk> 
 home in a few hours '' 
 i think everything 's all right and i 'll leave this thread now 
 thank you for all the replies both hate & amp support : as everyone knows school can get to us 
 every morning i struggle to wake up and get out of the house in time to catch my bus 
 this morning in particular was very different 
 i woke up and frantically checked my clock because i was late yesterday 
 through my groggy eyes all i saw was <unk> '' 
 typically i leave the house at <unk> so i jumped out of bed and quickly got dressed 
 i ran downstairs and out the door ignoring the fact that nobody in my family was awake yet 
 the fact that it was still dark did n't bother me because where i live the sun does n't rise until about <unk> on my way to school i noticed that there were not as many cars on the road as usual 
 i kept walking because i was just focusing on not being late 
 about 30 minutes later i reached the main road that lead to my high school 
 there were absolutely no people or cars anywhere 
 i thought i was dreaming or that the roads were shut down 
 i checked my phone to see if i was late or at least close to being late 
 it was <unk> am 
 i just kinda sat there hating myself for a minute then realized how much of a fucking idiot i was 
 i slowly turned around and walked home wondering if my family had woken up and saw me missing 
 luckily i made it back to my room without disturbing anyone 
 tl dr : i tried to go to school at 1 am 
 i 'm currently typing this in my world history class so thankfully i was n't late today 
 edit : apparently people ca n't read the multiple replies that i have left earlier about when the sun <unk> where i <unk> i had a surgery monday afternoon 
 <unk> are <unk> in my family and for some reason mine are particularly bad for a 23 year old 
 i elected to get the surgery now while under my mother 's insurance and to prevent it from getting worse 
 also this way my mom can take a few days off work to stay with me if i need anything 
 long story short they had to break 2 of my bones then <unk> them add some screws and pins file down the side of my foot then put the bones back into the sockets 
 i have 12 stitches and am on heavy <unk> drugs for pain 
 well i have a super high sex drive 
 i flicked the bean before surgery monday but it 's been 4 days 
 so i was horny and put on some porn 
 so i 'm going at it and getting really into it 
 a few attempts at finishing pass because of mild pain in my foot 
 i decide to play through the pain 
 bad 
 so i 'm finally about to come and i get ready straighten my legs 
 and i curl my toes as i climax as i always do 
 i curl my fucking toes 
 there 's a loud <unk> then my earsplitting scream of pure fucking agony 
 then i have about three seconds to think *oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck what did i <unk> before my mom comes barreling through my door 
 there i am covered in sweat vibrator in hand porn still on my tv and my mom staring at me in shock 
 she stammered are you ... uh oh 
 um 
 are you <unk> 
 uh ... '' she keeps glancing from me to the tv 
 i 'm yelling at her that i 'm fine just go i 'm fine <unk> 
 ** but she 's in shock i think because she 's still just glancing wide <unk> from half naked me to my tv back to me then my foot 
 so i throw something at her to wake her out of her confused daze to make her go 
 the only thing i had within reach 
 my vibrator 
 i threw my vibrator at my mother 
 she backed out of my room slowly 
 we have n't spoken since 
 edit : best proof i 've got : i have 12 stitches and i 'm not allowed to remove the bandage so that 's literally the best i can do 
 want more proof 
 go fuck yourself 
 also thanks for the gold <unk> a bit of background 
 ive been a piercer at my local tattoo parlor for several years and i have seen people do the <unk> things like eyebrow piercings <unk> piercings etc 
 ive also seen people do the most bizarre things like <unk> piercings and even anus piercings 
 ive only done 2 anus piercings in the 6 years i 've worked there 
 this guy comes in and says he wants his asshole pierced 
 i wanted to laugh but i put my professional face on and told him prices and answered his questions 
 we get to the piercing room and i tell him to pull down his pants and get on all <unk> up on the table 
 awkward already ... now im trying to get him to position his ass cheeks just right so i can get to his asshole 
 i finally get him to spread his ass cheeks apart and i get my needle 
 i can tell the guy is getting really nervous so i said dont tense up man just relax its only gon na take a second 
 just relax your anus do n't tense up or it will only be worse '' 
 i have my face right up to this guys anus and am about to pierce him and i say ok here we go '' 
 2 seconds after i get the needle in he <unk> shit all over my face 
 i start screaming like a motherfucker trying to wipe shit off my face and he starts trying to stand up but the needle is still in his ass and he screams bloody fucking murder 
 my boss runs in to find me wiping shit off my face and this poor fuck screaming and crying with his pants down 
 after i got cleaned up and we got the needle out his ass i said why did you shit on me '' 
 he just stood there obviously embarassed and he says you said to relax my anus 
 im so sorry '' 
 i will never pierce an anus ever again ... edit : holy shit this really did blow up 
 thanks for front page r/tifu this was back in high school where the setup for desks was in rows and columns less spread out 
 i have a bad habit of cracking my neck like someone would crack their knuckles 
 i know it probably is n't good for me but it helps relieve some <unk> for a little while so i do it anyway 
 over a week i began cracking my neck much to the dismay of the girl who sat behind me who cringed every time i would do it 
 one day i thought it would be funny to crack my neck then slump over as if i had just done one of those movie snap their neck and they die '' kind of things 
 one day my neck was feeling particularly stiff so as i go to crack my neck i turn around to look at her turn my head sharply to the right and lots of loud pops echo out into the classroom then i slump over and fall to the floor 
 the girl who sat behind me screamed bloody murder and freaks out the rest of the class 
 my teacher told me to stop cracking my neck after that 
 tl dr cracked my neck hit the <unk> few weeks ago my cousin was driving behind a ford galaxy on a rural road 
 as the cars went over a bump something fell from the wheel well of the car in front of her 
 she slammed on her brakes and got out of the car to see it was a tiny orange kitten 
 she never could find the owners and we assume he was a feral cat because i just had to put down my 17 year old orange cat she decided to let me have the kitten which we appropriately named <unk> due to his origin story 
 fast forward a couple of weeks 
 i just bought a samsung note 4. ever since i got the phone it has been doing weird things 
 namely the voice <unk> will randomly turn on and search for things while i am casually browsing reddit 
 i could n't figure out why and the staff at the store was of no help 
 a few minutes ago my kitten jumped on my lap while i was browsing twitter 
 so i said oh hi galaxy silly kitty '' 
 then my phone started a google search for silly kitty '' 
 hi galaxy '' is the phrase to start voice searches on samsung phones this is going to get very old very quickly 
 edit : as requested i hate all the <unk> long posts so i 'm going to keep this short 
 my little sister is 6 years old 
 the way i convinced her she was invisible was simple i took a picture of our couch before she was on it 
 then i called her and she came to me and i pretended i could n't see her 
 naturally she did n't believe me 
 so i told her to sit on the couch and i 'll take a picture 
 but here 's the <unk> : i showed her the old picture with no one on it 
 this was all it took to convince her 
 unfortunately people react differently to learning they are invisible 
 she was skipping around <unk> my other family members they were in on it too 
 it was pretty harmless until she started picking her nose and whatnot 
 we had to stop the gag when she began to undress 
 we gave her some honey and said it was <unk> <unk> potion and that was <unk> at a club last night and thought the mirror was a passage way into a new room went to go through it and saw someone coming towards me 
 tried to move out of the way and he moved the same way as me 
 then i looked up and apologised saw his glass was moving towards mine and proceeded to cheers him at this point realising it was my reflection ... edit : wow thanks 
 my first post and made it to the front page : d for those asking it was in <unk> days ago my girlfriend gave birth to our daughter 
 she had a mild infection so stayed in the special care baby unit for a few days 
 my girlfriend came home 3 days after the birth but we 've been going back to the hospital to see our daughter every day since 
 today our daughter was discharged from hospital so we went to pick her up 
 my girlfriend went to sign some papers in another room 
 i was super anxious and if i 'm honest i was not thinking straight 
 i ended up walking into the wrong hospital room the one next to where my daughter was 
 i was a complete and utter idiot 
 both hospital rooms looked exactly the same and this other baby was wearing a white <unk> and a yellow hat just like my daughter 
 my daughter had a wristband this baby did n't but i did n't realise it until later 
 i put the baby into the car seat and went to reception where my girlfriend was meeting me 
 while i was waiting my mum showed up with some stuff for my daughter 
 she asked to hold the baby and i said yes 
 she picked her up and said mike ... '' i could tell by the time of her voice that something was n't right so i started freaking out 
 she said the baby looked different but i insisted it was because the last time she saw her she was in an incubator 
 we continued to wait and my girlfriend arrived 
 my girlfriend looked at the baby and her face turned white 
 she said that it was not her baby 
 we rushed over to the desk and a nurse came with us to the ward to see what had happened 
 there was another couple there freaking out because their baby had gone 
 i was forced to admit my mistake 
 we picked up our daughter and headed home but now my girlfriend is being cold towards me and i feel like a crappy father for not recognising my own daughters face 
 wish me luck for the next 18 <unk> most of the other posts in this subreddit this did n't really happen today or this year but a few years ago when i was in high school 
 it was my senior year in high school and wrestling season had just ended 
 my aunt sent me a <unk> musical card -- the kind that plays part of a song when you open it -- which i thought would be fun to tape to the inside of my locker i shared this locker with a friend of mine so that it played every time i opened it 
 this one played simply the best '' by <unk> <unk> 
 it worked and i enjoyed it for a few days until the weekend which i spent in the mountains on a hiking trip with my dad and brother 
 when the trip was over i checked my phone and saw that i had a voicemail from my <unk> saying there was a bomb scare or something '' and that i had to talk to my principal on monday 
 that monday morning i met with my principal who explained to me that a night janitor heard a ticking noise coming from my locker apparently that 's what those cards start to do when they run low on battery and called the police who called the bomb squad who shut down the two major <unk> roads near my school and brought in a robot to inspect my locker 
 when the robot <unk> the locker they saw the device '' taped to the door some <unk> water bottles that happened to be on the top shelf that they thought must have been chemicals or explosives 
 they also thought they saw wires connecting everything together 
 eventually they saw the <unk> for what it was and shut down the operation but apparently it was a pretty elaborate <unk> 
 the article made the front page of the local newspaper the next day complete with a photo and everything 
 i never really got into trouble in high school and the principal knew who i was so after talking for a few minutes we agreed that the whole thing was an honest mistake and that there was no malicious intent although he said some parents were upset to the point that they wanted me suspended expelled or even to pursue some kind of legal action and he let me off the hook 
 in his own words : i 'm not exactly sure what i 'm supposed to lecture you about but i have to say something 
 i guess do n't ... uhh ... <unk> <unk> anymore '' 
 here 's the article tl dr : i taped part of a musical card to my locker door in high school which a janitor mistook for a bomb and subsequently got the police and bomb squad involved 
 edit : fixed some grammar and punctuation sorry using my phone 
 edit 2 : wow did not expect this to blow up like this ... especially for my first post 
 thanks guys 
 i 'm a middle school teacher and apparently i have a high number of aspiring basketball players in my classes 
 there 's always one or two students in every period who insist on shooting '' their trash into the garbage 
 daily 
 they also insist on missing ... daily 
 of course unless they are prompted they do n't pick up said garbage when it lands outside of the can 
 due to this i 've gotten pretty good at throwing down a stern you need to pick that up 
 **now 
 ** '' phrase in the <unk> of an eye 
 teaching a lesson across the room 
 bam 
 breaking up a fight between other students 
 bam 
 no trash goes <unk> 
 so today i 'm walking into the grocery store and pass two men off to my side 
 immediately my brain registers the motion of the jump shot and a paper bag landing far away from the trash can 
 teacher brain kicks in and i look at them very sternly and say you need to pick that up 
 **now 
 ** '' almost immediately upon saying this my brain realizes i am not in class these are not my students and those men were not about to simply leave their trash on the sidewalk 
 too late 
 now to add insult to injury i am a pretty young teacher who typically appears to be in her teens while <unk> day clothes as i was 
 these men were probably 10+ years my senior 
 one of the men quietly mumbled sorry while looking at the ground 
 the other somewhat frantically apologetic explains that he was just about to pick it up and *really <unk> was n't going to just leave it there 
 he promised 
 in the midst of my embarrassment and lack of a good explanation for their sudden scolding i just said good '' 
 and continued into the store 
 tl dr : i <unk> grown men outside the grocery store because they reminded me of my <unk> middle school students 
 *edit : * wowzers 
 i 'll try to respond more later today 
 since a couple people have inquired : i do n't mind the shooting of the trash 
 it 's the missing and leaving garbage on the floor that i do n't allow 
 we actually have a little score card going on the board for when they make a shot 
 the points are irrelevant and do n't really do anything but they have n't seemed to catch on to that yet 
 edit 2 : i finally understand rip inbox 
 also death threats 
 seriously 
 ya 'll need a chill pill 
 or detention 
 gold 
 that 's awesome : d sup pals 
 the <unk> to this fuck up happened about last week with the execution of it happening just a few days ago but since it <unk> both the weekday rules i had to bite my tongue and wait 
 anyways down to brass <unk> i 've been working odd hours to meet deadlines recently plus <unk> a few parties for some side scratch basically my sleep schedule has been completely fucked for the past couple months 
 naturally my girlfriend who sleeps like a normal human being for the most part started getting a little bummed out recently on account that we are living on two different schedules 
 so about 3 weeks ago she started trying to wake me up when she felt my 6 hour quota had been met to give us a few hours of quality time together before she went to bed 
 very fair but i 'm also very deep sleeper so she was very frustrated that she only got me out of bed a handful of times with the majority of those <unk> of me <unk> around the apartment like a husk with only one eye open for the first hour of consciousness 
 we had a talk about it and i assured her that this would n't be forever and i joked that if she really wanted to get me up maybe she should blow me into awareness 
 we laughed made up and the week pushed on 
 fast forward to thursday night i 'm in the strong embrace of an epic sleep <unk> through the alternate reality that is my <unk> when i feel this beautiful warming sensation <unk> from my <unk> <unk> my whole body and i was so content so happy so relaxed until it was all shattered by a high pitched scream 
 a mixture of anger complete horror and utter disbelief which manifested itself into the words what the fuck '' 
 simultaneously of a sudden my face is now being splashed with some <unk> warm mystery liquid and a slightly <unk> liquid is gently raining down everywhere 
 i snap awake and realize ... i just pissed in my girlfriends mouth she spit that mouthful of piss in my face and i 'm now continuing to rain down a morning or in this case evening wood <unk> <unk> cascade of piss 
 fuck 
 tl dr : asked my girlfriend to wake up with a blowjob and instead of waking up to a glorious orgasm i filled her mouth with enough piss to make bear grylls flinch 
 edit : thanks for the gold <unk> 
 i ca n't wait to tell my lady all the new reddit perks pissing in her mouth just <unk> me 
 perfect timing because just last night before we went out she told me i spend too much time browsing on here i do .so here i am nice sunday morning taking a dump and browsing reddit of course 
 i finish up put down the phone stand up only to realize both my legs are completely numb and i <unk> into the towel rack ... happy sunday everyone 
 this has actually been happening for 8+ years 
 since i was a kid my mom would always tell me how healthy tea was for you and how much <unk> it had in it 
 well i took that <unk> literally 
 in order to get all them goodnesses i would rip open the tea pack and pour in all of the <unk> and drink them 
 this would result in me coughing out my lungs and a dry throat 
 i thought oh well its worth it for all those goodnesses '' 
 until today when i was drinking tea at my girlfriends house and both her and her parents saw me and proceeded to laugh their <unk> off 
 they then took a couple pictures of me had them processed and hung 
 my mom now wants some <unk> of those pictures as well 
 we 're driving to walmart right now to pick them up 
 tl dr : tl dr been <unk> incorrectly for 8+ years **edit** : we got the pictures 
 i look like a fool they took several and had them <unk> made so that you could see my fu unfold 
 **edit** # 2 : i <unk> <unk> wrong in the title lol <unk> an <unk> **edit** : # 3 : wow this <unk> up 
 thanks so my two buddies and i dropped acid in my empty house 
 we ordered pizza for dinner since we could n't go anywhere 
 time passes by and we realize it 's probably time to get our money together 
 the three of us go out to the main foyer to count money 
 my one friend asks what do you got b '' 
 and since i recently broke a <unk> i had a bunch of cash in my wallet so i started <unk> it out 
 he asks again what do you got b '' 
 this time more of a <unk> 
 i start <unk> it rain with my money and now my two friends are chanting what do you got b 
 what do you got 
 what do you got b 
 what do you got 
 im now making it rain and dancing while taking my shirt off like its a dance circle 
 we are having such a good time <unk> laughing that other friends follow suit one taking his shirt off both emptying the contents of their <unk> on the floor all three of us chanting what do you got b 
 what do you got '' 
 and dancing in front of the front door totally forgetting what we were supposed to be doing when all of a sudden there is a pound on the door 
 wham wham wham 
 all of the color drains from our faces and turns to <unk> laughter 
 we open the door the three of us shirtless with money and cards and shirts all over the floor scrambling to find $ 25 
 sent that pizza guy back with a nice <unk> work as a loans officer in a rural branch of a small canadian bank 
 sorry for your suddenly-sodden panties ladies 
 definitely not my dream career as a kid – the fisher price <unk> is fun 
 <unk> is not a big seller – but when i lost my job selling computers in my early 20s i got this job and it stuck like soiled underwear 
 i’m okay at it and i’m a <unk> <unk> to many of the staff but i’m definitely a goofy round peg in a <unk> square hole which is what ultimately led to my wtf shitstorm 
 if i have to work in an office i’m gon na have a bit of fun 
 i love thinkgeek 
 in my office i have a <unk> the <unk> letter opener a <unk> <unk> <unk> clock and a magnetic <unk> world <unk> among other things purchased there and as fate would have it this past christmas in my stocking i discovered that my kids bought me an annoy-a-tron it’s a small device that makes <unk> short faint noises at totally random <unk> and can run for 3 months on a watch battery designed to be hidden to drive someone <unk> bonkers 
 here’s the description from <unk> site : <unk> annoy-a-tron will do its part to drive your co-workers slowly mad with its short and seemingly random <unk> 
 and when someone does locate the annoy-a-tron they 're not going to know what it is - which is almost as much fun as watching them search for it 
 <unk> ... <unk> and hilarity will ensue 
 right 
 as it turns out much less than zero 
 i came in early on a monday and placed it behind a metal poster frame hanging on the wall in the office of one of my co-workers 
 i flipped the on switch and went <unk> about my day waiting for a reaction and to share a few chuckles 
 monday came and went 
 nothing 
 tuesday nothing 
 wednesday and thursday not a peep 
 at that point i figured it was broken 
 frankly i kinda forgot about it 
 i had friday off and i suppose i would’ve checked it when i got back the following week 
 monday comes <unk> out of the weekend like a <unk> corpse 
 as soon as everyone arrives the manager calls all 16 of us into her office for an <unk> conference call 
 i end up standing at the back of the group near the office door 
 she <unk> in and our district vp announces herself through the little speaker 
 i stifle a <unk> 
 the vp then introduces our <unk> head of security 
 my brow furrows 
 this is unusual 
 <unk> now ” the vp says <unk> of you know about the device that was found at your branch last <unk> <unk> 
 what the hell 
 what kind of device could they possibly be talking -- * *oh holy jesus fuck nuggets 
 * <unk> it was found it on thursday nobody knew what it was so it was brought to the branch manager who then sent pictures of the device to <unk> <unk> 
 * <unk> i <unk> the images to our head of security 
 he couldn’t identify it but guessed it might be a listening device so he sent the pictures to the <unk> corporate crimes <unk> *oh fuck me 
 * <unk> well as the canadian security intelligence services in <unk> 
 they suspected it could potentially be a <unk> <unk> grand fucking canyon of fuck 
 * <unk> we closed the branch told all staff to stay home and hired a team of <unk> to search every square inch of the building over the weekend for any additional <unk> if i had sat down ahead of time to brainstorm a <unk> scenario i wouldn’t have even come close to this epic corporate <unk> 
 i had no choice 
 i took a shaky breath <unk> my nerve clenched my ass cheeks tight and tried to say <unk> <unk> but choked out a pubescent squeak instead 
 i cleared my throat interrupted the conference call in that stuffy room full of my coworkers and spoke up telling them it’s a harmless <unk> taking responsibility and apologizing profusely 
 the room was dead quiet 
 the vp slowly says thank you for speaking up they’ll stop the investigation and the call ends 
 everyone files out 
 i ask the manager if she wants me to stay but she says she can’t talk to me right now 
 she doesn’t talk to me for three weeks 
 i found out later that she was in her car with the device on the passenger seat when she got the call that it might be a bomb 
 she apparently burst into tears and nearly drove into a ditch 
 the district vp threw a fit and despite my <unk> <unk> work record she tried really really hard to have me fired 
 ultimately a senior <unk> in the company understood my benign intent and <unk> her 
 luckily they didn’t charge me the $ <unk> in lost business staff <unk> and other miscellaneous costs 
 no i don’t know why my manager didn’t just ask her staff if anyone knew about it instead of sending a fucking urgent memo to the entire fucking universe 
 my office is full of a lot of things but common sense isn’t one of them 
 **tl dr : thinkgeek + corporate <unk> = fail 
 ** **edit : ** so *this* is what it 's like to be the bottom in an upvoted reddit relationship 
 my god ... it 's full of <unk> 
 some <unk> : * i do n't work for thinkgeek 
 i doubt they 'd be allowed to use the term suddenly-sodden panties '' in their attempts at viral marketing 
 * my post is as accurate as i remember it happened a few months ago 
 i can only relate what was told to us during the conference call about the theories about the device and the <unk> of the authorities but i ca n't and wont verify if that 's what they actually did 
 i 'm not going to poke that particular dog with a <unk> stick 
 * although my post <unk> on my <unk> about the overreaction to my prank there 's a reason i posted this in tifu after i found out this subreddit exists 
 'cause i fucked up 
 as i mentioned somewhere in the comment <unk> below had i given a <unk> of thought to the type of <unk> industry i work in i never would 've placed the annoy-a-tron at my work at all 
 there would 've been no overreaction to have if i had n't done this to begin with 
 and my office pranking days are dead and buried - my wife will make damn sure of that 
 if i even <unk> about trying something like this again my wife will shove an annoy-a-tron so far up my ass that i 'd have <unk> punk <unk> <unk> actually happened less than 5 minutes ago 
 my daughter was born last week 10 weeks early 
 my wife and i have settled into a routine of visiting the <unk> every morning 
 because i already work remotely i just use the wifi at the hospital 
 between lack of sleep and too much reddit i 'm starting to get a little <unk> brained 
 while my wife was reading some children 's book to our daughter i hear her say you like that '' 
 without thinking i finish the sentence with you fucking retard '' 
 even the nurse in the room felt the look of death 
 posted this 3 days ago 
 was removed due to rules 
 reposting now that it 's the weekend 
 enjoy 
 this did not happen today 
 and i 'm a <unk> so i do n't care if you have a problem with it 
 my housemate often has his girlfriend over and she 's kind of <unk> during sex 
 not in an annoying way i just hear her a lot 
 he has apologized to me about this repeatedly 
 i never really get bothered by it but a few weeks ago we had a bright idea to show her what it 's like to listen to another couple have sex 
 first i had him bring up '' with his girlfriend the fact that my girlfriend and i are into some seriously kinky shit and it 's a little bit disturbing to <unk> us 
 then i had my girlfriend agree to play along in the shenanigans 
 so my girl comes over at night claire and my housemate 's girl jess is already there 
 i hear jess and my housemate talking softly in their room so it was time for the show to start 
 my girl and i start talking a little louder than normal and we essentially <unk> this scene she 's a great voice <unk> 
 then the real fun begins 
 i start saying some shit like yeah spank me spank me like a baby '' and shit 
 she slaps my ass really loud a few times 
 i can hear jess from the other room saying oh my god ... '' really softly 
 i know my housemate will keep a straight face his acting is like kevin <unk> 
 claire then says some shit like mmmm i always loved it when you used to fart on my neck 
 will you do it again '' 
 and i 'm like i 'll give it a shot babe '' 
 then i just make <unk> sounds for about 15 seconds then tell her i 'll get to that later 
 things heat up we say a few more ridiculous phrases i drop the obligatory south park reference oh you do that just like my father ... '' etc 
 but then we took it too far 
 jess is in the other room obviously <unk> by our <unk> and she keeps whispering to my housemate omg 
 listen 
 are they serious '' 
 and laughing and stuff 
 then i get a real bright idea and say oh yeah oh yeah baby stop stop '' 
 claire goes what '' 
 and i say pour some of that candle wax all over my asshole '' 
 claire almost loses it but <unk> 
 we remain silent for about 5 seconds 
 jess is utterly silent 
 then i start <unk> at the top of my lungs super <unk> as though i 'm in severe pain 
 i hear jess say what the fuck '' 
 and then she and my housemate start arguing 
 he tries to calm her down and tells her it was a joke but she gets furious that we pranked her and storms out 
 now <unk> in a fight 
 and she thinks i am an <unk> 
 **tl dr : never pour candle wax on your anus** edit : spelling -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- edit 2 : jess and housemate are fine 
 jess is slightly <unk> that she got pranked and that the pranking was a <unk> on her <unk> sex noises 
 i understand why she is not happy with me and i have apologized 
 claire is <unk> that people on reddit think she 's a keeper 
 whoever narrated thank you 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- edit 3 : thank you for the gold to both <unk> this fu happened this morning 
 university resumed this week after winter break and i started a new course together with a friend 
 in this course we were going to use matlab to calculate some <unk> stuff so the first lecture was an introduction to matlab for those that had not yet worked with it 
 my friend and i had used matlab before so we were n't really paying attention as it was still very basic stuff being explained 
 so my friend was <unk> matlab and excel in a way that he could both see the data and matlab or easily switch between the two 
 in order to do this he googled the multiple desktop feature for <unk> 
 so he was busy for a few minutes and when he finished i looked over to see his final arrangement 
 while i checked out his screen setup he turns to me and went like this i did n't expect that so i burst out laughing and kinda tried to play it off as a cough while <unk> my face in my hands 
 after i calmed myself down i looked up face red and tears still in my eyes 
 at this point the prof asked me if something was funny 
 i responded by saying no and apologizing 
 he did n't want any of that though because his next sentence was : get out i do n't want to see you in my class again '' 
 after he said that he left the room for a brief moment while i shut down my computer 
 he returned and repeated that my friend and i should leave 
 so we packed our things and left the room while he gave us a grumpy glare 
 i do n't know why he was so harsh maybe he thought we were laughing at him because of his thick accent or he just did n't like that we did n't pay any attention to his matlab introduction 
 anyway i guess we have wednesday morning off now ... tl dr : friend approved of his new desktop setup - professor did n't though 
 update : i just talked to the professor 
 the reason he kicked me out is because he finds it offensive when people laugh or behave <unk> during his lectures 
 i told him that i find it too harsh to not even warn someone before kicking him out especially considering there are other lectures that are much more relaxed where even the professors joke around from time to time 
 in the end we both apologized and i think both parties had more understanding of the other after the talk 
 i 'm not gon na take this course this semester though 
 maybe next <unk> i was in 10th grade i had a really close friend who was a girl i was head over heels for this girl would hang out non-stop text non-stop and all around i wanted to date her more than anything at the time 
 i also had no testicles at the time and never had the courage to ask her 
 at the end of 10th grade we had these <unk> and the custom was to get people to sign it and they would leave stuff like have a great summer '' nice to have known you '' etc 
 when i asked her to sign it she put in the following 
 here i am almost a junior in college and i found my yearbook by accident while looking for something else and just read this.. pondering life 
 edit : i did n't expect this to blow up like this 
 i 'm currently out at the moment and typing this from my phone 
 i will call her when i get home which is like 2 hours from now 
 thanks for the people who responded positively 
 edit2 : i 'm going to text her i really do n't want to make another cringey moment in my life and have an extremely awkward phone conversation 
 i 'll update soon 
 edit3 : i texted her found her number through mutual friends on facebook she changed it 
 i will post the conversation after i edit her number out 
 5 minutes 
 edit4 : edit5 : sorry for not calling in the text she mentioned she cried from 3 pm till 12 am and hearing that over the phone is just too awkward glad i did n't call 
 thank you for the people who <unk> me into this i needed it 
 edit6 : yeah i realized blocking out the name alexis was pointless so i didnt for the last 2 pictures 
 i blocked out mine though it 's very uncommon name 
 <unk> : i understand the skepticism if theres a <unk> way to prove it i will that does n't <unk> our identities 
 i just want to say i would n't do this for fictional points on a forum the past couple of hours have been a very weird rollercoaster 
 <unk> : i do have a girlfriend getting coffee with someone is n't cheating 
 i 'm not going to fuck her on the coffee machine 
 <unk> : i do n't know how somebody was able to edit my title on my first <unk> but this is not a <unk> <unk> book '' 
 here 's more pictures 
 <unk> : i gave her the link to this thread she has never heard of reddit and thinks it 's insane that the original picture has <unk> views 
 <unk> : probably the last edit i will make to this i want to answer everyones major questions 
 <unk> college do you go <unk> '' 
 # # # the ohio state university 
 <unk> your girlfriend know 
 ** '' yes both of them know and have access to this page 
 **are you lying 
 ** '' it 's very hard to prove without giving up my identity and even then i will receive <unk> 
 i can assure you this was n't done for fake fictional forum points but believe what you like 
 if there is a way to prove it i would 
 <unk> are the rest of the pictures 
 ** '' <unk> did n't you read it 
 ** '' i was more <unk> with getting as many <unk> as i could it was a good self esteem boost i did n't come home and read it 
 i probably put it down somewhere and it got moved around for years 
 **do you have any interest in her 
 ** '' i do n't know shes a stranger to me at the moment 
 good night i 'll try to keep people updated if anyone is interested 
 <unk> <unk> op she loves you** '' i honestly do n't even know who that <unk> at all i do n't even remember her <unk> : so sorry for the very late update i 'm drowning in school work at the moment but here is how the coffee <unk> not date went great 
 we sat around talked about old times added each other on the newer social <unk> <unk> snapchat etc and talked about past and current relationships before you ask she 's single and before you ask i 'm not interested in her 
 i genuinely came in thinking i was going to be but i 'm just not and for some reason tried because i was so sure i was but it turns out i 'm not not even slightly 
 she 's <unk> to my university next year and we 'll most likely keep in touch pretty heavily but that 's as far as it 's going 
 i know most of you wanted a love story but i do n't know she felt like a stranger more than anything 
 we will definitely <unk> our friendship and move on 
 my girlfriend which most of you asked about was way more understanding than i expected of course she was skeptical and slightly upset and i 'm pretty much enslaved for the next month so.. theirs that 
 i will definitely stay with her 
 above all i genuinely want to thank the people who abused the hell out of my inbox <unk> me to contact her 
 this started as a tifu i expected around 10 comments and expected it to get buried in the <unk> history but it really helped me <unk> with someone and the fact it stayed up for so long is honestly amazing 
 thank you so much 
 <unk> bare with me i 'm going on zero hours of sleep about 20 beers and a bad hangover 
 plus i 'm writing this on my phone because well ... my fucking house burned down with everything in it 
 last night halloween my girlfriend who i live with and myself decided to have a halloween party it 's saturday and we normally get fucked up on saturday anyways so why not drink and dress up 
 we have about <unk> people over at our 2 bedroom place and about half were dressed including my girlfriend and my self 
 i was dressed as mario and one of my buddy 's dressed as bowzer 
 well 4 of us start playing some bp to get our drink on and have a good time 
 we get a couple games in and the night seems like it 's gon na be a good and long one 
 well it was my turn up on the bp table 
 myself and a good buddy of mine are on a team vs my girlfriend and bowzer 
 before i go any further i have a house rule that i made up to stop people from throwing air balls 
 if the opponent throws and over shoots the table without hitting anything you can catch it and instantly throw it and if it hits the person that air balled in the face that team has to pull a cup from their side 
 so bowzer throws and air balls and instantly catch it and throw a fast ball as hard as i can towards his face 
 in his drunken <unk> he ducks by throwing his ass backwards which in turn <unk> the side table with 2 lit halloween candles 
 the candles flew around 5 feet straight towards our curtains that my girlfriends grandmother made us 
 i saw everything in slow motion 
 it took for ever it seemed for the candles to land 
 my butthole puckered so fast i 'm surprised it did n't whistle 
 then in less than a second the entire curtain is in <unk> 
 panic mode 
 i scream he screams my girlfriend screams everyone screams 
 i rush to get anything that can hold water and start filling it up 
 it does n't help my sink is over flowing with dishes already 
 i get one pot of water about half way filled and i can tell from the commotion from the other room that things are getting worse and the pot of water is n't going to help 
 i take it in the living room and way and dump it on the curtains that have already been pulled down onto the floor 
 it was at this point i realized that i 've been living in this house for 8 months and never bought a fire extinguisher 
 the house is super old and i 'm an army vet so i should know better than to take a chance and not have one we try <unk> out the curtains but it had all ready reached the ceiling before they were pulled down 
 at that point i grabbed my dog and usher the remaining people out of the house and call 911. it 's pouring outside so all of us are standing out in the rain waiting on help as we watch my living room glow like a <unk> 
 help arrived working 5 or so minutes of calling them probably about <unk> minutes from the whole thing starting 
 the fire <unk> save the back half of the house but the living room and the dining room are fucked 
 will update with a picture later when i head back to the house after getting some sleep 
 tl dr <unk> a ball at <unk> turned my house into a jack o lantern 
 thanks for the tl dr <unk> last wednesday the girl of my dreams asked me to go to prom with her 
 i readily accepted and that was that 
 the only problem 
 i 'm a girl as well 
 my parents thought that i was straight so i decided to tell them that i was bi that day to get it over with 
 so i go to my mom and tell her that i need to get a prom dress this year 
 where i go to school only seniors can go to prom unless you are asked by one 
 as a junior my mom automatically wanted to know which hot guy asked me 
 when i told her who it was let 's call her stephanie my mom had an ... .. interesting reaction 
 she told me that it was n't funny to make fun of lesbians 
 they are people too and deserve respect 
 she does n't care if i go to prom or not but i have to be respectful of others 
 this led to a mildly awkward <unk> conversation in which i tried to convince her that i was in fact a bisexual **tl dr i forgot it was april fool 's day edit : wow i left for school came back and this blew up 
 thanks for the gold and the support : for those wondering yes stephanie was serious 
 she wanted <unk> fool 's to be her response if i turned out to be straight 
 this happened about an hour ago 
 i had just gotten the kids to bed and was <unk> by taking a piss while talking to my wife with the bathroom door open 
 i was distracted from the conversation when i noticed that there was a spider hanging down directly over the toilet bowl <unk> closer and closer to all that i hold <unk> 
 naturaly i couldnt just stop <unk> so i did the next best thing and tried to knock the little fucker down with my stream of pee 
 unfortunately the spider realized that i had <unk> lock and started to retreat back up the web and when i tried to lead the target that is what your are suppose to do in such situations i missed and pissed all over the <unk> but in the bowl 
 right about this time my wife rounds the corner into the bathroom to <unk> as to why i was not responding to her <unk> as to whether or not i paid the cable bill 
 of course from her <unk> she couldnt see the spider and thought that i was just pissing all over the walls for the sport of it 
 so last night at <unk> john 's we get a call from some lady who 's online order apparently did n't come through for 45 mins 
 we get the order as she 's calling but she does n't believe us and is all pissed off 
 about half an hour later we get a a prank call from some kid who asked if our blowjobs are freaky fast '' - 'cause that 's funny right 
 my coworker suggested we text the kid just to mess with him so i take her phone get the number type and send the message are your blowjobs freaky fast '' 
 just to kind of mock him 
 it was n't even that funny but we were bored so whatever 
 then maybe 10 minutes later we get a call from the first lady and i realize i typed the wrong number in it was still up on our first phone screen 
 apparently she was so offended even after it was explained to her that she needed to talk to our general manager the next day 
 i come in the next morning and find out me the coworker and manager are all getting fired 
 and it 's completely my <unk> actually happened today and i 'm still in the library 
 every tuesday and thursday i have 8am classes 
 naturally i 'm pretty tired afterwards and sleep in my favourite library on campus for a few hours before my next lecture 
 i always set an alarm on my phone put in some headphones and get my snooze on 
 today at around 11:30 a girl randomly poked me awake and told me that my phone has constantly been ringing 
 this is when i came to the awful embarrassing realization that for some reason when my phone rings to wake me up it <unk> my headphones and just rings 
 not sure it 's some weird <unk> thing that happens with these new earbuds i 'm using 
 i do n't realize it 's ringing like this because i sleep with my phone next to me on the desk and expect the alarm to be pretty loud 
 now this would n't be such a big deal if my phone only rang once maybe twice max three times 
 but no i 'm an awful snooze button lover 
 i had wanted to wake up at 10 but have been <unk> every 9 mins wtf apple 
 since 10 all the way to <unk> what makes it even worse is that i 've been sleeping in this library every tuesday and thursday for the past month and a bit since this term started 
 oops 
 i 'm sorry for interrupting your studying 
 edit 1 : i worked till <unk> the night before and had to be up at 6am for my 8am 
 i 'm usually not this bad 
 have mercy on my uni student soul 
 edit 2 : i 'm now aware that the <unk> thing is not because of apple thanks <unk> peeps 
 : edit 3 : i 'm a commuter 
 no dorm on campus for me 
 edit 4 : seems like a lot of people who were there are redditors 
 if you see me please let me apologize in person 
 especially if you 're at that library often on those days 
 i usually wear a bright red jacket 
 maybe we can even be study buddies 
 i obviously need the <unk> 
 i promise i wo n't sleep with my headphones in when we 're supposed to be studying 
 i met a guy online and we have been talking/snapping/texting for about two weeks 
 our first date was supposed to be friday but he really wanted to meet me so i agreed to meet him at his house once i got off work at midnight 
 i pull up to his house and his mother i was n't aware that he lived with her came out and told me that i should n't be showing up at her house to <unk> with her son in the middle of the night 
 as i was turning to leave he comes out and apologizes for her behavior and tells me that she 's just looking out for him 
 he then says that they had had quite a few drinks 
 as he was explaining that she acts insane when she 's drunk not to mind her he suddenly throws up all over me 
 i had to drive home covered in puke 
 edit : wow front page 
 i did n't realize my massive fuck up was that massive 
 also i have learned my lesson 
 no i did not go to his house with even the intention of going inside 
 it was supposed to be talking for a bit and then i go home 
 thanks for all the concern but i do understand how stupid of a move i made 
 the vomit taught me a lesson 
 edit : gold 
 thanks 
 good to know my awful experience has made a lot of you laugh 
 i am laughing with you 
 : so i 'd been dating this girl for about 3 months most saturdays she would stay over but leave on the sunday morning as sunday was 'gaming sundays i know i 'm very cool she was always pretty cool with it and did n't mind 
 she stayed over everything was normal the morning came and she left 
 before i settled into my gaming session i checked facebook first 
 the first thing to pop up was people wishing her happy birthday 
 yep 
 it was her birthday and i 'd sent her home so i could play video games 
 i 've never apologised so much in my entire life 
 tldr i was n't aware it was my girlfriends birthday sent her home so i could play games 
 edit : thanks for the gold stranger i 'm glad you liked my tale - edit : people are getting pretty mad about this ... i saw my gf usually about <unk> days a week what 's wrong with 1 day a week for me 
 - edit : because so many people are asking i 'm 21 **the plan : ** tell a starbucks barista that my name is spartacus 
 when my drink order arrives and the barista says coffee for spartacus 
 claim boldy that i 'm spartacus 
 then watch and laugh when everyone else joins with cries of i 'm spartacus 
 we all have a good laugh for a couple of minutes and i 'm <unk> as a comic genius 
 **the reality : ** i told a starbucks barista that my name was spartacus 
 when my drink order arrived the barista said coffee for spartacus 
 i claimed boldy that i was spartacus 
 no-one else joined in with cries of i 'm spartacus 
 i <unk> grabbed my drink and trudged the long long walk upstairs 
 my mother to whom i had explained the whole plan and who thought the idea was below average went and sat at a different table 
 tl dr 
 i am an <unk> man 
 **update** um thanks for all the replies 
 having <unk> them all in great detail in a spreadsheet it seems that 23 % of respondents would have joined in with my crap attempt at a joke 35 % of respondents want my mother 's contact details because she 's awesome and <unk> % of people think i 'm autistic and need immediate medical help 
 have a great day everyone and thanks to the stranger for the gold.this happened over the weekend 
 the wife and i got hitched about a month ago but have been together for 6 years 
 we have been enjoying each other’s *ahem* company quite a bit since we got married 
 something about saying ‘i <unk> really got the freak juices a flowing if you catch my drift 
 so aunt flow was supposed to visit last week but never showed up 
 that’s cool we just got married and then we immediately moved and did n't really get a chance for a honeymoon 
 stress can delay mother nature for a few days 
 it has happened with her before… but then my wife got one morning and spewed all over the bathroom 
 as she kissed the porcelain god a wave of panic <unk> my being 
 i a man child of 26 years could possibly have <unk> another human being ... my entire adolescence flashed before my eyes 
 <unk> of little league games late nights playing halo ninja turtle themed birthday parties and drunken college shenanigans danced around in my head 
 i then pictured myself sitting at the kitchen table surrounded by dirty diapers while doing taxes 
 *i have to be a grown up <unk> <unk> 
 so my wife is freaking out a bit but being the amazing husband i am i tell her to lie lay 
 down and i head up to the store and grab her a pregnancy test 
 i get to the local <unk> and start making my way down the <unk> trying to find a plastic stick for my wife to pee on 
 as i am looking i pass through the toy aisle with all the goofy crappy cheap toys they sell at drug stores 
 you know the cap guns the <unk> balls that don’t bounce the <unk> that stuff 
 looking over these toys i am crippled again with <unk> from my youth 
 i remembered going up to eckerd before they became <unk> whatever i still call them eckerd to this day and begging my mom for an awesome beast wars <unk> to play with 
 i smiled as i looked at this <unk> transformers that don’t turn into <unk> and raptors but are still pretty sweet in their own right 
 it was right there that i decided that i need to get in some last minute youth stuff in order to come to terms with my fate 
 but what on earth could make me feel like a kid again 
 oh shit they have candy 
 sweet sweet candy 
 i merrily skipped to the candy aisle and began <unk> their selection 
 i was determined to buy it all 
 <unk> snickers mr. <unk> <unk> reese’s pronounced <unk> not <unk> for those of you who are illiterate <unk> were all <unk> into my arms as i began to beam with joy 
 candy fucking rocks and i’m going to eat it all and no one will tell me otherwise because i’m an adult but i don’t want to be so i’m buying candy to feel young again 
 i was about to head to the checkout when i noticed a treat that i had not even thought of since i was a young lad : fun dip 
 for those who don’t know this is fun dip i remember getting hopped up on that crap before my mother would dump me off at my <unk> when she had to go out somewhere and couldn’t take me 
 then i remembered the <unk> tasty <unk> stick and how you use your own spit to scoop out the sugar from the separate pouch 
 i actually said “oh hell <unk> out loud grabbed 3 fun dip packs and made my way to the counter 
 after paying for the candy and then remembering why i went there in the first place i grabbed a pregnancy test and drove home 
 my wife was in bed looking <unk> and pale and i rushed in with the test and showed her my grocery bag filled with delicious treats <unk> with pride as if i were a child showing someone my candy haul from halloween 
 she was not as amused as i was but doesn’t matter have candy 
 i open up a reese’s and dig in as my wife <unk> to the toilet to pee 
 as i wait for her i continue my <unk> <unk> for <unk> and stuff my face with sugary treats 
 i finish off my reese’s and decide now is the time to dip into some fun 
 i grab a pack and begin to furiously suck off the candy stick in a manner that would make <unk> haze jealous 
 when it is good and <unk> i jam the stick it into the sugar to coat all the <unk> areas that it may come in contact with throw that bad boy back in my mouth and accept the sugary scratchy goodness on my tongue 
 lather rinse repeat 
 wife comes out of the bathroom goes towards the bed and <unk> the pregnancy test on her nightstand without the cap gross woman you just peed on that and tells me it is time to wait 
 me being the <unk> and <unk> husband that i am notice something off about my wife 
 i ask her if everything is alright and she starts to cry 
 i walk over to her as she sits on our bed put my fun dip down and give her a hug 
 she is scared 
 of course she is she’s about to grow a baby carry it around for 9 months then force it out of her body as it <unk> her in half 
 i’d be scared too 
 we certainly haven’t planned for this but we decide no matter what happens we will keep the baby and move forward 
 i try to cheer her up and i offer her some fun dip because i’m an amazing and considerate husband and we make out on the <unk> so why wouldn’t she want some 
 she <unk> and <unk> so i try and make her laugh by maintaining eye contact and reaching for the pack and saying <unk> you <unk> 
 it’s <unk> 
 i then jam the stick into the sugar and plunge it into my mouth 
 this is where i fucked up 
 her eyes grow wide and i immediately notice that this scoop of sugar tastes ... <unk> and colder than it normally does ... i pull the stick out of my mouth and to my horror am looking at a pregnancy test covered in green sugar <unk> 
 my mouth agape i look at the nightstand and see the fun dip stick sitting by its <unk> taunting me like the little bitch that it is glistening from the <unk> job i had given it earlier 
 my bottom lip <unk> as a faint <unk> escapes from my soul and out my mouth 
 cue hysterical laughter from my wife as i scream like a 5 year old girl that just saw a spider and run to the bathroom to vomit all the sugar and chocolate that i had <unk> not even 10 minutes earlier 
 she couldn’t stop laughing 
 test ended up being negative she tried another one that was n't <unk> '' 
 she went to the urgent care down the road when she would n't stop throwing up and it turned out she had food poisoning 
 she got her period later that day 
 tl : dr : pregnancy scare leads to <unk> crisis that ends with me eating pee 
 <unk> to fix the <unk> and to clear up the ending 
 user cyae1 narrated my fuck up i am incredibly grateful 
 thanks for all the kind words and encouragement from everyone you guys have really brightened my <unk> did n't happen today it happened about 15 years <unk> it 's still stuck with me all this time 
 i was about 10 years old hanging out with my friend in my room doing whatever it is 10 year olds do 
 we were listening to music when my little brother knocked on the door 
 me being the mean big sister ignored him turned the music up and pretended like we were having a party that he could n't come to 
 i imagine that made him feel crappy and he went back downstairs 
 fast forward to a few minutes later and my mom knocks on the door kind of angry with me 
 she tells me to come downstairs to see what my little brother did for me 
 i go downstairs and find a clue written by him in his little 6 year old handwriting 
 it lead me to another clue and another clue 
 the last clue said to look in the other room for my valentine '' and there he was sitting on the bed 
 he gave me a hug 
 i felt awful 
 still do to this day when i think about it 
 tl dr : ignored my 6 year old brother knocking on my bedroom door turns out he had put a lot of work into making a valentine 's treasure <unk> for me that ended with him as my valentine '' and giving me a hug 
 cue the awful <unk> drove my wife 's car a 2001 hyundai accent to the bus station today and after work as i pulled into the driveway i had a <unk> brain fart 
 i left the car in neutral as always however i failed to set the <unk> 
 my driveway is an inclined gravel carport roughly <unk> car lengths long 
 it has a waist high brick wall on the drivers side getting higher as you go down the driveway and a carport overhead supported by steel <unk> one of which comes out the top of said wall 
 i stepped out the drivers door and took a step away from the car 
 it was my neighbour across the street that alerted me to the problem 
 he must have seen it start to move so he shouted 
 i jumped towards the drivers seat to hit the brake pedal with my foot 
 this is what followed : i was hit by the still open drivers door and knocked to the ground then dragged downhill 
 the door hit the steel beam of the carport with my hand/wrist caught between 
 my hips were slammed between the door and the bricks and my knees were dragged along the gravel 
 my right ankle was run over by the front wheel of the car 
 i was left in a heap and the car rolled i 've the street and into my neighbours yard 
 it stopped short of his <unk> lucky 
 and sat on his front lawn 
 i am fine with only some cuts a sprained ankle and a lot of bruises on my hips legs and arms 
 plus some gravel rash of course 
 the car has a ruined drivers door which i will now need to replace 
 my pride ... yeah that 's gone 
 i think the worst part is how my wife is taking it all 
 shes not stopped picking fun at me since it happened 
 an example : her : you 're an idiot '' 
 me : i am aware '' 
 her : no you 're not a were you 're an idiot all the time '' 
 so there you have it 
 tl dr i ran over myself with my wife 's car and i doubt i 'll ever live it down 
 edit : for everyone telling me to dump my wife i think there 's some context missing 
 i 'm from australia and it is very common to rib each other on a regular basis 
 if i had been seriously hurt she would only have been 100 % supportive and helpful 
 i was n't so the correct response is to laugh at me for it 
 please stop berating my wife i put those lines in there because i thought they were funny and clever 
 it 's possible you missed the joke being the <unk> animal humour for everyone asking for photos i 'll be posting some later this morning 
 edit 2 : album here : note the damage to the door and the wall i was dragged down 
 the yard you can see is the neighbour 
 i 've always been a fan of wake and bake this morning i packed a fat bowl and took it straight to the <unk> 
 i saw parks and rec was on and exclaimed fuck yeah '' i live alone and started it up 
 at some point i fell asleep and woke up to a commercial that said exxon and chipotle teamed up 
 for some stupid reason i was pissed 
 hell chipotle just took an item off the menu because of they way they were treating animals how could they possibly justify teaming up with a company who is destroying the planet 
 so i wrote this to chipotle : i 'm amazed with your company you pull pork from the shelves because pigs are n't treated properly which is awesome 
 now you 've teamed up exxon a company who is destroying the planet and laughing about it as they run away from their responsibilities to the environment 
 your food is delicious your moral compass is fucking disgusting '' 
 chipotle has awesome customer service i wrote them once before about my meal before and they wrote back within an hour great people 
 again they wrote back in about an hour it hurt so bad to read ... we definitely have n't partnered with exxon 
 the only thing i can find online that might suggest this is a fake commercial that <unk> on parks & amp rec recently 
 which is an awesome show as far as i 'm concerned but i 'm sorry if it caused any confusion 
 you can read the article i found on that here : thanks for your support of our stance on the <unk> <unk> 
 from the fellowship of the foil a '' my god ... it still makes me feel like a complete ass hole 
 fuck me i ca n't believe this shit just happened 
 the next quotes are the last two exchanges we had 
 wow i 'm retarded i need to stop smoking so much weed '' 
 glad to have set you straight <unk> 
 the next time the <unk> hit hopefully you can head for chipotle and feel good about where your money is going 
 : your friend in the burrito business a '' 
 if you read this a you 're awesome thanks for setting me straight 
 tldr : i 'm stupid and wrote an angry letter to chipotle for teaming up with exxon 
 at least i did n't rant about it on facebook i <unk> : this happened last <unk> so still within 24 hours 
 my friend whom we will call jake got dumped by his girlfriend for someone else 
 knowing him since early teens i knew he always took stuff like this too hard 
 i <unk> called him when i found out 
 he was already a crying mess 
 so being the good friend i am i offered to go out for drinks so he can take his mind off her 
 we go into a nice bar and have us a few beers 
 i took the classic route : <unk> she was n't worth it there are other fish in the sea she was a ho i told you bla bla bla '' but no that was n't working in retrospect : when did that ever work 
 jake only got mildly drunk he is a very <unk> drinker and that only make him more miserable 
 so we got out of the bar 
 keep in mind that i was also tipsy as well 
 but i knew i should n't leave him alone in a state like that so i said that we could take his laptop from his dorm then go into my place order some pizza and play some <unk> 
 so we played for around two hours eating pizza and drinking more beer 
 after seeing that jake 's mood finally improved i decided to note that we are both drunk at this point gift him a game from steam 
 jake likes adventure games very much so i search for adventure games and this game called life is <unk> pops up 
 i saw that it had very positive reiviews and instantly gifted him a copy 
 when he saw the game that we both did n't know much about beforehand he got happy and started downloading it right away 
 i was very tired at that point so i told him i was going to sleep because i have a class tomorrow and went off the bed 
 i woke up at noon because drunk me set the alarm at 8:00 pm 
 i <unk> recognize an <unk> weird smell hung in the air 
 i got out of the room and see him laying <unk> on his puke a half finished bottle of vodka in hand 
 i go into instant panic mode screaming <unk> shit fuck shit '' and frantically checking to see if he 's breathing 
 he is alive but i ca n't wake him up at all 
 i had to call an ambulance 
 they came in and took him off after 10 minutes 
 i followed them to the hospital 
 the doctors told me that he wo n't have any lasting harm but he probably wo n't wake up for half a day or so 
 i left my number to a nurse to call me when he woke up and went back to my house to clean up the mess 
 the pool of dried puke proved to be more than i could deal with 
 i called some cleaning guys to deal with it 
 i had to pay extra when they saw the mess 
 then i took jake 's laptop with me to the bedroom plugged it in and tried to boot it up to pass time 
 surprisingly it was n't turned of at all and the game i bought was running 
 might as well see what this game is about so i started a new save file and played from the <unk> 
 for the <unk> : it starts out just like another high school drama where our character has a superpower 
 <unk> 
 but then things got interesting then things got so interesting that i could n't get up except bathroom breaks then the game took a very unexpected trip on the feels train that i was played it in <unk> mode for the last hour 
 by the ending i was loudly crying my fucking ass off check the reactions on forums 
 i turned it off went back to my freshly cleaned living room and took a large <unk> from jake 's leftover vodka 
 after drying my tears off i got curious about how far did jake play 
 so i went back to his laptop and boot it up to see his save file 
 fucking completed 
 only then i realized what the fuck have i done 
 if the game made me cry like a fucking bitch then i coulnd't even imagine what did it do to him after a fresh breakup 
 might as well <unk> a fire out by pouring <unk> over it 
 so here i sit waiting a call from the hospital while wanting to slap myself 
 tl dr : friend is dealing with a break up 
 buy life is <unk> to help him deal with it 
 the game fucks him up even more 
 edit : he woke up 
 he 's still hammered though 
 he swears he will never play anything else i buy him ever again 
 : d edit 2 : guys seriously i 'm not trying to market this game 
 i would post this without even giving the game 's name away if i could 
 stop accusing me of marketing : dthis did actually happen today about an hour and a half ago 
 i recently started working a job in a county courthouse that requires me to arrive at 8am 
 i typically get to the courthouse around <unk> and while i 'd prefer to head right to my desk and get an early start on my day due to <unk> rules i 'm not technically allowed to enter my office until 8am exactly 
 so typically i stop at the courthouse coffee shop which opens at 730am 
 side note i hate having coins and this coffee shop only accepts cash 
 they have a cup positioned right in front of the cash register for take a penny leave a penny '' purposes 
 so i use this very frequently and unfortunately i 'm usually taking more than leaving 
 i know i know it 's bad karma but i really hate coins 
 they 're like little subway <unk> that you carry around in your pocket it 's disgusting 
 so today i pour my coffee walk up to the register and an greeted by a very <unk> high school student with special needs 
 this is common as the county allows them to volunteer at the shop as a means of gaining experience to help them find a paying job 
 i put my coffee down and rings up the transaction 
 it comes to $ <unk> and all i have is a $ 20 bill 
 so i reach into the cup as i 've been many mornings prior and grab six cents to hand to her 
 the look on her face tells me something is wrong 
 she then informs me that the cup is a collection cup for donations for the special needs volunteers 
 as my brain is trying to process the fact that for weeks i 've been blatantly helping myself to the money in this cup right on front of plenty of the volunteers and other employees of the court house 
 i insist that ca n't be the case as i 've used it before 
 she then <unk> the cup around to show that it says donations for our volunteers '' the rest of the transaction is dead silent 
 she hands me my change which immediately dump into the donation jar and mutter a weak im sorry '' as i slink away 
 tl dr tifu by stealing donations from special needs children 
 edit apparently the dick move in this post is me abusing the take a penny leave a penny system 
 i do typically break a bill at the end of the week and dump the remaining <unk> cents into the cup 
 so i end up giving more than i take 
 just <unk> 
 also front page is pretty neat edit : i <unk> the giving taking part wrong 
 i was saying i <unk> to put money in when i can but i usually still take more than i give 
 unlike most tifu this one actually happened today 
 so i 'm a dentist 
 there was a young early 20s new patient in the office today whose boyfriend tagged along 
 at some point during the exam the topic of breaking bad came up 
 i 'm a huge fan and pretty much recommend it to anyone if i find out they have n't seen it 
 i know it 's on netflix so at some point while talking to them i 'm mentioning how good it is and i tell them they can go netflix and chill 
 i 've seen the phrase here a bit and on other social media 
 since netflix has become so big i assumed it just meant relax and watch something on netflix and that was what the young kids were doing a lot these days 
 they both kind of look at each other giggle and mention something like they could do that 
 i 'm not young but i 'm under 40 and i thought they just found it funny i would use a newer phrase 
 fast forward to tonight 
 i 'm just sitting here watching baseball when this epiphany strikes out of nowhere 
 i realize there was something a little off about their reaction to my using that phrase 
 so i googled it ... just to make sure 
 now i 'm horrified that i told a young couple to go home and have sex 
 i only hope it was obvious i did n't know what i was saying 
 edit : i 'm just glad i 'm not the only one who did n't know 
 hopefully this helped others not repeat my mistake 
 : pi 've collected several <unk> for <unk> my <unk> inhaler but i do n't use it too often so i accumulate a few in the bathroom 
 i always use them before a big day out 
 so in preparation for nye i get out of the shower deodorise open the inhaler and take a deep blast into my lungs 
 what i did n't do was check the inhaler before i used it 
 turns out a nest of baby cockroaches had moved in right on the nozzle inside the <unk> 
 i sprayed the back of my throat full of cockroaches 
 tldr : it 's five sentences just read it 
 edit : jesus ok i get it it 's 6 sentences <unk> long-time lurker first post 
 *this happened when i was but a young dumb lad about fourteen years ago 
 * if anyone remembers what <unk> were like in october of 2001 then this story will make a lot more sense 
 only a month after the awful 9/11 attacks my parents decided it would be a lovely time to take a good ol family trip to disneyland 
 we left home canada without any problems - airport security was immense police presence pretty heavy - but nothing that we did n't expect 
 some of the extra security was a little scary as i was seven but i was too excited for disneyland to care all that much 
 as expected disneyland was all that a little boy could want 
 we rode the rides we ate the food and most importantly i bought a huge helium <unk> shaped balloon that i <unk> 
 the kind of inexplicable <unk> love that any young child <unk> for a new toy 
 like i *really fucking <unk> this balloon 
 the day after i purchased my priceless treasure it was time to leave 
 now our family was prepared for extra airport security but we had <unk> <unk> what was in store for us when traveling out of the us 
 american security made canadian security look like <unk> mall cops 
 <unk> to the security line headed out of anaheim 
 i was happily holding my beloved balloon completely oblivious to the army of tsa officers <unk> security machinery and immense police presence surrounding me 
 when the family in front of us began the process of opening their bags taking off shoes etc my mother realized that i probably would n't be able to bring a giant bag of helium <unk> a plane 
 just before we stepped forward to get <unk> ourselves she told me to dispose of the balloon 
 so like any smart rational seven year old i popped it 
 holy hell 
 the sound alone of the giant balloon popping sounded like a miniature explosive 
 all hell broke loose 
 people all around us started crying yes crying this was a month after 9/11 sirens started blaring complete with flashing lights and about 10 men dressed in hardcore military <unk> rushed in pointing their <unk> <unk> really big and terrifying weapons at my <unk> <unk> 
 of course we were all <unk> 
 four hours later we were n't on our plane but instead were just being released from the hell that is the tsa <unk> 
 after countless interviews questions and additional screenings we were allowed to rebook a flight and return home that night 
 tl dr popped a <unk> in security shortly after the 9/11 attacks almost got my entire family arrested / shot 
 edit : gun fact 
 not sure if they were automatic but tsa does n't carry automatic <unk> so thought i 'd edit for improved accuracy thanks to <unk> for pointing that out 
 edit 2 : front page 
 wow thank you 
 did n't expect my first post to blow up like this made my week well that was awkward 
 like 2 hours ago i must have been having a bad dream or something 
 i woke up to the sound of knocking on the door and thought i heard crying 
 i rushed to the door thinking it was an emergency and it ended up being <unk> 's witness recruiters 
 2 younger probably around 20 girls 
 all i had on were my pajama pants 
 they continued on with their pitch as i stood there awkwardly 
 they gave me a packet and went on their way ... and then i realized ... my dick was just hanging out of the front door of my pajamas 
 thinking back to their opening statement ... is now a bad time 
 we can come back later '' ... and my response oh no 
 it 's fine '' 
 and then me reaching out for the impulsive handshake at the end ... what have i done 
 update 3 : narration by /u/markreadsreddit update 2 : here 's a picture of the packet thing 
 some people wanted to know what they gave me 
 update : they ended up coming back but this time with a guy 
 i apologized to them for answering the door like i did to which the guy responded it happens to the best of us '' 
 they handed me another <unk> packet and left 
 tl dr : answered the door to jehovah 's witness recruiters with my dick hanging out shook hands realized afterwards 
 check your pee hole before answering the <unk> so this morning i go into the bathroom to do my morning business 
 my nephew is spending the weekend so his mother brought his stool to stand on when he brushes his teeth 
 as i am sitting there trying to go the cramps hit and i am serious pain and need to poop 
 i think back about a previous post about <unk> your feet up off the floor helps you take a dump 
 so i drag the stool over and put my feet up 
 it is not particularly comfortable and i am not sure how high my feet are supposed to be 
 well mine are about 8-10 '' off the ground 
 all of the sudden the urge hits me and i let loose 
 the hard plug followed by a severe <unk> 
 well when you raise your feet that high you also change the angle of your anus 
 a large part of the spray escapes the toilet painting my calves as it goes by 
 i look up to see it on the floor shower curtain and all over my legs 
 it was the worst cleanup job ever i am even <unk> as i type this 
 around three months ago i applied to be an extra in the new star wars film 
 they are shooting in the uk this summer fairly close to where i am based and had put out a casting call for 'salty sea dogs having spent the last 6 months allowing my beard to grow out i thought it would be a great opportunity to put my <unk> captain <unk> look to some actual use 
 so i <unk> up the facial hair sent off some pictures of my heavily bearded face and waited for a call from the casting agency 
 three months later and i had n't heard anything back 
 by that point i thought it was fair to assume i had n't got it 
 after all every bearded man in the country had probably applied 
 so i finally got round to shaving 
 to be exact i shaved at <unk> today 
 exactly seventeen minutes later i got a text from the casting agency <unk> that i more or less had a part so long as i <unk> have a good beard 
 the photos below were originally just the obligatory <unk> beard selfie for facebook 
 instead they just <unk> one of the most badly timed <unk> in history : warning to all my bearded comrades : do n't ever get rid of it 
 the universe will get you back for it 
 no star wars for me 
 and i look about 15 now 
 edit : **update** 4th july <unk> gmt so ... i replied with <unk> and received an email this morning that laid out specifically the look they were going for long <unk> hair 
 the email finished with : * '' if your hair is currently similar to this and you are generally free for filming in august on a major new feature film as an extra please email me back a <unk> of your current hair by the end of friday 4th july '' * disaster 
 as much as i would have loved to send them another <unk> photo the honest side of me <unk> the dark side and sent back an email explaining my predicament and with a photo of how the beard will look in around 6 weeks time if they want me they will reply 
 so now i wait 
 and as soon as i hear back i will let you guys know 
 ps - to the <unk> <unk> suggesting it 's impossible for me to have shaved and showered in 8 minutes there 's this great new <unk> called an electric razor 
 you just run it over your face and the beard is gone 
 it 's like magic 
 edit : **update** <unk> july <unk> gmt as much as i wish i could deliver great news at this point i still have n't heard back 
 i will send a quick followup email now but from here it looks <unk> i will get it 
 not 'salty enough clearly 
 on the bright ish 
 side and as some of you have pointed out it seems that the original casting call which did the rounds online could have been mistaken about 'salty sea dogs being for star wars 
 instead it could well be for the next peter pan film which is shooting in <unk> around the same time 
 sadly i ca n't verify this as i was given very little information in my contact with them as you 'd expect 
 of course if i hear back i will post here immediately ... but sorry to let you down this was a while back when my daughter was a toddler 
 my husband and i did n't want her sipping on his beer so we called that daddy 's juice 
 no you ca n't drink that it 's daddy 's juice '' one day i went to pick up my daughter from daycare and her teacher saw me and started giggling 
 it was around mother 's day and she had the kids do a little project where they answered some questions about their mommy 
 how tall is mommy 
 what is mommy 's favorite color 
 including what is mommy 's favorite drink '' 
 the answer being ... daddy 's juice 
 well that was a bit embarrassing to say the least 
 i explained to her what it was and we had a good laugh 
 this actually happened yesterday so it 's relatively fresh right so at the moment i am at disney world orlando with my dad and little sister 
 my sister is 10 and i am 17. as my sister is a dumbass and ca n't walk in a straight line as she is looking at all the disney shenanigans i sometimes put my hand on her back and guide her through the crowds 
 now the fuck up : we are walking in a big crowd towards the haunted mansion and i see my sister walking the wrong way so without really paying attention i again start <unk> her for a few minutes 
 when we get to the haunted mansion i look down and realise that 's not my sister 
 she was wearing similar clothes and looked similar but this was definitely not my sister 
 fuck 
 that 's also when my dad noticed 
 i had managed to lose my sister and kidnap someone else 's daughter at the same time 
 luckily ad disney they are used to lost kids petrified parents and confused <unk> child thief 's and managed to find the girls parents 
 and sadly they found my sister too 
 tl : dr went to disney 
 saw sister 
 kidnapped a little girl 
 edit : haunted mansion not haunted house wow okay this has blown up i 'm glad you are all enjoying my sisters <unk> 
 narrated <unk> me see how i can start this ... so every day i look forward to going to my history class i love history 
 so my super chill teacher who is really more of a role model to me than a teacher 
 he decided that our class has been working hard in preparation for finals and that we should watch some show called the office '' 
 so the open scene shows some lad talking about how bosses are like teachers and the boss said that teachers also bang students akin to bosses banging coworkers 
 well i did n't quite catch that part i 'm kind of hard of hearing 
 i only caught the part about how bosses are like very good teachers and that some bosses are good teachers or something like that i did n't really catch it 
 here 's the fuck up he asked me if i was enjoying the show 
 stevie '' he said 
 are you enjoying this show <unk> '' 
 and i tried to come up with some witty <unk> and unfortunately i need to work on thinking before i say something 
 i said yeah 
 this show seems like an <unk> of your life '' 
 and i did n't hear or realize that i said that right after the big boss guy said also teachers bang their students '' 
 he looked at me for one second and said dude that 's so disrespectful '' 
 it took me a second to think and i said i 've never seen the office ... sorry dude ... what 's the show about '' 
 and he just said turn around please '' 
 in one of the most upset voices i 've ever heard 
 i did as he said and he was so mad that he turned off the show and said we had to read from our <unk> for the rest of class 
 i was very confused of why he was mad and someone explained me the context 
 i felt very bad and i went up to him and said hey can we talk about this '' 
 he just told me to go and sit down 
 so i started writing an apology note 
 at the end of class i successfully wrote a one and a half page note 
 after class i said now do you want to talk about it '' 
 he said sure what you said was very inappropriate and mean <unk> 
 i was so embarrassed by what you said '' 
 and i tried to explain to him the context in which i heard it in but he did n't want to hear it 
 i gave him my apology note and he said thanks for that i want to talk about this on friday '' 
 and usually when he says he wants to talk later i know he 's going to throw some sort of detention at me 
 i wanted to say more but i choked on my tears and left 
 when i got home i started bawling like a baby 
 not because i do n't want to get in trouble but because i had lost one my friends today 
 teacher you told me you lurk reddit 
 if you see this i hope you can forgive me one day 
 i really did n't mean to imply that you 're a pedophile 
 i know your passion is teaching and please do n't feel down ... tl dr : watched the office tried to make a witty remark now my teacher and friend hates me 
 **update** : i 'm going to school now i 'll report back in a few hours 
 ok so i decided to use reddit 's advice and just not approach him and have him approach me about it 
 i went in to take my exam and he said might want to move your <unk> stevie '' 
 and gave me a pat on the back 
 also someone at my school showed this post to him so i suppose he is n't mad at me anymore which puts me at ease 
 i 'm sure you have all heard the story about the person yelling are you fucking sorry '' 
 well.. today i did something similar 
 5:30pm comes around at work and i 'm just chatting with a few people as we are finishing up 
 i then thought it might be cool if we go for a couple of beers after work 
 so i turned to my female colleague and went to ask her if she was game 
 however being the excellent clear speaker that i am i stumbled over my words and started saying do you want a quick one '' except <unk> through saying quick i changed the word to sneaky 
 i ended up asking her do you want a quickie '' 
 luckily she just laughed and told everyone else but i 'm not going to live it down for a while 
 edit : to all those asking a sneaky <unk> to getting a drink or two when you would n't usually have one 
 and i 'm australian so you do n't even need to use the word beer or drink in that <unk> : dr rock out til the cops out 
 i was driving home from work and got really into this <unk> song it was on <unk> no clue who it was 
 the <unk> was jumping like jacks the guitar was singing the <unk> of <unk> the <unk> had a beat that just rounded it off and got me <unk> 
 so i 'm tapping along to the beat on my wheel until we get to a red light 
 nice 
 it just turned red 
 pushed in the clutch stopped the truck and now i have a kick pedal thump my right foot on the ground 
 the roads flat so my truck stays without my foot on the brake 
 i 'm pretty much fully <unk> at this point ... then i pick up on the high hat opening ever other 4th ... so here i am lost in the fucking music at a red light and lift my left foot instinctively to raise the high hat and my truck <unk> forward into the cop car 
 he gets out checks out the car 
 luckily our <unk> lined up so there was no visible damage 
 but i guess he was watching me <unk> around and thought i was high or some shit made me do a sobriety test etc ... then lectured me a bit and sent me on my way 
 not a terrible ending i know but it put a <unk> on the fantastic mood i was in 
 edit : some requested things and other errors 
 also i 'm searching for the song 
 2 : the <unk> bearing gets replaced when i change the clutch out so i 'm not concerned about it wearing out 
 i 'll throw it away long before that time comes 
 so i 'd got pretty drunk with my girlfriend and a married couple we 're friends with and was appropriately hungover this morning 
 i walked my gf to work and then started to make my way home 
 my apartment is like an hour walk away from hers and i 'm starting to feel my <unk> coming on and realise i 'm not going to make it back without making a pit stop on the way 
 now i have this thing about hating using starbucks bathrooms without having bought anything and i was n't in the mood to go anywhere i had to talk to anyone 
 luckily i know the national art gallery is both free and has really nice bathrooms 
 this is when the fuck-ups started 
 i 'm <unk> hungover so i do n't think it 's a big deal when the nearest door i find is n't the big one and has a guard posted at it 
 he 's busy talking to a woman so i just walked on in 
 i realised pretty quickly that i was in the wrong section so tried to get to the main gallery 
 so i go downstairs and can see a part of the gallery i recognise through a glass door and luckily there 's a guy going through 
 i was too far away to get through with him and hate making noise too much to hail him so i just watched the code he put in from the end of the hallway and copied it 
 lo and behold it actually worked 
 i go and answer the call of nature and decide i 'm gon na have a bit of a jolly and look at some paintings 
 so i 'm having a great time looking at a <unk> of a woman partying down with some <unk> <unk> and shit when i decide i 'm too hungover to deal with art anymore 
 so i tried to get out 
 except i could n't 
 the door was locked and i must 've set off an alarm or something when i tried to open it because about two minutes later this giant security guard comes up behind me and says sir i 'm going to have to ask you to come with me or i 'm calling the police '' 
 luckily i think he realised i was n't an art thief by the fact i was whistling really loudly when he found me and had spent most of the time verbally mocking the paintings 
 apparently the art gallery was n't open for another half hour which i did n't know 
 so i got escorted out by big <unk> and then made my way home where obviously my first <unk> was to tell reddit 
 tl dr - help will always be given at <unk> to those who break into an art gallery edit : rip in peace my <unk> literally happened 15 mins ago i 'm still slightly <unk> 
 to give just a bit of background i 'm a 17 year old male and live with my sister who is a couple years older than me and parents of course 
 i have this strange habit that occurs <unk> whenever i feel the need to go to the bathroom 
 when i 'm alone i 'll casually whip out the d as i 'm walking towards the bathroom and as soon as i reach the toilet i let loose 
 easy peasy i 'm in and out of there in like 10 seconds 
 usually this is n't a problem if i notice anyone around i simply do what any other <unk> human being would do and not unleash my genitals 
 today i was watching a video on my phone so i had earphones in 
 on my journey to the bathroom i was giggling like a little girl so i did n't realise my sister was already sitting on the toilet as i walked in 
 why the door was n't fucking closed i will never fucking know 
 as i stroll in with phone in one hand and dick in other mind you i hear a voice say sorry i 'm in ... '' which then cuts off 
 slowly i look up from my phone 
 i swear if you saw her face it would be like i killed someone though a part of her probably died so yeah 
 i got the absolute fuck out of there and here i am in bed watching netflix and writing this 
 i 'm not getting up after that <unk> experience 
 tl dr had to take a leak instead showed my sister my flaccid ding dong 
 i 'll preface this by saying that my love for hot sauce <unk> <unk> 
 i often carry a bottle of dave 's <unk> sauce or the like wherever i go 
 <unk> on my phone and about to add said sauce to my salad i did n't bother to look up before <unk> giving the bottle a good shake 
 i 'm not sure when or how the cap on the bottle broke but as soon as i gave the first upward shake the cap flew off followed by a steady stream of red all over my right shoulder 
 upset i grabbed napkins and was about to clean myself off 
 within seconds the shrill screams tore through the grocery store <unk> me and everyone else to the horror unfolding 
 this poor baby who only seconds ago was fast asleep had been awakened by an unnaturally spicy sauce around his eyes nose and mouth 
 he had already started to rub them in an attempt to relieve the pain <unk> the burning 
 his mom grabbed napkins and ran to the sink to soak them 
 in desperation i took my cold coconut water with chunks and proceeded to pour it on the child 's face 
 15 minutes later the ambulance showed up 
 a store employee had called paramedics 
 they took the kid and mother to the ambulance to properly care for him and probably take him to a hospital 
 at this moment of relative calm i realize the crowd who had gathered to help had sharply focused their attention on me 
 it felt like the end of the birds 
 i stepped carefully with my salad and hot sauce in hand through an <unk> quiet crowd hoping to not <unk> a brutal attack 
 as i walked past the ambulance i offered my card to the mother asked her to please send me the medical bill and repeated my profuse apologies 
 they were not well received 
 tl dr : cap broke on insanely hot sauce and accidentally sprayed a stranger 's baby in the face with it 
 edit : thank you for the gold and the comforting remarks 
 still no word from the mother 
 i do n't know if that is a good thing or she 's <unk> a plan of attack 
 and yes i definitely should have put my finger on the cap before <unk> work at a small video game development studio 
 we recently attended a major <unk> to promote our new <unk> strategy game with <unk> strategy and card game <unk> 
 we had a fancy booth with half a dozen computers set up and a full set of staff <unk> people <unk> to them and showing them the game 
 the key sell '' that we were trying to make was to collect emails for a mailing list that we would use in the future for marketing beta testing and <unk> 
 emails are the holy grail 
 without them showing off the product would be virtually worthless 
 a few important things about <unk> at <unk> shows : * there is <unk> and cell phone reception because there are <unk> of thousands of people walking around 
 * the wifi is <unk> awful 
 * wired internet costs $ <unk> or $ <unk> for the <unk> convention 
 fuck-up number 1 : i had chosen to <unk> out and skip getting the wired internet 
 our game demo did n't require any internet <unk> 
 fuck-up number 2 : all of our nice computers were being used as demo machines and we were stuck with a chromebook to collect the email sign-ups 
 <unk> do n't work very well without internet but i had managed to load up a google doc spreadsheet in offline mode '' to collect all of the emails 
 or so i thought 
 over the course of four days we collected hundreds of email sign-ups in the spreadsheet 
 everything seemed just fine 
 however when we got back to the office the chromebook reconnected with the internet synced and the entire spreadsheet was erased in an instant 
 turns out that it was n't properly set up in offline mode so none of our edits to it were saved 
 the entire product of our trip to the trade show which required weeks of preparation and over $ <unk> in costs was gone 
 edit : yay looks like this is actually the top /r/tifu post that has nothing to do with sex 
 edit 2 : as others have pointed out the game is called prismata i 'm not sure if posting that is a violation of the rules on posting personal information i will gladly remove the link if mods so request 
 edit 3 : thank you to everyone trying to help 
 we 've tried just about everything 
 the chromebook is an <unk> <unk> 
 the one thing we have not tried is <unk> the hard drive but every method i 've seen for doing that seems to involve booting the device in developer mode which apparently <unk> the hard drive 
 if anybody knows a method of actually doing this we 'll certainly give it a go 
 edit 4 : damn now this is on top of all the sex posts 
 edit 5 : thanks to everyone who pmed me offering to sign themselves up to our list you guys are awesome 
 edit 6 : holy shit 
 i just checked our site stats apparently thousands of you clicked that link above and our list grew by more today than it otherwise has grown in the last month 
 we added <unk> new emails than we lost at the <unk> 
 honestly i have no words you guys fucking rock 
 edit 7 : what the fucking fuck 
 i get in this morning and our mailing list has <unk> 
 you guys have added <unk> more names than the rest of our company 's entire marketing efforts to date 
 what is this shit 
 edit 8 : so apparently the <unk> <unk> is now one of the top links on <unk> here 's what you guys did to our mailing list : edit 9 : here it is again at the end of the day it 's literally 1100 % times higher than it was 48 hours ago : just fucking unbelievable 
 even a few media folks contacted me about the story 
 the google docs offline team also contacted us to try to identify the problem and possibly recover our lost data 
 thank you all for your interest in prismata we will try our <unk> to get the servers running at their max capacity so that you can all play as soon as possible last night i was on the bus coming home from visiting a friend in a nearby town and i fell asleep 
 so i start dreaming about her and before i know it it turns sexual 
 a slow <unk> tension builds up as in my dream i slowly slide my hand up her naked thigh 
 the second i reach her <unk> all the muscles in my body release in a wonderful spasm of ecstasy 
 it 's enough to wake me up 
 of course with a sinking stomach i realize instantly what is happening my dick is happily pumping cum into my underwear like it 's waving freely in an open field 
 except i 'm sitting in the window seat on a fully packed bus with two hours left to go and the bathroom is out of order 
 to my horror as i 'm contemplating my pitiful existence i feel the cum start to slide into the crack of my ass 
 there 's no way to move to make it better 
 water finds the fastest most efficient route to <unk> to gravity and any way i move gets my cum deeper into my ass 
 if that was n't bad enough by the time i eventually got to a bathroom it had crusted most of my ass hairs together 
 pulling my cheeks apart has never been more painful - both physically and emotionally 
 i cried all kinds of tears last night 
 tl dr : i had a wet dream and came in my own <unk> all started when i was christmas shopping 2 days ago and i decided to get my parents a christmas card i grabbed one that said something along the lines of happy holidays '' and left the store 
 i gave my dad the card and as he reads it his eyes fill up with tears he calls my mom near him and she starts screaming out of happiness i was really confused as it was just a card they suddenly say so is it a boy or a girl i 'm so happy '' 
 i 'm really confused now and apparently i found out that the card says happy holidays grandma '' and my parents thought it was a way to tell them i was expecting 
 they 're very upset now 
 *my* doggy 
 so yes i 'm <unk> 
 still : it 's 630am 
 i stumble downstairs to get my wife 's lunch together for school shut up she 's a teacher 
 and there 's buster his entire body <unk> back and forth under the force of his <unk> joy at the reminder that i exist as an <unk> 
 he 's already been on a <unk> run with my wife that morning but is he the slightest bit tired 
 <unk> no 
 i stump over to the coffee maker 
 buster <unk> himself between me and it his desire for <unk> an almost palpable form hanging in the air his big <unk> eyes following me like a <unk> tracking a hit 
 i decide well it 's decided for me that the <unk> better have his felt needs addressed and i lean over to pet him give him <unk> etc 
 you know the drill 
 buster however feels that the time it 's taking me to lean down is altogether <unk> and decides to meet me halfway up 
 he launches all <unk> pounds of <unk> <unk> <unk> half <unk> muscle up at me with the speed of a thousand <unk> 
 his <unk> skull which i swear to christ must be made of <unk> or some shit connects with my face so hard the air around us <unk> 
 there is a massive <unk> as my eyeballs bounce off the back of the inside of my surely freakin <unk> skull purple and green <unk> <unk> around behind my <unk> 
 i get back onto my feet oh yeah : my lil <unk> laid me the <unk> out and <unk> my way up to the kitchen sink blood <unk> everywhere from my destroyed nose 
 i do what any sane man would do which is bellow something along the lines of oh you fucking dog '' over and over again whilst bleeding into the <unk> 
 this of course <unk> my wife to come charging out of the bathroom all naked and soapy from the shower which in any other situation would be just fine with me 
 however i am still <unk> <unk> into the sink so i do n't actually see this 
 what i <unk> however is the squeak and <unk> of her being bodily <unk> by a thoroughly <unk> dog who is learning more about the world being a confusing place every day 
 anyhoo 
 buster has calmed down now 
 i <unk> the blood off of the floor and gave him his <unk> to <unk> to pieces as a calming exercise 
 he 's taking his <unk> nap now 
 my wife was able to rinse the blood soap and dog hair off and still get out the door on time 
 i 've been sitting here with a bag of frozen peas across my eyes hoping the <unk> are n't too bad by the time i have to go to work myself 
 this is buster 
 he 's my buddy and i love him very much but <unk> fuck him so much right <unk> this happened to me a few days ago 
 i am heading back to toronto after a lovely christmas in belize 
 i am in line to clear customs at the houston airport because for some reason you need to clear us customs even if you 're transiting through to canada 
 since the line is moving so slowly they move all the toronto people to another slightly less <unk> line 
 i am at the back of the line along with a girl from south korea 
 she seems very worried that she is going to miss her flight which is going to leave in about 15 minutes 
 i tell her that we are on the same flight and do my best to assure her that we 're going to make it 
 we are indeed cutting it very close but i try to distract her by making small talk 
 right before it is my turn to speak to the customs agent she says to me i 'm sorry to ask you this but do you mind if we go together '' 
 i <unk> this as her asking if it is okay if we go to the gate together 
 it is obvious that english is not her first language so i thought she was worried she would get lost 
 i reluctantly agree even though i do n't want to miss my flight it would n't be right to leave someone like that 
 as i am walking up to the customs agent i see her walking with me 
 turns out she did not mean go together '' to the gate but rather go together '' through customs 
 now you have to understand i am a young south asian male in an american airport 
 at the time i not only had a <unk> beard did n't bother bringing a razor to belize but was also wearing a <unk> around my neck 
 i feared that once the customs agent saw through our <unk> that i would be taken to the back and cavity searched 
 the agent looks at our passports then at us 
 looks at our customs forms 
 back at us 
 passports 
 custom forms 
 back at us 
 finally he says i 'm trying to determine if y'all are married '' 
 i reply not <unk> '' and laugh nervously 
 after what seems like an eternity he tells us we are free to go 
 we now have less than five minutes before our flight leaves 
 we are in terminal a and our gate is in terminal <unk> we basically sprint the entire way there and make it just as they are about to close the gate 
 we make it to our seats – which are coincidentally next to each other – laughing and <unk> ourselves on a job well done 
 i figure that i should take this time to get to know my new fake <unk> 
 it is a three hour flight after all and she seems cool enough 
 i ask her what she was doing in belize 
 working at the ministry '' 
 wow 
 like the ministry of finance 
 or <unk> 
 she must be super smart to work for the government of another country 
 what 's more attractive than an intelligent woman 
 turns out she did n't say ministry 
 she said missionary 
 she was working as a missionary 
 i 'm a jehovah 's witness '' 
 she explains 
 after an awkward pause she asks do you know about jehovah 's witnesses '' 
 at this point i know i 'm screwed 
 if i say no she 'll tell me about jehovah 's witnesses 
 if i say yes she 'll ask me what i know and then tell me about jehovah 's witnesses 
 needless to say when we reached toronto three hours later i regretted not leaving her at customs 
 tl dr <unk> my anus at least in my mind to help a stranger catch her flight ended up getting missionary for three hours 
 **edit** hilarious narration by /u/cyae1 thanks 
 yes i suppose i could have politely told her i was n't interested 
 i honestly kept thinking she was going to stop at any minute and did n't want to hurt her <unk> i am walking out of work i finally check my phone and see i have 4 or 5 missed calls from the same number all within a few minutes time span 
 i also notice i have a text from my younger brother a few minutes before the phone calls 
 the phone starts ringing again so naturally i answer it 
 shouting and commotion -- i start to worry and am a little confused 
 who is this 
 hello 
 hello '' 
 i tell them my name 
 your brother has been in an accident he 's very badly hurt man 
 he 's bleeding really bad 
 he said to get your number and call you '' 
 i 'm very panicked at this point but trying to hold it together 
 i 'm starting to put together in my mind that text i received from my brother was probably sent while he was driving and he probably crashed 
 he lives in a part of the city with a lot of mexicans so the guy 's spanish accent checks out too as well as the city area code 
 then it get 's way <unk> 
 i 'm about to tell you something man and i need you to listen 
 your brother he 's in a lot of trouble man i 'm thinking he 's dying in a car crash your brother was texting on his phone and backed out and ran over my little nephew man 
 he left him in the street like a dog to died 
 he got scared and tried to run 
 i know it was a mistake but he left him like a dog 
 he 's not breathing '' 
 at this point the text i received makes more since texting and driving he lives next to a bunch of little mexican kids so it is very <unk> that he was not looking and accidently did something so terrible 
 this guy then explains to me through tears and screaming that they ran down my brother who was trying to run and have beat the shit out of him 
 they have him back at their house and have a gun to his head 
 i can hear screaming and shouting in the background one of an english speaking person through spanish 
 my first instinct is he ran over a gang member 's little kid holy shit holy shit 
 i immediately ask to talk to him to make sure he 's still alive and have n't hurt him too bad they say he 's bleeding but only needs stitches at this point 
 my thought is that this might be the last time i talk to my brother if something goes wrong so they put him on the phone screaming do n't call the cops do n't call the cops '' 
 and all i am saying over and over is i love you i love you i 'm gon na fix this i love you '' 
 this guy explains that obviously they have warrants and cant go to the cops so i need to give them money in exchange for my brother 's life 
 are you going to do this yes or no tell me now or i pull the trigger '' 
 of course yes yes anything 
 i 'm told if i hang up he dies if they hear me talking to anyone else he dies if they hear me texting into my phone he dies 
 i 'm told to drive to the nearest walmart and fill out a money gram for 2000 $ and send it to their relative in pr as to not have it <unk> back to me 
 the moment they get the money they will put my brother on the phone put him in a car and push him out at a hospital 
 i 'm told to talk about sports as i wait in line in walmart and if they think something is up they will just kill him 
 the entire time this guy is switching between crying about his injured nephew shouting at family members in the background talking about how he is so sorry to do this to me but they have no money and police records and they have to do it but man to man i have his word they wont hurt my brother if i just do as they say 
 at that point i do n't give a fuck i am so scared to death that i will give them every dollar i have to save my brothers life and know it needs to happen fast to get him to a hospital 
 the lady spells the name wrong on the money gram as i am reading it back to the guy on the phone i realize 
 he freaks the fuck out i run back into the walmart still on the phone cut in front of 10 people and say you need to fix this please now '' 
 and the lady looks at me like what the fuck 
 i walk back to my car as directed and told to wait to see if it goes through 
 more crying and screaming in the background 
 i wonder if they are just taking my money and killing him anyway 
 they say the money did n't go through 
 i 'm saying yes it did yes it did 
 do you want your fucking brother to die stop fucking around get in there and send it again '' 
 they put him back on the phone screaming <unk> in pain 
 i go back in line 
 my card gets denied as it has hit its max 
 i tell them and they freak out and tell me to buy as many go cards as i can and read them the pin numbers 
 i do it 
 another person gets on the phone i 'm going to give the phone to your brother 
 he will tell you what hospital we are taking him to 
 how many cards did you get '' 
 i tell them 5 and he freaks the fuck out 
 we said 10 
 10 
 i 'm saying i have done everything they asked just please let my brother go he 's got to be so fucking scared he made a mistake i 'm so so sorry 
 then the phone clicks off 
 at this point i 'm in my car crying because i 'm sure they 've killed him 
 i get a text from the number saying we let your brother go 
 we got the money 
 god bless you '' 
 where 
 what hospital '' 
 i text back 
 he has his phone back you can call him now '' 
 panicked that he 's bleeding in the street somewhere i call my brother 
 after a few tries he answers <unk> '' 
 where the fuck are you 
 what hospital '' 
 what are you talking about i 'm at work '' 
 and in that moment i have never been more emotionally fucked in my entire life 
 do n't let this happen to you 
 it was perfect they knew i had a brother they fed on it to get me to tell him his name -- then they perfectly executed the rest on my fear for his life 
 i do n't know how you could live with yourself after doing this 
 apparently this is not a new scam 
 i know the advice is to just hang up '' but when you are hearing your brother screaming in pain with a gun to his head in the background it 's just not an option 
 fuck these people 
 tldr : called by people saying my brother had run over a gang member 's little kid while texting and was being held ransom with a gun to his head 
 i wire them money from 3 hours away 
 my brother was at work the entire time 
 edit : for clarification on two points 1 right when i received the call and hear your brother has been in a horrible car accident '' my first mistake was saying who brothers name '' 
 but at the time i was so panicked that i would never even have considered that someone would lie about something like that 
 so they used his name against me by confirming it multiple times 
 i know i fucked up there 
 i feel sick about it 
 2 when i asked for them to put my brother on the phone it lasted all of about 5 seconds 
 the voice was crying and yelling through some sort of gag just barely understandable saying <unk> call the cops do n't call the cops '' 
 again another mistake : instead of <unk> <unk> <unk> i just wanted to make sure my brother knew i loved him so the time i could have used to maybe realize it did n't sound like him i just spent saying i love you for 5 seconds because i wanted him to know that if he really did get murdered 
 this is one of those things that if you would have told me about it before hand i would have thought there 's no way they could <unk> me ... but something about it being your brother just clouds your mind 
 i feel sick to my stomach i fell for it 
 bank is looking into it -- does n't sound promising 
 cops have a report -- also not promising 
 called verizon -- <unk> phone 
 called walmart 
 nothing 
 the worst part : i called the number back this morning and they were still fucking using it and answered why 'd you hang up 
 next time your brother dies '' 
 clearly doing this to multiple people a day i tried to play it along so i could drive to the police station with them on the line but eventually the guy says wait 
 you 're calling back from yesterday 
 fuck you '' 
 and hangs up 
 edit 2 : thanks for all the feedback suggestions etc 
 to the people pointing out the red flags '' especially the puerto rico part my immediate response was why cant i just wire the money to you <unk> nc -- <unk> area code '' and every time i would sound unsure at all about a detail stop fucking asking stupid questions man or we just hang up and kill him now '' 
 i was too scared to risk it and have that <unk> on my <unk> the rest of my life if i was wrong 
 it 's the worst looking back at it now but i 'm happy to see this getting attention though and hopefully it will save someone from having to go through this 
 and one of my students was in line behind me with his parents in the walmart -- which will be a fun story on monday 
 after a day of reflection my biggest regret is not handling it like this 
 this fuck-up happened many years ago 
 i went to my girlfriend 's parents house for dinner for the first time 
 everything was going pretty good until i grabbed a bottle of salad dressing off the table and shook it up 
 the lid was loose and it flew off as i was shaking the bottle 
 salad dressing spewed all over the fucking dining room 
 it was everywhere 
 on the wall on her mom 's sweater on the <unk> on her dad 's <unk> 
 everybody sat there in stunned silence and i reacted clearly in shock by saying : unbelievable 
 not even a drop on my fucking salad '' 
 girlfriend needed to use my computer for something today 
 before i went to work i logged it into my account so she could jump straight on 
 about an hour later gf calls me computer <unk> itself and she needs my password to log in again 
 my password is my ex girlfriend 's <unk> last night me and a few friends were walking back from a friend 's house down the street 
 we live in an area with fairly high crime and have had property stolen on several occasions 
 my roommate nick just in the last year had his car broken into and his girlfriend 's car stolen from the outside our house 
 so me and three friends roommate nick included turn down the street that our house is on 
 as we are about to reach our destination one of us notices in the distance what appears to be nick 's car backing out of our driveway 
 the car backs out and starts escaping heading towards us 
 fueled with paranoia <unk> by past experiences we all dash towards the vehicle 
 as the car gets closer sure enough it is his 
 my friend lunges towards his stolen vehicle and tries to open the door 
 in response the car <unk> manages to maneuver around us and speeds off into the night 
 we are all freaking out and can not believe the situation that has just <unk> in front of us 
 the <unk> are called to report it 
 as my friend is on the phone explaining the situation to the police we get close enough to the house to find that nick 's car is still in the driveway 
 dumbfounded we walk into the house 
 it turns out my other roommate who had been at home got into a <unk> with his girlfriend 
 his girlfriend had called her mother to pick her up who just so happens to have the same vehicle as my roommate nick 
 from her and her mom 's perspective four grown men came running down the middle of a dark street of a high crime area towards their car and tried to surround and steal it 
 so i work as a volunteer in a <unk> camp at a danish airport which is also a train station 
 basically what we do is we hand little bags of food to syrian refugees on the train heading to sweden 
 occasionally you do n't make it out of the train in time 
 so you have to ride the train all the way to sweden and then back again 
 so i was running through a train when suddenly i see a group of syrian refugees sitting and talking 
 naturally i give them all of the bags i had and told them in a very slow voice here 
 you take this 
 food '' and made eating movements with my hands 
 of course it turns out that they were n't refugees at all 
 they were danish with an arabic <unk> 
 the silence was so incredibly awkward 
 the train started moving and i realised that i was going to spend the next half an hour sitting with a whole bunch of people who thought i was a giant racist 
 they were so mad that two of them got out of the train with me went all the way back to <unk> and complained 
 i got <unk> night i was hooking up with someone for the first time 
 i was a little buzzed 
 i jacked off twice earlier in the day to last longer during sex 
 she gave me gum before we got to my house my breath was minty 
 i was so prepared 
 we started locking <unk> clothes flew off i just punched her ticket for <unk> <unk> 
 i started pounding her as hard as i could so hard the gum flew out of my mouth i was into it she was into it we were in the zone 
 all of a sudden i lost my boner ... too much jacking off today i <unk> 
 she asked me what 's wrong i say nothing and try to keep going 
 i look at her hair gum is tangled in it 
 she touches it and freaks 
 i tell her not to panic and i go downstairs then back up with some peanut butter 
 it 's supposed to help get gum out but it did n't work ... she asked me what the fuck i 'm putting in her hair 
 i tell her peanut butter 
 she tells me she hates peanut butter 
 peanut butter is still not working 
 she tells me to get scissors 
 she cuts her hair out 
 her hair is fucked up 
 she looks up and sees a framed picture of my recently <unk> cat it 's a joke from my friend and says tonight is way too fucking weird and tells me that she 's leaving 
 she laughed in my face as she left 
 i definitely fucked up my first time but at least the gum saved me from the embarrassment of my lost erection 
 hello reddit allow me to take you back to 2007 when i was a 15 year old little bastard 
 growing up i gave my parents a lot of trouble 
 started drinking in the 8th grade started doing pills and smoking weed a year later 
 anyway i 'm 15 and halo 3 was just released 
 it 's mid october and i had finally saved up to buy an xbox <unk> mom gave me $ 60 towards the game and i go home from gamestop rather happy 
 flash forward about a week later cute older girl down the street was having a party and invited me and a couple of my buddies 
 it 's around 11pm parents are asleep i sneak out of the basement like i typically do and proceed to party 
 6 or 7 beers a couple joints and an <unk> 3 of us split later i am messed up 
 around 1am i feel my phone buzzing 
 this is never good 
 i look at my phone it 's my mom 
 i go to where no one can <unk> and she 's furious 
 i tell everyone i got ta go and stumble to my house 
 i walk through the basement door and there stands my mother asking me how drunk i am 
 i throw a few smart remarks her way but then i hear a voice call my name from my dad 's workshop 
 mom never gets my dad involved cuz the man 's scary as all hell 
 i step into my father 's workshop and he 's got a sledgehammer in one hand and his other hand is resting gently on my xbox 
 gives me a speech about how i need to get my shit together or he 's gon na smash my xbox 
 to <unk> i am messed up 
 i look at my dad directly in the eyes i try to look serious but i 'm giggling like a school girl and manage to only say no balls '' 
 without hesitation dad lifts the hammer and <unk> it 
 again and again and again 
 i cried the next morning when i came to 
 tl dr : got messed up at a party at the age of 15 got called home at 1am dad threatens to smash xbox i no balls '' him dad smashes xbox i cry next morning 
 **edit 1 : ** to be fair my father was **not** going to smash my xbox until my drunk ass brain decided to mouth the words that would inevitably send my xbox into <unk> hell **edit 2 : ** no balls '' is challenging someone to complete the task they 've threatened to carry out by telling them they do n't have the balls to do it 
 **edit 3 : ** i turned out okay graduated college and got a job in what i love doing and all that good stuff 
 made bad decisions along the way but have n't touched a drug in years 
 thanks for caring those who asked approximately 5-6 years ago as a nerdy 12 year old i had found a small minecraft server 
 this server was basically about 100 people building <unk> designs 
 these people put a lot of work into this server like up to hundreds of hours each 
 the <unk> on the server were pretty <unk> and gave everyone mod tools which basically meant you had god mode and could use commands to make building easier 
 i used the command which allows you to fill the volume between 2 points with a certain block 
 i unknowingly set one of the points at the <unk> and then walked <unk> for about half an hour to find a free region to build a house 
 it was going to be a sky house i decided so i built a <unk> to the top of the world and started with a nice pond 
 i wanted to surround the pond with sugar cane block so i used the fill all command 
 here 's where i fucked up 
 i thought i set the first point at one corner of the pond and the other at a connecting corner 
 instead the first point was still at the spawn half hours walk away 
 and the second was in my pond 
 i used the fill command and filled the space with sugar cane 
 if i recall correctly close to 600 million blocks of fucking sugar cane 
 the thing about sugar cane is that if it 's not next to water or if it 's <unk> above a height of 5 it drops into an item on the ground 
 i had just dropped 600 million <unk> metres of sugar cane on to the ground 
 unsurprisingly the server crashed after a few minutes due to the intense load 
 i found out through the servers irc chat that the map and the server could n't be saved 
 which means the <unk> could n't be <unk> nor the chat logs so they did n't know i did it 
 the admin of the server had to delete the map completely and create a new one 
 needless to say the players did n't like this one bit 
 the 100 players <unk> to about 10 before the server was shut down due to low interest 
 tldr : i destroyed the world by ending world <unk> this happened a few years ago but after reading the post about the <unk> guy that derp yelled in chipotle it reminded me of this fuck up 
 so in high school i was a lifeguard at a local outside pool club during the summer 
 i worked long hours between 4-6 days a week and would always leave mentally exhausted because we had a crappy management where you would be staring at the pool in one spot for hours at a time 
 in training you learn that you 're supposed to switch around every <unk> minutes just to stay refreshed and aware 
 anyway one particularly long shift some kids are literally just being the worst 
 breaking all the rules running around <unk> all the crap you need to tell them to stop doing 
 as i leave i get a call from my mom telling me to go to grocery store and pick up a few things 
 so i decide to just go directly from work to the store in my lifeguard attire 
 as i 'm walking down the produce isle looking at <unk> i see a flash of movement out of the corner of my eye and turn to see a kid full on running down the isle 
 my brain suddenly <unk> and goes back into lifeguard mode and i yell walk '' 
 in the most <unk> loud voice 
 the kid stops like a deer in headlights and looks terrified which is pretty much what i looked like after i realized what i did 
 then i look over and find the mom absolutely glaring at me <unk> the most angry <unk> i 've ever seen 
 i 'm standing there red-faced and dumbfounded and the only thing i could think to say was i 'm a lifeguard '' 
 i then put my head down and finished shopping as quickly as possible 
 tl dr <unk> the hell out of a grocery store 
 edit : my first front page post would be a tifu haha 
 thank you all for enjoying my <unk> yeah this one happened 30 minutes ago 
 i just ... i just do n't even 
 wow 
 so co-worker was asking how he could manage things on his home computer from work 
 as the it he thought i 'd have a clever solution 
 i did n't 
 i told him just install teamviewer and he can access his pc from anywhere 
 i use it to <unk> <unk> issues from work file transfering issues etc 
 as well as just regular use 
 so he was at my desk i did n't think twice before offering a demonstration 
 load it up 
 input password 
 it loads no big deal 
 loud bdsm porn 
 not mine 
 who 's home 
 my wife 
 what happens when teamviewer connects 
 little corner icon 
 after a <unk> of hardcore <unk> fucking and <unk> '' from this little blonde girl i panicked and hit <unk> which just closed the tab of bdsm porn and leaving some <unk> <unk> shit up 
 i love my wife and i love her porn and sexuality 
 i think it 's super hot that she loves her porn 
 but today was not the day 
 i closed the window and just leaned back and said well i mean 
 you see it works '' 
 he was both shocked and amused and left with just a yeah '' 
 that 's it 
 and yeah my wife definitely would have received the thank you for using teamviewer '' <unk> 
 so she knows i saw 
 i do n't think i 'm going to tell her about the co-worker part 
 edit : oh wait best part 
 i share office space with a few other people 
 after the noise one of them sort of piped up a minute later and just said uh ... * '' it guy '' * want to talk about something '' 
 me : oh you know 
 <unk> '' 
 him : <unk> ... '' first up this was a near fuck up but it still makes me cringe when i think back on it like most of my life 
 i was driving home from work late at night part time waitress and had my music blasting 
 i was really getting into the song as always with <unk> <unk> fucking a+ when i notice behind me the red and blue flashing lights 
 i pulled over turned the music down and thought back to everything that could have been illegal in the past 5 minutes of driving 
 the <unk> comes over and asks if he knew why he pulled me over and although all the reddit advice on this matter says to own up i legitimately had no clue 
 the officer sighed like a disappointed dad then told me it 's because i was using my phone holding it and using it on loud speaker is still illegal where i live 
 now this is where i realised i sorta fucked up 
 i had to explain to the officer that i was n't holding my phone at all and it may have looked liked it because i using my hand as a pretend microphone to sing into 
 he then in all seriousness asked for a rendition of the song 
 i felt like my life was on the line when i nervously spat out 'i 'm just a poor boy from a poor family and he just shook his head and walked <unk> sure if he was in awe or horror but i did n't get a ticket and will not be pulling out the microphone '' while driving <unk> i get bonus points 
 this happened less than an hour ago and i 'm still laughing 
 i had been expecting a delivery all day but i had to get ready for work 
 i 'll grab a fast shower what can go wrong '' 
 ha 
 hahaha 
 i was shaving my legs when i heard the <unk> ring repeatedly and my <unk> german <unk> going <unk> 
 i knew this was a delivery i would have to sign for so i leapt out of the shower <unk> for my glasses and threw on a towel 
 i did n't notice that i was still dripping soap at this point 
 this is important later on 
 i thought i locked my dog in my room as i ran to the door but i guess the door did n't shut all the way also important 
 so i opened the front door hiding behind it to maintain some decency as i scribble and drip on the pad the poor driver offered me 
 then i hear <unk> the dreaded sound of paws racing across hard wood 
 my moron dog slips in a puddle of soap <unk> his footing and crashes into the door sending me towel and scribble pad flying 
 i landed on my ass naked as the day i was born and sopping wet sitting on the very same scribble pad 
 the poor driver got a very <unk> look at my tattooed hide as i scrambled for my missing towel somehow it landed halfway across the room one hand across my tits and the other trying to cover my <unk> lady garden 
 i stammered an apology as he grabbed his scribble pad and practically runs to his truck so red his ears might be smoking 
 my <unk> asshole of a dog is now watching me type this and i swear the bastard is laughing at me 
 fuck my life 
 edit : holy shit 
 this is rapidly turning into one of my highest posts and one of you crazy bastards popped my reddit gold cherry 
 awesome : d now wtf do i do with it 
 edit edit : yup this is now my top post and made the front page 
 i love you <unk> started out like any other saturday but today was mike 's 19th birthday and i wanted to do something nice for him 
 it was three in the afternoon and i had no gift ready and his big day was already halfway over 
 as i 'm sitting in my dorm room and i come to the conclusion that i now am of legal age to rent a stripper 
 with this idea in my head i raced down the hall and find my two close friends and i pitch my idea to them 
 they love it 
 my next step is to ask my floor ra if there are any rules against having strippers in the <unk> dorm rooms 
 my ra thinks i 'm kidding but he asks his supervisor anyways 
 after they look it up there is no rule against strippers in the dorm rooms so our college gave us the green light 
 bingo 
 so how do 3 eighteen-year-old college kids find a classy stripper hours before the big day they hit up yellow pages 
 i called some company and the operator give us a quote of $ 300 an hour 
 now to three college kids 300 bucks is a <unk> of money 
 i said thank you will keep looking '' but in the back of my head we dismiss the idea and moved on with our day 
 fast forward to 6 pm i get a call back from the stripper company 
 the lady says she can do $ 200 for half an hour and <unk> costs 
 honestly we do n't care how long the stripper is here we just want to say we got our friend a stripper for his birthday 
 200 bucks split three ways is still a lot of money so the three of us rounded up six other kids and split the cost nine ways 
 mike was going to get virginia 's <unk> two hour notice stripper 
 the operator puts me in contact with a stripper and as soon as i start talking to this girl i realize how big of a mistake we had just made 
 this stripper probably drank rocks as a kid 
 without any photo evidence of who she was we told her to come and she drove 45 minutes south to our college 
 i greet her when she arrives and she steps out of the car and i thought maybe she was the escort for the real stripper but i was sadly mistaken him 
 maybe this girl was a soft 2 out of 10 oh and she was 32. looking at her i was ready to pay her to keep her clothes on 
 well we already invested the money no turning back now 
 mike was having a really bad day and his fraternity was having a social with a popular <unk> right before the stripper was about to arrive 
 we planned everything out in secret so we would surprise him and we could n't have him leaving before the big surprise 
 i call his big brother in the fraternity and tell him to keep mike at bay 
 now on top of mike 's terrible day he gets a phone call saying that he is not allowed to come to tonight 's social and he 's in trouble 
 i walk the stripper from her car to my dorm room and i try my best to make small talk 
 how do you even make small talk with a stripper 
 for the three minute walk she was able to tell me about the time she was raped as a kid how she watched her dad get shot in the face and about her two kids in high school 
 lovely 
 i get to the room where all the guys are waiting and i knock on the door three times 
 the room erupts in chaos as nine college boys turn into rabid dogs 
 the stripper and i walk in and my friends faces turn from astonishment to terror 
 one of my good friends looks over at mike pats him on the back and says uhhh mike happy birthday dude we bought you a stripper '' and to my astonishment he <unk> over to the sink and throws up 
 the stripper then has an emotional breakdown and sits in my chair and starts crying 
 birthday boy is up chucking his birthday wishes and the chipotle he ate for lunch and crazy stripper mom is hysterically crying in a chair in front of 8 now less horny boys 
 after 10 minutes of dead silence from us and the stripper hysterical crying i tell her it 's okay you can leave we 'll work something out 
 having already paid her in cash we exit the building and i bring up a <unk> 
 this is where all hell breaks loose 
 the stripper start screaming at me saying she does not give <unk> and threatens me with rape charges 
 i call the company and try to work something out but they tell me that they have fired the stripper and they are no longer affiliated with her 
 i tell her if we do n't get our money back i 'm going to call the police 
 i dial 911 on my phone but do not press the call button 
 what i did n't know at the time was that when you dial 911 from my phone it automatically sends the call 
 the phone is not my ear but all the dispatch officer hears is a lot of shouting over money and rape 
 within 45 seconds four police officers are running at the two of us who are standing in the middle of our quad with flashlights in our faces screaming our <unk> rights 
 both of us have no idea what 's going on but now the stripper is hysterically crying again 
 the police officers catch her lying in between sentences when she is giving them a description of tonight 's events 
 this stripper is so dumb she <unk> herself in every other sentence 
 the next thing i know my guys come outside of our building to help tell the story and all hell breaks loose 
 the cops are cracking up asking why we would ever hire a stripper when we 're all sober 
 the crazy stripper gives us her phone number date of birth and fake name and goes on her way 
 the police officers pull us to the side give us a hard look and one of them said this is why you never order a stripper off yellow pages '' 
 so far i have received 44 calls from crazy stripper mom and there might be a civil lawsuit involved 
 tldr : bake your friends a fucking cake for their <unk> just started working nights at this hospital and had enjoyed it so far 
 i was on my break this morning and printed off an application for my local volunteer rescue squad 
 when i came back to my computer a notepad file opened up that basically said all my data was now encrypted and i would have to pay to get it back 
 <unk> it 's been on the news so i email the it guy thinking this is no big deal and that shit like this happens all the time 
 nope 
 apparently i awoke some super <unk> virus that deleted all of my departments folders and fucked everything up 
 now i have <unk> people blowing up my cell phone my boss is unsure '' if i 'll keep my job and my co workers have started a rumor that i watch porn at work 
 tl dr anyone hiring 
 edit : they managed to contain the issue and i have n't been shit canned yet 
 lesson learned though 
 edit edit : thanks for all the replies 
 i feel like less or a moron because of you guys 
 this happened earlier today 
 i am mortified 
 a bit of background : my wife and my <unk> are the same height 
 they have the same body type 
 and they have the same color hair 
 well today they were wearing the same color outfit 
 whenever my wife <unk> over i always cup her ass 
 not just a little tap or on the cheek 
 i get down as low as i can i have long arms and i finger her clit if possible 
 just for a second just to tease her 
 i did n't know my mother in law came over this morning 
 so i wake up late see my wife for a second and give her a kiss then i take a shower 
 then i go downstairs 
 go to the kitchen cause i 'm damn hungry 
 and by the <unk> my wife '' is bent over presumably getting a pan to cook with 
 so i proceed to cup her and immediately proceed to the fingering her clit for a second <unk> <unk> she '' .. yelps 
 i 'm a bit horrified 
 but my wife just said her mom is n't <unk> but <unk> video games in my room for this week sounds <unk> it 's <unk> to tell you guys i 'm jewish ... so my gf was taking a shower and i had to pee so i went into the bathroom and told her that i 'm coming in ... i started peeing and after a few seconds she said when you 're done you can come to into the shower with me if you want '' and while usually i 'd say yes and hop in i felt extra funny that moment so i replied with sorry dear my grandpa already fell for that trick '' ... i really thought she 'd like the joke ... but she did n't ... tifu by making a joke during sexy time 
 last night my wife and i started getting a bit frisky after the kids were in bed 
 as i began to remove the items of clothing covering her magnificent breasts she said slow down no need for rushing '' 
 i replied i 'm not russian i 'm german '' 
 it took several minutes to convince her to let me touch her <unk> i lurk a lot here because i 'm a pretty <unk> guy 
 occasionally i will comment and even <unk> times i will post 
 but most of my time spent here is just reading 
 across many different subs 
 that being said one day i noticed that i had opened 4 or 5 threads in a row ... and everyone in all of them were just complete jerks 
 like <unk> mean to people 
 it really left a bad taste in my mouth 
 had the urge to cuss out a few people so i just had to step away for a bit 
 came back a few days later and decided to try a different sub 
 same thing happens 
 but i really do like redditing so i decided to just not read any comments since magically every redditor on the planet had <unk> into cruel cold hearted <unk> beasts who only wanted to hurt others 
 or maybe everyone had always been like that and they just decided to all stop faking being nice at the same time 
 and so i did n't read comments for probably a week 
 even ignored self post comments 
 just clicked links and left 
 finally just now i click the top right of my phone and see : sort comments by : controversial 
 wait ... you can sort comments 
 tl dr thought everyone in the world had become jerks for a week because my reddit comments have been sorting by controversial without my <unk> i work behind the bar in a popular bar in <unk> normally i wear jeans when working but as the weather has been quite warm i opted to wear a long thin cotton skirt but unless i wore a g-string i had quite a visible panty line so i opted to go commando 
 the manager went down into the cellar to carry out a stock check access to the cellar is through a trapdoor behind the bar and i carried on behind the bar 
 you get used to working around the open trap door and after an hour or so i had more or less forgotten that the manager was down there 
 i had been stood taking to a customer for a minute or 2 when i heard a <unk> cough from below where i was standing 
 it was only then that i realised i had been stood <unk> the open trapdoor on full display to my boss 
 his face spoke <unk> as i looked down to see him grinning up at me with one hand <unk> <unk> over his eyes saying am i clear to come up now that the <unk> has been cleared '' 
 the only saving grace was that he had left his <unk> by the till and did not have it with him or i suspect i would now be a lot more famous than i ever want to be 
 **edit** 1 i get it <unk> references to <unk> are now unoriginal 
 2 if you are desperate for nudes send me money and i will send you someone else 's nudes and we can both be happy 
 3 thank you for the insulting pms and comments i will be sure to devote the attention they deserve the better ones i may borrow for personal use when required i am a british <unk> and have to deal with pissed <unk> frequently 
 i recently starting hooking up with a girl i knew from high school 
 we are 22 now and just realized we were a decent match 
 it was our 5th or so night of sleeping together and it was great 
 <unk> sex ending in mutual satisfaction 
 as morning rolled around we decided to have another go 
 things progressed normally foreplay went well and eventually we ended up with her on top 
 as she was on top being incredibly sexy and making me realize i had landed something special i decided to try and assert my male dominance 
 mistake 
 i thought a slap on the ass would be just perfect 
 not too hard but enough to get the message across 
 i 'm a <unk> 
 as i swing my arm out to start building momentum she sits straight up on me 
 my arm moves around and i start the slight <unk> motion so that it i get a nice pop '' as my hand lands 
 i start to make contact 
 my palm lands directly in the middle of her butt cheek 
 my fingertips fully extended wrap around only to find that i 've overshot the <unk> so to speak 
 my stomach drops and my mouth starts <unk> 
 i slapped my balls 
 hard 
 with the aforementioned pop 
 i let out an audible groan and she immediately knew what i had done 
 she tried to get off out of courtesy but in my state all i could mutter was do n't move 
 do n't move '' 
 i sat there for the next 5 minutes inside her trying not to vomit successfully and her trying not to laugh unsuccessfully 
 after what felt like a lifetime i was able to allow her to get off not the way i had hoped 
 tl dr : i tried to slap my girlfriends ass while she was in cowgirl position and instead slapped my balls so hard i almost threw up.i was browsing reddit just a bit ago and saw a tiny little spider crawling on the wall behind my monitor 
 i get up and destroy it with 1 smack of a <unk> of cardboard i found lying around 
 i thought to myself <unk> if that was just a baby then there is most likely more '' so i look around on the wall see nothing i look up and right up on the ceiling above me is this huge fucking spider just staring down at me i ca n't reach the ceiling with this cardboard so i grab a golf club and gently inch close enough to it so i hit it with 1 tap 
 i missed it falls down and is now behind my desk somewhere ... waiting <unk> this happened last night me and my fiancée got engaged in november due to some family medical <unk> we only got round to having an engagement party this evening at her mums so our parents and families could meet 
 everything was going fine i had a few <unk> before we went to her mums and my tummy was a little <unk> but i figured i 'd be fine if i switched to whiskey and then i could enjoy a nice long poop when i got home 
 now her mum is the kinda lady who believes she 's the upper of the upper class she is never not <unk> or proper a few months ago she had her hip replaced and has been in a wheelchair since and is getting along fine but it was the main reason to have our engagement shindig at her place 
 so everyone 's being friendly and happy <unk> to plan our wedding for us after a few drinks me and the fiancée are really glad everyone gets along and the night is going great until her mum drops a glass of <unk> <unk> 
 me being the chivalrous fella i am <unk> to clean the broken glass as i did i felt a turn in my stomach but by then i was already bent over in front of my mother in law reaching for the glass my ass is about 15 inches from her face 
 i felt the pressure first that dull pushing sensation against my butthole it was like time stood still if only it had 
 in a half a second i erupted in the loudest <unk> fart i 've ever produced it sounded like a <unk> drowning and the warm blast of gas was soon replaced with the wet dripping sting of liquid poo running down my legs like blue jeans in a white wash. my mother in law immediately began to throw up i stood up quick enough to have her puke on the bottom of my new suit trousers and brown leather boots 
 my fiancé went bright red my mom and dad laughed my sister screamed at the smell and her brothers <unk> with laughter and my mother in law the poor <unk> woman just kept cursing through vomit and tears 
 i went and cleaned up thankfully with a change of trousers from her brother and tried to block out the noise and laughter coming from the living room and shortly after i excused myself for not feeling well 
 so now i 'm at home fiancée <unk> said much and i do n't think i can ever look her family in the eye again 
 tl dr - shit myself when i bent over in front of my mother in law to clean up <unk> wine 
 edit : front page 
 holy shart 
 my fiancée & lt <unk> two e 's has now randomly read this while scrolling reddit and wants me to explain she was n't upset with me she just wanted to make sure her mum did n't have pink eye before she laughed having read all these comments we both think it 's pretty funny although we wo n't be going to her mums for sunday dinner this week 
 so its win win really 
 ok this did n't happen today it happened quite a long time ago 
 i was working at a print shop 
 i 'd only been working there for a month or so and still trying hard to impress the boss so he 'd eventually let me do some design work instead of just printing shit out for people all day 
 i tried to avoid customer service as much as possible 
 i was an awkward <unk> old 
 i usually made myself busy whenever i saw someone walking towards the front door hoping another person would take care of them 
 well today i was the only person available 
 everyone else was at a lunch meeting a few doors down 
 a customer walks in and they proudly place their brand new diploma on the counter and ask me if i could laminate it 
 i did n't want to 
 i 've seen all sorts of shit happen with that laminating machine 
 one time i lost an entire document inside it - i put it in and it came out as a wrinkly ball of plastic disappointment 
 so i tried to stall the customer hoping like hell my boss would come back and sort it out 
 being a diploma i could n't just make a <unk> as a spare if i fucked up the first one 
 i only had one shot 
 i ran out of things to talk about in regards to our laminating service 
 i knew the time had come to do the deed 
 i picked up the diploma walked over to the laminating machine and just went for it 
 it came out fucking perfectly 
 straight 
 not a bubble 
 smooth 
 i was so proud of myself 
 i walked back to the counter with a grin on my face like when you 're walking towards someone you know but you 're too far away to start talking but you 're terrible at acting <unk> i put the perfectly laminated diploma on the counter and then i see it 
 a long black curly pube 
 right there next to their name 
 it almost looked like a flourish like it was part of the design 
 but no there was no hiding it 
 something that was probably attached to my balls earlier that day was now a permanent part of this stranger 's life 
 i did n't know what to do 
 i quickly turned it over grabbed a paper bag and slid it inside 
 i told them ahh do n't worry about it '' in regards to payment 
 i wanted them out 
 they were very grateful 
 they picked it up and walked out 
 for the next few weeks i had to hide every time i heard to bell when someone came into the shop 
 just incase my pube <unk> had returned 
 maybe they never saw it 
 maybe my pube is still there proudly displayed on their wall ... i just do n't know 
 tl dr - laminated a pube into a customer 's diploma 
 still do n't know if they have seen it <unk> i know pickles are edible <unk> that exist 
 let me explain 
 i 'm in the airport with my mom returning from <unk> kong and we 're both starving 
 while i find us seats in the food court she buys two # <unk> from a curry place 
 the food is pretty amazing for the airport 
 i 'm almost done <unk> down when i notice a little white cup to the side filled with chunks of a solid green vegetable 
 they were sliced into <unk> so i could n't identify them at a glance and i was n't about to risk putting strange veggies into my mouth especially since it was some kind of <unk> <unk> food 
 hey mom what are these '' '' 
 huh 
 oh those are pickles '' 
 oh okay 
 i thought they might 've been cucumbers '' 
 yeah so you were right '' 
 ... wait what '' 
 at this point my mom stares at me blankly 
 yeah 
 they are cucumbers 
 pickled cucumbers '' 
 note that i love raw cucumbers and hate pickles with the passion of a thousand fiery suns 
 i reply in this <unk> confused tone : but you said they were pickles '' 
 they are pickles 
 pickles are pickled cucumbers '' 
 oh so now she 's just messing with me 
 everybody knows pickles are a separate breed of vegetables 
 like *really 
 this woman <unk> to <unk> me the <unk> on pickles 
 ha 
 how silly 
 i 'll prove 'er wrong 
 * i say something along the lines of you 're kidding me right 
 pickles are a whole other plant 
 there are pickle farms and there are cucumber farms '' 
 she 's just shaking her head looking a little <unk> so i proceed to tell her <unk> they taste completely different so how can they be the same 
 * i whip out my phone to prove her wrong ... and end up feeling like an utter moron 
 i 'm 110 % sure the tables around us were listening in 
 tl dr : my mother no longer thinks i 'm a gifted child 
 **edit : cucumbers are fruits i fu 'd twice witness my genius <unk> **edit # 2 : my very own reddit gold : ca n't thank you enough 
 and i 'm glad all these folks are learning about the secret origin of pickles 
 ** <unk> by cyae1 whoa thanks dude : after class the other day i went to pick up my younger sister at the middle school 
 when i got there i was shocked to see her getting beaten on by an older girl with a few others looking on 
 she was n't even fighting back 
 she was just curled up covering her face 
 i broke into a run and yelled for them to leave her alone 
 the girl who was hitting her just sort of looked at me probably thinking i was some <unk> worker coming to shoo her away 
 she started it '' 
 the bully lied 
 bullshit 
 i shoved her out of the way and checked up on my sister 
 she had some scrapes but otherwise seemed okay just shaken 
 i 've never seen her so scared though 
 tears were just pouring down her face 
 the bully girl did n't give a fuck tried to pin the fight on her and grabbed a <unk> of her hair 
 well shit i kinda lost control and <unk> her upside the head 
 her friends started screaming and they all <unk> off 
 i took my sister inside to get cleaned up by the nurse 
 she promised to let the principal know about our <unk> 
 that night our parents got a phone call 
 apparently i punched that girl so hard that her jaw <unk> and her dad was shitting himself with rage 
 my parents think i did the right thing but we could potentially be in some legal trouble 
 we know the bully 's family has no case multiple witnesses could identify her as the aggressor and my sister has a black eye but they could buy a good lawyer which is much more powerful 
 we 'll just have to see where this goes 
 tl dr punched a kid who was <unk> my sister may get <unk> actually happened just a few minutes ago.. so me and the wife are sitting together watching family <unk> the question on the show is name something your wife talks to you about but you have no interest in '' 
 the first family answered with the obvious answers her clothes and her friends 
 they could n't figure out the last two so steve harvey asked the second family name something your wife talks to you about but you have no interest in '' 
 i immediately blurt out her feelings '' 
 it 's been 30 minutes now and i am still trying to convince her that i care about her feelings i just thought that 's how other people would answer 
 i 'm such a dumbass 
 background : so i work as a chef at a pretty popular restaurant in city <unk> 
 since <unk> has begun we 've been taking in a few students from local high schools to <unk> in the kitchen 
 it 's nothing special really : washing the dishes taking out garbage preparing very simple ingredients 
 it 's a pretty positive <unk> program for kids who wish to get into any trade schools 
 this semester we 've taken in three students one of whom has down syndrome 
 let 's call the special needs kid ricky for the story 's sake 
 ricky 's got a strong work <unk> very positive and to be honest seems to be more capable than the other two idiots we have working with us 
 i could go on a tirade about them but this is my tifu and not a time to get something off my chest 
 tuesday nights are nights when students are allowed to work as long as they want for more money it 's great for people who do n't want to find a different job and of course ricky wants to stay until close 
 it 's great for me since with two cooks sick today the cleanup process would be forever and a day 
 with time winding down and the restaurant about to close i told ricky he could put some unused ingredients back in the walk-in freezer and take a break after he was done 
 a few cooks and i finished the cleanup work and we got ready to go home 
 i did a quick inventory of the kitchen and saw ricky 's sweater was gone so i assumed he went home 
 naturally i thought nothing of it and left 
 i get home pour myself a few vodka shots <unk> alcoholic here yeah sorry mom and read a bit before passing out in bed 
 about two hours ago i get a phone call and my boss is screaming at me 
 ricky 's parents have called the cops as well as the restaurant owner 
 ricky was missing 
 of course since i was the last person to see him i was considered somewhat <unk> for this 
 my boss was having a <unk> and a half by calling me every 10 minutes while i drove down to the restaurant 
 ricky was n't answering his phone and i was getting legitimately worried 
 i have a history of not working well with high school students but i really liked this kid and wanted him to be safe 
 i get to the restaurant to find my boss several cops what appeared to be ricky 's parents and ... ricky 
 thank fuck he was found and my worries had come to an end ... or so i thought 
 it turns out ricky interpreted my telling him to take a break after putting unused ingredients in the freezer ... to take a break in the freezer 
 naturally or thankfully he brought his sweater in with his nintendo ds into the freezer 
 he did n't know how to use the emergency escape or notification we show all the new people how to use it in the event they 're trapped in a fridge or freezer and left his phone in one of the <unk> 
 i was just so happy to see he was okay i gave him a hug 
 i 've never felt someone so cold in my life 
 surely hypothermia and pneumonia 
 my <unk> did n't end there 
 staychilly you smell like <unk> '' 
 what do you mean ricky '' 
 your breath smells like mosquito spray '' 
 the cops look at me and lean in to smell the vodka shots i had a few hours prior on my breath 
 i 'm immediately forced to take a breathalyzer test passed while being judged by pretty much everyone present 
 it gets worse 
 after i hugged ricky he looks at my chest and well cold does things to people 's nipples 
 in my haste i forgot to put on a bra and had <unk> <unk> as my ex used to call it 
 ricky although innocent loudly blurts are you turned on staychilly '' 
 by this point i 'm so embarrassed and ashamed my face is red as can be 
 in one night i successfully lock a kid with down syndrome in a freezer forget about him take a breathalyzer test and forget a bra at the most <unk> time ... ever 
 ... my boss has n't returned any calls or texts in the hours after 
 ... coworkers are asking my recipe for <unk> '' 
 ... ricky 's been at the hospital telling people he turns me on 
 i 'm dreading tomorrow morning 
 edit : so work has definitely been interesting 
 if anyone works in a kitchen they 'll know any story travels incredibly fast 
 the two cooks that were sick 
 as soon as i got in today they were singing *let him go 
 let him goooooo 
 * <unk> n't freeze <unk> kids anymore 
 * *let him go 
 let him goooooo 
 * <unk> a break and slam the door 
 * people have started calling me <unk> 
 it gets somewhat better i suppose 
 i 've got several angry phone calls from ricky 's school and his parents for being so negligent 
 my boss has been trying to laugh it off but at the same time he 's throwing me under the bus so i can take full responsibility which i should i did n't check the freezer in the event the restaurant gets blamed 
 i 'm amazed with all the feedback wow 
 ricky 's got mild hypothermia but is expected to recover fully 
 he does n't seem too mad 
 i 'll keep you all updated as the day progresses 
 edit ii : so i went to the hospital to visit ricky and drop off a large serving of our <unk> 
 his parents are n't talking to me and nearly sent me on my way 
 ricky 's brother a redditor who saw this post on the front page thanked me for the kind gesture and also <unk> me for my <unk> regarding <unk> with down syndrome 
 i 'm still scared as hell that the parents are going to take legal action 
 also thank you very much to whoever gave me gold for this post 
 i ca n't thank you guys enough i bought the citi kitty toilet training system about two months ago 
 if you 've never heard of it it 's a <unk> plastic litter box that fits between the rim and seat of the toilet 
 it has inserts that can be removed to make a hole in the litter box 
 over the course of a few months you gradually take out all the inserts until your cat is doing his business in the toilet 
 the first week went <unk> 
 cat transitioned from his regular little box to the citi kitty with no problems 
 i decided it was time to remove the first insert 
 this is when i began smelling strange things in my bedroom 
 i soon discovered that instead of pooping in the citi kitty training box my cat had been sneaking into my closet and <unk> off his kitty <unk> into various <unk> and boots 
 i thought to myself okay he 's just <unk> 
 he 'll learn '' 
 with the use of <unk> cat nip and praise cat began doing his business in the citi kitty training box 
 victory 
 after a few weeks i removed a second insert 
 the <unk> of that one insert shattered my cat 's world and sent him on a downward spiral into a psychological kitty breakdown 
 he began to believe that everything white and porcelain was his toilet 
 one evening i discovered him hunched in the bathtub doing his best to hide behind the shower curtain 
 the final straw was when i went into the bathroom looking forward to washing my face and brushing my teeth after a long day only to discover a steaming pile of brown shame in my bathroom sink 
 that was it 
 i could n't take it anymore 
 i put the insert back in and <unk> training for a month 
 during that month cat got used to doing his kitty business in the citi kitty litter box 
 all the inserts were back in so there was no hole for him to see the toilet water below 
 i figured eh why not might as well give it another go 
 i removed the insert 
 it was a terrible mistake 
 this morning i woke up to the sound of my cat howling and moaning in pain 
 i rushed out of the bedroom and the smell of cat poop hit me like a brick 
 i searched high and low for the source of the smell 
 finally ... i found it 
 my fucking cat took a shit on my cactus 
 so purchase the shitty kitty toilet training system if you enjoy cleaning poop out of your shoes the tub and the bathroom sink and if you would get a kick out of seeing your cat <unk> his butthole while trying to relieve himself on a cactus 
 edit : everyone who wants to see the cactus <unk> sorry : everyone who wants to see the rest of my <unk> family : thanks for the gold 
 totally makes the <unk> poop under the <unk> and chance of <unk> e.coli worth <unk> by having my penis touched for the first time 
 i 've made some edits to the story so hopefully it is easier to read 
 sorry that it was poorly written before 
 -- - when i was younger i went on a lot of mission trips with my church 
 this takes place the summer after my 15th birthday 
 we all piled into the astrovan 8 of us 
 my best friend growing up let 's call him sam the main female in the story let 's call her hanna and i took the back seats 
 she made herself comfortable between us in the middle of the <unk> 
 soon we were all piled in the engine <unk> to life and we were off 
 the trip this year was in ohio 
 it was roughly a three hour trip from home 
 maybe fifteen minutes into the trip hanna brought out this <unk> 
 you may remember the type : green four <unk> vibrating 
 we took turns giving each other innocent massages but slowly it 's vibrations shook a palpable sexual tension over the back three seats of the van 
 it definitely was not uncommon to feel that way back then but this was the first time i knew a female was feeling it about me too 
 her massage found its way to my legs 
 a glancing buzz to my thigh 
 oddly enough it was not just me getting the <unk> treatment 
 sam as well was being given the same genital teasing <unk> 
 she was buzzing our towers closer than tom cruise in top gun 
 then as things reached a critical <unk> sam passes me a note by way of his phone 's notepad 
 let her massage your dick '' it said 
 i was shy very shy but there was nothing hesitant about the urgent fashion i pecked out the letters <unk> on that <unk> keyboard 
 my <unk> and <unk> however had met its match in sam 's ability to manipulate simple text 
 as quickly as i had typed no he changed it to yes and accidentally '' let hanna see 
 now one thing we can all agree on is a young inexperienced male in the heat of puberty can be <unk> by nothing more than a <unk> 
 i was no different 
 moments later her hand had slid up my gym shorts and her hands began to explore my crotch 
 i positioned a blanket over my lap and more or less gave her free <unk> of my <unk> 
 now despite my <unk> <unk> for what was now happening it was accompanied by a sudden <unk> realization that she had not developed the same <unk> stroke that i had grown accustomed 
 i was the opposite of enjoying it '' but had enough <unk> awareness to realize what was happening was too rare for me to reject 
 the setting was n't great her technique was worse but i hope that you all will understand why i felt <unk> to try my best to appreciate my circumstances 
 fast-forward an hour 
 imagine all the ways <unk> had <unk> this poor girl wrong and <unk> with me 
 i was paying the price of years of poorly researched techniques in somehow <unk> printed <unk> 
 the fact that this <unk> act was still being performed on my <unk> jewels that long after should be evidence enough of her lack of <unk> 
 there was a lot of squeezing and tugging not things i would <unk> associate with enjoyment in those regions 
 after a little more than an hour total the astrovan stopped for lunch 
 as did the other vehicles 
 it was a great but only temporary reprieve 
 sam had a <unk> & amp j sandwich and a laugh at my suffering 
 i do n't remember having much of an appetite 
 now let me remind you at this <unk> that we were on a mission trip through our church with my church 's youth group 
 the mission trip was to last 5 days 
 we 'd brought sleeping bags pillows and blankets so we 'd be comfortable sleeping on the floor of a community center <unk> 
 okay 
 got it 
 now let 's continue 
 my reprieve as i stated before was only temporary 
 when we were back on the road sam and i flipped our places in the back of the van presumably to give her other arm a rest 
 almost immediately it began again 
 i pulled my hat over my eyes faking sleep but the rise and fall of my blanket in my lap proved my <unk> 
 some thirty minutes later something happened 
 something that gave me reasonable cause to write in to <unk> 's complaint department and file a <unk> <unk> 
 the basketball shorts i was wearing hardly provided barrier to my more protected '' <unk> 
 her hand being slid up my shorts was right there ... some guys like fingers in their rectum i get that but that section of the article should 've been <unk> with adequate prerequisite stipulations 
 1 never in a van 2 never while with your church group 3 never suddenly aggressively or 4 while wearing sharp gel nails 
 fuck man 
 this entire time sam is very aware of my displeasure 
 i think he may of giggled just then 
 fast forward five more minutes 
 sam somehow still thoroughly <unk> in a <unk> act of triage gives her some much needed pointers 
 pointers '' of a completely different variety if you catch my drift 
 i think he gestured to her the proper technique because suddenly things got a lot more focused in a great way 
 suddenly it become pleasurable 
 the pleasure grows 
 finally in much the fashion you 'd expect of someone in my situation i was not far from relief 
 this is where i unintentionally <unk> my revenge on this <unk> penile perpetrator 
 i lifted the blanket off my crotch as i <unk> exposing my cock and creating an <unk> as where the explosion would go 
 her reaction perhaps also from lack of real-life experience was to raise a shield to protect herself from what i can only guess she assumed would be enormous and deadly 
 and actually to my surprise as much as hers it was 
 it absolutely devastated her shield 
 which was her pillow 
 the one that she would be sleeping on for the next five nights ... she made a sound then 
 not a grunt or a scream 
 not a sound that has a name 
 for the sake of building it with your imagination let 's call it the someone <unk> everywhere '' sound 
 fleeting innocence utter shock sadness fury all boiled down into one <unk> <unk> 
 we have n't spoken since 
 -- -- -- - tldr : my first handjob lasted two hours 
 got a finger in my butt 
 finally came on the pillow the girl was going to need for the next week 
 this happened late yesterday afternoon and i 'm still trying to deal with the aftermath 
 since <unk> of 2013 i 've lost about 30 pounds which has been really great but it came back to bite me yesterday 
 it bit hard 
 after my wife was done with work yesterday afternoon she thought it would be a good idea for our two boys to play in the 6 or 7 inches of snow that had fallen overnight 
 so we bundled up the kiddos grabbed the saucer and went out in our backyard to slide down the little hill 
 since the kids are 1 and 3 this little grade is perfect for them to <unk> down 
 being dad i had to take a few runs myself just to see what it was like 
 it was good but it could be bit longer so i decided to go down a different way and make a new path 
 i ran 
 i jumped on the saucer 
 i went down the hill and fell off getting powder all over me in my boots up my pants and in my gloves 
 quickly i pulled my glove off of my left hand and shook the snow off 
 that 's when i felt it go 
 it felt like eternity but there was nothing i could do in that split second 
 my white gold wedding band went flying off my finger and landed somewhere in the snow 
 after losing the weight my ring has been really loose loose enough to come off while shaking my hand 
 i have no idea where it is 
 my attempts at <unk> the snow were futile last night 
 my finger feels weird without it and my wife thinks i 'm a complete <unk> 
 yifu 
 tl dr : lost weight went <unk> 
 got snow in my gloves and flung my loose wedding band into 6 or 7 inches of fresh <unk> <unk> by accidentally getting my cleaning lady high as fuck so yesterday i had a friend that was going to come over to play some mario kart in the afternoon 
 the problem was i had told my cleaning lady an older hispanic lady in her <unk> to come over at 3pm and she likes to have the place to herself when she cleans which meant that either i had to tell her or my friend to come earlier 
 i messaged maria and she agreed to come earlier at 11am which would <unk> well with a lunch meeting i had to be at 
 i gave her the normal $ 100 plus an extra $ 20 for being willing to come early and not giving me a hard time and then left the house figuring she 'd be gone by the time i got back 
 i pull into my parking spot and see that her car is still there 
 hmmm that 's strange 
 wonder what took so long 
 my place is not that big and she did say she had extra energy today which sounded to me like she thought she 'd be finished by the time i got home 
 as i open the door i can see the place is almost finished 
 pretty nice job as usual maria 
 but then she looks at me with terror in her eyes 
 she says i ate the chocolate '' 
 you <unk> <unk> 
 she says she ate the chocolate and now <unk> weird 
 kinda tired 
 i said omg maria you ate the wrong chocolate 
 she ate an entire <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> edible 
 this was a <unk> from a <unk> i got a couple months ago that i left lying around because i did n't want to fuck with it because it did n't say how much thc was in it 
 anybody who 's tried <unk> before knows that you can easily eat way more than you need to and thus it 's better to <unk> on the side of caution and dose small at first 
 maria asks me if she 's gon na die 
 i think about it for a second and remember that nobody in the history of planet earth has ingested so much thc that they died from it 
 however with my luck this could easily be the first case in history of that happening 
 i laughed and told her no maria you 're not gon na die but you might have a bad trip 
 i tell her that it was <unk> in the chocolate and asked how long ago she ate it 
 she said 30 minutes so i suggested she throw it up so as to save herself from letting it <unk> further 
 she tried but to no avail 
 i said well maria you can chill here until it wears off you 're certainly in no shape to drive 
 she <unk> agreed and thus began probably the worst trip she 's ever had in her life 
 this poor lady sat on my couch trying not to die for the next 7 hours 
 i searched the <unk> for any information i could find about how much thc was in this bad boy since there was none on the wrapper 
 turns out there 's 120mg of thc aka 1.2 grams 
 the chocolate bar was <unk> off in 12 meaning she ate <unk> a regular dose 
 then i start searching for anything i can find about what to do when someone 's eaten more weed than they should have and the best i can come up with is one post on <unk> about how milk and cookies can help sober you up 
 my friend agrees to bring milk and cookies and finds maria on my couch all bundled up in a blanket 
 i tried to sit with her and keep her company but she was n't having it 
 tried to turn on the tv or put some music on was n't having it 
 she told me not to look at her and to not call any mens <unk> '' which i believe meant that she felt like someone might take advantage of her in her vulnerable state 
 clearly the paranoia has set in 
 anyways my friend shows up with the milk and cookies and she agrees to eat one and drink a little milk 
 we play mario kart in the other room and check on her every now and then between races 
 a couple hours pass the sun has gone down she 's now 4 hours into the ride of her life when we check on her 
 i ate all the cookies '' 
 we laugh our asses off and tell her that that was what they were for and she begins to look a little relieved 
 slowly over the next couple hours she starts to look less terrified and actually a little refreshed 
 my friend leaves to go to dinner with her girlfriends and i make plans to go out as well telling maria that i have to leave at 9:30 but that she 's more than welcome to stay until she 's cool to drive 
 she says my place is scary at night by herself so she 's going to sleep in the car if that 's ok. i say sure that 's fine go ahead and that i 'd be back to check on her when i got home but that if she went home to please text me that she made it back 
 10:30 rolls around and i 'm in the club telling the story to my boys when i get the message : i got home thank god '' 
 phew 
 our <unk> nightmare is over and order has been restored 
 but i do n't think she will ever ever ever ever eat anything in my house ever again 
 the irony was that if she 'd only been a little less picky in her chocolate choices she woulda been fine 
 i 'd recently come back to canada with a huge dark chocolate bar that was easily 3x the size of the edible but she did n't eat that one which was plainly in sight 
 nope she went for what she thought was the one i 'd forgotten about and karma was an instant bitch yesterday 
 now the only question is : should i call her back to clean next month 
 tldr my cleaning lady ate an entire fucking edible and spent the afternoon high out of her mind on my couch 
 bonus : maria on the ride of her life **edit : ** thanks for the gold 
 made the front page for the first time ever 
 here are some replies to frequent comments : - i had n't seen the al <unk> bit until now but that shit is hella funny 
 i can 100 % assure you that this really did happen on friday 
 - i did offer to drive her home early in the afternoon and my friend certainly woulda followed in her car but she was n't having it because her family was at home and she was freaking out 
 - by the time 9:30 rolled around she was definitely down from a 10 to a 3 and looked visibly refreshed 
 my parking garage is underground and <unk> so she was in no danger to chill down there for a bit 
 based on when i got the text message and when i left she chilled for half an hour and bounced 
 - turns out 120mg is only <unk> grams not 1.2 so phew 
 thank god my metric math sucks 
 she 'd <unk> still be trippin if it were more 
 - for the record i did n't take the photo my friend did 
 she was like let 's take a picture '' 
 and i said no but she did it when i was in the other room anyways 
 when she showed me at the club her and her friends showed up later and also thought it was hilarious i fuckin died and decided to post it 
 hey at least i <unk> her face 
 - the candy bar was definitely labeled : before anything sorry for my english 
 so friday night a friend of mine called to tell me that he 's alone in the house and we should invite some people for a house party 
 alright nice 
 i call some of my friends including this horny one 
 let 's call him joe 
 i call some girls too and by the <unk> of the party there was 7 people : <unk> **joe** **guy1** **guy2** **girl1** **girl2** and <unk> 
 we started drinking and talking and people just spread around in the house 
 some were in the balcony it was a apartment some in the bedroom some in the living room 
 after a while i heard a scream and one of the girls leaves the bedroom covered only by the bed sheets 
 wtf 
 everybody left the apartment because the mood got heavy 
 i was driving home me and my friend so i ask him : joe what happened 
 here it goes : & gt **joe** : yeah ... so i was in the bedroom with **guy1** and **girl1** 
 we were chatting no big deal 
 all of a sudden **guy2** enters the room with **girl2** 
 they were hooking up so the three of us decided to leave the bedroom so they could use it 
 as we leave i turned off the lights and realized the room got pitch black 
 so i decided to stay inside since they would n't see me 
 i closed the door and stayed by the wall 
 they started <unk> up on the bed as i could hear 
 given time your sight starts to get used to the dark 
 so i could see forms and shapes 
 i could see them fucking 
 i started to jacking off 
 the girl was on four and basically i was in her <unk> direction but she did not see me 
 the guy was fucking her really hard and i started to jack off even harder and then ... she sees me 
 she screams saying <unk> somebody <unk> 
 so i started apologizing and turned on the lights 
 as they see me and i see them now in the light we all turn to another corner of the bedroom : there was **guy1** there dick in hand 
 he started to apologize as well then she leaves the room screaming '' 
 **tl dr : ** invited a horny friend to a house party 
 he sneaked in a bedroom with couple fucking in it 
 they see him after a while 
 then they realize there was a even more ninja guy in another corner as well 
 **the tale of the horny <unk> **edit : ** since 3 guys were in the bedroom me and the other 2 girls just thought the ninja <unk> were buying <unk> at the gas station down the street 
 this all happened in the <unk> of 5 minutes or less 
 <unk> : ** all the girls were ours friends so they just laughed about it afterwards 
 the only new face to them was the second ninja 
 he was friend of the guy who got ninja-cockblocked 
 <unk> : ** a lot of people are calling it fake 
 i do n't mind but i 'll try to answer some questions people are making 
 <unk> did n't <unk> notice why she left the bedroom alone 
 ** *i sent her a message about that 
 she said she went straight to the bathroom 
 when she left the bathroom she did n't even think about joe and <unk> 
 * <unk> how they did n't notice the second ninja <unk> 
 ** *that 's the beauty 
 nobody knows 
 * <unk> who was the host 
 ** *the guy who got ninja-cockblocked 
 <unk> many have asked here is the not very long <unk> ending the the van the xbox and the tickets 
 trial was on friday 
 not so much trial as it is just to go down to the court house and see if the crown would consider dropping charges or <unk> the size of the fines 
 it had been asked lots of times so the ticket breakdown was 250 $ for no <unk> 250 $ for operating a <unk> vehicle with and improper license and <unk> $ for having no insurance 
 i got to the court house and sat down in the chambers 
 there were quite a few other people there 
 it made me feel a lot more comfortable when there are 3 or 4 people being called ahead of me being charged with theft attempted murder etc etc 
 it 's interesting that they have traffic <unk> and violent <unk> at the same place 
 small town thing i guess 
 my name was called i walked up to the cue 
 the judge asked me if i would like to speak to duty <unk> 
 i had never been to a court house in my life and being that i was <unk> myself any sort of help seemed reasonable 
 i agreed and an older gentlemen walked me out of the chamber and into his tiny little office 
 i do n't know how or why but this man was my saving grace 
 he sits me down and says <unk> i can likely drop the insurance ticket just pay the other 2 
 so 500 $ instead of 3000 $ sounds pretty awesome 
 so he and i walk back i to chambers and i 'm called again 
 this time the old man stands at the cue for me and asks the judge to drop the one charge 
 i had never been in trouble before so the judge looked at my record turned to me and said 'this the last time i see you

 also proof sian anderton playstation access community manager follow : @ <unk> | like : <unk> | play : <unk> <unk> sony computer entertainment uk limited today i fucked up because anonymous sex 
 craigslist is typically a failure but i 've had enough success that i still go back to it now and then 
 about a month ago i answered an ad for a couple where the husband was going to tie up his wife so i could use her free to cum where i wanted to 
 we ended up not meeting but there had been good contact 
 so yesterday i was responding to craigslist <unk> hoping for the best when i saw the same couple posting 
 i responded we chatted a bit and they asked me to come by this morning 
 bright and early and horny i woke up and started emailing then right away 
 apparently they were equally excited and were responding immediately 
 anyway about two or three hours later i show up to the house and am greeted by the husband 
 we talk for a minute as he makes sure i 'm safe and i make sure there is n't a hidden <unk> next to a stack of plastic trash bags 
 there were n't and apparently i do n't come across as crazy 
 ground rules were : no hurting her no anal she stays blindfolded cum anywhere except in her pussy and i have to be ok with him jerking off and watching 
 deal 
 so i went into the room designated which looked like a tv room 
 she was blindfolded and tied to an armour thing 
 i did n't look around too much but all pictures and stuff were covered or laid down 
 i fucked her from behind like crazy her husband jerked off 
 while i was fucking her i noticed a tattoo of a star on her shoulder but thought nothing of it 
 i fucked her like that for about 10 minutes and she was groaning heavily 
 eventually he got in front of her and she gave him head while i kept fucking 
 shortly after it was time to cum and i shot it all up her back even onto her shoulder tattoo 
 exhausted and hot i stood there for a moment watching her blow him until i began to feel awkward 
 i backed up slowly and started putting my clothes back on and neither of them seemed to notice 
 i asked if i could grab a drink before i left and he told me to grab a water bottle off the kitchen table and promptly forgot about me 
 i walked into the kitchen and grabbed the water bottle when i noticed a picture on the fridge - exactly the same picture on my fridge of my grandma holding my cousins baby both my grandma and my cousins baby died within a week of eachother from individual natural causes it was very <unk> for my entire family 
 immediately i went to my car and tried to figure out wtf happened 
 after about half an hour on facebook i found an aunt of mine at a wedding with the husband of the woman i had just fucked 
 a few clicks around his profile and i saw the picture of my cousin getting a star tattoo 
 i had not even known she got married or that she lived in this state again 
 hell i had n't seen her since we were kids and she had all but become forgotten 
 so that 's out and i guess i 'm the only one who knows as long as i continue to avoid family events 
 update : my cousin is a redditor and now her husband wants to kick my ass 
 so i 'm just gon na stop here and go to sleep while i contemplate whether or not to sleep with a <unk> 
 good night reddit thanks for helping me feel better 
 or <unk> 
 i guess it depends how you look at it 
 to my cousin and her husband : i 'm sorry you read this i did n't think you would i just assumed it would disappear into the internet 
 read what i said please nothing was disrespectful and i really did have a good time with you.. this post was not about anything negative and i swear i will never mention this to anyone ever again 
 really i 'm sorry 
 so basically cheque came and i was super happy so i wanted to tell my mom about it 
 which in hindsight is where is my first fuck up is because my 50+ year old <unk> mom thinks that any making money on the internet is secretly a scam to steal all of our personal information run by the <unk> 
 realizing that i fucked up by even mentioning money and internet in the same sentence i attempted calmly walk away before she got curious 
 she got curious 
 i immediately responded with <unk> mom you are going to <unk> what i 'm going to say and we are gon na have a stupid argument '' she chuckles and responds with im not that much of an immigrant '' so i gave her the benefit of the doubt and explained i signed up with a network a few months back and did all the paperwork on my own since i just turned 18 
 she was cool with it at first and asked how ad <unk> works i explained its based on how many people watch 
 she asked if anyone in our neighbourhood shitty could watch it i just said its open for everyone to see and that yeah **someone i know could see it** 
 noticing she is getting a bit upset i tried to end the conversation 
 <unk> <unk> : my mom kept me inside alot as a kid because she assumed the kids in my area were a bad influence and even at 18 them watching me tell jokes online was a huge <unk> that could lead to be selling drugs 
 actual thing she said but again she calmed down and asked about the paperwork when i signed up for my network 
 knowing that if i bailed now she 'll assume the worst and i 'd be fucked i told he about how filled out a <unk> form cause im in canada for the irs using **my sin ** and some other things along those lines 
 i 'm screaming internally waiting for the oncoming storm but she replies with so is there a limit to how much you make '' 
 and said nope just depends if enough people watch 
 **think of it like commission** im fucking amazed that my mom is actually believing in me instead of making up the usual <unk> insane <unk> theory of crime and identity theft 
 but i was wrong *she just felt a little slow about it today* # so so the the three magic nails in my coffin appear **someone i know could see it** **my sin ** and the fucking stupidest one **think of it like commission** *i see it now * the people in our neighbourhood told you could make money online with dumb videos but they really just wanted your sin so they could steal your identity and make money off your work so they told it was commission so you 'd be okay with getting such a low amount '' 
 at this point i 've given up hope but 
 we had to pray so that bought me some few moments of peace before what i was expecting to be a beating 
 but nope no beating instead i came upstairs to my <unk> being thrown downstairs all while hearing my mom wail you ruined our lives you sold all of id '' you so stupid how could you not see it '' how could an idiot that can be taken advantage of so badly be my son '' and worst part was i knew she was so mad that anything i will be <unk> so i took my computer into my room because mic and monitor are fucked now and checked if it worked 
 i took our old kind of broken tv from the basement and tried to use it as a monitor to see if the comp worked i got a black screen at first but then realized that only my <unk> broke rip my shitty <unk> <unk> you served me well : <unk> 
 so currently in my room with the door locked with a now worse computer and no mic 
 so also rip my youtube channel 
 **tl dr** immigrant mom <unk> child from <unk> let 's play slave ring by destroying his mic monitor and graphics card 
 **edit** : thanks for the willingness to help it 's appreciated but rule 10 need to be a good redditor : p may make an external thread later **edit 2** : stop saying its a $ 100 my network pays me not youtube sent the mods proof here you go first off this happened yesterday but i was a bit injured so i could n't write this 
 anyways let 's just get right to it 
 so every morning as i get ready for school i shower because personal hygiene is a good thing 
 this particular morning i was a bit <unk> so i was getting <unk> 
 i went to take my underwear off and the big toe on my right foot got caught in my underwear and i fell over head first into the door 
 the next thing i know i am butt ass naked laying in my bathroom with my mom on the phone with 911. she is freaking the fuck out and i quote he is naked on the ground unconscious 
 i dont know what happened just please come '' 
 so the ambulance comes and wind up going to the emergency room in just my underwear 
 now i am being tested for a concussion 
 tl dr : my underwear tried to kill me 
 edit : holy shit just got back from going out and this blew up 
 also there was no injury i was just a bit banged up 
 edit 2 : for clarification i was not going to school but showering to keep clean 
 sorry for confusion 
 i know yesterday was saturday i forgot since my head is <unk> up 
 i 'm just getting home now and want to share this pretty mild but utterly stupid fuckup with you 
 on my way over here i drove up to a red traffic light 
 since i wanted to make a right turn i lined up in the <unk> lane behind 4 or 5 cars 
 as the light goes green and nobody moves i begin to boil a little 
 although i 'm pretty sure everybody zones out and starts <unk> in traffic at least once in his life i ca n't stand if that happens in front of me and costs me precious seconds i could spend doing things i like better than waiting 
 and as much as i hate this i love to put people in their place for it 
 so obviously i made sure absolutely everybody around me got to hear my horn and the pretty admirable tirade of only the finest <unk> and insults my vocabulary has to offer 
 a few seconds later when still nothing happened it hit me : the cars in front of me were parked <unk> : this happened two hours ago and i 'm still embarrassed 
 for those of you who do n't know michael 's is a craft store with everything 
 i 'm an 18 year old girl in college and i happen to have a boyfriend 
 parents like said boyfriend blah blah blah 
 now onto the story ... my mom was excited because michael 's was having a 70 % off christmas sale and a lot of other things were marked down too 
 i live in a dorm room so i went to check out <unk> oh sweet storage space 
 after examining several that were cute but still out of my price range i found a grey wicker basket with a white canvas lining 
 it fit perfectly with my color scheme and i was <unk> to see the price after the discount was $ 7 
 i touched it and said i like this one '' and then turned to my mom to ask if i could get it 
 her jaw had gone slack and tears welled up in her eyes 
 but you 're so young '' she said 
 confused i looked at the basket and realised the front had baby things '' <unk> in french script 
 for some reason i thought the response oh no i 'm not pregnant yet '' was the perfect response 
 my dad an aisle over said what the fuck '' and everyone immediately looked in our vicinity 
 after a few moments of mortal terror i convinced my parents that no i was not pregnant and yes i was telling the truth 
 after my mom calmed down we immediately checked out and left 
 in the car they asked if i was using condoms 
 good times 
 and i did n't even get a basket 
 tl dr fucked up by making my mom cry in a crafts store by telling her i was pregnant but not really edit : fixed a <unk> edit2 : thanks for the gold 
 : d he always shakes everything out before he puts it on no matter where he got it from -- floor closet drawer 
 he <unk> his clothing thoroughly and also usually folds things neatly even when they 're dirty 
 and usually if anything 's been on the floor as long as he does n't need it immediately he 'll automatically toss it into the laundry even if he knows it 's clean 
 at any given time his clothes make up a good 70 % of the clothes i wash and he rarely touches something that 's been deemed <unk> 
 i always thought he was being a lazy weirdo but now i know the truth 
 because as soon as i slipped my arm in the sleeve of my robe today which i took directly off its designated hook a huge house <unk> <unk> out over my hand and fell on the floor 
 it was so big that it made a <unk> when it landed 
 it is now setting up camp under our bed 
 i feel so violated and the worst part is i had just finished showering and there is no way there 's enough hot water left to wash away the feeling of its <unk> little legs 
 i ca n't even trust clean clothes that have been put away 
 boyfriend 's response : and now you know why 
 edit : no sign of the beast for now 
 oh and as many have pointed out despite looking like little creepy aliens house <unk> are good to have around 
 i just prefer them to not be in my clothes or on my person 
 also i live in canada in <unk> for everybody asking 
 tifu by cussing out a <unk> 
 **bzzzzt** ... **bzzzzt** ... *ring ring* as is often the case when i hear that <unk> ringtone for unknown numbers i pause to consider what i might possibly say to whomever i discover on the other end 
 typically i will be greeted with utter silence or the tell-tale click of a <unk> dropping the call but i always steel myself for the possibility of genuine human speech <unk> in response to my ... • me : hello '' 
 • phone : ***do you want to make money from home 
 more money than you have ever seen in your <unk> 
 *** '' dammit 
 it 's a recorded message and it was loud 
 those are n't nearly as fun because you do n't get to cuss anyone 
 for the most part i have learned that the only way to stop them from calling back is to wait until they finish their speech and get to the part where you can ... • phone : <unk> 1 for more information 
 *** or press 9 to be removed from our list '' • me : presses 9 
 • phone : <unk> you for <unk> up 
 *** someone will be calling you real soon '' 
 • me : you son of a bitch '' 
 • phone : *click* '' it takes a lot to piss me off 
 it really does 
 there 's very few things that make me want to punch faces in this world and this sort of thing ranks right up there ... <unk> above <unk> this put me in mind of that ol classic cat facts '' prank 
 still maybe they just got their wires crossed 
 i highly doubt that my phone was going to ... **bzzzzt** ... **bzzzzt** ... *ring ring* • me : hello '' 
 • phone : thanks for telling us you wanted more information about this great offer 
 my name is mike and i want to ... '' blah blah blah ... write down my number in case you have any questions 
 that number is <unk> '' 
 • me : *click* '' okay ... so now i have this piece of shit 's *actual* phone number 
 time to teach him a lesson 
 • me : ... <unk> ... waiting ... 
 ringing 
 • phone : leave a message 
 <unk> 
 *** '' • me : hey mike 
 guess what you can do 
 you can eat my *actual* asshole 
 that 's right 
 it 's covered with fresh chocolate frosting too 
 it might taste a little strange at first but you 'll get used to it ... <unk> mom did 
 *** *click* '' haha 
 yeah i sure showed that guy did n't i. just a little harmless fun after all 
 right 
 **bzzzzt** ... **bzzzzt** ... *ring ring* • me : hello '' 
 • random dude : yeah did i just miss a call from you '' 
 • me : check the number ... not the one i just called ... no sorry 
 was n't me '' 
 • random dude : oh okay then 
 bye '' 
 *click* **bzzzzt** ... **bzzzzt** ... *ring ring* • me : hello '' 
 • random chick : who is this '' 
 • me : excuse me '' 
 • random chick : who is this 
 why you be <unk> my phone 
 take me off yo list '' 
 *click* oh shit ... a little light bulb just popped on over my ... **bzzzzt** ... **bzzzzt** ... *ring ring* • me : hello '' 
 • random chick : did i just miss a call from you '' 
 <unk> 
 fucker 
 *** over the course of the next 4 hours my phone was <unk> with calls from <unk> people wanting to be taken off the list 
 it was nuts 
 hundreds of calls 
 text messages 
 my voicemail box was destroyed 
 <unk> bastard changed the number <unk> id shows to give people my number instead 
 *** pissed off does n't begin to describe how i felt 
 fortunately that phone number was one i only used for close family so it was a <unk> matter to change it but still 
 so yeah ... he got me good 
 tl dr - i left a choice message on a <unk> voicemail 
 he made me his bitch 
 ***edit : r.i.p 
 inbox 
 <unk> my life seems to be stitched together by tifu moments going back as far as i can remember 
 anyway this one happened this morning ... i was taking a shower pretty normal nothing out of the ordinary 
 i have a toothbrush and some toothpaste on the little rack thing some days i 'll brush my teeth while showering some days i 'll do it over the sink 
 i was up early so was taking my time doing stupid stuff like filling my ears up with water seeing how hot i could handle the water ... stupid shit like <unk> 'm 32 btw 
 then i decided to brush my teeth 
 but instead of brushing to and <unk> with my hand i closed my eyes and shook my head side to side 
 i was trying to see if i could get my whole mouth done while keeping my arm in a fixed position 
 it worked quite well until i 'd finished ... the second i stopped brushing and opened my eyes i was unable see straight or balance and it felt like the whole bath tub was sinking on one side 
 i grabbed the shower curtain to steady myself this immediately came off of the pole i fell forwards out of the bath tub and ended up in a heap of naked <unk> and shower curtain on the bathroom floor 
 still kind of <unk> i just lay there laughing then i heard my 8 yo son run up the stairs and open the bathroom door to check on me 
 he immediately burst out crying 
 this made me laugh even more 
 when i finally got up off the floor and sorted the mess out and had spoken to my son he said he thought i 'd gone crazy ... he says heard me scream then a big thud then he came running up the stairs and saw my laying on the floor naked wrapped in the shower curtain laughing my head off while i was <unk> at the mouth 
 edit ... tl/dr brushed my teeth in the shower by moving my head only 
 fell out of the bath tub son burst into tears when he saw me naked wrapped up in a shower curtain laughing while foam was coming out of my mouth 
 wow someone gave me gold for my fu 
 thank you /u/kay_k88okay so maybe that 's a <unk> 
 but this is how it went down : my coworker and i were making small talk with a customer 's 5 year old during checkout and he asked how old my coworker was 
 she told him to guess and he guessed 20. she is 19 so she said wow 
 very close 
 i 'm 19 '' 
 now i 'm 20 and this kid is a good <unk> so i 'm going to give him a shot at my age 
 that 's where i fucked up 
 okay now guess me '' 
 <unk> ... 
 37 '' 
 me taken aback i <unk> 
 well no 
 i 'm 20 but i 've always been told i seem a little bit older '' 
 oh 
 probably because you 're fat '' 
 edit : hi op here 
 i did n't expect you all to find my story so amusing and i certainly did n't expect all the responses you 've posted for me 
 thank you for sharing your funny stories and words of encouragement 
 these responses made me feel better than some 
 you know who you are 
 let me address a few of your comments 
 this story took place at a previous job about 6 months ago 
 i 've come to terms with the fact that the little guy did n't mean to upset me but i still think of this every now and then and it hurts 
 <unk> i 'm fat 
 ** i 've been <unk> for as long as i can remember 
 i struggle with chronic depression and anxiety and while this is not a good excuse for my <unk> and <unk> i do believe it carries some <unk> 
 * those of you that understand mental <unk> may be familiar 
 i am receiving treatment and i 'm working on <unk> my mind and body but it has been an <unk> battle.so i posted a topic ranting about my height yesterday that blew up and my friends have been telling me to post the yugioh story '' here now 
 i will never be able to live this down - it will follow me and my brother chris for as long as we live 
 me and chris are identical twins 
 we used to look almost exactly the same to the point where my mom could even be <unk> by it and he 's my best friend in the world 
 in 18 years we 've never had a real fight 
 anyway we were both always the same height growing up 
 seeing who 's taller was a frequent playful competition between us but it 'd come down to splitting hairs 
 regardless we were average height for our age all through elementary school until about 7th grade when we both dipped down to the 10th percentile or so 
 our concerned parents took us to the doctor by the end of the year and apparently found our hgh and <unk> levels to be extremely low <unk> us both with <unk> 
 we get prescribed hgh injections and get taught how to administer them into our legs by ourselves 
 we <unk> these injections with a passion 
 we did n't think we needed them and fought our parents constantly about it especially because we had to do it every single night 
 our parents told us we would just have to do it until we got back to the <unk> percentile of height 
 they felt terrible making us do this though and said they would buy us each 3 packs of yugioh cards every week as long as we just did it without complaining 
 chris started collecting yugioh cards before this and had been <unk> his friends during lunch so i was kinda excited to start making a deck with the packs our parents bought us 
 after a few weeks i was completely addicted and looked on ebay for cards i needed researched deck builds etc 
 it was really fun actually 
 meanwhile chris had this girl that he was obsessed with 
 he would always bring her up to me and said he wanted to ask her out but did n't know how 
 we find out through a mutual friend that this girl thinks chris is cute but too short for her to date she was 4-5 inches taller or so at the time 
 chris <unk> and cried for hours in our room when he heard this 
 i 'd never seen him get so upset over anything before and i felt terrible 
 all of a sudden chris comes to me with a proposal 
 he wants to take my injections for a little and offers me his 3 packs of yugioh cards every week for as long as he can have them 
 in the last 3 months i noticed no difference in height we actually had both grown an inch and hated doing them anyway so i happily agreed to the trade 
 he only wanted them for a few weeks or months at most and we both did n't think they even worked 
 still i felt amazing getting 6 packs of cards a week while he obsessed over getting taller hoping that the double dose would help 
 he also agreed to let me take both shots later on if i wanted he just wanted them for now 
 we got this by our parents and pulled this off for 11 months 
 in that time chris had shot up 7 inches to <unk> '' and i only grew one inch to 4'11 '' 
 my poor mom took to so many doctors and none of them understood how i was n't growing like chris was 
 high school started chris asks the girl out a week into school and she said yes 
 they are still together 4 years later but that 's besides the point 
 as a 4'11 '' freshman guy i felt so damn overwhelmed by high school and decided to ask chris for my share back 
 i still played yugioh but was moving past it quickly and i realized that i needed to start the hgh very very soon 
 he asked to do them until new years at which time i could take both back for myself if i wanted them 
 sounded good to me 
 well i could n't wait that long 
 i was so short for my age and chris was starting to look huge next to me so we switched after thanksgiving instead 
 i was still 4'11 '' and he was now <unk> '' and our extended family was shocked to see chris but not me 9 inches taller than he was during last year 's family party 
 i hated the huge height difference between us now so much and needed to start the shots immediately 
 everyone reassured me that i 'd be fine and was just a late <unk> 
 i started the 2 per day injection routine with lots of excitement this time 
 by the end of 9th grade we both saw an <unk> mainly for me who took x-rays of our bones 
 then she drops this on us : we were done growing 
 completely done growing 
 we were told to <unk> the shots as they would n't help at all anymore since they had to be <unk> while the growth plates were still open to be effective 
 the plates went from wide open to closed for both of us in that one year time span 
 chris measured in at <unk> that day and i was still 4'11 '' and 1/2 '' 
 i could n't believe it 
 in a <unk> i explained to my <unk> doctor what me and chris did this whole time and needed to know if it could be fixed 
 she tells me she ca n't help me anymore - i should 've <unk> to her and done my own injections 
 we were literally grounded '' by our parents for over a month after this meeting 
 by senior year we had <unk> out - chris was <unk> '' and i made it to <unk> '' and 1/4 '' 
 being this height as a guy sucks more than anything 
 the worst part is that i did it to myself too 
 chris apologized so many times and even cried with me once about it 
 we are still just as close as ever but it sucks that he does n't have to endure any of the issues i have related to height 
 i just started college <unk> state and everyone is just massive here 
 i feel like an actual midget a lot of the time and get shit for my height every single day 
 i fucked up big time and never imagined a little <unk> from 5 years ago would <unk> my entire life forever 
 i still have a <unk> yugioh deck though 
 this did n't happen today but i thought it would be a decent first post 
 so i had been seeing this girl for several months 
 i had made it very clear to her that i was n't interested in a serious relationship and this was just a <unk> arrangement 
 she was n't a fan of this but she went along with it anyway 
 the problem with this girl is that she was incredibly boring 
 her stories made baby seals club themselves 
 her voice made me want to drive into oncoming traffic 
 she was a sweet girl but so fucking boring 
 it had become very apparent that the amount of effort it took for me to even be around her was <unk> the <unk> <unk> sex we were having 
 i needed to get out 
 it was agreed upon that i would go out to see her after i left work one night 
 i felt like i <unk> her a face-to-face so that i can offer closure and an explanation as to why i did n't want to continue seeing her 
 i get to her friend 's place where she was staying she got in the car and we went for a drive 
 after maybe 5 or so miles i pull into a parking lot so that we could actually talk 
 i break the news to her that i do n't think we should continue our arrangement any longer 
 she did n't take this well and walked out of the car 
 we were at least 5 miles from her place and i knew her cell battery had just died so i asked her to get back into the car and i 'll drive her home 
 i wish i would n't have done that 
 on the drive home she remained very quiet 
 i was pouring out <unk> as to why i did n't want to see her 
 it 's not you it 's me you 're a great girl and you 'll find better i 'm actually doing you a favor 
 you get the point 
 i should mention here that the road i was driving on was a <unk> between two towns so the speed limit was 50 but i 'd typically do <unk> through that stretch 
 on this particular night i elected to do 45 so that i had a little extra time to give her some closure 
 i had just <unk> another cliche for her when the unthinkable happened 
 without a single warning or a single word from her mouth she opened up the car door and dove out at 45 mph 
 i immediately stop the car and begin running back while calling 911. she was n't moving so i thought she was dead 
 as i ran up next to her she began to move and cry 
 i immediately went from concerned to boiling blood furious 
 between giving directions to the 911 operator i was yelling at her asking her why she jumped out of my car 
 she kept saying she did n't know what happened 
 after a few minutes police and ambulance show 
 ambulance workers tend to her police <unk> me with questions 
 i 'm no prize so the cops were equally confused as to why a seemingly normal girl jumps out of a fast moving car 
 i was so embarrassed as a crowd began to form to see what the commotion was 
 at this point the cops are giving me a sobriety test 
 i 'm still in my work clothes 
 ambulance takes here away and cops determine i was n't drunk and told me to just go home 
 6 hours later she texts me a picture of her face from her hospital bed 
 she had some bad road rash and a few broken bones 
 i did n't respond and have n't spoken to her since 
 tl dr- told a girl i did n't want to see her anymore 
 she jumped out of a fast moving car then sent me a picture of the damage 
 do n't stick your dick in crazy kids 
 i made a hot pocket in the oven last night and i of course needed to test if it was cool enough to eat 
 so i used the most appropriate method i could think of i took a small bite 7 
 <unk> cheese '' comes out but no big <unk> there 
 i proceeded to devour both pockets and <unk> my burning lips and mouth with an <unk> beer 
 i went about my night and everything was normal 
 this morning i noticed i had burned my bottom lip near the right corner 
 it was n't too bad just a small blister i noticed while shaving 
 i went to work and went about my day and proceeded to forget about my burned lip 
 i got off work and met up with my girlfriend 
 she gives me a big kiss which then pops the blister 
 she pulls away quickly as i reach towards the blister 
 she looks at my lip and asks me what is on it 
 i say it 's just a blister but she just keeps staring and <unk> it 
 after a minute she picks up her purse and says no that 's herpes '' calls me an asshole and accused me of cheating on her 
 she tells me we 're over and started freaking out that she now has herpes 
 i keep trying to tell her it 's a hot pocket burn as she leaves the bar but she just stormed out flipping me the bird while everyone just gave me a death stare 
 i checked out myself in the mirror and the blister popped really badly it looks pretty nasty but i do n't think it looks like herpes 
 this all happened an hour ago and she 's not answering my texts or calls 
 tldr : i ate a hot pocket burned my lip gf left me cause the burn kind of looks like herpes 
 photo of blister : update : she still has n't responded but thanks for all the support 
 i dunno what is going on with her but maybe this was the best hot pocket ever 
 edit : wow first page 
 rip inbox thanks for all the support everybody 
 edit 2 : to answer some of the questions her ass is kate hot she is very far in the hot side of <unk> scale i thought less crazy though and we 've been together 2 years 
 edit 3 : thanks for the gold kind stranger this happened yesterday 
 my husband downloaded the water your body app and has been working towards tracking his health 
 he has been trying to get me to download the app for a few days but i kept forgetting 
 so last night i finally got it on my phone and today i was hoping to impress my husband with my dedication by reaching my goal on water consumption 206 ounces 
 i am drinking water what seems like constantly and check my progress half way through the day 
 it was only at 26 % 
 i <unk> and drink more water 
 we had a <unk> return appointment that was so agonizing as my bladder was full for the whole hour most relieving piss of my life 
 by the end of the day i lost count of how many times i used the bathroom 
 there was one time i peed then almost immediately had to pee again 
 in the evening we compare each other 's goal percent and mine was barely over 50 % 
 wtf how would i be able to drink twice as much without pissing myself i thought 
 i ask my husband what his goal amount of water is and its a little over 100 ounces 
 how could mine be 206 
 i check my settings and turns out i somehow entered <unk> pounds as my weight 
 no wonder i had to pee so much today 
 and good news 
 i reached my goal and then some 
 <unk> % 
 tldr : excuse me while i use the <unk> a bottle of coke and a sandwich on the ground floor of the main building at university 
 i left the shop with the coke in my hand rather than putting it in my <unk> and went to the third floor to meet my friend 
 as you come out of every lift in the building there 's a walkway to the main floor and on each side you can see right to the ground floor 
 slipped and lost my footing coke bottle rolled along the bannister and then went over the edge 
 guy behind me was just like <unk> as we both watched my coke hit the ground floor and explode everywhere ... edit - the bottle did n't roll under the bannister instead it rolled along the <unk> and then over the <unk> my wife and i are done having kids at this point and i decided to <unk> for a <unk> as it is supposed to be much less <unk> than her permanent options 
 any time i started to freak out about the upcoming visit to dr. <unk> i <unk> myself with thoughts of endless <unk> <unk> sexy <unk> days 
 it 's the promised land 
 first of all the doctor did n't use enough freezing 
 you know that feeling when someone cuts into your scrotum 
 no 
 well i do 
 second you know that feeling when someone is tugging on your testicles 
 no 
 i do 
 lastly you know that smell of your balls being burned 
 i wish i did n't 
 as a bonus i could actually see the smoke wafting lazily towards the ceiling 
 <unk> : <unk> would not allow doc with knife near my balls again 
 so like most tifus this was not actually today 
 about two weeks ago i picked out a small local sushi place in <unk> to go get a bite while i was there on vacation 
 unfortunately it was closing as i arrived so i googled <unk> near me and picked from the list at random 
 i landed on a place nearby about 5 mins called <unk> <unk> 
 it took a while to find - it was a small <unk> door with no sign somewhat shady - but once i entered it was lovely 
 after eating some of the best sushi i 've ever had i noticed there were no prices on the menu 
 i 'd had about 8 plates of sushi at this point and started to <unk> a little 
 i quickly googled the restaurant and <unk> at what i found 
 the restaurant was 120 years old and had one <unk> star 
 as quickly as i could i asked for the bill 
 <unk> <unk> $ 150 later i decided to thoroughly research any future restaurants i visited on a whim 
 and not to use data in japan 
 that was another 50 usd 
 edit : to clarify why this was so expensive there were 2 pieces of <unk> sushi per plate no <unk> this happened a few hours ago 
 backstory : i work in a small industry firm with no more than 10 employees in the finance department so going on reddit is fine since there 's no customers come in or out of the office 
 everyday i come to work and most days i 'm always on reddit to pass time if there 's no work to do 
 i usually go on the popular main subreddits including tifu 
 when i go on tifu i usually scroll down to hide the title today i fucked up since its obviously inappropriate at work 
 but today was different 
 today i was a dumbass 
 instead of scrolling down to hide the title i forgot and my boss called me in to have a word about some work 
 so i walked over and spoke to him for about 5 minutes 
 i returned to my desk and found the fucking ceo of the firm looking at my computer screen 
 i walked over as if nothing was wrong and said morning boss '' 
 no reply from him 
 i looked at the screen and saw in huge letters today i fucked up 
 i nearly died 
 my heart started racing 
 thinking of an excuse he looked at me pointed at the title and said looks like you did fuck up today '' and started laughing 
 he told me to get back to work and be careful next time and do n't go on sites like this as he walked away 
 still in shock that i dodged a bullet i sat down at my desk and breathed a huge sigh of relief thinking i 'm never going onto reddit at work again 
 an hour passed and guess what i 'm on reddit because reddit is love reddit is life 
 tl dr went to tifu at work ceo saw it laughed it off dodged a bullet still on reddit **edit ** woah this blew up 
 thank you for the gold & lt 3 looking at your replies most of you saying to lock my computer when leaving my desk good idea next time and no the ceo is n't any of you guys ... 
 or is it ... hey boss <unk> tried to post this the other day but like a rookie i did n't know about the weekend rule so i 'll try again 
 anyway just like all the other tifu 's this did n't even come close to happening today 
 this happened after a house party when i was quite a bit younger i 'm now 25 and still get a laugh out of this every now and again 
 my dad was a pretty heavy smoker when i was growing up and he quit just after he got pneumonia ever since then my mum had been always onto us about never smoking because it was bad for us and we could die etc etc 
 anyway i went to a house party one saturday night and was around a lot of kids trying to show how cool they were by smoking 14 packs in one night which in turn <unk> my clothes with cigarette smoke 
 while all the cool kids where smoking i was 4 knuckles deep in some girl all while thinking i was in fact the cool kid because while every other guy was out smoking i was finger banging the <unk> out of this chick which while being a young teenager it was up there with cool things to do 
 along came midnight and with it my mum to pick me up 
 so i tried my best to make it look like i had n't been drinking and jumped in the car for the ride home 
 about two mins into the journey she asked me if i had been smoking because thats all she could smell on my clothes and me telling her that i had n't was n't enough she wanted some tangible proof and that my friends is where i fucked up 
 keep in mind i was only young and had been drinking so for me this all happened pretty fast 
 the only thing she thought to do to prove my innocence was to smell my fingers and at that stage i was nowhere near fast enough to stop her from grabbing my hand and doing exactly that 
 immediate silence fell over the car as my mother had realised i had n't been smoking but instead i had my fingers rammed in some chicks puss for the past 30 mins 
 we did n't speak for the rest of the car trip home she never asked if i had been smoking at a party again and to this day i 've found its been the most effective way to ever get out of something that someone has accused me of 
 tl dr went to a party with heaps of people smoking fingered some girl mum <unk> my fingers after 
 edit : in regards to the knuckle <unk> yes there is three knuckles per finger but i only got in the first two knuckles plus some <unk> 98 % of a full finger 2 fingers with two knuckles each = 4 knuckles not sure how anyone thinks they can get the third knuckle in a girls puss without <unk> said girl 
 edit 2 : ca n't believe how much this has blown up good to see someone else can get a laugh out of this as much as i do 
 <unk> for the gold kind stranger : so i was on a date with a girl to the cinema 
 the date went well but it was only a second date and i still did n't know if she liked me or not 
 so she went to the bathroom and i decided to go to the shop next to it while waiting 
 now we had gone to see the <unk> and i was starving as i had n't eaten since dinner before and i did n't feel i needed a snack during it and i did n't want to ask her for some in case she thought it was weird 
 so when i went to the shop i saw condoms and i started to ask myself if i may need some myself 
 now i 'm a 19 year old virgin so i 'm very oblivious to any signs of interest from girls and i never had a need to already have condoms 
 now i only had enough money for the condoms by themselves and then i would n't have been able to afford the chocolate 
 so i bought the chocolate 
 big mistake 
 i drive her back to her college apartment and walked her to the door 
 she then invites me inside for some tea 
 now being inexperienced and kind of clueless i think she genuinely means a cup of tea 
 so we are there sitting on the couch drinking tea when she leans in and starts kissing me 
 things escalate and she 's <unk> me to her room and we start getting undressed 
 then she ask the dreaded question do you have a condom '' 
 so now i 'm sitting here still a virgin with a mars bar wrapper in my hand 
 tldr : bought a bar of chocolate instead of condoms while on a date and now i 'm still a virgin because of it 
 edit : wow thanks for the response guys it is really helpful 
 i decided to take the advice of a few of you and rang her 
 things seem all good and she wants to go out again 
 pretty clueless as to what i 'll do but i 'm definitely not forgetting the <unk> night we were in bed and my girlfriend was scratching her eye <unk> complaining that she suffers from chronic dry eye and not from leaving contacts in for too long 
 as we 're in the spooning position she finally sighs and asks me to make her cry '' so her eye gets some <unk> 
 i quickly think of how to do that on short notice 
 should i tickle her <unk> 
 do i need to <unk> rice her 
 and then a lightbulb goes off in my brain 
 i lean close to her ear and whisper to my girlfriend of over three years : i 've never really loved you '' 
 needless to say tears were had 
 i 'm not a smart man 
 edit : wow my inbox 
 so a lot asked what happened afterwards 
 she was caught off guard because i said it so sternly like i meant it 
 i did not 
 i <unk> my love and did not have to sleep on the couch 
 so this fuck up happened two nights ago 
 my wife and i had just gotten our taxes back and decided to live <unk> for a night so we got a <unk> went and crawled the local <unk> until ending up back home 
 i popped a viagra because yolo and begin plowing my wife like i 'm peter north 
 here is where the fuck up happens 
 while site seeing during our trip to pound town we get turned around somehow 
 feeling my abs burn after about 2 minutes of froggy style i decide to fall forward and support myself with one hand on the <unk> 
 except we were <unk> towards the foot of the bed 
 i end up damn near impaling myself on the <unk> corner post breaking two of my ribs 
 fast forward two hours later there i am sitting in the emergency room clutching my side while and <unk> an unusually long lasting <unk> my teacher is an alcoholic 
 lately i 've been feeling tired of school and as a result i 'm constantly running late for most of my courses 
 also i had n't slept much that night because i 've trouble sleeping when it 's windy outside and that particular night it was windy as hell 
 when i 'm tired i 'm usually quite moody and sometimes i turn kinda aggressive when someone is being a dick towards me 
 it was the last course of the day and i was running late for history class because i had to talk to my science teacher 
 when i walked in the door my teacher said in a humiliating voice why do n't you just quit the science courses 
 i bet you 'll fail them all anyways '' 
 being the moody asshole that i am i answered well if i fail them all i can just become a drunken history teacher anyways '' 
 i heard people <unk> in the classroom and the moment i realized what i 'd said i understood the consequences 
 needless to say my teachers jaw dropped to the floor like one of those <unk> in one of those cartoons and the class went dead silent 
 now i 'm sitting at the principal 's office 
 edit : gold 
 thank you guys 
 i love that so many people supported me on this 
 i had to have a meeting with my principle and teacher 
 they said something about unacceptable behavior and i had to say sorry to my teacher 
 when i explained why i 'd said it my teacher also had to say sorry to me 
 i 'm a guy in my 20s and i do n't flirt 
 i 'm not one of those guys who can come up and deliver a pick-up line with a straight face or ask a girl out 
 i get way too embarrassed and <unk> 
 for whatever reason i have this irrational fear that someone should think i 'm hitting on <unk> i just do n't flirt 
 ever 
 anyways i was staying with my mom for the weekend and she asked me to go get groceries for dinner as she had just gotten back from work and was exhausted 
 i was happy to do it as she was buying 
 no big deal right 
 wrong but who could <unk> what was to come 
 so i drive to the market collect the groceries and pretty soon i 'm looking to check out 
 i get in the only checkout lane available and immediately see that the cashier is very ... very pretty 
 too pretty for me to handle 
 i quickly whip around in search of another lane open but there were none 
 i gather myself and think 'you can do this 
 do it for your mother 
 so <unk> my fate i <unk> the most plain and standard transaction possible between her and me 
 <unk> to what you know i thought to myself 
 before long it was my time to shine 
 i presented her with my groceries for <unk> and proceeded to <unk> around with my wallet this was pretty much the entire plan 
 all was going extremely well and we were even getting along with enthusiastic dialogue such as her : did you find everything ok '' 
 and me : yes '' 
 then she hit me with a question that in my <unk> strategy i had forgotten to plan for ... do you have an express card with us that you 'd like to use '' 
 no but i have a phone number for one '' is what i found myself saying 
 it was an <unk> <unk> response 
 i gave her my phone number while still <unk> fiddling with my wallet 
 a moment passed 
 ... i 'm sorry sir that phone number is n't coming up in our system ... '' my mind clicked 
 not my phone number my mom 's phone number 
 my mother 
 my mothers credit card 
 i was about to present a woman 's credit card after trying to get a discount with a wrong number 
 'this looks really bad i thought to myself 
 so i turned to her as casually as <unk> possible and said '' oh that 's my cell phone number '' this pause was longer so long i looked up and in her face i saw the <unk> 
 in her mind i just pulled the smoothest shit in the history of shit 
 i was the <unk> of cool in her eyes : giving her my phone number in the <unk> of ways 
 she started to smile and this is when i realized what i 'd done 
 she looked at me realizing how cool i was and i looked at her realizing how cool she thought i was 
 obviously like all smooth people i freaked the fuck out 
 oh no im sorry do n't use that number you ... i have another number not mine my moms i have a mom '' 
 i paid for the food and i got outta that store as fast as possible - leaving the cashier in a haze of confusion as i furiously fast walked away - destined never to be smooth again 
 tl dr : i gave the cashier the wrong phone number for an express card 
 she thought i was flirting and giving her my number 
 i freaked out 
 edit : spelling : <unk> lol what a <unk> idoitthis happened a few days ago during my honeymoon 
 my wife and i were on an adventure tour of <unk> 
 one day included a <unk> rafting trip with a group of 4 <unk> we did not know 
 for safety 's sake we were all wearing <unk> and life <unk> 
 after an hour or so of rafting we pulled <unk> for a bit 
 my wife and i got off the <unk> at the same time with me a step behind her 
 after glancing over my shoulder at the river i turned around reached out and patted her on the butt saying would you like to go for a swim '' 
 two things happened 
 first i heard my wife laughing hysterically but from about 10 feet away 
 second the person who i had just patted on the butt turned around in shock 
 and she was a 16 year old 
 after i rapidly explained what happened and people could tell from my wife 's reaction that i was not lying everyone had a good laugh 
 well maybe not me as much as the others 
 the girl was not bothered at all 
 even her father who was also on the trip thought it was amusing 
 my wife is now going to make fun of me for at least the next 50 years and i deserve it 
 tl dr - a brief case of mistaken identity <unk> by rafting gear led me to pat the butt of a 16 year old girl instead of my wife 
 edit 1 : i did apologize profusely to the <unk> this happened about 20 mins ago and i will try to keep it short 
 on mobile sorry for any errors 
 a little backstory about the company i work for while it is n't a terribly strict place to work it is very heavy handed with disciplinary actions for <unk> company rules 
 with most stating immediate termination for violation 
 anyway i usually get in around 10 and take my lunch at noon 
 today i decided to get a sprite from the vending machine as i had n't had one in a very long time 
 while i was eating my lunch my boss walked in to inform me about an upcoming meeting 
 mid sentence she spotted the sprite and told me to wait here 
 thinking nothing of it i continued to eat my lunch 
 about ten mins later she had called security to escort me out of the office 
 very confused i ask why 
 she responded with you are in violation of company policy by drinking an alcoholic <unk> during work hours '' 
 i was still confused mainly because i am only 20 <unk> old 
 i was being escorted out before i had any chance to explain myself 
 so naturally i get really mad and inform them that i had nothing alcoholic with me 
 then i remembered the sprite 
 recently sprite cans have this '' <unk> the phrase '' thing going on that has some phrases written in a weird script 
 so from a distance it looks like a beer can 
 i am trying to explain this and they are n't hearing any of it 
 then the head of hr barbara walks by and asks what is happening 
 i explain my half while my boss explains hers 
 in the process of explaining lo and behold barbara is holding the same can 
 she holds it up and asks my boss if this looked similar 
 she responds then they go check my office 
 she finds the can and let 's me go 
 now i am sitting in my office writing this while barbara is having a meeting '' about my boss 's actions tl dr almost got fired because of a sprite can 
 picture of can in comments update : my boss is planning to find <unk> to make this right she is n't a terrible boss as she is actually pretty friendly as she told me she has had problems with others in the past that have violated that rule and got into some pretty serious problems for not catching it 
 she was protecting her job which i can understand 
 this company hires a lot of 20 ish year old people so ca n't really stay mad about it 
 she plans to buy me lunch at some point though i doubt it 
 in terms of the can i am making a memo about it to let others know to get the information before losing their minds 
 and will post the memo sometime later 
 as far as hr is concerned it 's just another story to pass around update 2 : there is another post on tifu as someone claiming to be my boss on the other side of the story while i do give <unk> credit for attempted karma whoring they do n't even know the name of my company or my position 
 someone below in the comments has posted the link to the other post and as soon as i can will be linking it myself thanks for the support guys update 3 : someone said i should post to twitter at sprite to see what would happen 
 just did it edit : removed twitter link as i was n't aware of all the rules as with most fuck-ups this did n't actually happen today 
 it was over 9 years ago 
 my mom informed me that morning that we would be having aunt maggie '' over 
 i had never met this aunt but there were plenty of other family members showing up out of nowhere so i did n't think anything of it 
 we spent several hours cleaning the house to prepare and then they arrived 
 aunt maggie and her two kids a girl around my age and a boy several years younger 
 we spent the whole day playing as kids do while my mom and my aunt talked 
 eventually as the day was winding down the three of us were in my room playing with legos 
 aunt maggie called to her kids telling them it was time to go 
 we all came out and started saying goodbye to eachother 
 before leaving the girl came to me in the kitchen and asked me if i would go on a date with her 
 no '' 
 i said wondering what kind of person asks their cousin on a date 
 looking back my tone of voice was about the worst it could have been probably sending the message i would n't want to be seen in public with you '' 
 she was visibly disappointed and left 
 i went back to my room afterwards and found an unfinished message written with legos 
 will you go o '' cute but i 'm not gon na romance my cousin 
 fast forward a few months when i found out we 're not actually related and aunt '' is apparently just a term of <unk> 
 every time i see this girl i 'm blown away 
 she 's stunning and i 'm a moron 
 tl dr : did n't date my cousin turns out she 's not my cousin 
 kick myself in the ass daily.i really like my girlfriend and i think she likes me but having a relationship with her may be a bit difficult from now on 
 we went to her house for dinner and everything went smoothly until we were done eating 
 she has a <unk> brother who is 5-6 years old not sure and he seemed to like me and we threw his little plastic ball back and forth 
 he started getting competitive and threw way harder than i 'd expected so as a reflex i slapped the ball mid-air so it flew knocked over and broke this urn 
 the urn contained my girlfriends grandma 
 without missing a beat her little brother runs out and fucking points the finger at me and said i did on purpose and the little shit even started to cry 
 i tried to explain what really had happened but they gave me the classic we think it 's best you go home now '' and my girlfriend took her parents side 
 so here i am the day after and she still wo n't return my calls or my texts 
 we might be done 
 edit : she saw my post here since it apparently has made it to the front page of reddit and broke it off 
 according to her i 'm <unk> and unable to take things seriously '' 
 guess first round 's on me rip 
 edit 2 : i must explain since a lot of people seem to think this is fake : i 've been a reddit lurker for a long time and only made this account to share my story with you 
 never imagined it would blow up like this and i can understand you being suspicious 
 your comments made me realized how fucked up this whole thing was and i wan na thank you all 
 you 're the best : thank you kind redditor for the gold this happened just a bit ago 
 i was playing the division beta with my two <unk> friends girlfriend posted up on the couch next to me 
 things progress and shes feeling <unk> so she starts becoming playful '' with me as im playing 
 it becomes too much to bear and i put my mic on pause to do the dirty deed 
 we go at it quite <unk> and my girlfriend is not the quiet type when it comes to sexy time 
 we finish up and are laying there taking quick <unk> when she asked : so what happens when the controller dies with the mic on '' 
 it goes to ... <unk> ... ... <unk> ... .. '' i respond slowly grasping the situation 
 i quickly call out to check our terrible hypothesis 
 hello '' 
 ... ... <unk> answer so i try again <unk> '' 
 yes '' 
 he responds in a fit of laughter joined by my other mate 
 hours of rolling laughter later and our friendship is now at a much closer and much stranger level 
 my girlfriend is embarassed mortified and im not sure how to tell her i find it hilarious 
 tl dr : controller died during sex xbox live party heard the whole ball slapping scene unfold edit : some people are calling bullshit because of the <unk> of the question 
 i wear turtle <unk> so when i play my tv volume is super low but on 
 during sex we didnt notice becuase well sex and only when laying after did we notice that the voices of the party were now able to be heard in the tv 
 totally true story boy <unk> <unk> i was chatting up this girl and she decided she wanted to come over for some fun time in an attempt to surprise her i planned on standing in front of my door naked and erect so when she came over it would be more sexy stupid i know anyway i hear a knock and warm myself up before opening the door only to find myself standing there full <unk> in front of a horrified <unk> i sprinted inside yelling sorry sorry sorry and posted this to reddit for your enjoyment instead of just forgetting it you 're welcome.the company i work for was looking to hire a couple of employees last week and i was put in charge of interviewing potential candidates 
 the first applicant came in about 2 hours early so i had to scramble a bit to gather all the stuff i needed for the interview 
 my boss told me to get a clipboard so i could take notes 
 not finding one i grabbed a large note pad instead 
 about halfway through the first interview the applicant started acting funny 
 he was professional up until i started taking notes and then he began nervously laughing and looking around the room not making eye contact 
 really bizarre 
 at the end of the interview he barely shook my hand before he beat feet for the door 
 my boss was eager to find out about the interview since this first candidate looked perfect on paper 
 i was in the middle of telling her about his weird behavior when her eyes went wide and she started laughing uncontrollably pointing at the stack of notes in my hands 
 i flipped the note pad over 
 would you like to join me for dinner tonight beautiful '' 
 written in permanent marker 
 took me a moment to remember that i wrote that myself about 2 years ago while asking a girl out 
 poor guy came in for a job interview left thinking he had been <unk> into a date with another dude 
 edit : the secretary who was scheduling the interviews forgot to tell me that this guy was going to come in as soon as he got off work '' and apparently he did tell her that he might be up to 2 hours earlier than the given appointment time but she neglected to mention that to me when she gave me the <unk> : this story might be coming down soon my parents do not want to be bothered with chris christie 's political <unk> okay so this is my first reddit post so please forgive me for formatting errors 
 i 'm also on my phone so spelling errors might occur 
 this fu happened 10 years ago unfortunately i was only 7 at the time so i did n't have access to reddit 
 anyway at that age i absolutely loved astronomy 
 everything about it was amazing 
 i loved the stars the moon the <unk> way the distant <unk> <unk> and especially the constellations 
 the only problem was that i had no idea what to call half of them 
 i knew the basics the big <unk> and ect 
 i wish i never loved them as much as i did 
 my father was amazing 
 he knew how much i loved looking at the stars all night long so he bought me night sky related toys 
 our church even have a blow up rocket ship that he took me to see 
 my favorite out of all of them was this silver metal green laser 
 i was never allowed to touch it but it represented everything the sky was 
 bright colorful and a learning experience 
 because with that laser to shine the way my father would teach me all the names of the stars he would buy books to learn them and do research so that when the night came we could go outside on the porch together and he could explain the sky and all of the little <unk> that went with the stars 
 edit : there was n't actually a meteor shower i think i thought there was because of what happens later 
 the memory is a bit fuzzy and i apologize for that 
 just imagine a clear sky and a lot of stars 
 one night there was a meteor shower and my dad took me outside to watch with him 
 he brought the laser with him so that during the shower we could spend some time learning more of the constellations 
 sometimes he would repeat old stories like the brothers <unk> and <unk> the <unk> 
 but i did n't mind 
 each story was told to me as if it was my first time hearing it 
 this was a few days after new years eve 
 during our routine i see a meteor that looked a little odd 
 it was <unk> than the others and had been lasting pretty long 
 i 've never seen a comet before and that 's what my little mind thinks it is 
 so i tell my dad about the comet however he ca n't see it 
 that 's when he passes the laser to me to point it out 
 this is the biggest thing in my life at this point 
 *i* got the laser 
 *i* was now the master of the universe 
 so with my little heart beating in my ears i pointed it at the comet 
 i look over at my father and his face has suddenly gotten really pale in the dark 
 i 'm confused when he rips the laser from my small hand and tells me it 's time to go inside 
 i feel heartbroken but i was never one to disobey 
 so i go inside 
 the memory gets a little fuzzy here 
 i remember my mother was making cookies for the next morning and that i was told to go in the bathroom for a shower since my older sister just got finished 
 in the middle of the shower my mom enters the bathroom and quickly <unk> me off and starts to get me dressed before i had even finished 
 i would have complained but something inside told me to shut up and do as i was told 
 when we 're exiting the bathroom and i 'm finally dressed i hear voices coming from downstairs 
 i do n't remember exactly what was said but i could recognize the deep <unk> tone 
 i was scared but still numb from confusion 
 my mother told my sister and i to stay upstairs while she went down to see my father 
 i looked down the stairwell to see my father talking to three police officers 
 i was so scared my mind could n't comprehend was was being said 
 i sat there and watched as he looked back over his shoulder at me he was scared 
 i 've never seen my father scared before 
 i knew i made a mistake i just was n't sure what it was and i would n't know for another 7 years 
 well for a few months after that people started asking my sister and i questions where ever we went 
 we were a block from a grocery store and often times we would hold hands and walk together to the store to get <unk> ect 
 they kept asking us about my father and i did n't understand why they wanted to know about him 
 they asked us if he was abusive and if he hurt us 
 he never did he was perfect 
 our once quiet street now had a lot of people in it who wanted to talk to us 
 i was confused but my sister would always answer for me saying things along the lines we 're not supposed to talk to them '' 
 i did n't know who they were but they liked taking pictures of us 
 when my mom found out about them we stopped picking up groceries and were moved next door to our <unk> 's house 
 dad would suddenly go missing for days at a time and we would be visited by random family members 
 my sister was older than me and i think she understood what was going on but to me it was all so <unk> 
 i do n't believed i ever complained 
 eventually we went back to school but even there we were asked questions and the other kids seemed to sit a bit further away during lunch 
 eventually everything settled down but my mom wanted us to move south closer to our other family members 
 for 7 years everything was fine but then chris christie was elected <unk> and i over heard my parents growling about it 
 that 's when i learned what really happened that night 
 a few nights before my father took me to see the meteor shower a man had tried to take down an airplane with a laser and escaped 
 he was an actual terrorist and honestly wanted to kill people 
 the night of the meteor shower i had shined a laser at a comet 
 only it was n't a comet it was a helicopter 
 they blamed both attacks '' on my father and when he tried to explain to the police what he had really been doing a rumor spread that he was trying to blame it all on his daughter '' 
 the <unk> threw slander at my family called us terrorists or just plain <unk> 
 my dad was overwhelmed hell we all were 
 we used to love our neighbors but when they were questioned a long time friend of ours said on tv he always looked like an evil man '' 
 that was it 
 that one sentence shattered every hope my family had of living where we were 
 everyone thought my father was evil 
 the <unk> was chris christie 
 all my father was guilty of was loving us 
 i could never understand how it all got so cruel so quickly 
 my dad got sick after a month or two of the investigation 
 he still had to attend court and had to sit and answer questions while he was burning with a fever 
 eventually he cracked and confessed '' to both crimes 
 edit : my father took a <unk> <unk> option but it was undoubtedly because of the stress of the entire thing 
 i 'm sure he would have stuck it out and tried to have went with the innocent option but it was one of those if you confess you do n't go to jail '' kind of things 
 i 'm sorry i did n't mention that at first i 'm getting the information 10 years too late and from people who do n't really want to talk about it 
 he was tired he was n't thinking 
 he wanted to go home 
 he never went to jail however 
 i thank god everyday for that 
 instead he was labeled a felon forced to move to protect his wife and 3 daughters and struggled to earn a living ever since 
 he had to give up his guns and was legally never allowed to purchase another laser again 
 and this was all because one night i thought i saw a comet and my dad trusted me 
 tl : dr i was 7 liked the stars 
 dad takes me outside to teach me constellations with a laser 
 i shine the laser at a helicopter and my dad gets arrested and tried in court by chris christie 
 we were forced to move 
 i 'm <unk> you all : edit july 4th : okay so a lot of you are <unk> me and that 's understandable 
 namely <unk> who is replying to every comment he sees that op is n't david <unk> 's daughter '' 
 so i 'm posting a few pictures of my father and me 
 here 's one from an article of my father so you can compare : here 's another from an article of my father and my mother : behind my father 's right shoulder is my uncle george okay and here are some pictures of us : do n't forget my dad 's aged so he 's not as young as he once was 
 he cut his hair shorter but i honestly think he still looks the same 
 my dad playing in the leaves with us : me when i was 6 my mom and dad celebrating the 4th 
 my mom and dad at my graduation : a framed picture of my parents : my parents about 10 years ago : # proof i am who i say i am picture of me with sign i 'm sorry for my awful appearance i 'm really ... really tired right now 
 so i find this toyota pickup on cl that i want to look at but it 's a couple hours away in <unk> 
 normally i would go by myself but my wife 's got ta work so i take my 8 yo son with me 
 i 've got a trailer and the cash in case i decide to buy it 
 seller wants to meet in a public place walmart 
 i text him when we get there and he replies that he 'll be there in a couple minutes 
 guy shows up and i start looking the truck over 
 i walk around it get on the ground and check the u joints and when i stand up the cops are there 
 seems that somebody assumed that just because a man and a boy were in a vehicle alone in the middle of a walmart parking lot they 're having sex 
 unbelievable 
 i 'm coming to realize i ca n't go anywhere alone with my son for fear of what others will do 
 i do n't like this place anymore 
 edit : one of my many thoughts on the way home was the <unk> for this 
 was i victim to something akin to <unk> 
 could someone have called the cops and reported this knowing full well that nothing was going on just for kicks 
 today i met up with my family for a funeral and to save money we all are sharing a hotel room 
 i am 26 and my family is pretty close so we 're fine sharing a room 
 so this morning we are all up and getting ready for the day 
 after my turn in the shower i 'm drying off in the bathroom when i hear my dad telling mom a interesting story 
 me being curious go out and listen to his <unk> tale 
 so here i am casually drying my hair and listening to dad when i noticed my mom is giving me a puzzled look 
 she then casually asks do you know that you are naked '' 
 it was only then that i realized that the towel i was using to cover up is currently sitting on my neck after drying my hair giving my parents and brothers front row seats to the viewing of the family jewels things not seen by them sense childhood <unk> were still common 
 i quickly cover up to the <unk> of laughter from my entire family 
 now i have to sit through a <unk> tomorrow and i know my family will let all of our relatives know of the peep show i put on 
 *edit : changed nick to neck 
 is this really nsfw 
 this happened last night 
 i really enjoy jelly beans 
 they 're definitely my 'go to for something sweet to have every once in a while 
 sours gourmet starburst you name it i probably have a jar of them in my pantry 
 my family knows i enjoy jelly beans and for christmas as a stocking <unk> they bought me a four pound jar of gourmet jelly belly jelly beans a box of sour starburst and miscellaneous flavours 
 awesome 
 i have one or two <unk> a day for after meals or just while i 'm working 
 life is good 
 at least until i made a mistake that almost made me cry 
 so last night i 'm chatting to friends <unk> from my jelly bean jar when i realize that it 's about halfway gone 
 i get the idea hey 
 i should open the three boxes of random flavours and put them all in the jar and mix them up 
 then i can just throw the boxes away and have a full jar again '' 
 and so i did 
 i opened the three boxes of about <unk> lbs of jelly beans each and put them into the jar gave it a roll and a shake to mix everything up and threw the empty stuff away 
 <unk> 
 refilled jelly beans 
 i sit in my computer chair grab three of my new assorted jelly bean <unk> and plop the white black and red treats into my mouth 
 what assaulted my taste buds was probably the most vile thing i have ever tasted in my life 
 it felt like a nightclub bathroom kicked the door down into my mouth and started rubbing its nasty <unk> tiles of its floor against my tongue in some sort of sick dance 
 my face <unk> and crumpled into a <unk> christ what is happening to me 
 expression and i spat the contents of my mouth out into my hand 
 it smelled <unk> 
 i ca n't express how bad it was especially after being chewed up 
 something is definitely wrong 
 so i rush to the trash can and remove the boxes to start properly reading the labels 
 starburst '' okay nothing bad there 
 sours '' still nope 
 bean <unk> '' <unk> ... .what is this 
 i inspect the box and it turns out to actually be a little game that jelly belly put together 
 it has ten flavours within out of the standard 45 gourmet ones and of those ten flavours some of them have been swapped with god awful ones that appear the exact same as their partners 
 to make this clear they are identical in shape and appearance their flavours have been swapped 
 i pale as i start to read what potential flavours there are 
 i will list them here for your benefit * <unk> has a chance to be snot * <unk> has a chance to be gym socks * <unk> has a chance to be lawn clippings * buttered popcorn 
 rotten eggs * <unk> blue could be toothpaste * chocolate pudding could be canned dog food * caramel corn is moldy cheese * peach is barf * coconut is baby wipes * <unk> is skunk spray <unk> this guy my face gets more and more sad as i read these and i glance back at the mound of chewed up satan i spat out to try and gauge the colours of the three i tossed into my mouth 
 skunk spray barf and baby wipes 
 it tasted exactly like it said 
 i 'm sitting in my chair slowly realizing what i 've done to my christmas gift 
 i 've ruined it 
 every handful has a chance to bear one of these god awful <unk> flavours that will completely ruin any enjoyment out of the rest 
 i tried i tried to continue but the occasional barf or moldy cheese completely ruined my appetite and i had to stop 
 i 'm a man but i felt like crying 
 laugh crying 
 staring at this jar of assorted evil 
 i went to bed defeated 
 this afternoon i have poured out the entire contents onto a blanket and i 've separated out the every member of the ten flavours good or evil 
 i found out if you squeeze them and smell it you can pick up what flavour it is without completely ruining the jelly bean 
 so this is going to be my afternoon 
 reddit do n't make my mistake 
 read your labels or end up in jelly bean <unk> like me 
 tl dr - mixed many kinds of jelly bean flavours got some <unk> <unk> <unk> nonsense type to a magnitude of 10 in the <unk> 
 nearly died from a mouthful of baby wipes and skunk spray and am now sitting on my floor sorting through good and evil to find the <unk> my girlfriend and i have been dating for 10 years 
 i 've been planning to propose to her for the past six months : researching about diamonds and figuring out how to do the perfect proposal for her 
 on new years eve i enlisted the help of a few friends to figure out her ring size 
 she likes to drink and i figured she would pass out later in the night at which point we 'd slip a ring on her finger to figure out what size i should get 
 we let the night play out and sure enough she passed out 
 after a few tries we figured out her ring size was about 3.5 or 4. after a bit of searching i found a design that i really thought she would like and i ordered it in a size <unk> it looked perfect 
 now i had the ring and i knew how i wanted to propose to her 
 but silly me i decided that i did n't want the ring to be too big or too small 
 i waited for another night when we had both gone out to drink 
 we came home and she was fast asleep 
 she 's a pretty heavy sleeper especially when she 's had a few drinks 
 i thought it 'd be a great opportunity to slip the ring on her finger without her knowing that way i would know how well it really fit and i 'd be able to make <unk> before <unk> to her 
 to make sure she 's dead asleep i <unk> her finger with my hands and increase the pressure to see if she has any reaction 
 she 's dead asleep and does n't even stir 
 perfect 
 so i whip out the ring and slide it onto her finger 
 with a bit of resistance it slides on and sits perfectly and she has n't got a clue that she 's wearing her future ring 
 i 'm satisfied : 3.5 is the right ring size 
 as i try to take the ring off it gets stuck at her knuckle 
 i did n't see this coming 
 i gently tug but it 's not working the ring is stuck 
 i hold her hand firmly in place and tug and twist a bit more 
 i 'm in a panic the ring wo n't come off 
 i keep going at it for what seems like an eternity which was probably only 20 seconds and then i feel her hand pull away from mine 
 i look toward her and her eyes are wide open 
 super shocked 
 probably even more shocked than i am 
 she looks down at her hand and sees the ring 
 there 's not much i could do at this point so i ask her the big question with an embarrassed look on my face will you marry me '' 
 she sits up and gives me a big kiss and says yes 
 thank the lord 
 she loves the ring and thinks the proposal is memorable not ideal ... but memorable 
 tl dr : i tested an engagement ring on my fiancée while she was sleeping ring got stuck and now we 're happily <unk> reddit 
 i fucked up 
 i was in a nightclub 
 i was speaking to a girl and said i would buy her a drink she agreed 
 i took a swig from my drink 
 swig went down my <unk> 
 threw up on said girl 
 got kicked out of the nightclub 
 that 's it ... bye 
 edit : my shame is now front page 
 technically happened last night but close enough only just gotten over the trauma to post 
 me and my girlfriend hired a apartment room for alone time '' and all that jazz 
 and after a while and a few drinks we think hey i 've never actually seen my own butthole as you do 
 so i take a picture of her on my phone alone with a few fingers in and what not and show it to her and then we swap over and does the same then she got the great idea of trying out her little bullet vibrator on me i think fuck it why not '' 
 it feels pretty good awkward at first but then the vibrator turns on and she keeps <unk> the power it felt good so i asked her to put it in a little deeper 
 now this is where things go south fast 
 i hear an <unk> '' behind me with what feels like frantic scrabbling in my ass as i panic i tense up as you do 
 and it goes 
 it 's gone 
 there is <unk> but silence and a dull buzzing from my lower gut as the gravity of the situation set in 
 i waddle to the toilet and try and keep calm while all i can hear is a constant <unk> '' which i can feel moving around inside at one point it must have pressed <unk> my stomach in my hunched waddle state because my christ it buzzed 
 now bear in mind i 'm trying to keep calm focus my muscles and she is freaking the fuck out 
 did n't help thankfully within about 3-4 mins and some iron will from myself there 's an <unk> crash in the bottom of the toilet and it flies out like a potato out of a potato cannon 
 i 'm still a little shaken 
 and now nothing is going near my butt again tl dr girlfriend put a bullet vibrator in my butt it goes for a trip upwards while on full power i waddle to the toilet and i put mortar <unk> to shame with the force it came out 
 edit : sorry for typos so hung over while writing this 
 edit2 : for those that ask i 'm a dude 
 this happened a few days ago 
 i was out with my two youngest kids at the grocery store 
 when we were pulling up in front of the christian book store next door there was a mother and two young kids probably about 5 and 3 holding a sign that said they were poor and hungry please help '' 
 i am trying to teach my children about giving back at a young age so they grow up to be good helpful and respectful people 
 since we were going into the grocery store anyway i picked up a small jug of milk some bread some fruits and two pieces of candy for the kids since it 's the holidays and it was starting to snow the candy was more of a bonus for them being forced to stand outside in the cold 
 i explained to my boys what we were doing and they were excited to help out 
 we paid for all of our things and walked out 
 i was feeling pretty good about myself at this point 
 we walked over to the family standing in the snow and i handed the mother the bag 
 her reply was no i would like cash '' i 'm sorry but if you 're poor and hungry '' you should be more than excited that someone would go out of their way to buy some <unk> or even accept it for the children because the children definitely looked like they have been missing more than a few meals recently 
 she on the other hand did not 
 i set the bag down next to the children said merry christmas and went on my way 
 i watched her eat the candy out of the bag and set the rest next to her 
 luckily my children are n't quite old enough to realize what happened and still think we did a good thing 
 i will continue to let them think that 
 tifu by trying to help a family who claimed they were poor and hungry found out only the children are probably hungry and were being used to get <unk> reddit this is a bit of a long one but it pays off promise 
 this weekend for my birthday i decided to go to london comic con for the first time with my good friend d a con veteran 
 friday and saturday were great days <unk> by drinking smoking and meeting all sorts of awesome people 
 d knew plenty of people there so i got introduced to them made delightful new friends and wandered around in awe of all the fantastic <unk> and cool shit to do 
 on the friday night d got given a <unk> laced with <unk> some weird shit by an <unk> and had a very bad time but that 's another story 
 on the saturday night for me this time things went badly wrong 
 in front of the convention centre is a small green where there 's a music stage and people sit around drinking and partying in general until the early hours 
 we were out there drinking ourselves into a <unk> when i noticed a large crowd of people standing in a circle cheering and catching the eye of security 
 i decided to go and check it out and was greeted by an organised fighting ring <unk> by professor snape 
 the rules were simple : no striking and if you get someone on their back you win 
 sounds like fun right 
 well it was n't 
 i was doing a <unk> superman <unk> t-shirt plus cape and in my altered state may have believed i was more like the man of steel than a drunken guy of <unk> average build 
 i ran back to the group of people i was with and shouted i 'm gon na go get myself hurt for the respect of people i do n't know '' 
 professor snape was only too happy to oblige me <unk> me against a guy dressed as solid snake 
 this should have been my first warning 
 you do n't fuck with solid snake 
 surprisingly we were pretty <unk> matched 
 we were both <unk> and were both going for the old <unk> technique 
 i was considerably <unk> than him so swiftly lost my balance tripping backwards <unk> myself to my fate 
 unfortunately my cape proved to be my kryptonite 
 snake tripped on it falling forward over me with his knee extended 
 i <unk> what happened next 
 my right ball was caught between his very solid knee and the <unk> this hurt 
 it hurt a lot 
 writhing in agony i put on my <unk> smile shook the desperately <unk> snake 's hand and limped back to my group laughing at my own misfortune 
 my new friends were only too happy to join me 
 half an hour later the pain had n't gone 
 an hour later the pain had n't gone 
 my old friend d is a medical professional 
 he said dude you 're fine '' 
 i was n't fine 
 i was pretty fucking far from fine 
 i <unk> limped back to our hotel a mile away cradling my rapidly swelling <unk> 
 i took some painkillers and passed out 
 on waking up in the morning i looked inside my pants and was greeted with what looked like an <unk> <unk> <unk> on top of a red onion 
 i called down from the bunk : d how good a friend are you '' 
 very i 'd say '' ... <unk> you take a look at my dick '' 
 i whipped it out and the look of horror on his face told me all i needed to know 
 my dick and balls were entirely purple and <unk> swollen 
 i was in agony 
 go to hospital 
 now '' 
 i was n't going to argue 
 12 hours later having been giving an <unk> amount of painkillers an <unk> urine and blood tests i was driven via ambulance to a surgical ward in the next county 
 in my <unk> haze i remember <unk> of <unk> * '' think we can save the testicle ... <unk> ... blood <unk> ... crushed ... swollen '' * waking up in the morning after passing out for the second night in a row i was told that while it had been close the doctor thought i would be keeping my <unk> right ball 
 he would however have to apply what he referred to as a <unk> turban 
 i was discharged miles from london and had to limp across much of the city cradling my <unk> <unk> scrotum in order to catch the train home 
 i 'd missed all of the sunday of comic con and did n't gain any respect at all as far as i can tell 
 and that reddit is why i 'm off work with a <unk> <unk> and pumped full of codeine 
 my first con 
 tl dr went to first con fought solid snake now have purple ballsack the size of a baseball wrapped in a <unk> 
 edit 1 : spelling edit 2 : clarification and thanks a bunch for the gold 
 edit 3 : posted a pic for proof removed due to advice of mods and <unk> sense of shame 
 edit 4 : that 's enough annoyed fellow <unk> 
 edit 5 : video or it did n't happen 
 turns out it was n't snake who landed on me he was just on the other side 
 please do n't hold it against me i was super drunk and in a world of pain so not quite as with it as i could have been 
 it also apparently makes for a better story last night i crawled into bed and was having trouble falling asleep i was just laying there staring at the ceiling trying to calm my internal <unk> when i hear a slight <unk> squeaking coming from my <unk> hot female neighbor 's room above mine 
 knowing that she occasionally has male visitors over which i have enjoyed hearing her groan from before i started listening more intently 
 after a bit i hear some very slight moaning <unk> the steady squeak 
 living in an apartment with paper thin walls i knew that she was the only one home and <unk> that she was in fact masturbating 
 hot 
 so i start to get turned on and proceed to give me self a tug 
 she never really <unk> in intensity just staying quiet yet mostly even <unk> 
 i 'm fantasizing seeing her fingering herself and moaning while i lead myself to orgasm and finish feeling rather satisfied 
 i lay there in post ejaculate comfort and note that she 's still going still the same steady rhythm 
 mmmm i 'm loving this still 
 so i lay there listening for a bit close my eyes and try to sleep once more 
 after a little while i hear her get up and go to the kitchen 
 but ... i still hear the squeaking and the moaning ... <unk> she 's in the other room 
 i open my eyes with confusion and for the first time note that the sounds are n't all coming from directly above me the squeaking is but the moaning sounds like it might be coming through my open bedroom door in fact ... so i get up and creep out slowly from my bedroom to find the source of the <unk> 
 as i walk out of my room the sound gets a bit louder and more <unk> and ... familiar ... i then finally notice that this moaning is actually my cat lying on the couch fast asleep snoring 
 after a moment realizing my idiocy i go back to bed and also note that i 've heard the squeaking before on other hot nights such as this : a rotary fan in her bedroom 
 tl dr i jerked off to my cat snoring edit : whoa 
 glad you all enjoyed my awkward wank 
 this is completely true although i do n't have much of a way to verify 
 this is my cat also no i 'm not a lonely creep it 's kind of a fact of life living in <unk> constructed apartments that you can hear everything so why not enjoy it 
 would n't this kind of be the same as watching porn without video being a total stranger and all 
 she also gives quite a loud vocal performance when she 's got a guy over and knowing how sound <unk> her apartment as well i 'm not sure she cares 
 as for the fan just a guess seemed to fit the <unk> 
 maybe it 's a vibrator ... <unk> kitty kitty kitty edit2 : gold 
 gold 
 thank you kind feline <unk> 
 <unk> was over a year ago but i am still reminded of it almost every day 
 i am a database programmer and one day i was working on a project where our customers can upload a profile picture to their account 
 so i am going through the <unk> database stored <unk> and i find one called <unk> 
 it takes two <unk> a member id and an image object 
 perfect 
 to humor myself i found a picture of oscar gamble a baseball player from the 70 's and 80 's with the greatest afro in history 
 so i run the stored procedure it should n't take more than a second or two 
 well after about 10 seconds i start getting nervous 
 finally it says execution successful <unk> records updated '' 
 oh holy shit 
 every customer picture is now oscar gamble 
 every button on the restaurants point of sale system is oscar gamble 
 all the buttons that used to be a hot dog or coke or whatever is now oscar gamble 
 the thing is on the pos screen it <unk> in the image so you could n't see the whole picture just a close up of his face 
 our users start calling our help desk freaking out about an obama virus 
 customers are upset when they login to their account and see a picture that is obviously not theirs 
 took me about 2 hours to get everything back to normal and everyone had a good laugh 
 pictures and mentions of oscar gamble still float around the office pretty frequently 
 **edit : ** thanks for the gold 
 also my co-worker just sent me a screenshot he took of one of the pos <unk> that shows the obama virus '' in action 
 this happened around 9 years ago now but is probably the most embarrassing thing that i have ever done 
 the premise was ordinary enough i wanted to ask the girl i had a huge crush on out on a date 
 i gave her a call and no answer 
 that 's fine i 'll just leave a message saying i called and i would call her back 
 like most teenage boys i was super nervous and because of this i wanted to make sure the voice mail message was perfect 
 not too interested not too <unk> 
 this was easy enough as i could start leaving a message and if i did n't like it i could delete it and rerecord 
 easy enough 
 another thing i should note when i get up the courage to do something i talk to myself 
 i try to <unk> myself into it saying things like come on man you got this '' or no big deal stay calm '' about half way into the 7th or 8th try into the voicemail i 'm startled by a voice that i will never forget <unk> full 
 <unk> and then a click 
 ... it was at that point to my horror i realized that although i was pressing the restart button i had to first hit a different key to enter the menu for the restart to take place 
 i did n't start my message over 8 times 
 instead i left one obscenely long message comprised of me starting over again and again with phrases in between that talked about how i needed a good message because i liked the girl so much 
 i wish i could say at this point i never saw her again but i was young and stupid and tried to convince myself it was n't so bad 
 it would be several more months before i realized she was n't playing hard to get 
 the memory however lives on 
 edit : several people are asking about what happened afterwards 
 it 's not very interesting 
 she was always one of those people who tried her best not to make people feel bad and so it was never directly brought up and she tried to ignore me 
 the end of me having a crush on her actually occurred when i finally confronted her and made her tell me she did n't like me 
 it made her feel super uncomfortable but at least i got closure and we both finally got to feel awkward 
 or <unk> happened a year or two ago but i have only recently discovered this oh so glorious subreddit and deemed this story reddit worthy 
 this story occurs in florida 
 this has a little bearing to the situation because in florida the tidal pools are made the ocean washing over large <unk> in the sand and the receding tide leaving large pools of water only a foot deep that little children love and parents feel comfortable leaving there children in 
 that is before i enter the story 
 it was the afternoon and i was hanging out with a few of my friends <unk> fishing 
 one of my friends catches a bonnethead shark and one of the larger ones i 've seen at around 4 foot 3 inches that 's <unk> meters for you <unk> 
 as a kid i remember i always enjoyed seeing what the <unk> brought in when they were <unk> and a few of my friends agreed that it would be appropriate to take the shark in a large bucket we had to show the children 
 so i scoop up some <unk> <unk> the shark and run off to the tidal pool <unk> with children from the ages 2 to 4. as i near the tidal pool the shark seemingly decides its uncomfortable and shifts around and i not paying attention to my footing trip and drop a 4 foot shark into the kiddy pool 
 the shark instantly starts swimming off into the deeper parts of the tidal pool and i move faster than i ever have yelling at the top of my lungs theres a shark in the tidal pool theres a shark in the tidal pool '' 
 mothers grab their children babies are crying and i 'm <unk> around in a foot of water trying to grab a bonnethead shark 
 i eventually managed to scoop it up in a net and get it back into the bucket and then to the ocean 
 i decided to leave earlier than i had planned after receiving all manner of dirty looks from the mothers 
 tl dr i caught a small shark and went to show it to the <unk> when i tripped and dropped it in their tidal <unk> just happened reddit 
 crazy i know 
 i work in a large performance venue 
 i went into the bathroom for my daily 3:30pm case of the dirty <unk> and it just so happened that a co-worker from another dept who i 'm friendly with was walking in to sit down and take care of lunch in another stall 
 we 're sitting there brothers in stalls quietly downloading some brown loads when he rips a <unk> fart 
 the <unk> in the bowl was beautiful so i chuckled a little 
 he laughed back 
 i 'm the kind of guy who will always laugh at two things - farts and other people 's laughter 
 this was the holy grail 
 we basically laughed back in forth in turn <unk> to the point that i laughed so hard that i started farting too 
 this caused even more laughter 
 we both finally calmed down cleaned up and left the bathroom 
 i should probably mention that the venue i work offers <unk> tours to patrons 
 it just so happens that a tour group had been stationed right outside the bathroom as their tour guide was taking the time to talk about the history of a display in that hallway 
 we had many looks of horror amusement and even some of respect 
 tl dr : engaged in a <unk> <unk> with a co-worker 
 tough crowd 
 edit : when i am at work later my coworker and i will record a <unk> track to <unk> for gilding my farts edit 2 : thanks to all the <unk> <unk> <unk> who made me realize i was uploading my brown loads not downloading edit 3 : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> edit 2 furious : *op delivers* as you may or may not be aware it 's exam season here in the uk and us year <unk> grade <unk> to translate are off school permanently unless we have to be <unk> for an actual paper 
 today yes today bonus points was chemistry unit 5. transition metals and <unk> chemistry tricky stuff 
 sadly my fuck-up has nothing to do with <unk> acid 
 a little backstory : i 've been cycling a lot recently shout out to <unk> and i recently managed to get to and from my school 10 miles away 
 i decided cycling to school *for my <unk> would be a fun thing to do 
 i was n't late if that 's what you 're thinking 
 i <unk> my school clothes over the back of my chair in the morning got into my biking stuff had seven cups of coffee stared blankly at the past paper i 'd left out to do in the morning and browsed <unk> for a bit 
 the <unk> bike ride was hot sweaty and invigorating much like my weekends /s so i arrived knackered but in high spirits 
 ordering a <unk> cup of coffee i moved myself into one of the toilet cubicles to have a <unk> shower and change into my suit 
 no suit trousers 
 <unk> 
 * to cut what is already a long story short i ended up having to do the exam in a black suit jacket shirt and tie smart shoes and black cycling shorts 
 i am currently waiting on a photo that one of my teachers took on his iphone between breaths of laughter so i 'll post that if this gets any form of attention 
 tl dr : you know the nightmare you have of forgetting your trousers when you go to school 
 that happened 
 edit : i ca n't believe this got to the front page 
 cliche i know but in the midst of exam stress this has really put a smile on my face 
 i 'd like to especially thank <unk> and everyone else who took the time to comment 
 onto the stuff you <unk> to hear 
 the photo was taken by one of my heads of year while the other one was laughing his head off after i walked into their office and said i 've made a terrible mistake '' 
 i 've emailed him and asked for the photo and sent him a link to this post for good measure but i do n't expect a reply till tomorrow 
 i 'll update here and probably make another post just for good measure i do n't get any karma from this sadly ... *op will deliver 
 * i 'm saying this all now because i 'm going off to bed 
 i have <unk> electronics tomorrow morning so i need my <unk> 
 as my parting gift here is a video someone made about this exact chemistry paper last year 
 thanks for being awesome reddit this happened about 3 hours ago when i showed up to work and clocked in 
 my boss happened to be getting water and asked me about my iphone because he wants to make the switch from his android 
 he was asking some general questions and i was showing him some of the <unk> 
 then i let him hold my phone to get a feel for it and play around with the layout 
 being as i just rolled out of bed 30 minutes prior i did n't think much would come of this 
 then i saw him touch the messaging app 
 he wanted to see the layout of texts and see how to send a new one 
 unfortunately for me my most recent messages were all about <unk> and me hitting up a couple small time dealers looking for a little sack 
 of course he clicked into the top conversation and the last message was from my friend which read i had to run to the store so <unk> you arrive while i 'm gone the front door is unlocked and i left the weed on the counter just leave the cash '' 
 if i knew how to upload a screenshot of the conversation i would 
 i 'm still new to this and mainly a lurker he glanced at me gave a sly smile and handed me my phone back 
 i enjoy smoking once in awhile and needed to relax a bit from the stress of work 
 only problem i live in <unk> i received an email from him about 20 minutes ago saying i needed to meet with him at 4 which is right before we clock out 
 tl dr - i let my boss use my phone he saw a message about me buying weed and now i have a meeting right before the end of the day which probably means i will be fired 
 edit : when i walked in he asked me to sit down and was pretty serious 
 he chewed my ass for a bit <unk> that he saw the message and that he does n't want to see me go to jail over a text and that if anyone else saw it i would have been fired 
 he told me that because it was <unk> he was n't going to do anything about it and told me that if he ever caught me high at work i would be fired on the spot 
 then he starts smiling and says he enjoys a good toke as well 
 told me his kids and wife are out of town for the week and invited me over for as he put it <unk> <unk> whiskey and a joint '' 
 so here i am about to roll a joint and head to my boss 's house for a <unk> ass dinner 
 if he lets me get a picture of dinner i will add another edit with the image 
 edit 2 : just got back from dinner 
 trying to respond to everyone 
 and i really appreciate the gold 
 one love this actually happened 3-4 years ago when i was in my second year of university 
 i met an exceedingly handsome man lets call him lars and spent all year trying to move from just friends '' to more than just friends '' we had quite a lot in common and i thought this guy would be a great boyfriend and i therefore spent most of that year hanging out with him instead of doing my work 
 i even failed a class because trying to get with him was more important in my foolish 20 year old mind 
 so one night we were hanging out after watching a hockey game and i trying to be <unk> which i suck at pass him a note saying i & lt 3 you more than my favourite hockey team i ca n't put the team 's name because i might give myself away 
 so lars takes my note <unk> and asks if we can go to my dorm room hang out more i think he is going to confess his feelings for me so we head up to my room while i 'm grinning like a <unk> fish 
 we get to my room and he tells me that he 's gay 
 tl dr i tried to date a gay guy ended up failing a course and had to pull 3 all <unk> to finish all of my other work.so this happened around 10 years ago and i 'm using an obvious throwaway account 
 in my childhood bedroom there was a <unk> box thing that was about <unk> feet with black mesh and metal wire around the sides i 'm not sure what it was and i would n't dare ask my parents what it was at this point since that would just be odd 
 anyways me and my sister used to play a game where we took the grill lighter and put it against the side of this air altering box device that was and saw who would hold it there the longest 
 one day i held the lighter for a while and then me and her ran off back downstairs 
 apparently i had started a slow <unk> of the box things mesh since several hours later at night the smoke alarms all began going off fire trucks are at our house and we get rushed outside to the corner 
 the flames started in my room and despite my dad closing the bedroom door the flames did n't die out and we watched the flames slowly <unk> the house 
 fortunately me and my sister had fallen asleep in the basement so we did n't burn alive in my bedroom 
 nobody had any idea how the fire happened and it was blamed on the heater thing being faulty and having a short circuit of some sort 
 i have n't talked about this to my sister or to my family and think i will just leave this is the dark cobwebs of my life 's basement to not mention again 
 tl dr - i used a grill lighter to set a heater on fire in my room which burned my house down 
 <unk> : **this is a friend 's <unk> and she is n't a redditor but i begged her to let me post it from the perspective that she told the story in 
 also i apologize i 'm not a writer 
 i am currently a second grade teacher at a public school 
 i have a wonderful class and i like to <unk> them when they have a good week by having volunteer parents bring in snacks i.e 
 cookies candy granola etc 
 provided the parent keeps them <unk> 
 this week our volunteer parent who we will refer to as autumn lily speaker not far from her actual name told me on wednesday that she will be preparing cookies for the class and is <unk> for this opportunity 
 thinking nothing of it i thanked her and marked it off my weekly <unk> list 
 so friday rolls around and the kids are excited 
 autumn lily speaker comes into the classroom with a pan full of treats and brings them to me and says with a smile i decided you can use these to teach the kids about the woman 's vagina today '' 
 <unk> and completely caught off guard i slowly peel the <unk> foil off the pan to behold a <unk> of sugar cookie and frosting vaginas 
 not just any old vagina but all kinds of vaginas 
 there were small puffy white brown shaved bald and even a fire crotch with beef curtains 
 perplexed i give the parent the most professional look i can muster and quietly reply i 'm sorry autumn but i ca n't give these to my students 
 this just is n't appropriate '' 
 <unk> angry radical <unk> autumn bursts with the fury of a thousand angry <unk> <unk> 's and starts yelling in front of the class about how 'i should be proud of my vagina and 'i am <unk> for a women 's role in life 
 utterly bemused and frozen from shock all i can do is stand and stare at the woman as the word 'vagina is yelled in front of my second grade class about <unk> times 
 finally after what seemed like an eternity she storms out of the class leaving her vagina cookies on my desk 
 i scramble to collect my thoughts and take control of the situation before my second graders develop vaginal ptsd 
 my only thought is to scrape off the vagina frosting and hand out the plain sugar cookies to my students 
 the rest of my day went quite well and ended without a incident 
 i sent my kiddos home and started wrapping up work and getting ready to leave when the phone rings and a bewildered parent wants to know why their son learned the word 'vagina in class today i answer the best i can explaining the situation in the most professional manner possible 
 i get about 3 more phone calls and 4 emails until i get it the mother of all emails ... autumn 's 
 autumn 's email screenshots tl dr - <unk> crazy women who thinks she is a <unk> parent brings in vagina cookies parents are mad domestic violence wished upon me narrated courtesy of /u/cyae1 **edit : for clarity this was a friend and she took it up with the school 's administration who is taking appropriate <unk> **edit2 : this is not meant to be an attack on feministic <unk> it just has to do with a single radical feminist who lost her cool 
 feminism is about gender <unk> and should n't be grouped with off the wall people like this 
 ** **edit3 : no longer referring to autumn as a feminist because she is n't 
 she 's just bat shit <unk> <unk> : tifu by not knowing how to turn off my push notifications for my mobile app 
 ** **update 
 : i got a hold of my friend and asked her a couple questions about the incident so here are the main points 
 ** * the kid was removed from class by the parent and moved to a private school * the parent is no longer allowed on district property * school administration refused to answer whether or not they were taking action * no pictures were taken of the cookies * no action was taken against my friend administration deemed she handled it professionally * the cookies were actually pretty <unk> this happened a few weeks ago ... my girlfriend and i went to get <unk> and of course sake bombs- the other night 
 she was on her period so to compensate for the lack of sex we decided to drink ... a lot 
 after a few too many <unk> my girlfriend slammed the bottle onto an <unk> couple 's table 
 it was strongly suggested by management that we should leave so we <unk> out into the night 
 we got back to my apartment and she started begging me to lay into her 
 being the forward thinking man that i am we laid down a towel and proceeded to make her cry til the <unk> came home 
 fast forward a week later and my girlfriend is having <unk> stomach cramps and feels <unk> 
 remembering the night of <unk> passion we discussed the possibility of leaving the tampon in during sex 
 she was freaking out and i put on my best deep sea fisher face and tried to hook that bad boy out of her vag 
 now i have a girlfriend screaming in the bathtub and bloody cotton child laying on the floor of my bathroom while i throw up in the sink 
 this fuckup happened when i was approximately four years old so this did n't happen today at all - in fact it happened in the 1980s when people did n't know what <unk> was and children like me were <unk> called <unk> rather than <unk> hellspawn tinydemons from <unk> 
 the story begins with my mother being a teacher - at an <unk> school which teaches kids around the ages of eleven and twelve 
 the teachers had organised a christmas shindig just for them and their own kids - and as i recall it was hosted at the principal 's rather large house which had a great back yard for hellspawn tinydemons like myself to race around in until they exhausted themselves 
 now in new zealand christmas parties in the 1980s usually involved a lot of sun a lot of booze and piles of burned meat cheerfully charred by someone 's dad on an old brick bbq 
 in this case the booze was beer and cask wine and the casks were being kept under the shade of a trestle table with a big tablecloth thrown over it 
 the beer of course was in a bin full of ice which slowly turned to <unk> full of <unk> of burned meat and dead <unk> 
 amongst the beer was an assortment of nasty coloured fizzy drinks for the kids that were 90 % sugar 
 as a <unk> <unk> ball of irritation i had already worn everyone 's patience to the nub by being loud demanding and <unk> in the extreme 
 after being given a clip around the ear by my embarrassed mother i was told to sod off and go annoy the other kids 
 unfortunately for my slightly drunk and slightly <unk> mother i took my main chance to get out from under her <unk> eye and look for opportunities for <unk> 
 the other children <unk> from just below my age up to ten years old and finding myself <unk> by older smarter kids i decided to <unk> under the trestle table which doubled as an awesome blanket <unk> due to the oversized tablecloth 
 i should make it clear at this point that at my parent 's wedding not long before this i had stolen so many shrimps from the shrimp cocktails that i 'd thrown up over both my <unk> and <unk> grandmothers 
 i also required about three hours sleep a night and was pretty handy with a screwdriver - much to my <unk> father 's dismay who left tools all over the house 
 on this particular occasion my <unk> and <unk> turned to the casks of red wine under the table which i knew were the adult equivalent of fizzy drinks 
 figuring out the plastic <unk> spigots things on them i proceeded to get nicely <unk> 
 this would have been fine if i was n't also a <unk> and <unk> child - by <unk> my chance to <unk> the older kids as the <unk> i invited the others into my cave of wonders and proceeded to get a bunch of <unk> and primary schoolers <unk> on cheap cask shiraz 
 me vomiting red was probably the <unk> for my parents realising <unk> had been unleashed at the wrong <unk> - promptly followed by other kids <unk> crimson into plates of <unk> on the trampoline and into their parent 's laps 
 pretty quickly the party was over 
 i do n't remember the rest of the <unk> but apparently it was spent intermittently singing the four-year-old equivalent of drunk karaoke and falling asleep <unk> 
 we were never invited back to the principal 's house for parties 
 **tl dr** : got my four-year-old self and a whole bunch of other kids shitfaced at the bbq of my mother 's <unk> happened last week but it feels appropriate to still post it here 
 i like to think i have a pretty good gollum '' impression 
 i was practicing my gollum voice at work i work in tech support so people are usually on the phones around me so no one hears me being a weirdo and i was having a <unk> conversation between myself gollum and smeagol 
 the three of us were arguing about work when i said something about <unk> my co worker we 'll call her angela and wearing her hair like a cape in my gollum voice only to follow as smeagol and say <unk> 
 she 'll hear us 
 it was at this point i noticed everyone in silence around me 
 i <unk> over my cubicle and angela was there staring at me in utter fear 
 3 days later angela quit 
 **update** : fellow redditor /u/isthisnew has uploaded a voice over <unk> of this post and it 's hilarious 
 my fiance and i had been using my queen sized bed for a long time while my roommate was using a twin sized bed 
 now that we are about to get married we replaced my queen with her king sized bed and yes it is glorious 
 so we had an extra queen with no place to go and i asked my roommate if he 'd like to use it of course he agreed 
 so we wash the sheets and move the bed to his room 
 fast forward to today and he tells me that his throat is hurting a lot 
 rewind three weeks ago and i was huddled in the blankets having the worst case of strep throat i had ever experienced 
 but we were puzzled we washed the sheets ... until we remember that we did n't wash the comforter because '' ... i do n't think we need to wash that one '' 
 **tl dr : i accidentally went christopher columbus on my roommate by giving him my strep throat blankets with my old bed 
 <unk> time using tinder 
 i thought what the heck might as well try it and see what happens 
 fast forward to a few weeks later i matched up with a very lovely woman and we decided to meet up 
 we met up at a restaurant in the city 
 had a few drinks and a few laughs with some delicious food 
 we also take a stroll around the city having a nice talk and getting to know each other 
 as the night ended i took her home as her friend dropped her off at the restaurant initially 
 i parked up in front of her home and was saying goodnight 
 she asked if i would like to come in side for a bit 
 i knew i scored big time so i was cheering 
 as i walked in it seemed like she was n't living alone 
 it was a pretty big house 
 i asked if she lived with anyone and she said she lives with her sister but she 's out of town and has the house to herself for a week 
 we sat on the couch and eventually one thing led to another 
 next thing you know i carry her to her bedroom and she starts going down on me 
 that is until the door flung wide open with her husband staring straight at both of us 
 yes her husband 
 i guess he was the sister out of town 
 he immediately starts charging at me as i stood there <unk> 
 he hit me with a flew blows and i was swinging back to get him away from me 
 i dazed him out with two punches to his <unk> push him real hard that he moved out the way and i hit the runner straight to the front door 
 all this was happening while she his so called wife was screaming as us to stop fighting 
 this happened about an hour ago and i currently have a bag of cold peas on my left cheek thinking fuck me 
 did i just really ruin a home i honestly feel pretty awful 
 i wonder what is happening to her now <unk> 
 so long for online dating 
 tl dr. went on a tinder date husband walked in on us all hell broke loose 
 **update 
 ** as cliche as it sounds i did n't expect this post to become as big as it is now 
 many people are calling this story fake but you can say what you want 
 the deed has been <unk> unfortunately 
 i woke up this morning thinking what the fuck 
 first <unk> of what happened i actually could n't believe it 
 second seeing this post blow up on reddit with great advice from redditors it really had me thinking 
 i am not going to press charges because in reality the husband is going through enough already and i would n't want anything else to be a <unk> burden on him 
 i took them punches like a man and now i just have to deal with it 
 what i am going to do though is write a letter explaining the whole backstory and leave it in their mailbox with a 12 pack on top of it 
 i deleted tinder and blocked the <unk> number 
 i think i should leave the dating game on the side for <unk> while and concentrate on myself 
 i 'm just going to have a quiet night to myself tonight and relax hoping this <unk> on my face heals quicker than usual 
 <unk> of australian women 
 i got home from work this evening and was getting ready to go to the gym 
 a few moments before heading out the door i was opening some snapchats i had received earlier in the day and just as i was about to exit the application i received one from my cousin female who never snapchats me male we missed each other in college by about a year so i was kind of excited to hear from her and see what kind of shenanigans she was getting into to these days 
 so at the exact same time that i receive a <unk> of texts from her i open up the snapchat to receive full <unk> <unk> of my <unk> cousin 
 of course the texts were do not open that snapchat from me '' do not '' i swear to god do not '' i swear these have to be the three fastest <unk> texts in the history of human motion 
 so there 's that in my life now 
 cousin if you see this since i know you reddit sorry for sharing but at least its <unk> edit 1. washington state no <unk> involved 2. no reddit i did not screenshot it lol 3. there will be no wincest in this guy 's future 4. she 's not really my type anyway 5. i made it to the gym and it actually was leg day : dthis happened about 2 hours ago 
 it all started about 2 days ago 
 i messaged both alice '' and stacy '' this sunday on okcupid 
 i am a sad lonely man and i need a <unk> 
 they both happened to respond 
 awesome 
 i set up the date with stacy '' first 
 we set it for this friday around <unk> for coffee 
 cool 
 now if any of you have ever dated online before you know how often <unk> <unk> fades and general bullshit happens 
 so as i was still talking to stacy i set up a date with alice 
 based on my talking with stacy she seemed somewhat reserved and <unk> and it felt like a 1-2 hour '' coffee date kind of thing 
 so i figured i had time on friday night to go out with alice 
 alice and i play some rocket league set up a date friday night everything is groovy 
 fast forward to today 
 i talked to both <unk> alice <unk> until today 
 about 3 hours ago i receive this message from <unk> okcupid : oh my god this is too funny 
 you should <unk> '' at this point i have no idea what the fuck is going on 
 then i got a text from alice ... <unk> your phone '' how in the actual fuck out of all the women in the world do i happen to pick 2 women that are best friends meet each other tuesday night and ask each other about their fucking dates on friday 
 i can only imagine their fucking faces when they figure out they 're going out with the same dude on the same day mere hours apart 
 the last i heard one was really fucking pissed at me and the other one thinks it 's hilarious 
 yes i know <unk> jokes fuck you 
 a better man than me might have pulled it off 
 **tl dr set up dates with two completely seperate women on okc on the same day 
 they hung out today and happen to be best fucking friends and figured out they 're both going out with the same <unk> proof : first ss from stacy : next ss from alice : old home with old <unk> door knob the kind that has an open key hole all the way through it 
 before work i sprayed it full of expanding foam quite proud of myself for easily fixing the <unk> problem 
 after work realize what a mistake i 've made when i ca n't get back into my <unk> wife and i have been trying for a second baby for about 3 months now and still have not gotten pregnant 
 during this time she started baking cupcakes and cake truffles from our home to sell 
 i created her a website and got some facebook voucher codes for $ 50 advertising 
 i tried using the code on mine but i realised it was only for new <unk> only i had already <unk> my fb page so i was n't <unk> 
 how i fucked up : i texted her this morning to tell her i 'm gon na log in with her account because it needs a new <unk> in order for the coupon to work 
 i start creating an ad and in the background i see her <unk> her best friend 
 she asks my wife if the test came out good or bad 
 i continue creating the ad and try not to read anything but i read her saying it came out positive 
 at this point i call her and tell her i read it 
 apparently she had been planning on a cute way to tell me since we started trying 
 she had her sister order a shirt so it would n't show up in our account since i keep up with that daily 
 the shirt says big brother '' 
 she was going to have it delivered to our neighbors so that i did n't accidentally get the package 
 the shirt was supposed to be delivered today and she was going to have my son wear it when i got home 
 i have never logged in to her account before and the one time i do it fucks up a big surprise 
 edit : well damn i did n't expect to blow up so much 
 also thanks for the gold 
 edit 2 : thanks for all the kind words 
 i knew reddit had a soft side 
 edit 3 : i can see the traffic on my wifes cupcakes website you sneaky redditors 
 edit 4 : thank you guys for the website traffic i can finally <unk> 
 edit 5 last edit : a lot of redditors have asked for my wifes website but i really did n't want this to be pr for it 
 it 's really pointless unless you 're in the dallas tx area 
 if you really want it you can send me a pm 
 edits : rupees not <unk> 
 also i made my front-page 
 thanks for all the comments : i 'm about to land but i 'll read the rest once i get home 
 just got reddit gold from a very kind fellow redditor 
 thank you 
 hey reddit this just happened to be this week 
 it’s quite long but i hope you enjoy it 
 i had a trip planned to india and was flying out this past saturday 
 a couple of weeks prior i applied for the indian tourist visa online 
 it got approved in a couple of days and all was good 
 i bought plane tickets and booked <unk> 
 i was flying from the us to india with a connection in germany 
 trip day comes 
 i exchange a bunch of dollars into indian rupees and off we go 
 i take the 9 or so hour flight to germany and have an hour or so to get to my next flight 
 i pass customs in germany and security 
 all good 
 then there’s this airline counter : “document check” right after security where they make sure you have all the proper visas and what not to travel to wherever you’re going 
 i was very careful to print out everything and proceed to show all of this to the airline person 
 i want to quickly explain how indian tourist visas work 
 you apply online with your name passport info date of arrival etc 
 once your visa is approved you get an email with your visa confirmation number your passport number etc 
 you print this out and once you get to india you will get the actual visa on your passport 
 ok back to the document check module 
 i’m a bit anxious as my flight leaves soon but i’m past customs and security so i should be good 
 i show the guy my passport and my printed visa confirmation 
 he starts <unk> through my passport and gets this worried look on his face 
 once <unk> done he looks up with the saddest expression on his face and tells me he can’t let me go through 
 the indian visa requires 2 completely blank pages on your passport and all of mine have something in it 
 even if it’s just an entrance stamp from when i’ve arrived to the us it’s still not completely empty and thus doesn’t count 
 it starts to sink in that i’m not actually going to be able to board my plane 
 he tells me to go to the airline service center to see what i can do 
 i eventually get there and talk to several representatives 
 they can’t let me go because i will be turned back once i arrive in india and they will be charged a fine for letting me go in the first place 
 also by this time my flight has left 
 they mention that i can potentially get extra pages added onto my passport in the consulate 
 my return flight is not until a week later so i decide if i can get new pages quickly enough i can still make it to india and use the same return flight 
 it’s sunday and everything is closed so i have to chill for now and call the consulate first thing in the morning 
 i get a hotel room at the airport and slowly admit defeat 
 i 'm not really expecting to be able to make but still giving it a shot because why not 
 i cancel what i can for the days i won’t be able to be there 
 monday arrives and my body is completely confused 
 i’m hit with <unk> jet lag i’ve ever had 
 i didn’t actually think it was a thing until now 
 in my head i’m apologizing to all the people i had silently judged when they complained about being jet lagged 
 i call up the consulate and they say they can’t give me new pages for my passport but they can give me a whole new <unk> passport 
 they ask when i would like the appointment and i simply say : “can it be right now ” 
 i train into the consulate everyone is super nice and effective and i’ve got a new passport within the hour very impressed 
 it suddenly dawns on me holy shit i’m actually going to make it to india 
 super excited i decide to explore the city a bit 
 germany is pretty cool has amazing <unk> and pretzels 
 it’s raining but it doesn’t matter because i’m going to india 
 i train back to the hotel and make sure to call the indian visa place to make sure my visa is still good if i got a new passport and get the ok from them 
 sweet i book a flight for 2 days from now since i’m not going to make the first city i was going to in india 
 might as well stay here and try and fix the jet lag 
 next day i’m still super jet lagged and have a horrible time 
 i still go out and explore the city and end up going to a pretty cool zoo 
 i pass out at <unk> and sleep like never before 
 wake up the next morning refreshed and ready for india 
 my flight is in 6 hours so i have an epic breakfast go to the gym and day dream about eating new food and finally using my indian rupees 
 same deal cross customs cross security and back at the “document check” place again 
 different guy and this one is kind of a dick 
 i show him both my passports and my visa 
 he does his thing for a bit and then says he can’t let me through 
 <unk> 
 he says that the visa confirmation page i have printed out says my passport number is different that that of my new passport 
 no shit i got a new passport but the old one matches and it’s right here with me 
 i also tell him i called the indian visa place to ask this specific thing and they said it was all good 
 he still won’t budge 
 he calls his supervisor on the phone and he says no 
 i ask to speak to his supervisor and he says you can’t but you can speak with the customer service desk of the airline same place i had gone the previous time 
 it’s very rare that i get altered or lose my nerve 
 the only <unk> is when dealing with cell phone <unk> 
 so i keep my calm 
 i know i have the facts on my side and i got plenty of time since i came in early 
 i walk over to the customer representatives desk and explain the whole story 
 this woman <unk> it she’s on my side 
 she says she just has to get some proof that it doesn’t matter if you get a new passport 
 she calls the indian consulate in germany and they say they’re not sure 
 i google and find it clearly stated on their website that it’s okay if you have a new passport 
 she calls the indian visa place to make sure and they end up saying that it’s not a problem if you get a new passport and your visa is in the old one as long as you carry both passports with you 
 however what i had wasn’t a visa 
 it was a visa authorization and that one is binding to whichever passport you applied with 
 so my visa authorization is bound to my old passport which has a big <unk> stamp on it 
 i’m assuming when i called the indian visa place the day earlier they thought i already had my visa on my passport and i didn’t think to clarify 
 the lady is super sorry and heart broken for me 
 i’m done 
 i’m going home 
 i lost this one 
 now i thought this is where it ended 
 i’m not going to india i accept that 
 i won’t be able to eat the food or use my indian rupees 
 let me just go home 
 i proceed to grab my checked bags and go to the ticket counter for the airline which was operating my return flight 
 my return flight was on sunday it was now wednesday and it went india - & gt germany - & gt us 
 great i can just grab the second flight on sunday and go back home 
 or even better i might be able to grab the same flight back tomorrow or something 
 nope 
 apparently if you don’t board the first part of your flight india - & gt germany our whole trip gets wiped and you can’t board the second one 
 furthermore you can’t just cancel your first flight and be good because it might be more expensive to go from germany - & gt us than to do india - & gt germany - & gt us 
 <unk> 
 this is what they told me anyways 
 so even if i just chilled in germany until sunday i couldn’t board the flight i had already paid for 
 so no matter what i had to pay a changing fee and the difference of the flight or get a completely new flight 
 i end up changing the flight for the next day at a charge of $ 500 bucks and booking another room at the hotel in the airport 
 i was completely defeated at this point 
 i proceed to stay in my room all day playing video games and ordering room service with wine 
 today i boarded my flight back to the us 
 i was terrified that now my us visa i’m not american so i have one of those too wouldn’t work with the new passport and i would be once again turned back at the famous “document check” module 
 luckily there were no problems 
 i’m now writing this from the plane as i’m headed home 
 no india for me 
 total flights lost : 4 + change fees thanks for reading reddit 
 tldr was headed to india connecting through germany 
 got stuck in germany because i needed a new passport 
 got new passport 
 indian visa not <unk> with new passport 
 no india 
 my wife is a flight attendant and she is gone for 4-5 days art a time 
 we have been married for 24 years and i really miss her when she 's gone 
 we have 3 children ages 8 10 and 12. the 8 year old is our only girl 
 she is a fucking <unk> 
 she likes to sleep late and stay up late 
 anyway on thanksgiving day my wife flew in and she missed me a lot 
 in so many words she told me what she was going to do to me that night after the kids were in bed 
 it made me <unk> 
 so around 9ish we told the kids to brush their teeth and we would read to them a bit then it was off to bed 
 after reading to them my wife said you guys get in the bed and do n't come downstairs and bother mommy and daddy 
 we are going to sit on the laptop and do some christmas shopping for you '' 
 well this made them run upstairs and get right in the bed 
 we waited about ten minutes and it was sexy time 
 i wo n't get into details but let 's just say my wife really missed me and was vocal about it 
 about halfway through our sexy time i hear a knock on the door 
 we immediately stop what we are doing 
 we are dead silent hoping whoever it is will go away 
 thirty seconds go by and i hear the sweet sound of my precious 8 year old daughter say are you guys still christmas shopping '' 
 my wife says yes we are 
 go back upstairs '' 
 my little angel says well all i can hear is ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh '' 
 immediately i lose my <unk> 
 end of sexy <unk> was fresh out of high school working as a receptionist for a fancy computer firm 
 it was my 2nd day on the job and the sales manager approached me and asked if i would announce over the company intercom 'that the sares meeting is beginning 
 i repeated his request back to him and he said 'not sares ... <unk> 
 no problem - i picked up the phone and proceeded to announce to the entire building that the <unk> meeting is beginning 
 immediately i knew ifu because the entire building erupted into laughter 
 turns out the poor bastard had a speech impediment and pronounced his <unk> 's as <unk> 's 
 sales meeting ... <unk> <unk> meeting throwaway because the gf knows my account 
 this happened last friday and i finally got the stains out of the sheets 
 i took the girlfriend out to dinner as a celebratory meal for her finishing school 
 a nice meal two glasses of wine her cheeks are <unk> she wants to go home 
 ok no prob 
 she was also pretty horny 
 so one thing lead to another i have her all wound up i slip off her dress and she decides to go down on me 
 you can see where this is going 
 i 'm lying on the bed full erect and she 's got me in her mouth slowly and sensually going up and down 
 the odd quick one and more sucking shit this is awesome 
 so then she goes way down 
 <unk> down 
 and i 've never felt that before 
 and in my pure moment of body numbing pleasure with my balls getting that tingly feeling my hips thrust ever so slightly 
 well that little movement <unk> the gag reflex of a full stomach horny and fairly drunk college graduate 
 she puked up two glasses of wine half of a fruit <unk> with ice cream her salmon <unk> on wild rice and one quarter of a <unk> <unk> d all over my erect penis while it was in her mouth 
 all over my balls in her hair all over my lap on my comforter and a good portion of my sheets 
 still plan on marrying her though.so i 'm in my hotel room and go online to check my orientation schedule for tomorrow and see that check-in starts at <unk> am ... next <unk> i was pulling into the target parking lot when i saw a man on a nearby sidewalk that said living in van anything will help god bless '' 
 i saw a <unk> van behind him that was filled with blankets boxes a large water bottle etc 
 the man also had a dog with him 
 i am a sucker for animals and this man really did seem to be going through a rough time 
 also it 's lent so i figured that it would be a good idea to be more <unk> 
 for the record i do not normally give directly to people with cardboard signs on the street because i know there are much better ways of helping the economically disadvantaged and that many <unk> are <unk> 
 so during my shopping trip during which i got a lot of toiletries for myself i picked up some extra items that i knew would be helpful for someone living in their car : unscented baby wipes hand sanitizer a pack of those <unk> toothbrush things a target gift card and a starbucks gift card <unk> are nice and clean and if you buy one coffee or food item you can hang out there all day as well as some <unk> trail mix instant coffee packets and <unk> 
 i also got a some dog food dog treats and some entertain your dog for hours '' 
 bones 
 included a small note on a ripped out piece of paper asking the man to stay positive and giving him information about several charities in the area 
 unfortunately once i left the target the man his van and his dog where nowhere to be seen 
 i did a lap around the surrounding block but could n't find him 
 i was disappointed but decided to head home 
 on my way back i passed a corner that i drive by at least twice a day if not more 
 there 's always a man begging on that corner 
 he stands there every day with a sign asking for money 
 he has come up to my car before to beg and i have never given him anything 
 but today i had two bags full of things for a homeless person '' in my car and decided what the hell hopefully this will help him 
 so i pulled over rolled down my window and <unk> for him to come closer 
 i had to reach into my <unk> to grab the bags which was a little bit awkward but i was able to pass them through the window 
 he thanked me placed the bags on a bench took off his hat and <unk> it to his chest which was interesting because i learned that he was bald under the hat he always wears 
 i said something like god bless you have a nice day '' 
 and drove away 
 once i got home i looked at the rest of my target bags and realized that i had the hand sanitizer toothbrushes gift cards and food that i had purchased for him with me still 
 i had my receipt and found out that i was missing the bag that most of my toiletries were in 
 i also realized that i had given him all of the dog stuff despite his lack of dog 
 tl dr so i pulled up next to a bald homeless man whom i see every damn day and have never given anything to and gave him some baby wipes dog food dog treats dog bones a box of <unk> a <unk> kit three pairs of pantyhose a bottle of shampoo and some fucking <unk> syrup 
 i 'm pretty sure he 's going to think i 'm making fun of him : edit : thank you everyone for the kind responses 
 i realize this is n't the worst thing in the world but i am worried that i insulted him with what was in the one bag 
 i will drive past him again today i 'll pull over and give him the correct bag and explain 
 hopefully he was able to give <unk> trade some of the items 
 i ca n't imagine what a yeast infection is like for homeless women 
 i hope this thread <unk> someone to be <unk> to the <unk> economically disadvantaged 
 if you do n't want to fuck up like i did try giving directly to a food pantry church i know this is reddit but most churches really do try to help people a <unk> program or a shelter -- feel free to give to a battered women 's shelter children 's shelter <unk> shelter depending on whom you most want to help 
 most places should have <unk> of needed items online or if you call them 
 happy holy week to you all 
 update : i saw him again today and gave him the back of other items 
 he laughed and said thanks anyway and that he gave the items he did n't need to his shelter 
 again thanks for the nice comments everyone 
 so i had a super shitty day at work today and i usually love my work 
 it dragged on and on and on ... finally after 15 hours of stuff i hate to do i crawled home 
 one thing that kept me somewhat <unk> is the thought of my girlfriend making dinner for me 
 she is an amazing cook so i was really looking forward to it 
 i get home and make my last call for today while she whips up dinner 
 she calls me i sit down pretty dead by that point and she shoves a pot of something in front of me 
 i take a fork and eat it 
 <unk> it 's spicy noodles <unk> in some sort of delicious soup 
 i had one <unk> this entire day and the noodles taste unbelievably fucking incredible to me 
 i devour them and with all but tears in my eyes tell my girlfriend this is the best thing she ever made i am absolutely amazed she should make this every week 
 then i notice she 's just sorta ... staring at me 
 at this point i look down and realize what i am eating 
 it 's fucking instant noodles from a dollar store still in that freaking plastic bowl they come in 
 apparently i was <unk> enough to : * <unk> instant noodles * wander into 24 hour store buy instant noodles * thrust them into my gf 's hands and inform her i do n't want any of the steak and salsa she was planning to make but in fact i want instant noodles * having no recollection of the above eat instant noodles and act like it 's a god 's gift to earth 
 kids do n't let this become your life **edit** : since this is still getting replies might as well clear some stuff up 
 i actually got some sleep since you know this post is 20 hours old 
 not as much as i would have liked to but what can you do 
 my girlfriend did not in fact dump me on the spot or <unk> me to the couch 
 she is a lovely and very understanding woman 
 i did not drive home 
 i eat my steak rare with no <unk> save occasional red wine sauce 
 salsa makes for a mad side dish tho 
 my working hours are usually somewhat shorter <unk> and comprised mostly of stuff that i love to do 
 so no thanks i do n't need a new job 
 ~~i do however need more <unk> also people from the top thread i meant reddit but fuck if i know what actually happened to <unk> also i am female but did n't feel like correcting every single lovely person in the comments for making the standard reddit assumption **tl : dr** : i live to eat <unk> <unk> steak another <unk> 's a couple of things you have to know about me for any of this to make sense 
 firstly i went to a small rural high school where everyday knows everybody and there 's very little protocol for anything out of the ordinary 
 secondly i had recently had some heart problems so i had been wearing a heart monitor that alerted me when my heart was beating <unk> 
 <unk> i 'm a classic good girl who had never broken a rule in my life 
 in fact until that fateful day i did n't even know where the principal 's office was 
 so here 's what happened 
 for my physics class i had to complete a project called the egg drop project '' 
 i 'm pretty sure this is a common assignment for basic physics classes but in case any of you do n't know what it is allow me to explain 
 basically the idea is to drop an egg onto the ground from 20 feet up without the egg breaking 
 some people built complicated <unk> while some people just wrap the egg in bubble wrap and let that sucker fall 
 i decided to put my egg into a small box fill the box with cotton balls and close the box with duct tape 
 now my physics class was my last class of the day so i decided to just set it inside the class room put my name on it and come back for it later 
 i thought that would be fine because i left projects in random classrooms all the time and no one ever messed with any of them 
 however this time was different 
 someone found my project and thought it would be funny to open up the classroom window and set it outside 
 i guess they thought that i would walk into the classroom freak out because i could n't find it and then we 'd all have a good old laugh about it 
 wrong 
 so wrong 
 apparently a student was arriving late to school and noticed a small cardboard box just chillin outside of the building and decided to go tell the main office about it 
 so there i was <unk> my own business sitting in my 4th hour class when a rushed slightly panicked announcement came over the loud speaker 
 they called my name and asked me to come to the office 
 immediately 
 i was already freaked out because i had never been called to the office before 
 but honestly i just assumed i had forgotten something at home that my mom was dropping off 
 when i got to the main office all of the secretaries were just staring at me 
 they all looked oddly pale and they were not saying anything at all 
 i asked them if i had a package or something and one of them just pointed to the principal 's office and told me that they were expecting me 
 okay 
 weird 
 i was getting really nervous but i did n't want to ask questions so i just went in anyway 
 i entered the room and there was my principal my vice principal and my egg drop project just sitting on the desk 
 i sat down across from them and i honestly did n't know what to think 
 the feeling in the room was so tense 
 no one said anything for so long and just when i could n't take it anymore the principal said this was found by a student outside of the physics classroom 
 it has your name on it 
 we have called the police and they 're on their way 
 we need you to tell us right now ... is this a bomb 
 do you have a <unk> on your person 
 and if it is in fact a bomb i need you to tell us how to disarm it '' 
 i was shocked 
 i honestly did n't know if i should laugh or scream 
 looking back on it now it is absolutely ridiculous that a box containing an egg and bag of cotton balls could cause so much drama 
 but at the time i was scared out of my mind 
 i was getting ready to explain everything and apologize when the worst possible thing that could have ever happened actually happened 
 *beep* *beep* 
 my heart monitor 
 it had registered my nervousness and increased heart rate 
 it was dead silent in that room except for the sound of that beeping 
 all three of us just stared at each other not moving not even breathing 
 it started slowly and quietly every second getting louder and faster until it actually sounded like a <unk> action movie explosion <unk> 
 the two grown men in front of me began to panic 
 one of them grabbed the intercom system and screamed <unk> get down we 've got a bomb in the building 
 ** '' the other one grabbed the box and kind of just ran around the room with it 
 meanwhile i was yelling at them trying to explain that it was n't a bomb and the beeping was n't me trying to set it off 
 the whole thing probably only lasted 10 seconds maybe less 
 but the panic in the room mixed with the screams from the <unk> outside made it feel like everything was in slow motion 
 when i got my wits about me i grabbed my monitor and pulled it off of my body 
 the beeping stopped and they finally calmed down enough to hear me say it 's not a bomb it 's an egg in a cardboard box and i have fucking heart problems '' 
 eventually i explained everything 
 we did n't exactly laugh about it but i got to go home for the rest of the day 
 so that was cool 
 also everyone at school knew me as the girl who brought a bomb to school and i made it into the graduation speech 
 so at least i have that going for me 
 **tl dr : having heart problems is in fact not da bomb 
 ** **edit : okay 
 quite a few of you are wondering why they would bring the box into the building if they thought it was a bomb 
 and honestly i wondered the same thing 
 the only thing i can come up with is that because my school was so small and they knew i was a good kid they did n't actually believe it was a bomb 
 if that 's the case then they probably just planned on bringing me in so i could confirm that it was just a harmless egg in a box 
 they did end up changing their entire policy after this incident and they added a bomb threat drill 
 ** **edit 2 : reading through the comments especially the ones who so kindly and respectful shared their opinion that this post is <unk> has really shown me that people have no idea what 's going in small towns like mine 
 it 's not uncommon for people to bring weapons into the school 
 people have pocket knives attached to their <unk> and <unk> in their vehicles 
 that 's just the way it is 
 i do n't actually care if people <unk> my story or not but the point is this shit happens all the time 
 it 's not super unusual 
 * edit 3 : sorry i 'm editing so much but i want to answer the most common questions 
 1. the egg did survive but the police took the box away 
 so i had to remake it 
 i eventually got all the points on my project 
 : 2. pretty much it was common knowledge who put the box outside but he did n't get in trouble 
 i think everyone involved was just embarrassed and they wanted to put the whole thing behind them 
 3. i <unk> all the concern about my heart 
 i 'm alive and well 
 i have <unk> syncope and i 'm taking medicine that pretty much allows me to live normally technically yesterday i fucked up but whatever 
 to set the scene i was flying back from a business trip to <unk> the morning after a long night of vaguely <unk> drinking 
 i arrived at <unk> de <unk> at an absolutely <unk> hour of the morning and got ready to board my flight and return to the usa 
 i was miserably hung over and stopped in an airport restaurant for some breakfast 
 somehow my <unk> mind decided it would be a good idea to get eggs benedict and a <unk> 
 a word to the wise : never under any circumstances eat airport eggs benedict 
 if for some incomprehensible reason you must eat airport eggs benedict do n't wash them down with an <unk> beer 
 as i <unk> onto the plane a bit later my stomach started churning pretty aggressively 
 i found my seat <unk> a hello to the <unk> french family sitting next to <unk> my row and settled in with noise-cancelling headphones and some music 
 a little ways into the flight my stomach turned <unk> completely 
 taking a shit in an airplane bathroom is one of the more miserable things in the world so i resigned myself to a <unk> journey 's worth of intestinal discomfort 
 then the farts started coming 
 one then another then another unrelenting waves trying to fight through a <unk> the <unk> equivalent of the <unk> at <unk> 
 i kept them silent but they kept coming 
 i felt for the rest of the plane smelling these horrid drunk airport eggs benedict farts 
 at least i thought they would n't know it was me 
 it went on like this for the entire flight a <unk> <unk> of vile but silent farts every 10 or 15 seconds 
 then we started the landing 
 i started to let out a fart as an announcement came over the <unk> i pulled off my headphones to listen 
 suddenly to my horror as i pulled off the noise-cancelling headphones the silent '' fart turned <unk> loud 
 i put the pieces together and <unk> deeper and deeper into my seat as i did 
 <unk> shit ... that means ... the entire flight ... oh fuck <unk> i <unk> out of that airplane without making eye contact with a single soul 
 tldr : made questionable food choices and released what i thought were silent hangover farts to an entire airplane for 6 hours because i forgot my noise-cancelling headphones cancelled noise 
 edit : holy shit front page of reddit and gold 
 thanks strangers 
 also to the go take a shit '' crowd many years of experience with my own stomach make me highly confident that this was not a one and done thing taking a shit would have reduced my personal discomfort but i 'd just have been the constantly farting guy who kept making everyone move so i could shit every half hour 
 that being said yes all the decisions i made in this story were bad decisions 
 i blame free booze and sleep deprivation 
 also myself 
 yeah mostly <unk> going into the story itself i have to give a bit of background 
 one of the important part of my work is going to professional <unk> parties or trade shows 
 it 's a fairly small world so i end up meeting the same 100 people at least once a week in a social setting think open bar and free food 
 naturaly after a few years like that you start making <unk> friends especially among the few people among my age 
 one of these people is a cute young lady with whom i share a passion about videogames and we usually chat about that while hitting the bar 
 all in all just a friend 
 last night we met at a party where so where also invited and where i met her boyfriend of a few years who she wanted to marry i introduce myself and then she and i start to chat about our latest favorite game <unk> of eternity for those wondering 
 after some time i go to the bar to grab a few glasses for me her and her bf yay free champagne and when i come back a couple minutes later said boyfriend is throwing a <unk> about how she 's looking at me '' an then storms off shouting that it 's over between them 
 i then proceed to my friend that has become a teary <unk> and put her into a cab to go back home 
 i then proceed to my own place and proceed to my daily skype session my own girlfriend long distance sucks guys 
 i tell her what just <unk> to the party and she then starts to act coldly and ends the session quite fast 
 i then woke up this morning to a text telling me that she 's breaking up with me because where there 's smoke there 's fire you were obviously hitting on her '' 
 so i 'm now single and the single positive fact of the day is that me and my newly single friend are going to hit the bars tonight to get wicked drunk we both need it 
 tl/dr : crazy jealous bf breaks up with my friend because he thinks she 's into me 
 my own gf proceeds to break up with me because she thinks i did something wrong 
 gon na get wicked drunk tonight 
 update : too much beer too much shots 
 the hangover is strong 
 nothing happened this was not some damn romcom 
 : 'dso i 'm at the hospital browsing reddit cause i 'm bored when an <unk> nsfw picture pops up and a spark was lit 
 i tried to forget about it but that did n't really work 
 so then i just decided i would go 
 i stood up and walked to the bathroom at the end of the hallway <unk> i am taped to a <unk> heart monitor that sends my pulse right to the nurses room 
 well i 'm in the bathroom coming as a nurse starts banging on the door and kinda <unk> calling my name 
 i in the middle of my climax answers in a really weak voice yea i 'm here '' then there are a couple seconds of quiet until she finally asks <unk> <unk> is that you '' 
 and i respond 
 i walk out of the bathroom to meet a very annoyed nurse looking at me with a grin and tells me i told you to keep your pulse down '' and than walks away 
 and i leave standing there with a face red as a tomato in shame 
 tl dr : jerked off in a hospital bathroom and a nurse got angry 
 edit : <unk> happened a few years ago but when you really think about it what is time 
 anyway i had just handed in a big assignment for my teacher training degree it was a friday so i went out and had a nice time 
 the next day i hung out with friends and i was in a <unk> mood 
 i had a small class workshop to give on the monday but i was getting the hang of this teaching lark and i wanted to let my hair down for a change 
 my friends decided to take some lsd that night and having done other drugs before i thought it would make me feel a bit funny have a giggle with my mates go to sleep and that 'd be that 
 i took some it turned out to be a lot 
 we were sitting around watching music videos and i remember as we were watching slow by <unk> minogue her eyes started to <unk> with different colours and i started laughing at how beautiful she was 
 we then just hung out the space of the room became gigantic lying down made my sense of gravity make me feel like i was on a rollercoaster 
 listening to people talk made your mind <unk> in their sentence their words altering your whole perception 
 also when i crossed my legs they felt like they were <unk> like that bit in the mask suddenly it 's 4am everyone had gone to sleep and all had become dark in more ways than one 
 i thought i could hear my friend crying and that the trees outside were hands clawing at the window 
 the core of my intelligence knew that this was all imaginary and took a detached intrigued stance on the whole thing 
 emotionally though i was fucked and did n't get any sleep 
 the next day due to lack of sleep and my new role as a drug fiend my mind had completely gone and i was worrying it would n't heal quick enough for the lesson and this worry made it worse 
 it reached its <unk> when because my teeth had become numb my tongue felt like it was feeling around the inside of a skull which technically it was 
 then i realised in the end my body was just made of nerve and bone and my mind was an organ held inside a very <unk> box 
 good times 
 anyway i managed to get a bit of sleep despite spending most of the night in the fetal position <unk> whether my mind was broken and whether i might die 
 the next day i met all my coursemates at the school we were doing a class for 
 the minitrips were erratic and less intense but still very much there 
 suddenly i 'm standing in the classroom centre stage with my coursemates watching 
 the kids came <unk> in innocent curious complete 
 it was at this point that my intelligence core said to me you 're about to teach a class of kids and you 're on lsd '' in the same way that a horrified <unk> turned to <unk> and asked did you just bring a bomb into a hospital '' 
 i kept rubbing my numb face and staring at the carpet <unk> which made me feel nice 
 the lesson was <unk> that cardboard <unk> of different <unk> could hold different weights 
 i <unk> that the <unk> cardboard could hold the most weight which seemed to make some of the kids trip out as much as me 
 one of the kids asked whether a perfect <unk> would hold an infinite weight which made my heart rate spike because i was expecting my mind to <unk> under its own imagination and exhaustion 
 i kept losing track of how many kids there were i thought one of the kids had a copy of himself and images of hands clawing at the windows <unk> flashing up 
 i knew it was n't real and i just kept viewing myself from outside trying to act normally which was n't hard because as i discovered the previous day all i am is just an organ in a skull 
 i was absolutely petrified i was going to end up on the front page of a <unk> and/or in prison by the evening 
 a few of my coursemates thought i was acting a bit weird but i got through the rest of the day by saying i was ill and they were all thinking about their lessons too much to care that much thank christ 
 tl dr achieved learning <unk> despite hands clawing at the windows and kids copying themselves edit : thank you so much for the gold and all the lovely comments 
 rest assured there was never any risk to the kids please do n't forget that teachers always do an incredible job of <unk> etc 
 i 'd take a bullet for any one of my little buggers : quick background : i 've had <unk> issues for years and went the prescription route about six months ago 
 tried a thousand options all unsuccessfully and finally struck gold with ambien 
 i take <unk> pretty much every night - total <unk> 
 recently started dating a new guy 
 he 's great i 'm infatuated and i 'm doing everything in my power to not fuck it up 
 as most of you probably know the ambien walrus is very real 
 if you do n't go to bed within 20-30 minutes you 'll probably start seeing and doing weird shit 
 most nights i 'm asleep in minutes but i 've never had insane <unk> or <unk> out and done something ridiculous 
 i 've watched pillows <unk> like lions picture frames morph into dragons and towels turn into the couple from american <unk> 
 the worst thing thus far was waking up to an order confirmation from amazon prime for 24 boxes of sugar-free <unk> 
 well that is until 3:30 am today 
 last night was our second adult sleepover 
 around 3 he 's sound asleep and starting to snore a little while i 'm lying there under his cuddle trap <unk> and wide awake 
 i 'd had a long week and the idea of a <unk> night is n't too appealing so i grab one from my purse swallow the fucker and crawl back into bed 
 we did n't have much to drink earlier and the ambien walrus rarely hangs out with me so i was n't worried about anything 
 about 15 minutes later the bf wakes up and starts <unk> sex and i 'm very down 
 he 's hot sex is fun and let 's just say 2015 was the most <unk> year of my adult life 
 everything 's going great - a little making out a little foreplay the p goes in the v everyone 's happy 
 important to note : we are n't doing anything remotely freaky 
 very enjoyable but very vanilla 
 at this point it 's right around the 30 minute mark and just in time the walrus pulls a michael jordan and comes out of <unk> 
 the bf 's been on top for a few minutes when i suddenly <unk> a little 
 out of nowhere i scream oh my god stop 
 ca n't we just have sex normally '' 
 he pulls off and says i 'm sorry of course ... but what do you mean 
 did i do something wrong '' 
 i was 100 % convinced that we were having sex on stage at the democratic national convention while hillary clinton was delivering a speech 
 i thought his bed was next to the podium and hil was narrating our every move and explaining how real sex aka not porn sex works as part of some sex ed thing 
 he 's howling laughing can barely breathe rolls off of me and tells me that sure we can leave we 'll just go to sleep and have some normal sex later 
 i wake up at <unk> and as a huge fan of morning <unk> i 'm all over him 
 right as he 's about to stick his dick in me he smirks and goes oh i 'm sorry is this normal enough for you '' 
 i do n't have a fucking clue what he 's talking about 
 he starts cracking up and explains the entire thing which i had zero recollection of though it 's been coming back to me today 
 i do n't think i 've ever been more embarrassed or turned a brighter shade of red in my life 
 the bad news is i do n't think i can take ambien again 
 ever 
 i want to flush my remaining supply down the toilet and tell my doctor to cancel my <unk> and get me on something new 
 the good news is this guy must be quite fond of me because i 'm pretty sure yelling that you do n't want to fuck on stage at the democratic national convention would be a <unk> for most people 
 <unk> oh and i 'm not even a <unk> 
 and i really do n't like hillary clinton 
 & amp nbsp tl dr i yelled at my brand new boyfriend to stop fucking me because i thought we were on stage with hillary clinton 
 *edit : * <unk> does n't work <unk> does n't work not actually going to flush my pills and thank you for the gold still quite fresh happened yesterday night but has been taking place for the past year 
 short <unk> backstory at that time i was a 27 y/o bi guy dating this girl for about a year she lived with her dad at the time so whenever i would go over her dad and i would shoot the shit watch sports play videogames and we became decently good friends 
 turns out while we were dating she was cheating on me so during our break '' her dad texts me and sees if i was alright and if i wanted to go for a drink 
 she still lives with him so we went to a bar nearby and continued being friends like she did n't exist 
 we knock back a few too many stumble back to his home drinking and driving is bad kids 
 and i drop him on his bed and end up passing out myself 
 wake up after a few hours to find myself being spooned up to him panic wake him up in the process 
 embarrassing silence follows and then he leans over and kisses me 
 turns out i 'm not the only bisexual in the room and we end up doing the nasty 
 fast forward 2 months he and i are still seeing each other his daughter and i are not but no one knows about him and i. his daughter moved in with her new bf and he invited me over since she was gone 
 we were just hanging out and playing games i go to get a another beer for us come back to find him down on one knee with a ring 
 fate has it his daughter forgot something and opens the door right at the moment with new bf in tow 
 shit hits the fan she starts screaming obscenities he <unk> and tries to calm things down and i walked over pick up the ring and put it on 
 hell <unk> no fury like that of a woman whose dad i 'm now engaged to 
 she starts screaming even more her bf decides punching me is the best option and thankfully my days in judo have n't completely been forgotten 
 i throw him out of house dad tells daughter to get out and slams door in her face 
 she runs off and tells the whole world on fb calls his family and mine 
 his family is pissed at him my very indian family is livid with me and right now i just hope she gets hit by a goddamn <unk> 
 tl dr- dated a girl befriended father broke up with cheating girl slept with her father now engaged to him shit hits the fan and neither family is happy 
 edit : ok this <unk> my first reddit post ever did not expect the crazy amount of responses 
 here i 'm thinking it 'll get lost in the swell that is the internet 
 thank you for the <unk> else this was just me venting and it 's become wayyyyyy more than that now 
 also i have no fucking clue what reddit gold is but thank you to the kind soul who <unk> that 
 please do n't give me more i do n't know what to do with it : / q & amp a to answer some of the questions posted or just clear some stuff up 
 - he 's <unk> i 'm 29 she 's 24. he had her when he was 18 
 - he 's divorced so he 's not cheating on anyone i would n't allow that given that 's what happened to me 
 - i did not put on the ring out of spite i was going to say yes anyway with or without her barging in 
 - he 's canadian italian and i 'm the <unk> kind of indian 
 - he 's not overly thrilled with me venting on here so i wo n't be posting <unk> anytime soon 
 maybe once things and he calm down 
 edit2 : holiday season was bonkers busy so did n't get a chance to update 
 we have decided to move in together my place not his old place 
 my extended family cousins et al are talking to me again the younger ones could n't give a fuck about my sexuality the older ones are <unk> around it 
 my parents are ... my parents they are concerned blah blah blah they do n't understand but <unk> 's daughter is <unk> pretty and a doctor but they realize they ca n't <unk> and puff and expect me to go running back to their side 
 his family typical italian do n't get it or do n't want to 
 except for one brother and one sister he 's essentially cut off and it crushes me but he said they 'll come around and i certainly hope so 
 also for the people hung up on the judo thing judo has very little to do with punching and kicking and is mostly <unk> throwing and submissions 
 i used to be a purple belt <unk> junior rank before i <unk> to canada he 's also severely against his picture being online so no pic but once i get him a ring we 'll put up a pic of the rings 
 this happened around christmas 
 a gay couple i am friends with invited me to their house party 
 i am a straight <unk> they are middle aged 
 they had also invited about 2 dozen other gay men from around town 
 i did n't know anyone else there 
 after i arrived i tried to mingle with the other guests 
 one was about to tell a raunchy story but acknowledged that he did n't know me 
 before i start are you family '' 
 not knowing what this meant i thought he was asking if i would be offended by gay stories 
 yeah i 'm family go right ahead '' 
 i replied 
 his eyes grew wide 
 i was now the young new guy at the party and everyone wanted to get to know me 
 all night long everyone was over the top nice to me and <unk> i thought they were just being <unk> to the <unk> in their midst 
 until at the end of the night one of them started hitting on me 
 when we realized my mistake we all had a laugh but i had about 20 new facebook friend requests the next morning 
 what 's more because i had just ended things with my live in girlfriend the week before my host friends had thought i was coming out too and were planning on making a celebratory announcement until it was stopped at the last minute 
 embarrassing mistake but i will have a funny story out of it at least there 's an extension that converts any appearance of cloud '' on a webpage to butt '' 
 i work in web development and as such am exposed to a lot of marketing copy about how to use the cloud to <unk> your business vertical and the like 
 i installed this extension on chrome on my home computer not my work computer but did n't realize that chrome will <unk> your <unk> across all logged in <unk> 
 so one day at work i 'm asked to take a look at a bug in a weather forecast script in the sidebar of a news website that my company manages 
 i open up the script which is <unk> only <unk> <unk> through the <unk> fix the bug and get back to my other projects 
 the next day the newspaper editor stops by and asks me to take a look at the weather forecast cause it 's acting strange '' 
 long story short approximately <unk> area residents were informed that the weather in their county today would be <unk> with light rain in the evening 
 this actually took place over the course of a few months 
 we drive to see my girlfriend 's grandmother a lot on weekends 
 the grandmother lives in a different state and it gives the girlfriend and i a lot of time in the car together 
 being a pretty boring drive we usually help time go by by having karaoke parties playing the <unk> game race from <unk> finding words that start with the next letter on signs or arguing about <unk> in serial 
 being such a long drive about 6.5 hours one way we of course hold hands occasionally 
 cute boring stuff 
 well usually we 'll say i love you '' as we hold hands and i got it in my head on one trip that i 'd mess with her 
 it started with me putting my hand on her knee giving it a light squeeze and saying i love you '' 
 she 'd respond <unk> and we 'd continue 
 i 'd do this a couple times each way 
 then i began to do it when we 're on the couch watching something or just in general sitting next to one another 
 not too often but enough to form a habit 
 then i started to just squeeze her leg 
 my plan worked perfectly 
 without realizing it she 'd look at me flash that great beam of a smile and tell me she loves me 
 for a few weeks i enjoyed a game that only i knew we were playing chuckling to myself in satisfaction 
 finally i could n't take it anymore 
 it was just too good 
 i had to tell her 
 this was a mistake 
 she could n't believe she did n't notice it for so long and wonders what else i 'm doing to mess with her 
 now when i squeeze instead of saying she loves me i get scowl and an eye roll 
 but eventually she does still say it 
 tl dr : my lovely <unk> <unk> loved my touch and all was swell until i did sing now when the bell rings all i hear is go to hell '' edit : since so many have asked <unk> is not in fact the <unk> actually <unk> this morning 
 one of my classes is a black and white photography class 
 we were assigned to take a roll of film worth of pictures 
 photo assignments are <unk> heavily so i wanted to take awesome photos 
 anyways i was taking a picture of a friend and this dude purposely walks in front of my camera and <unk> my picture 
 he snickers and walks off 
 i am pissed because it is not like i can just delete the photo 
 so i yelled my favorite insult you are a rude waffle 
 a crusty pancake with square holes '' 
 he turned around and looked me in the eyes and <unk> with this is why nobody <unk> loves you '' 
 he walks off again and i just stand in shock 
 i knew this kid 
 he would follow me around sometimes and be really creepy 
 i turned around to finish taking a picture and one of my teachers comes up and starts ranting 
 do n't use that language 
 it is improper for a lady '' 
 i looked at her confused 
 i just called him a waffle 
 he is the one that <unk> at me '' 
 well two wrongs do n't make a right 
 i 'm disappointed '' he walked in front of my camera and ruined a picture for photography 
 i am getting graded on it '' 
 he has a hard life 
 you do n't know what he has been through okay '' 
 i know he went through my fucking picture 
 i have a hard life to but i 'm not an asshole '' 
 she got really mad and sent me to the dean 
 i had to explain to my mom why i called a kid a crusty pancake 
 i have to write an apology note 
 my dad finds this hilarious though and we are making waffles for dinner 
 **tl dr : called a kid a waffle 
 got grilled for it** **edit : ** omg i logged on and my inbox was filled and i got happy over internet points 
 thank you guys 
 to clear things up i am a senior in high school but do advanced college classes in school 
 **edit 2 : ** so i have the picture of him walking across 
 i just have to develop it and enlarge it but i will try to post it in a few days 
 **edit 3 : ** for everyone saying that waffle is dumb or i am just being random '' the original insult is twat waffle but i enjoy the word rude 
 i also hate waffles so i added the crusty pancake part 
 i did n't want to be too insulting because i was upset but not angry 
 i just came out with a <unk> confusing immature insult 
 **edit 4 : ** hey guys 
 sad news the picture does n't show him at all 
 just a mostly dark picture 
 sorry : so i recently got the samsung galaxy <unk> 
 all in all i 've been pretty happy with it 
 anyway i 'm home from college for winter break 
 being the bum that i am i wake up today around noon shower eat and decide it 's nap time 
 hey i 'm an adult 
 i do what i want 
 i get back into bed tuck myself into a taco and turn on a meditation soundtrack 
 now i do n't typically use these but i figured why not 
 i find one with a male voice speaking in a slightly seductive soothing english accent 
 okay i can work with this 
 and i have to say this soundtrack had me passed out within minutes 
 <unk> i get an email notification vibrating my bed and blinding me with the bright screen 
 i reached out in a daze clicked the power button a few times in quick <unk> and <unk> myself in the blankets 
 not a minute later my phone rings 
 ugh i grab my phone and before i can speak i hear my frantic father yelling heydandelion heydandelion '' 
 but since i live in the middle of <unk> the call fails 
 a little weirded out by his tone i look at my notifications and realize i had unwittingly sent out an i need help '' sos text of my gps location a dark picture of my room and a voice recording to my emergency contacts a galaxy feature apparently triggered by pressing the power button three times 
 i quickly jump out of bed and grab the house phone while frantically trying to send out a group message to my mom dad and boyfriend that it was a mistake i 'm sorry i 'm not dying '' 
 three phone calls to three panicked individuals later all is well 
 except perhaps my mother 's pants because she has <unk> and probably shit herself 
 chuckling to myself a while later i check over the messages and decide to listen to the audio recording thinking hey maybe i snore or something 
 instead the only thing audible from the five second recording is a english male 's voice 
 i want you to be as comfortable as possible both physically and mentally '' 
 tl dr : tried to get a seductive voice to <unk> me to sleep <unk> sent out sos to emergency contacts made everyone think i was kidnapped by a creepy old english man 
 update : holy crap this exploded <unk> <unk> 
 since a lot of you requested it and the amount of references to <unk> made me angry who lies on the internet goddammit here 's the audio recording 
 i also included the two pictures sent along with a screenshot of my convo after with my mom 
 she thought the <unk> was being devious 
 * <unk> * imgur this actually did happen today 
 i was merrily browsing tifu before work when i came across this little <unk> : well i learned what a grower not a shower '' is 
 turns out it is not someone who gets taller but goes <unk> or basically people do n't notice that he has gotten taller 
 i 've been calling my little brother a 7 year old one for years 
 before you ask i did get strange looks and embarrassed my parents on multiple occasions but i never really understood why 
 i have said this in front of many people including many of my relatives and my parents friends 
 none of them told me what it meant 
 tl dr <unk> my brother 's penis to my friends and <unk> son is at that age where he spends a lot of time in the bathroom with the door locked 
 my daughter has made some remarks about it and i felt it was time that i addressed it 
 here 's how it went down : i told my son to go have a shower before bed and as per usual he said he had to use the toilet first 
 he locked himself in the loo and was in there for 45 mins 
 in that time i had a shower this is important later and as he came out the bathroom i said 'hey kids i want to talk to you both 
 i just want to tell you that it 's normal and natural to masturbate 
 it 's nothing to be embarrassed about because you should be comfortable with yourself and your body 
 at this point my daughter burst out laughing and asked why i 'm doing this now 
 i asked her what she meant and she said that her brother has been in the loo for 45 minutes so clearly i am talking about him 
 my son was standing there blushing and i did n't want him to be embarrassed so i had to think of something quick and went with : well you see while i was in the shower i caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and thought 'i would totally do me and i just thought i would share that with you both because it 's ok and totally normal 
 i walked away because we were all to embarrassed to be in the same room at that point.this just happened 
 well my boyfriend and i are in college and both lead very busy lives 
 it 's finals time which means we have hardly seen each other which also means there 's a lot of pent up sexual tension 
 unfortunately i have also had a really bad cold for the past few days so our little time spend together has been <unk> even more 
 today was the first day that i was feeling 100 % so i decided it 'd be great to meet him at the library for some late night kisses 
 he 's still a little concerned about my disease <unk> body so he said he could walk me to my car and hug me goodnight before getting back to studying 
 he 's an engineer student and taking very involved courses so i knew he was really worried about his tests 
 however i really wanted to get intimate and i knew that this would be our one chance for another few days we have finals up until next wednesday 
 i told him that he could hug me goodbye or he could give me 10 minutes and i could make him cum 
 now that would be a personal record of ours he usually lasts a lot longer 
 he being horny as well agrees and says that he 'd love to see me try to get him off so quickly 
 we park in a parking garage next to the library and i give him the best blow job i 've ever given and he cums right at the 9 minute marker 
 now remember he has n't had this sort of release in a while so there 's quite a bit of semen in my throat all of a sudden 
 also my one remaining <unk> of the cold is a lingering buildup of mucus which i keep having to cough out 
 we hug talk all <unk> <unk> pull his shorts back on and i let him return to the library to his beloved books 
 as soon as i pull out of the garage i feel a nice lump of mucus in my throat and know i have to spit 
 the only thing i have with me is a napkin from some fast food a few days ago but desperate times call for desperate measures 
 i spit into the napkin thinking only the little green lump would actually appear but i was very wrong 
 cum <unk> out of my mouth and drops all over my black jacket and <unk> 
 i look through my windshield and there 's a group of freshmen girls staring at me 
 from their point of view i 'll be remembered as a sweaty girl drooling cum next to a soaked napkin in a library parking garage 
 tldr : swallowed when i should 've spit and spit when i should 've swallowed 
 edit : spelling edit 2 : woah gold 
 i told my boyfriend and he sleepily laughed and then looked grossed out 
 : thank you all for your wonderful comments they 've made my study breaks awesome 
 we are staying with my mom for easter 
 when i got up this morning everyone was still asleep so i was on my own for breakfast 
 i <unk> through mom 's fridge and found some left over <unk> in a zip lock bag some garlic mashed taters in a plastic tub and a metal bowl of peas 
 i dumped everything into the taters and mixed it up and <unk> it 
 then i dumped the concoction into the metal bowl and added some <unk> 
 not your typical breakfast but i thought it was good 
 a while later my parents came downstairs 
 i was still sitting at the kitchen table reading the paper with the empty bowl next to me 
 my step dad picked up the bowl 
 why is the dog 's bowl on the table '' 
 that 's not the dog 's bowl '' i said 
 it was in the fridge full of peas '' 
 my step dad said yeah that is the dog 's bowl '' 
 then mom explained that she gave their pit bull a hearty serving of left over beef stew last night to make room in the fridge for the stuff she was making for easter dinner 
 after he finished eating she noticed that he had n't eaten the peas 
 there was just a <unk> of clean peas at the bottom of the bowl '' mom explained laughing 
 she 'd found it amusing and put the bowl on the counter to show my step dad but she 'd forgotten about it and then my sister came through cleaning up the kitchen and put the bowl in the fridge 
 so i might as well have french kissed a dog 
 tonight my girlfriend broke up with me while i was sitting in an internet cafe playing some games with some friends 
 i get a text from her and i’m pretty happy 
 it’s been long distance the past two months and she hasn’t been great at replying to messages 
 so i was chuffed until i read the message 
 needless to say the news was not good and i bailed on my friends cause “i was suddenly feeling <unk> by the time i hit the stairs to leave the cafe i can feel that i’m gon na start crying if i stop moving 
 me 
 cry in public 
 a 23 year old man who already struggles with the idea of being <unk> 
 a man boy lets be honest who kept growing a beard because one person one time said it made him look a little older 
 fuck that 
 i will <unk> some sort of <unk> during this disaster potentially ... hopefully 
 against all the odds i make it to the bus stop without crying 
 but the bus isn’t coming for ages 
 i 'm pacing up and down checking and re checking my phone 
 re reading the msg getting depressed all over again 
 the bus shows up and i’m on board in a second 
 but i don’t sit down i 'm fucking stalking the aisle back and fourth 
 keep moving 
 keep fucking moving 
 i’m fucking daring the bus driver to tell me to sit down 
 he does so <unk> mate you can you sit down ” you want me to sit down 
 you want me to fucking sit down 
 i say in my head 
 in the real word i’m already sitting 
 i don’t want to piss off the bus driver 
 he didn’t break up with me 
 keep moving 
 i’m <unk> in my seat legs fucking jack <unk> pounding the floor 
 trying to speed up the bus fred <unk> style 
 i know exactly what i’m gon na do when i get home 
 change into shorts chuck my running shoes on and sprint down to the harbour and scream out over the water 
 oh yeah just like a fucking movie 
 scream at the ocean like the actor you tell yourself you will eventually be 
 <unk> why the fuck am i not <unk> enough to <unk> for anything shut the fuck up self <unk> nature 
 we telling a story 
 back on track 
 bus is about to reach my stop but i’m up already 
 everyone else on the bus looks pretty fucking happy i’m going 
 oh i’m sorry i wasn’t the ideal co passenger you <unk> 
 i’m dealing with some shit so you’ll have to forgive me 
 fly out the door in an instant and im running up the hill to my house 
 punch the back gate with my face 
 fucking shit 
 gate just got replaced way harder to open opened it into my face brush it off 
 i’m fine physically i’m fine emotionally i’m a mess duh back door code gets punched in at lighting speed 
 i’m up the stairs 
 jeans off 
 runners on 
 god dammit man put ya shorts on first then your runners 
 runners off 
 shorts on 
 runners on again 
 nailed it 
 i’m down the stairs grab a quick mouthful of water reach the back door and it fucking hits me 
 i need to shit 
 like really need to shit 
 i pause at the door think about risking it 
 i do not risk it 
 as i’m running back up stairs to the bathroom i nearly shit myself on the 4th step 
 i was right not to risk it 
 bathroom door flies open i fly onto the seat and thankfully don’t shit on myself 
 but i’m not moving 
 i can’t move much at all 
 i’m stuck until the shitting ends and i know i won’t make it 
 i start crying 
 like really fucking crying 
 i have never cried like this before 
 all the while this torrent of tears was coupled with what i can only describe as some of the most explosive shitting i have ever produced 
 probably would have been one of the funniest things i’ve ever done and if i wasn’t sobbing like the world was ending i probably would of laughed 
 but there i was for 10 minutes shitting an <unk> and crying a <unk> 
 but as all things do it ended much like my relationship 
 oh snap 
 too soon 
 of course it’s too soon you’re an emotional wreck 
 only through laughter can i grow hahaha my heart is a black abyss ... i wipe 
 pants up 
 tears dried 
 i rush back downstairs grab my earphones chuck on some heavy metal so fucking hardcore and start sprinting towards the ocean 
 it should be noted that this run to the ocean would be <unk> by a fit person 
 i am not a fit person 
 even a fit person would struggle to sprint the whole way and yet sprint i did until i felt like my lungs were gon na fucking kill me 
 grief it seems does not increase your overall <unk> 
 by the time i make it to the water i am almost more of a physical wreck than an emotional one 
 but i will <unk> 
 i will scream my <unk> out over the water like some crazy method actor 
 i drag myself up to the edge of the harbor and open my mouth to scream 
 only i don’t scream 
 i instead proceed to projectile vomit into the fucking harbor 
 it’s <unk> it burns it <unk> the tears again and it just keeps going 
 are you fucking kidding me body 
 it was one tiny sprint 
 i vomit up the past months food 
 i’m shivering at this stage 
 cause it’s winter 
 it’s <unk> and i’m in shorts next to the ocean 
 y em i so smart 
 i drag myself to a bench and just sit there staring at the water until my throat stops burning 
 then i just walk home 
 stepped in dog shit on the way back because you know have to keep the misery as high as possible 
 and now i’m here sobbing silently onto my keyboard 
 tldr : girlfriend broke up with me via text 
 tried to <unk> deal with the sadness by planning to run to the ocean and scream out at the water 
 ended up sobbing and shitting at the same time on the toilet for ten minutes 
 then tried to run to the ocean but i wasn’t fit enough and i projectile vomited into the ocean when i got there 
 numerous other bad things also happened read above 
 edit : thank you all for the gold 
 i 've never really posted before and usually i 'm very precious about my writing 
 thank you all for the support 
 i have work most of the day but i 'll try to write back to some of the comments when i get home 
 thanks all 
 this happened yesterday as most stories on this subreddit 
 so we had a bomb threat all over <unk> schools yesterday we had to be <unk> and everything 
 police search dogs bomb squad fbi 
 the whole 9 yards 
 so me and my friend were walking home when we were released from the school and we got stopped by some reporter 
 my boston accent shines through at the worse times and the italian in me makes me <unk> kind of fast 
 so when the reporter asked on live tv if anyone would do something like this i responded no one in this school has the fucking balls to do it '' the reporter dropped his mic and the camera guy turned away 
 tifu by swearing on live tv 
 this happened in west virginia last october 
 i was with a group of seven camping in west <unk> for a week and exploring vertical caves 
 we 'd set up <unk> <unk> on the top and dropped down into some pretty deep caves and then explore further from there 
 my fuck up came on the second to last day 
 we had a pretty big caving network we were excited to go into it started with a 50 ft drop into the pit and from there a pretty extensive tunnel system down into the cavern 
 i opted to led the group through the tunnels as i had the map and enjoyed being in front 
 there was about 45 minutes of tunnels and squeezes to get to the cavern some of the stretches of tunnels were about the size of a microwave 
 definitely some tight areas and at times slow to crawl through 
 during the crawl i was began to feel a little <unk> i had eaten sour cream in the morning that had felt a bit off but i did n't think too much of it 
 the further down we <unk> the worse my stomach felt 
 when we finally reached the cavern some 300 feet below the surface i was beginning to sweat and feel seriously wrong 
 it was then i realized i needed to make my way back up to the surface before the worst could happen 
 i told the group i was n't feeling well and was going to head back up 
 i started crawling back through the tunnel when i heard them make the decision to follow me and come back up as well.. great 
 crawling back up through the tunnel i began to feel worse and worse my face became pale and my forehead was sweating profusely 
 the tunnel felt even tighter and <unk> than before 
 i stopped midway and began to clench hard it was all i could do to keep the fluid in 
 i knew at that point i was in a bad spot the only place to go was to keep crawling forward but i could hardly move because i was clenching so hard 
 i stayed for about 10 minutes in this tight tunnel breathing heavily and clenching so hard i began to cramp in my abdomen 
 something ugly was about to come out and come out fast 
 by a miracle i was about to shuffle and crawl my way out of the long tunnel but only into the pit 
 once up there i knew i could hold back nature no longer and unfortunately for my team behind i was forced to let it all out as my <unk> crawled silently out of the hole one by one 
 it was the most embarrassing and memorable moment of my caving experience 
 tl dr i had explosive diarrhea while crawling through a 45 minute tunnel system with my 7 person team behind me 200 feet underground 
 this actually happened about an hour ago so it really is <unk> i fucked up 
 in life there are many things which perhaps cross our minds but which we decide not to explore perhaps because of social pressure or perhaps just because we do n't go down that <unk> 
 one of the things which i 'd always been interested in was shaving my ... nether regions 
 now i appreciate it 's not the weekend and so i <unk> n't go into any detail but after 20 minutes of careful <unk> and a sharp razor i was smooth and comfortable 
 the sense of freedom was <unk> and it felt <unk> 
 where 's the fuck-up 
 i hear you cry 
 well i woke up today i started to feel a little uncomfortable just a slight itchy <unk> 
 you know what it 's like if you 've gone to the barber and you have hair stuck in your collar 
 it was kinda like that but no matter i thought i 'll just put some moisturiser on 
 when i 've shaved my beard before i 'd used it to reduce <unk> with great success 
 so quickly i squirted some stuff into my hands and <unk> applied it 
 the cooling feeling was great 
 however within about 5 seconds this cool <unk> was replaced with a warming sensation and then a *really* warm feeling and the temperature kept rising and rising until it was <unk> painful 
 like oh my god my balls are literally on fire and everything is burning '' 
 it was as if someone had thrown a scotch <unk> <unk> into a <unk> mixed it with <unk> and applied this <unk> to my sausage and eggs 
 it was only at this point that i looked at what i 'd squirted in my hand 
 i could see the bottle of moisturiser on my shelf and next to it a bottle of deep heat '' cramp relief 
 i 'd been suffering from leg cramps after a run yesterday and had left it out and in my haste did n't check which bottle i 'd used 
 i am still in pain 
 **tl dr : ** i tried to make myself to look hot for my lady ended up too hot and fried my eggs 
 edit : a lot of you guys seem to doubt this happens saying that it 's an <unk> legend - but even more of you have messaged me <unk> sympathy - it goes to show that really a lot of us fuck up in the same ways 
 thank you to those of you who suggested remedies - i 'm much cooler now and i feel better 
 finally though to whichever poor sod gilded me <unk> 
 so i should preface this by saying that i am a 17 year old male and i recently went to the doctor for a physical 
 this practice is located in a converted house that 's a little bit older and very small 
 they started off the process by having me produce a urine sample 
 they handed me a cup and pointed me to the bathroom 
 it was n't until i had already filled the cup that i realized there was no lid 
 weird maybe but i ca n't remember if they had given me a lid last time or not so i ignored it 
 i walked over to the door and threw it open forgetting how light the door was and how hard as quickly it opened 
 i managed to knock a young kid maybe 4-6 years old that was standing right in front of the door onto his ass and before i could do anything about it had already spilled my cup of urine all over his head and body 
 i was horrified and the kid began to scream along with his mother and several other people in the waiting room 
 she gave me a death glare the doctors rushed out to see what had happened and everybody turned to me 
 the rest of that <unk> was very awkward and now i likely need to find a new doctor 
 so that was fun 
 today my gf and i went to go get our nails done together as good lesbians do 
 i was really excited for the massage chairs and unbeknownst to be they were a little more intense then the ones i am used to 
 when i sat down the woman to the left of me commented on how the chair was massaging her ass and she seemed uncomfortable 
 i figured she was overreacting ... that is until the woman who was going to give me a pedicure turned on my chair 
 the woman to my left was right it was a butt massage but as i was sitting straight up with my butt in the back of the chair it hit a different spot 
 i <unk> and my girlfriend gave me a look to shut up and there were about 20 other women in the place so i did n't want to make a scene 
 i was like a deer in the headlights frozen and unable to move crippled with the anxiety of anyone finding out i was getting a <unk> magic wand straight to my <unk> 
 needless to say i came more than once and almost kicked the woman giving me a pedicure in the face 
 the chick to my left definitely knew and gave me <unk> as she walked out 
 tl dr : show me on the <unk> where the chair touched <unk> is currently asleep in my bed as i write this out 
 he was half asleep until i teased him to er full <unk> 
 i proceeded to blow him and when he came he was really far down my throat 
 i 'm not too sure what i did it was like i breathed in and out at the same time in an effort to catch my breath 
 well my body and probably god said fuck you slut '' and next thing i know his cum is spraying out my nose 
 as it was pitch black in my room fwb did n't notice anything amiss 
 i stayed quiet 
 it still burns 
 edit : til - sticky <unk> angry steaming nasty puff the magic smoking flaming white dragon 
 thanks reddit ok so i live in colorado and have separate gas and electric companies and typically this time of year your gas bill goes up and electric goes down 
 so money has been tight with the holiday 's coming up we have had to forgo some things we have wanted like everyone does this time of year 
 i pay the bills every friday 
 so today i go online to pay my gas bill and keep in mind the last few months i have paid $ <unk> then $ <unk> then $ <unk> last month which seems oddly high but it was minus 11 at one point so i <unk> it up to that 
 today i check it and its $ <unk> and i lose it i 'm <unk> all over the place i call customer service and i am ready to fight 
 listen my bill is to high i have no idea why it would be that much '' 
 so the lady on the other end calmly says well sir back in august you over paid by about <unk> dollars and a credit went onto your account see that <unk> on your account '' 
 yes ... '' i say <unk> starting to realize what 's going on 
 she says well ... you have been paying the credit balance the past 3 months and that 596 is a credit on your account not a past due would you like us to send you a check for the 596 '' 
 i of course say yes and needless to say i am an idiot but we wont be completely broke this christmas 
 tifu in a pretty decent way 
 i 've been cutting my own hair since the eighth grade 
 i like to keep it pretty short so rather than spending $ 15 every month for what is essentially a buzz cut i bought a pair of clippers and have been doing it myself ever since 
 while this is <unk> convenient and has probably saved me a couple thousand dollars over the last <unk> years it 's generally a pain to clean up 
 to combat this i 've developed a system where i stand / kneel over the thick plastic <unk> bib that came with the clippers the little cape they put on you at the salon letting the hair fall and gather on that and carefully emptying it into the trash when i 'm done 
 which brings us to yesterday 
 i had a ceremony to attend and wanted to look fresh – and due to a recent move i did n't have access to my normal bib <unk> system 
 so i laid a towel on the ground to catch all the hair fired up the clippers and went about my business 
 as i finished my haircut i decided to trim my beard as well 
 * got ta look nice and groomed for the night 
 and hey my chest hair is looking a little out of control too let 's give that a trim 
 and while i 'm at it let 's just do the whole deal 
 * i grabbed my pube trimmer i have a separate pube trimmer i 'm not an animal and do a real nice thorough <unk> 
 shaft balls gooch ass inner thighs back 
 by the end i 'm feeling 5 pounds lighter 
 the mass of body hair that has <unk> on the towel resembles a <unk> <unk> 
 at this point i realize i 'm a bit behind schedule so i quickly <unk> the towel up taking care not to leave any <unk> for the hair to spill out put the hair-towel in the cupboard beneath the sink and hop in the shower 
 fast forward to this morning when i 'm awoken by the ungodly <unk> of my girlfriend in the bathroom 
 i jolt out of bed and open the door revealing my lovely girlfriend looking like the little monkey boy from <unk> 
 <unk> used the hair-towel 
 ** my nasty body hair clippings are <unk> to her wet skin from her forehead to her knees 
 my pubes <unk> themselves to her <unk> lips my ass hair <unk> on her tits 
 she screams what the fuck '' and all i can do is laugh 
 she 's spitting hairs out of her mouth and turns the water back on to try and rinse the hair off but its those stubborn <unk> hairs that only seem to stay put in the shower 
 she has to be at work in 30 minutes and still looks like <unk> after the <unk> potion 
 tl dr : i 'll never forget the look of horror disgust and desperation on her cute little gorilla <unk> and after pics obligatory this happened last year 
 my brothers and i decided to get a tattoo in memory of our late grandfather 
 he was a great man and an even better businessman 
 his most memorable venture was his bow tie company so we all picked one <unk> out of his private collection to get done 
 i had work the morning of the <unk> so both of my brothers went first 
 this is where i fucked up work was busy that day and i had n't gotten to eat anything 
 in order to calm my <unk> i thought it would be a good idea to smoke a little joint on the way over 
 everything started alright until i felt a little <unk> the tattoo artist went to <unk> me some candy and when he returned i had passed out and fallen on the floor face first 
 well that was n't the worst of it 
 after <unk> i walked outside for some fresh air and noticed that there was something extra in my pants yup you guest it i shit my pants after i passed out 
 frantically rush to the bathroom and rip my underwear off throw them away and used up everything they had to clean myself ... it took me a hole year to come back and finish the tattoo and i even included a little number 2 to show that it took twice to get my first ever tattoo tl dr do n't smoke weed before getting a tattoo for the first time 
 also make sure you eat something or you will pass out and shit your <unk> posted this in another sub two days ago but i figured that i could post it here as well 
 i was dating this girl when we decided it would be nice and fun to do a <unk> together ... sooo this night we set up our plan to bath together at her place because i do n't have a bathtub 
 we already had sex some weeks prior but i did n't want her to see my flaccid dick 
 yes i 'm a grower not a shower 
 and for some stupid reason i just did n't want her to know how my not erect dick looked 
 while the water was cooling down and we were waiting for it to reach a <unk> temperature she went downstairs to get some wine 
 this was my chance to strip naked get in the tub as fast as i could and hide my dick under the shampoo bubbles we just put in 
 i did n't feel the water first there was no time for that so i jumped in there like an <unk> <unk> 
 the water did n't cool down at all ... it was still fucking hot 
 i mean this water was practically boiling 
 <unk> could 've <unk> that ring in there 
 the heat almost got me <unk> i started screaming like a lobster which got my date run up the stairs to see what was happening 
 there i was completely naked with my ass hovering above the water with my flaccid dick <unk> through the bubbles 
 tl dr - just show her your flaccid dick or you might burn it edit - i never could have thought that so many people would be talking about my dick today 
 thanks for all the do 's and don'ts will come in handy the next time ok so this just happened about a half hour ago 
 my wife and i are in the process of potty training our daughter and we have a tiny <unk> mouse toilet that has a bucket like <unk> that sits under the seat for catching all <unk> <unk> '' 
 i work late hours and last night after getting home i had me a couple adult <unk> before heading to bed 
 fast forward a few hours later i 'm woken up from my daughter screaming in her bed which usually means get me now or i 'm going potty all over my bed 
 so i go in and grab her and take her to do her business 
 i did n't turn the light on in the hopes i could put her back to bed for a bit longer 
 i set her on her seat and she starts to go 
 hearing your little spawn let their bladder go is one of the best sounds ever 
 you know that you do n't have to clean a big mess and that the tons of money for diapers are gone 
 i 'm sure anyone who potty trained their little one knows what i mean 
 anywho while she 's going my happiness turns to confusion as my foot is getting wet 
 when she is done we go through our high <unk> and i send her to get in bed with mommy 
 i turn the light on and instantly realize that her mom had not put the bucket thingy back into the potty after cleaning it so she had actually peed through the potty not in the potty 
 not only that she was now chilling in our bed with her mom asking why is her feet wet 
 i just wanted everyone to know that we have acquired a new seat so she can actually use the big person potty 
 my only worry now is that we do n't forget it 's not in there at some point and have her fall in 
 like almost all tifus this did not happen today but some time ago 
 for obvious reasons i am using a throw away and being vague about some details because anyone who reads this and is a chemist at the university i attended will know who i am 
 for some background i was a graduate student at a large <unk> university getting a <unk> in chemistry 
 as an organic chemist i frequently use compounds that require <unk> handling and an <unk> <unk> of attention 
 i was working in a lab that frequently used fairly <unk> things in that they reacted spontaneously and spectacularly with air or water <unk> 1 the problem with that is when you use dangerous things every day you get used to them and the danger goes away 
 you become <unk> 
 maybe you make <unk> about the what safety <unk> others are following 
 this is a horrible practice 
 one of the things i frequently used to clean certain types of glassware was concentrated nitric acid 
 you really need to be careful with nitric acid not only is it a very strong acid but also insanely good at <unk> things in addition to being a <unk> <unk> agent 
 this means that not only is it super <unk> and can eat through copper and other metals pretty quickly but that it also <unk> violently and often explosively with most organic chemicals to produce toxic gas + a nitrated <unk> 2 nitrated compounds make great explosives 
 as <unk> says <unk> of organic compounds with nitric acid is the primary method of synthesis of many common explosives such as <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 as very many less stable byproducts are possible these reactions must be carefully <unk> controlled and the byproducts removed to isolate the desired <unk> 3 i’m sure you can see where this is <unk> so here is where the chain of events that was my fuckup begins 
 i was cleaning some glassware with nitric acid which is a fairly common method to get very clean <unk> 4 the waste bottle that we use to dispose of nitric acid was full so i had to <unk> a new empty bottle to use as the nitric acid waste 
 typically we use an empty bottle of nitric acid as the waste container for used nitric acid 
 this way the nitric acid is going into a container that only ever held nitric acid <unk> no random organic chemicals left around in the bottle to react with the acid 
 there were no empty nitric bottle in lab so rather than go get a new one 4 floors down i grabbed a common use waste bottle 
 these are 4 liter glass bottles with a screw on <unk> 6 usually they are used to collect organic waste brought to a <unk> facility where they are emptied and then thoroughly cleaned 
 university protocol is that they are first cleaned with ethanol then water 
 the idea is that the only remnants in these bottles should be water 
 i happened to pick a bottle that had not been washed with water 
 knowing that nitric acid was dangerous i visually checked the bottle to make sure it was empty 
 there was a little bit of water or so i thought <unk> in the bottom which did not concern me because nitric acid and water are fine to <unk> i proceeded to clean my glass using a total of <unk> <unk> of nitric acid which i <unk> of in the waste container 
 knowing that nitric acid could react with organics i left the waste bottle <unk> in my fumehood for about 60 seconds after i put the nitric in 
 seeing no reaction i then capped the waste bottle loosely 
 this probably saved me a trip to the hospital 
 now the <unk> chemist reading this may have figured out what happened <unk> 9 nitric acid and ethanol remember this bottle was supposed to be washed with water but never was react very violently to produce heat and a large amount of gas 
 this reaction has an <unk> time of a few minutes before it really kicks in 
 so 20 or so seconds after capping this bottle i hear an ominous whistling sound 
 the kind of whistling you would rather not hear in a chemistry lab 
 i look at my <unk> hood and saw a very large and copious amount of brown gas <unk> billowing out from my loosely <unk> cap 
 as the whistling increased to a truly terrifying pitch i had a few seconds to dive behind a wall before the waste bottle exploded with a force much larger than that mortar from the front page <unk> 10 here i fucked up again as despite my 10 or so second lead time i did not warn anyone that a glass <unk> bomb was about to go off 
 i am so fucking lucky that no one decided to come around the corner at that moment 
 as the nitric acid <unk> glass <unk> down upon me my lab mates rushed to see what was wrong 
 i yelled for them to <unk> the lab as a billowing cloud of <unk> green gas a toxic mix of nitric acid <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the various other chemicals in my hood which were <unk> and <unk> was spewing forth from my fumehood 
 alarms were going off lights in the ceiling were blown out and haphazardly hanging from their sockets i 'm pretty sure an undergraduate was crying ... needless to say we exited the lab in admirable time 
 a few minutes later the chief safety officer arrived with gasmasks in tow 
 our lab replaces the air about every 2 minutes due to the <unk> and by design for instances just like this so after 5 minutes we deemed it safe enough to reenter with gasmasks on 
 the level of <unk> was actually <unk> 11 everything in my hood was destroyed 
 the window directly behind my fumehood was destroyed 
 that window was made out of <unk> inch thick safety glass 
 this explosion sent a <unk> or shards of glass flying hard enough to bust a hole clean through 1/4 inch thick safety glass ... had i been standing in front of this thing or had anyone else they would have been in the hospital with some very serious injuries 
 in doing some research i found out this is not a fairly uncommon <unk> accident and a simple google search of nitric acid + ethanol furnishes a number of safety reports on similar incidents 
 an investigation found out that two parties were at fault 
 the waste bottle should have never had ethanol left over in it 
 improper <unk> on eh & amp s was determined to be the major cause 
 me being a <unk> was determined to also be a cause 
 because of this a number of safety protocol with how waste bottles are handled were changed and incoming graduate students get to hear about what i did 
 <unk> i did not get in trouble because everyone handled themselves like adults 
 tldr : i might be the only person to use the excuse “i blew up my lab <unk> for why i was late to my first date <unk> my future <unk> and have it be a real excuse 
 <unk> she realized i was a keeper is now my fiance and we have a great first date story 
 the damage references : 1 
 2. nitric acid reaction with <unk> gloves 
 3 
 4 
 5 
 6 
 7. it should be noted that working in an organic lab all day removes your ability to smell ethanol and most other <unk> 
 8. have <unk> trust me 
 9 
 10 
 11 
 12. a similar explosion albeit in a smaller non glass bottle with less toxic things ingredients 
 edit : not safety glass should have fact checked that and <unk> it 
 also this did not happen at your university 
 waste bottle over <unk> is not an uncommon lab accident 
 i never thought it would happen to me reddit but today i fucked up by calling my interviewer gay 
 i 've been interviewing for a new position at work over the past several weeks 
 i have been really stressed but i had just finished the last interview and decided to unwind by playing <unk> in the break room with one of my colleagues 
 this is were my fuck up occurred 
 with my brain near mush and what little <unk> i had left focused on the game i made what has to be one of the most cringe-worthy statements of my entire life 
 enter one of my previous interviewers 
 he had interviewed me several weeks prior and was clearly gay 
 super nice guy just one of the nicest guys you 've ever met and clearly homosexual 
 in any event he walks into the break room looks right at me with a big smile and says yay <unk> did you hear the good news '' 
 and in my <unk> i found myself replying yeah the supreme court really came through this weekend '' 
 i have never seen a smile turn into a scowl as quickly as that moment but i tell you if i was timing it it may have been a world record 
 my interviewer then coldly says you got the job '' and walked out of the room 
 so now i 'm trying to find out where i can dig a <unk> to go live in for the rest of my life 
 thanks for reading : **update : ** well it 's rather anti-climactic but some of you are asking for an update 
 i passed him in the hall this morning and we exchanged pleasantries like normal 
 i chose to forgo the apology and just accept that i have the social skills of a <unk> 
 i did n't want to unintentionally offend further 
 however i had previously wrote him a nice letter for being so awesome and checking up constantly on my interview process so i guess i will be be giving that to him a little sooner than expected 
 thanks for the feedback everybody i work for a very large store chain and have been there for a year and 8 months 
 i was doing my taxes because i 'm saving up for a down payment for a new car and i 'm single and live with my mother 
 i did my <unk> taxes online and they <unk> to $ <unk> i owe the state $ 300 
 that should n't have happened 
 i check my paycheck to make sure i filed under single and no children '' 
 apparently i had 9 <unk> on my paycheck ... that is every 
 single 
 paycheck 
 since 
 i 've 
 worked 
 there 
 i 'll try and straighten this out on monday but until then i 'm putting the new car on hold 
 tl dr : a year and 8 months ago while starting my new job i put that i had 9 kids when i have none either i hit 9 instead of 0 or i have shitty handwriting 
 now i owe $ 1500 in taxes 
 p.s 
 fuck jenny ... edit : popped my front page cherry 
 thanks guys 
 now there 's blood all over the sheets 
 zach you fucking cunt ... edit <unk> <unk> : i spell it zach because fuck him 
 also <unk> is the man 
 he is friendly and <unk> 
 this was a little while ago but whatever 
 so i 've been dating this girl for a few months now and we 're just chilling at my place like we usually do 
 i load up the ol computer to put on a film for us and as per usual while booting steam loads up 
 so she looks at my library and decides she has n't played the sims for ages so instead of a film i 'm going to watch her chill out to some sim action 
 first alarm bell rang when she looked at the amount of time i 've spent on that game 
 143 hours in total 
 mostly this time is due to me leaving it on while i do other shit but really that 's just way too long to be playing the sims 
 she laughs at me for being a sad douche continue on to playing 
 second alarm bell when she loads up my only sim <unk> faggotson 
 that 's when i remembered everything i had been doing with that one sim for 143 hours 
 i had fucked every single person in the sim village to create as many children as possible a total of around <unk> children 
 the only reason i did n't have more was because there were literally no women left in the village that were n't either my daughter or elderly 
 not only that but i had figured out i could take dna samples from sims and clone them but they end up as babies and i have to raise them from birth 
 so i was basically factory farming as many dna <unk> children as i could so i could fuck them later to get more children in the most horrible controlled death camp kind of style 
 as soon as they were old enough to take care of their own needs they would never leave their cells 
 all of this she saw as she was exploring and my house was n't the only sex dungeon farming <unk> i had i owned several <unk> in the town that were <unk> full of these children i was going to fuck and create more children with 
 tl dr i created a horrible sim rape dungeon forgot about it and my girlfriend saw it 
 update : so a few people wanted to know her reaction it was a mix of belly laughter and creeped <unk> 
 she played the save for a while and even made a few sims pregnant for the hell of it but then she made me delete the save so no <unk> 
 the reason it 's a fuck up was that during sex she would sometimes go oh <unk> faggotson '' 
 or she 'd offer me some of her hair jokingly so i could clone her 
 any kind of problem we had could just be countered with yeah at least i do n't have a digital rape dungeon '' this didnt happen today happened about 2 weeks ago 
 i 'm a teenager living in <unk> i have brown skin because my family <unk> is indian so i do n't really look very <unk> instead i look different i 'm a pretty laid back individual who do n't care about racism or discrimination instead i find racist jokes quite funny 
 it was <unk> so for a bit of banter '' i decided to go into school pretending to be all depressed 
 a group of my mates asked me if i was alright i said no '' 
 they then proceeded to ask what was the matter 
 i told them that my uncle died 14 years today 
 they were all pretty shocked 
 one said are you alright '' 
 i told them not to worry becuase he took 2000 other people down with him 
 that is how i got suspended for a week 
 i 'm a dick 
 tldr : do n't be racist to yourself and make jokes about 911. edit : wow i 'm glad everyone liked my fuck up 
 last night i had 10 upvotes on this post i woke up and i have <unk> before this i had 50 comment karma xd edit2 : just checked my inbox rip edit3 : just came back from school 3000 up votes and been given gold for taking this piss out of the colour of my skin thanks btw and wow 
 edit4 : wow top of r/tifu yesterday xd let me just get something straight i never said i did n't deserve the consequences for my actions instead i 've said how much of a dick i am and how i fucked up <unk> was actually a couple of days ago but i did n't really <unk> posting this story on reddit at the time 
 my flatmates and i went to amsterdam to celebrate the end of our first year at uni 
 amongst other such cultural activities that one would partake in when visiting amsterdam such as the van <unk> <unk> we also decided to go to the zoo 
 we spent a lovely day <unk> at all the animals and spending our valuable <unk> <unk> on <unk> food in the café 
 cut to the end of the zoo visit and the fateful event 
 my friend t has a big thing for lions and insisted we go and see the <unk> fuckers before the day ended 
 and so it was that we <unk> on tired feet to the lion enclosure to look at the lions 
 they seemed kinda lazy just <unk> around and not really doing much so a few of us went and sat on a bench 
 it was then that the lion began roaring not full on roaring but just little ones like he was building up to something big 
 i only remember this bit in slow motion with ominous music in the background 
 intrigued i made my way towards the enclosure alongside a bunch of other <unk> tourists 
 the lion surveyed the faces before it 
 he opened his mouth displaying his magnificent <unk> 
 we waited with <unk> breath 
 he turned facing away from the cage 
 we stood a group of us waiting for the mighty roar 
 he <unk> his head and ... literally fucking projectile pissed right in my eye 
 at the time everyone was in chaos screaming and running from the dreaded stream but fear was replaced with laughter when they heard me scream he fucking pissed on me '' 
 safe to say i went straight back to my hotel and had the longest shower of my life 
 but i can never wash away the hilarious embarrassing leverage my friends now have over me 
 p.s 
 to all the random tourists who stood there pointing and laughing 
 fuck you it could have just have easily been you 
 tl dr lion <unk> in my <unk> edit : for some bizarre reason some people think i made this whole story up due to the lion enclosure in <unk> being separated by a sizable body of water 
 however i explained that there is a separate part of the enclosure that requires them to go through the indoor part 
 this allows you to get closer to the lions 
 hopefully this <unk> proof that you can in fact get close to the lions will be enough to put any <unk> 's mind to rest 
 edit 2 : my tale of <unk> has been narrated 
 how lovely here it is in an effort to be sexy and save money i decided to wax my own vagina 
 i researched it online and watched videos and i 've had them done professionally since i was 15. i figured if my puerto rican high school dropout bikini waxer can do it then so can i. i took a xanax and applied the wax and ripped 
 easy peasy 
 it did n't hurt and the hair was actually coming out 
 as i was applying wax to the <unk> sensitive area of the vagina my husband came in the room 
 i was half kneeling half <unk> over my makeup mirror in a sports bra and nothing else while applying the wax with a tongue depresser 
 when he came in i screamed dont look at me '' 
 and tried to do a barrel roll behind my makeup vanity so he could n't see me 
 as i did this the tongue depresser lodged itself in between my downtown lips and the wax stuck to both sides of the tongue depresser which was now lodged firmly into place 
 if you do n't know anything about bikini wax it <unk> very quickly 
 i tried to open my legs but the tongue depresser was stuck to both lips and there was nothing i could do 
 so i figured my best bet was to breathe deeply and rip it as fast as i could 
 i am currently writing this in the lobby of urgent care while wearing an adult diaper because i ripped a two inch section of flesh off of my vagina and am bleeding rather profusely 
 so please men and ladies if you 're going to get waxed find your nearest puerto rican high school dropout and let them rip your hair off for you 
 edit : guys and girls thanks so much for the gold 
 it means a lot to me 
 i 've now been gilded for a appearing in a glory hole while resembling <unk> from <unk> and b for <unk> my vagina 
 i love you all i 'm going to go home and sit gently on a bag of ice 
 i 'll be back tomorrow to answer your questions and apologize to the people of puerto rico 
 second edit : so sorry for offending anyone from puerto rico i was just stating the fact that my waxer has told me multiple times that she is a puerto rican high school drop out 
 also i live in <unk> it 's very common to get bikini waxes starting in high school 
 i would not get a brazilian wax please do n't get offended that i wrote brazilian just a simple bikini line wax where you leave your panties on so i was n't spread eagle in front of a random stranger 
 and as stated previously i went to a <unk> salon not some van with <unk> windows and a sign that said free waxes for young teen girls '' 
 to answer the question why did you freak out if your husband saw you '' 
 if you 've never seen someone wax themselves it looks like a gorilla crime scene 
 there are sticky strips covered with hair and tiny specks of blood on the towel you sit upon while sweating and yanking large patches of fur off your <unk> 
 it 's just not cute 
 it has nothing to do with my husband i just want to feel sexy and that 's not a sexy time for anyone to see 
 it 's uncomfortable awkward and tear filled 
 i mean i guess that turns a lot of people on but i prefer to surprise my husband with a nice trimmed clam friend to eat rather than let him see the <unk> process 
 third edit : if you guys liked this i have some more horrifying stories that i can share with you 
 none of which involve any <unk> or races ok so today was a pretty normal day 
 i woke up at 7am cleaned myself up collected a kiss from my mum and went to school 
 mum was ready for work too 
 school was fun beside the <unk> fact that this fat kid next to me in class just wont freaking stop eating and tear my nerves 
 so schools out me going to the school bus the <unk> telling me that i should wait here because my dad later picks me up for what ever reason she didnt know 
 so i waited 
 finally he arrived tells me to get in and just shut the fuck up 
 i was shocked didnt know what to say but did what he said 
 so he obviously was pretty pissed staring at the road didnt say anything at all 
 i said : <unk> he said : could you just be quiet please ... i said : ok ... so we arrived at home and then i couldnt believe what i saw 
 i just remembered that candlelight i forgot to kill before going to school 
 my parents knew i always let the candlelight in my room on 
 and they knew.. the house was half burned down with the firemen killing the rest of the fire 
 so how was your day 
 sorry for my english im not a native speaker cyae1 narrated it for me thanks dude 
 <unk> : actually the same thing happened to a friend of mine a couple of years ago two of his <unk> and one or so cats caught fire and eventually died 
 but it wasnt his fault 
 it was his <unk> depressed mum who i think let a cigarette on and dropped in the kitchen and my friend picked her up and then the <unk> burned down or so.. im not sure though 
 this morning like every morning i got out of bed stumbled down to my bathroom and undressed in preparation for a shower 
 now i have one of those <unk> cubicle showers and when i opened the door i noticed a small moth in the corner of the shower 
 fuck '' i thought to myself 
 here 's another bloody thing i have to deal with i do n't want a fucking moth flying all around the place while i 'm trying to shower '' 
 so i turned on the shower a little bit to encourage my little friend to <unk> the <unk> of course it starts freaking out and flying all over the place just as i knew it would 
 however it finally finds the open door comes racing out hooks around and crashes <unk> into my crotch where it became <unk> in my pubic hair 
 now being a single male who never had much luck with the ladies i 've had no <unk> to maintain it so it was tangled up there well and good 
 having a live moth in your pubic hair is not a fun experience so letting out a <unk> of <unk> i attempted to remove the moth with a gentle flick ... which caused the moth to explode 
 it was awful 
 it was like a scene from <unk> <unk> <unk> in a jungle 
 needless to say there was much shampoo and soap used that day 
 **tl dr a moth <unk> 'd into my pubic hair and when i tried to remove it it exploded into little moth <unk> time lurker on the is sub although just changed account 
 i am writing this to say that i am fed up with the overly <unk> fuck ups '' which have unnecessary detail which <unk> is just there to <unk> up votes and leaves other more interesting fuck ups off the front 
 i know that stuff like this has been posted before and i know that of course some detail is needed but shit like this : & gt '' i just got in this mood to give him exclusive ball action with my tongue and hands 
 i first started by just licking <unk> up and placed each ball inside my mouth and went to town by sucking and licking them 
 i then laid beside him showing how much i loved him by sucking and licking his neck ... my fingertips <unk> the <unk> of his skin i began to just rub his balls in such a fluid motion 
 he pulled me on top of him i turned around so he could get a <unk> of my ass i leaned in <unk> his hard cock and began licking his nuts again '' 
 just sounds like 50 shades of grey 
 i do n't think that this adds to the story and mostly 
 is n't needed 
 sorry for the rant obviously other people do n't feel this way but i think that this sub has lost it 's <unk> so this did n't happen today exactly but a relative of mine mentioned it to me and refreshed my memory and now i am burning in shame 
 so when i was around 8 years old i had this obsession with <unk> <unk> the works and really wanted any power regardless of how lame it was be it the power of super strength super hearing growth etc 
 one day when i was watching tv this really hot steamy sex scene suddenly popped up and for the first time i saw a woman 's nipples 
 instinctively i started to touch my crotch for some reason because it felt weird ... i then noticed that i had a raging <unk> in my pants 
 i was amazed 
 i grew 
 at that point i convinced myself that i had a superpower and was eager to show the world 
 the next day was my birthday and in front of all my friends and relatives i proudly announced that i was a superhero and told them that i had the power of growth 
 one of my friends did n't believe me so i showed them a demonstration 
 right then and there i grabbed my crotch area and started rubbing it - hard - in front of all those little kids who 's parents were rushing to cover their eyes 
 in about 30 seconds i managed to get it up '' and gave a proud smirk of achievement to my audience 
 god i fucked up 
 edit : real life friends on reddit are now calling me <unk> ... edit2 : on front page ... expected this post to be <unk> but no ... edit3 : the irony is that i kinda have ed today ... guess my <unk> <unk> got me : last night i started my nye celebrations at a mates house 
 we were drinking beers and i had downed about 5 in an hour and a half 
 so i was a little drunk walking down to the carnival 
 now my body build is very lean and skinny 
 i am considered a bit of a light weight 
 i had packed 6 beers for myself and a liter of jack <unk> straight 
 when walking down to the carnival and where there was live music 
 once i walked down there i started drinking the jack straight from the bottle 
 which was like rocket fuel compared to the beer i was drinking 
 after 2 hours i drank half of my jack and i could n't stand up and i was vomiting everywhere 
 someone called the police so i was taken back to the cells where i was spewing and passed out 
 i had no charges laid against me 
 once my parents picked me up 
 i was as white as a sheet of paper and i was <unk> at the mouth 
 my grandpa who was with my parents said i needed to go to hospital 
 where i got my stomach pumped and had to be assisted breathing for 2 hours 
 my blood pressure was <unk> and my heart was beating at double what it should be 
 i was so close to total organ failure 
 i woke up this morning in my own bed wondering where i was and my friend who was staying over was relieved i woke up 
 now i am being asked all these questions and lectures about responsible drinking while dealing with the biggest hangover of my life 
 last night i fucked up 
 edit : thank you all for the hangover advice and to clarify i am 18 and living in australia 
 happy new year to all as well everyone stay safe over this <unk> <unk> brother 13 goes to a day camp at a local community college in my hometown 
 i was visiting home for a few days working at my college over the summer and my parents were encouraging us to spend time together since i would n't see him for long 
 i picked him up from his day camp which ended at 4 and had to entertain him until his drum lessons at 5. knowing that he 's obsessed with video games i took him to a gamestop near his drum lessons 
 everything went according to plan until it was time to leave 
 <unk> hit we needed to go but he was n't having any of it 
 <unk> he still really *really* did n't want to leave and by this point i was growing impatient because i did n't want my parents to be pissed at me for making him late 
 <unk> and i grab his hand and tell him the <unk> need to <unk> 
 danny we have to go '' 
 just one more minute '' 
 no dude your lessons are starting like <unk> 
 let 's go '' 
 just give me a sec 
 i just need like two secs '' 
 i an 18 year old boy grabbing my 13 year old brother 's hand in a crowded gamestop angrily yelled # # # *** '' danny we do n't have time for secs 
 *** i got a lot of concerned looks got really red in the face and got the hell out of there as quickly as fucking possible 
 i posted this on <unk> but it was recommended that i try it out on here 
 my apologies if you read it already at our school we are required to do two duties '' outside of our normal classes 
 one of mine turned out to be lunch duty with two other teachers for the entire middle school 
 so today while walking around the cafeteria and watching the students i found two <unk> on the ground 
 i sneakily picked them up and put them in my pocket and continued walking 
 i was sure nobody saw me so i thought nothing more of it 
 about fifteen minutes later i found another <unk> 
 i again looked around and put it in my pocket 
 it was about five minutes later that i found two more spread across the floor between two tables 
 i could n't believe how many nickles i was finding 
 for the next 10 minutes i continued finding about a total of 8 nickles 
 before the bell rang i reached in my pocket to feel the pocket full of treasure i had found 
 it was gone 
 i had been robbed 
 i looked over at a table of adolescent boys and saw them giggling at me 
 when i asked them what was so funny they said reach a little deeper 
 after taking the young one 's advice i quickly realized that there was a hole the size of my fist in my left pocket 
 when i asked the boy laughing the hardest how he knew he said that their table watched me the entire period picking up change taking a few steps and watching the silver flow out of my pant leg 
 i immediately turned red but found the humor in the situation 
 putting myself in their situation i could only imagine how funny and ridiculous a teacher looked in this scenario 
 disclaimer : the reason i looked like a moron to the entire 7th and 8th grade is because that table of boys told just about everyone in the room 
 i had a girl in the hall say to me mr. w can i borrow a <unk> '' 
 this was followed by a roar of <unk> for the gold 
 one of the brave and few this actually happened today 
 i was talking in the hallway with one of my friends who is a girl and today is pajama day at our school 
 <unk> were walking by and we were just talking im fairly comfortable with most of my friends that are girls so i wanted to see what shirt she was wearing so i do what any teenage male that does n't think before he acts 
 i unzipped her hoodie in the middle of a hallway where many people were traveling through 
 she wasnt wearing a shirt so after showing everyone in the hallway my friends <unk> lots of nervous laughter and red faces 
 being yelled at and laughed at im sitting across the table from her in study hall and the first thing she says to me after a couple hours i told your mother '' edit : 1. holy shit <unk> 2. senior in high school its spirit week not sure if people actually saw since no one reacted besides me and her but there was that chance 3. if you do n't believe idk its the fucking internet heres a screenshot of a text you reddit detectives 
 screenshot edited so you cant see her number so my sister and i resolved to get fit together this year and have started going for afternoon <unk> around our neighborhood 
 we are two years apart and best friends so we do really dumb shit in front of eachother all the time just out of sheer boredom or to make eachother laugh 
 we were almost home and i had been holding in gas for ages 
 i was <unk> slightly in front of my sister and so decided to let out my gas in a series of short loud farts while <unk> that i was <unk> powered 
 my sister told me i was gross and from behind her i heard a muffled laugh 
 an older lady and an incredibly hot guy our age had been walking about 10 feet behind us 
 my sister began laughing hysterically and i quicky fled to our front yard and around the side gate to escape 
 turns out the lady is our new next door neighbor and the hot dude is her son 
 <unk> happened two days ago so i thought i 'd share it but a little bit of back story 
 me and my best friend we 'll call her cara have known each other since we were 13 we 're both 22 now 
 i do n't have any interest in her besides being friends 
 i 've seen her through good relationships and bad break-ups and vice-versa 
 her current boyfriend we 'll call him david who she 's been dating for a year is a pretty cool guy we all hang out drink beer shoot pool etc 
 i try to avoid being the third wheel but they insist on having me around but i think that 's gon na change now 
 story : every other day we hang out over cara 's play some minecraft and cod and i head out for work 
 i usually leave at 5:30pm to be there at six but i had taken that day off 
 working 13 hour shifts is a bitch 
 around <unk> i decided to go get some air so i went out on the deck and sat by the pool and i ended up drifting off to sleep 
 when i woke up it was <unk> and i wondering why they were n't out here with me 
 then i remembered i did n't tell them i took the day off they probably thought i left for work and did n't bother 
 i 'm thinking we can all go get pizza since i 'm still here 
 as i head back inside with my craving for pizza i walk straight through the kitchen and into the living room and what do my eyes see 
 cara ass naked on the floor riding david who is handcuffed to the table btw like a demon 
 at one point i thought she was going to break his pelvis death by snu-snu 
 she had a black dildo <unk> in the air like she was about to charge into battle with it and it was then i noticed david had red dick <unk> on his face and chest 
 they both had 9 inch grins on they 're faces until they turned and saw me and turned completely red 
 they were speechless with those oh shit '' facial expressions 
 straight ahead on the tv they still had minecraft loaded up the annoying music had stopped and all the damn farm animals were staring at me like they were waiting for my reaction 
 even the damn chicken or duck 
 stopped to stare at me and that little bastard is always causing shenanigans 
 i told them nah you guys finish up i 'm gon na go home now '' and left 
 the drive home consisted of me laughing like an idiot with tears in my eyes 
 well two hours ago she sent me a text message saying yeah we need to talk about the other day '' 
 idk know what 's going to happen from here on out hope it does n't ruin our friendship 
 tl dr : went outside for some air at best friends house went to sleep woke up went back inside caught a front row of her and her boyfriend having freaky rough sex 
 minecraft animals were staring at me like a sandwich 
 i never got my pizza 
 update <unk> : okay first off <unk> reddit 
 i did n't think it 'd be this popular 
 second i 'm at work on my break and yes an update is coming 
 me her and david are meeting up for breakfast when i get off work so i 'll update when we 're done and thank god they know nothing of reddit 
 i 'll keep you guys posted 
 also i really want to get to the comments you guys are awesome as hell 
 update <unk> : well we met up for breakfast when i got off work and i 'm not going to lie i was pretty worried 
 i was n't traumatized by the grand event i witnessed in fact i thought it was hilarious 
 i was <unk> worried about how they felt about the whole thing 
 i 've caught them both in some pretty funny situations and vice-versa but nothing like that 
 at first there was some awkward silence but then i told them about the minecraft animals especially that god damn <unk> to break the ice and they lost it 
 i also learned that after poor david was handcuffed cara pulled the dildo out and started slapping him and that if i did n't show up when i did cara would have hit him again 
 i completely lost my shit and a mouthful of pepsi 
 i told him be thankful that 's all she did with it 
 i apologized to both of them like hell and told them both how awesome they are as friends to be able to laugh something like this off 
 i found out after breakfast that cara had told david something about me that evened the score ... fuck 
 it appears we have ourselves a mexican <unk> in that department my days are <unk> 
 anyway we 're going to hang out again later on today and i 'm gon na make damn sure we get that bacon and ham pizza 
 btw cara and david are not their real names actually it 's pretty far off 
 i am a guy not a girl 
 whoever gave this post gold thank you 
 thank you guys you 're all funny as hell 
 apparently this was narrated : i would use a throwaway for this but i have no shame 
 recently my girlfriend and i have been talking about <unk> 
 she said she wanted to try and shave herself bare <unk> there and i asked if she would like me to do something about my peen afro dreading the response 
 she said i should probably trim to about half size for <unk> 's sake and of course i agreed 
 i should mention at this point that not once in my life thus far had i taken a blade to that most holy of places and had allowed my <unk> to grow wild and free as mother nature intended 
 clean as a whistle and soft as down my carpet was my pride and joy 
 so this morning uk time i sat buck naked over the toilet like butters a pair of safety '' scissors in front of me and <unk> forest <unk> out over the bowl 
 my hand <unk> as i reached for the scissors my mind flashing back to every time the barber told me to stay still else he might accidentally cut my ear off 
 ever so slowly i opened the blades and <unk> off the first chunk of long and <unk> 
 * '' there that was n't so bad now was it 
 * confident now i cut away more and more hacking through my gentleman jungle with some pace 
 admiring my <unk> i started to get more ambitious cutting closer and closer to my soft pale skin 
 a glorious mound of hair grew in the toilet bowl 
 and then it happened 
 i saw it a moment too late 
 as the blades snapped shut a tiny piece of <unk> flesh was sliced clean off with the pubes 
 my eyes <unk> from the <unk> wound and the shock and blood welled to the quarter inch wound 
 i flung the scissors down and grabbed a handful of toilet paper as a <unk> of blood ran down my balls 
 clutching the paper to my bleeding bollocks i slid on my dressing gown and half ran half <unk> downstairs doing my best to look normal as i walked passed our security camera 
 heading to the kitchen cupboard i snatched out the first aid box and rifled through it for a plaster 
 all we had remaining was a kiddy <unk> plaster 
 fuck it it would have to do 
 the damn thing would n't stick the remaining hair and ball sack <unk> would n't allow the plaster to maintain contact 
 panicking i threw the plaster away and went back upstairs to the shower 
 i needed to make sure the wound was clean so it would n't get infected 
 i showered quickly on a high heat and it looked like the bleeding was stopping but as soon as i came out and dried my balls with the towel the wound <unk> and blood trickled from it once more 
 then in a stroke of what i humbly describe as pure genius a <unk> plan came to me 
 i took a thick sheet of kitchen roll and hunted through the drawers for one of my sister 's hair <unk> <unk> to wrap my jewels up like a crispy <unk> to soak any blood up till the bleeding stops using the <unk> to secure the kitchen roll in place 
 thankfully i managed to find one tight enough to keep it together and yet loose enough that blood would still <unk> 
 i sit here now typing this with my junk looking like <unk> eastern <unk> not daring to see if it 's finally over 
 i 'm never *ever* putting scissors anywhere near my plums again 
 edit - **tl dr** tried to trim my pubes cut a chunk of my balls off 
 oh god the bleeding 
 balls now look like a party snack 
 edit2 - update i have spent most of the day with my girlfriend being laughed at for cutting my bollocks like a moron 
 <unk> my testicle parcel and there was blood everywhere 
 all over my balls and all over my underwear 
 cleaned up and had to use a couple of her <unk> no i 'm not joking so the blood would n't reach my trousers 
 have been out in town to buy <unk> and fabric <unk> and had to go to public toilets to clean up twice put them on and at long last the blood has stopped 
 females of the world never will i make fun of periods again 
 putting up with the blood for a day has been miserable and embarrassing and i did n't have any pain 
 i have no idea how you do it for a week every month 
 also many thanks to <unk> 
 i have never been gifted gold on here 
 this post is the most upvoted thing i 've ever <unk> to reddit and will be in my history at the top forever now 
 i 'm not sure whether to laugh or <unk> is pretty short but is easily one of the most embarrassing moments of my young adult life 
 when i was about 14 during those awkward and interesting days of adolescence i came home from school to an empty house so i decided to hop in the shower 
 i used the shower in my parents bathroom because theirs was nicer — it was a walk-in shower with a glass door and one of those <unk> spigots 
 well as i was cleaning myself i started thinking about a girl i was attracted to at the time and ... please do n't judge me ... i started kissing the shower door imagining that i was kissing her 
 so here i am pressed up against the door getting physically <unk> ... stimulated ... when out of nowhere my mother opens the door to the bathroom and finds herself face-to-face with her son rubbing up on and making out with the door to the shower 
 she just does a <unk> and walks out 
 about 10 minutes later i head out and came up with some excuse that i slipped and fell '' onto the shower door 
 her response 
 well from the look of things it certainly must have been exciting for you '' 
 i have never mentioned it to her <unk> five month old kitten was napping beside me while i was laying on my side reading a book 
 felt a bit of a squeaker building up and thought it would be funny to startle kitty with it 
 spread my cheeks and lined up my puckered brown eye to the back of kitty 's head 
 i felt like <unk> harvey <unk> 
 let my little squeaker go 
 it sounded like a <unk> coughing 
 poor cat shot about three feet high and six feet forward off the bed 
 this was about three hours ago and he still wo n't come out for his food and bolts as soon as i try to touch him 
 edit - thanks for the gold 
 as requested here 's a pic of my victim 
 looks as though he 's still struggling to come to terms with it 
 have n't been laid in a while so i thought i 'd facebook message all the girls i thought i might have a chance of getting with were i to put the effort in 
 so i write a nice friendly message and send it to about ten or so different girls 
 hey how 's it going 
 : d have n't seen you in a while ... how come 
 both sentences are two separate messages gives the impression that i have n't thought it through and its just a friendly harmless message 
 usually works they wo n't think i 'm trying anything on right 
 wrong ... as soon as i send it a single messenger thing pops up at the bottom of the screen with a group message containing all ten girls 
 i accidently created a group message containing all ten girls and sent my message to the group 
 the positive thing is i got replies from all of them ... the negative is all of them were along the lines of <unk> '' and you do know we can all see this right '' 
 probably deserve the creep status i now have 
 **edit : ** i just left the conversation about thirty messages in 
 the last few messages looked something like this : <unk> haha '' really <unk> '' 
 <unk> i know right 
 as if he even has a <unk> '' <unk> has left the conversation '' 
 they 're probably still going 
 **edit** messaged them all privately : not really too much i can say about that one obviously that was pretty <unk> <unk> of me so sorry i guess ... <unk> '' 4 replied 2 of whom had already messaged me being super cool about it and basically just being like mate that 's so funny seriously what the <unk> were you thinking the other 2 just being like yeah ok no worries shit happens 
 of those 4 who replied only one of them is on my course 
 : / no response from the other 5 who are all on my course ... 2 of whom were super <unk> in the group message although one of those two i did kind of sleep with then not really talk to afterwards in <unk> 's year so maybe she has the right to be 
 now that its been a while and some have replied being cool about it and i 've at least got front page status for my fu i 'm just sitting here chuckling and really dreading tomorrow morning 
 it could be worse i guess 
 lol 
 * post thanksgiving update * **tldr : ** i posted a text message between myself and my husband that my mother took offense to and <unk> my husband and i to thanksgiving and future holiday events 
 also everyone and their brother got to see the drama 
 this happened yesterday 
 a little background : me : veteran morbid humor tends to be the <unk> of my family husband : chinese also has a us <unk> has no family in america mom : <unk> <unk> mom whole life very conservative christian <unk> admitted <unk> this year for thanksgiving we 're doing something new 
 everyone is bringing a dish to pass around 
 i was assigned bean casserole but i wanted to bring something a little extra 
 having trouble deciding i sent my husband a text to see if i could get any recipe ideas : is there any holiday like thanksgiving in china '' 
 his response : no ... you know ... because we did n't kill all the people already living there '' 
 this is the section of our conversation i had put up on fb 
 i had countered this response with a haha very funny ass '' 
 sort of response but left that out 
 i do this at around 12pm get a couple likes and responses that are also haha very funny ass '' 
 and i head into my meetings which will keep me occupied for the next 5 hours 
 on one of my trips to grab a thumb drive from my desk i see my phone has blown up with fb notifications as well as texts 
 not having much time i glance at the latest text from my husband which says : people are sending me messages about your post 
 i never thought i would be part of a public facebook drama 
 i am a little embarrassed 
 i was so careful '' 
 instantly my heart drops into my stomach 
 i had not told him that i had decided to put this text up 
 i thought it was harmless it made me laugh it made some of my co-workers laugh when i had shared it with them - what in the world was going on 
 but i did n't have time to check i had to go back into a meeting that dragged on late for another 2 and a half hours 
 at this point its close to 5pm 
 utter chaos 
 my mom had responded with a very aggressive reply to that post 
 essentially she <unk> my husband for speaking poorly of america and how dare he imply that his home country was somehow above <unk> from america 
 that if he did n't like it here he should gtfo 
 she even posted an article about <unk> things his country had done in it 's developmental stages 
 one of my sisters step in to tell her to stop being mean and she gets into an argument with her about how she 's not being mean she 's just standing up for america and why does that make her the bad guy 
 my sister tells her it 's not that she 's standing up for america it 's the words she choosing to use in order to do <unk> especially those directed at her children 
 for some context here are a few of the many quotes from my mom in this fb status conversation : yeah the asian history is so full of loving <unk> history 
 lol idiots '' 
 people who live in america have american jobs and do n't know what its like to live under <unk> rule 
 they make me sick this is thanksgiving 
 thank god you live in america thank god for the military who has died for your ass to live free in america with the <unk> of the <unk> and stfu about <unk> <unk> who got their ass kicked 300 years ago but kicked someone else 's ass to live in the lands they lived in 
 and if you do n't like it like i said go live in <unk> america or mexico or back to asia 
 if they are so <unk> with their own history '' 
 people need to wake the f up and see how this hating on america <unk> into people 's minds and eventually turns a country into self <unk> americans '' 
 it 's humiliating that a sil <unk> would say something about the country that has <unk> him with open arms and given him <unk> then can say stupid crap like that 
 it was n't funny '' 
 if you do n't like america 's history and want to put thanksgiving down ... <unk> '' 
 why is the person who points out <unk> lack of common sense the bad person with you '' 
 should n't put up stuff for all to see if you ca n't take the heat '' 
 i do n't like people <unk> on america have a real problem with it i taught my children better '' 
 well i talked it out with her father and since we both agree that husband 's hate post was political the rest stands 
 unless husband would like to apologize for insulting this country '' 
 all this over a playful exchange that was in no way meant to be a political statement from my husband 
 english is his second language he struggles sometimes to accurately express his thoughts and feelings due to his vocabulary 
 my mom - most people - do n't know that he genuinely is concerned about what he says because he 's afraid of articulating it incorrectly 
 because of this he often says nothing in the moment and my later explain to me what he wanted to say but could n't find the words 
 one could n't be more mistaken to think my husband would say this sort of phrase with the idea it represented any sort of <unk> opinion that he harbored 
 he was going for a cheap shot laugh which he succeeded 
 <unk> no big deal 
 and i feel like i should mention this again ... i am a veteran of the us military 
 so the idea that i have no <unk> towards this country is pretty <unk> ... and a little insulting 
 so i post a response in which i say my husband will not be apologizing and i gave more background to the whole conversation and tried to explain it was said in <unk> and was n't meant to be any sort of political jab to anyone 
 i also requested that if you have issues to message me directly about it or call me and not make a spectacle in public for everyone to see 
 his sister reads all these comments and calls him 
 his sister is in china 
 his dad is also on fb 
 i am freaking out because i do not want his family to see this 
 we have friends messaging both him and me asking <unk> is going on are we okay and offering to take us in for thanksgiving if she 's serious about not wanting us there 
 during all of this my mom messages me on fb and once again tries to argue about how what he said was <unk> and why was she in the wrong for defending america 
 i tried to explain to her 3 times the reason behind what he was saying how it was innocent and she was taking this too personally and literally and that just made her angrier 
 as i was still at work i had to cut the conversation short but told her i was very disappointed with her choice of dealing with this situation and i would let her know my husband and i 's decision on what we would do for thanksgiving 
 so this morning i 'm <unk> messages to those who stepped into the line of fire that was my mother 's words with an apology and thank you for trying to step in 
 i 'm going to message my sil sister-in-law and beg her not to say anything to their father 
 and i let my mom know we <unk> be there for thanksgiving 
 and that 's where i am right now 
 no reaction yet from my mom but she 's effectively told my husband he 's not welcome to family functions right before thanksgiving and christmas 
 i 'm just sitting her spinning not sure what to do next 
 i 'm so upset that i ca n't pin down one emotion right now 
 i 'll update if anything happens over the next day worth reporting 
 yay holidays 
 edit : we 've shared text messages from one another before without asking 
 i should point out our fb is mostly college and close friends 
 we live pretty far away from folk 
 fb has become a bit of our we 're still alive and this is what we do '' <unk> for these folk 
 mom joined fb about 3-4 months ago and the drama started 
 she is a bit of a <unk> i 've come to realize <unk> some of her comments on others <unk> 
 so as strange as it might be to some sharing <unk> of our <unk> is not unusual for our updates 
 update : my mom responded with : lol do n't bother i 'm sure we can cover the casserole 
 enjoy your holiday 
 also before i <unk> her she started posting all sorts of <unk> and thanksgiving <unk> all over her page 
 sigh 
 post thanksgiving update : we went to a friends thanksgiving 
 it was very nice and drama free 
 i did miss the <unk> of my family thanksgiving but ultimately my husband and i had a <unk> holiday weekend in which we reconnected with friends 
 thank you for all the advice - both supporting us as a couple and those who <unk> to the whole situation 
 i really appreciate being able to see the view from all sides - to have both support to stand strong as well as the encouragement to have a forgiving heart 
 i feel this has brought my husband and i closer as well as opened my eyes to some things i 've been compromising to keep the peace 
 my mom - through my sister living at home who was not the one to say something to her - offered to make us soup from the leftovers from dinner 
 knowing her i feel this is her way of a <unk> offering and to our true family fashion of <unk> <unk> like this an moving along 
 we still have not spoke i have not planned on speaking to her this week as i have work things to deal with but i will keep an open heart and mind as we move closer to christmas 
 most importantly this will start our dialogue of <unk> which is <unk> needed 
 thank you again everyone and if something comes up for christmas ... well i 'll be back to let you know 
 i 'm looking for advice at <unk> post thanksgiving 
 this actually occurred about a year ago when i was <unk> i was at my grandfather 's wake 
 he had wished that all of his grandkids 8 in total would serve as the <unk> 
 my uncle that had married into the family and did not share the same last name as my grandfather asked me to check the list of the names that he was going to give to the funeral <unk> 
 so i did and the list looked like this : john smith kids of the aforementioned uncle jill smith mary smith <unk> delucio me sharing my grandfather 's last name amy delucio ben delucio <unk> delucio jane delucio the names looked fine except for the fact that our last name is actually spelled with a capital l meaning it was delucio '' 
 i gave a lighthearted well i mean it 's way off they forgot the capital l '' 
 my uncle gave a lighthearted laugh back but then <unk> and looked confused 
 uncle : what do you mean 
 me : the l '' 
 it 's not capitalized 
 but we do n't really care 
 uncle : what do you mean it 's capitalized 
 no it 's not 
 me : ... um ... yes ... i 'm pretty sure i know how to spell my own last name 
 you do n't share our last name but i assure you it 's a capital l '' 
 it was at this point my uncle <unk> up and down that my grandfather spelled it with a lowercase l '' 
 we went to my grandmother standing by my father and asked her about which it was 
 she looked confused but stated that it was indeed a lowercase l '' 
 but my father suddenly started acting strange 
 it was then that my dad confessed to a 50 year old secret : he said that our name was actually delucio '' but that when he was in 3rd or 4th grade he decided he wanted to look cool and capitalized the l '' on his own 
 he never got caught legal <unk> apparently did n't <unk> and the name stuck 
 tl dr : i 've been living my father 's lie for 30 years 
 this fu as most is not from today but is from yesterday ... actually you could argue the fu is 3 years ago or even 4. was in a fairly new relationship with a girl tara '' for a few months while on a work term in my home town 
 work term ended and i went back to school a few hours away 
 within a couple months i had received a phone call from tara telling me she was pregnant 
 i came home for the weekend and discussed what our plan was and she decided she was going to keep it 
 3 years later my step mom <unk> my dad that i should do a <unk> test since she thinks the child looked nothing like me 
 got the results back today and for the last 3 years i was financially and emotionally invested in a child that was n't mine 
 ends up tara was sleeping around 
 now i feel awful for the kid and do n't know how to exit the scene 
 edit : since this has been coming up in a lot of comments 
 i 'm no longer seeing tara for some time now other than picking the little one up every other weekend 
 i am going to try to <unk> myself out of their life and go on living mine 
 for the kid i hope she finds the real father but man thats got ta be an awkward conversation to start 
 edit # 2 : thanks for all the support and suggestions 
 thankfully i do n't live in the us 
 as i mentioned i was in school out of the city so i was n't as close to the kid as most people seem to imagine 
 work also took me a ways away for some duration for the 2nd year 
 since i was in school for the 1st year and a half i was n't able to pay any child support during that time 
 i 'm not asking for any of it back but i fully intend to cut payments from here on out 
 nothing too serious but i felt pretty stupid 
 i decided to pick up some mcdonald 's after class today 
 i get there during the lunch hour so of course there is a long line of cars ahead of me 
 i decide to kill some time by opening up the reddit app on my phone 
 before i know it i 'm pulling up to the first window 
 it 's right then that i realize something 
 *i never stopped to order my <unk> 
 so i look at the cashier and obviously i just drive off instead of having to explain to the her that i forgot to order my food like an idiot 
 edit : narrated by the hilarious cyae1 
 this happened minutes ago 
 i 'm sitting in the school library on a computer 
 in the library there are <unk> of six computers arranged around a circular table with each screen facing <unk> 
 so i 'm just working on some electronics <unk> when a gorgeous girl sits at the computer next to me 
 now my school has a particular reputation for having an extremely <unk> population of hot girls so i 'm instantly aware 
 i look over and to my joy i see she has her lanyard with her id card which we all have to carry on the table in front of her and i can see the name clearly 
 trying not to shout for joy i quickly grab my phone and type her name into facebook 
 i do n't have the facebook app on my iphone as i do n't often use it and it would just be taking up space for no reason so usually use on the mobile site in safari 
 as her profile loads up i check her picture and it 's definitely her 
 <unk> 
 now here 's where it starts to go wrong 
 i go to tap on the <unk> section of her profile to check if she 's in my year group or the year above but my stupid fingers accidentally tap the <unk> friend button 
 my heart <unk> 
 i quickly try to tap it again to cancel the request when my screen goes black and my iphone dies 
 i 'm always <unk> when i hear <unk> where timing is this convenient but i shit you not this just happened 
 i can see her phone feet away from me on the desk to my right and i 'm praying she does n't pick it up 
 my profile picture is very recent and she 'd know it was me straight away from her peripheral vision 
 worst part is facebook is blocked on the school computers so i ca n't use it to cancel the request 
 we can access reddit by using but facebook does n't work 
 any ideas 
 may have to run 
 fuck 
 edit : spelling edit : as i 'm trying to get the courage to say something to her she grabs her phone and opens the flip case 
 i looked over and could see the friend request notification on her lock screen 
 she <unk> left with the grace of a <unk> before i can grab my shit and run 
 i see my profile pop up 
 my dick is basically inside me 
 it dawns on her that the 0 mutual friends guy is me 
 she looks over for a good few seconds but i keep my eyes fixed on my pc 
 she quickly <unk> her things and leaves 
 just before she walks off i muster a <unk> but she gives me a 'wtf look and <unk> out the library 
 i 've never been so embarrassed 
 looks like i 'm gon na have to avoid the only <unk> in this place from now on 
 edit : the idea of looking on facebook was to check if she was the year above before introducing myself as i 'd prefer someone my age from observation relationships between year groups do n't work well in schools 
 this was the only thing my retarded brain could think at the time 
 i 'm sorry reddit 
 update : still no <unk> of said request 
 will update in due course 
 update 2 : she has n't accepted 
 to be honest i was n't expecting it 
 it 's game over boys 
 thanks for the <unk> it has made me laugh a lot 
 **tl dr : ** took a vegetarian to texas roadhouse thinking we were just going out as friends 
 so this happened about 4.5 years ago but i was just thinking about it today and thought it was <unk> 
 so i was a loser for well always but i 've managed to get less <unk> as life went on 
 i age like a fine wine and as such i did n't lose my virginity until i was 20. the same day i met this girl let 's call her chelsea 
 we immediately hit it off she was not who i hooked up with but we got on facebook and started talking 
 well we kind of faded for a bit since i never asked her out since i met another girl 
 on the internet 
 playing video games 
 who lived further from me than chelsea 
 we 'll call this girl sasha 
 well i decided to pursue sasha more than chelsea and despite having met on <unk> we decided to date '' 
 we met in person twice over the summer then just texted and skyped and all the long distance stuff that couples do 
 it was a weird relationship though i was just not a good boyfriend at the time not cheating or anything just dismissive at times and ignored her to go out drinking constantly 
 well chelsea and i started talking again more once the school year started up again but she did n't know i was in a relationship since i was a bad boyfriend and had my relationship status hidden from general facebook view 
 but i just figured i could have female friends and it would be innocent 
 so chelsea and i hung out a few times in the <unk> and at some mutual meetings and stuff pretty innocent stuff 
 never really on the weekends though as she was n't 21 yet 
 but she was cool fun to hang out with and she ended up asking me out 
 now let to preface this and point out that i was and still am a complete and utter dumbass who is completely hopeless with women and unable to pick up on even the most obvious of signals 
 i thought she just wanted to hang out 
 she did n't even say we were going out just said that her roommates were busy and she wanted something to do i said mine were busy and we could hang out 
 she was like yes let 's do that 
 then she gave me her address and said to pick her up on saturday and like 5. i thought that was weird but whatever i can give her a ride so we can hang out 
 i get there and she asks where we 're going to eat she 's dressed up i 'm not 
 i am still not aware that this is a date 
 she suggests we go to olive garden since they have a lot of vegetarian options 
 she then on the 10 minute drive there spends half the time talking about this vegetarian place she wants to try since she 's vegetarian and that olive garden has good vegetarian options 
 i 'm well aware she 's a vegetarian 
 we ended up going to texas roadhouse because olive garden was busy 
 ooops 
 afterwards i paid since she did n't have a purse thinking whatever she can pay next time 
 then we go back to my place to play cod : black ops 
 i then keep answering texts from my girlfriend while hanging out with this girl who keeps trying to get me to make a move 
 she kept moving closer putting her hand on my thighs leaning in and laughing at all of my corny jokes that are terrible 
 long story short we hang out and i take her home telling her peace '' 
 as i drop her off 
 i get home and talk about hanging out with chelsea with sasha 
 sasha then points out i just went on a date 
 i denied it for like a week before realizing that chelsea stopped talking to me afterwards and her friends told my friends that i took her on the worst date ever 
 we saw eachother once a week for the rest of the school year though and said maybe 50 words to eachother 
 my relationship with sasha did not last after that 
 she has a reddit account so i 'm <unk> she 'll see this and i 'll get a snap later 
 i still do n't know what happened to chelsea since she transferred schools and deleted her facebook 
 i still maintain that i did not know i was going on a date or cheating since i did n't know it was a date 
 but this is definitely a story i do n't tell new girlfriends 
 i do still go to texas roadhouse a lot though i do n't regret going there at all 
 its <unk> in sunny <unk> as i write this a quiet sunday morning 
 i woke up with a pretty bad headache but after a couple glasses of water the headache still had n't left me 
 i decided to step out onto my balcony for some fresh air and a smoke 
 as soon as my front door closed behind me i realised - today i fucked up 
 i had grabbed my smokes and my lighter but no keys no phone no money nothing 
 and my beloved flatmate is out of town until monday night even if i could have called her she would n't be able to get to me 
 thought about asking my drug dealing eastern european neighbours if i could borrow their phone but if they did let me i do n't know who i would call - all my family 's numbers are stored on my phone 
 locked inside my house 
 at this point you may be thinking why did n't i borrow a phone and call a locksmith 
 i literally can not afford one right now 
 so what did i do 
 i smashed my fucking kitchen window with a fucking <unk> plant 
 my landlord will repair it but it will most likely come out of the deposit i dropped on this house 
 do n't smoke kids 
 if it does n't give you cancer it will put holes in your house 
 **edit the people asking about my doors automatically locking - yes the <unk> locks behind you if you dont leave it up - which i usually do 
 i 'm <unk> the headache this time around 
 ** **edit 2 yes i smoke the occasional cigarette ca n't believe there are actually people who are talking shit about that as if it 's the worst thing ever 
 or trying to lecture me about the health risks 
 i smoke sometimes 
 deal with it 
 ** thanks for the gold 
 made the broken window less of a blow to the <unk> happened around an hour ago 
 i have had time to let the blood tears and shame wash from my soul in the shower 
 tonight i have a bit of a special evening with a girl i have been seeing so i thought i 'd have a little clear up of my man forest using the clipper part of my electric razor as is natural in these situations 
 there is a particularly difficult part to this procedure which is the most commonly forgotten region of a man 's body - the gooch for those that do n't know it 's the bit between fun bag and poop hole 
 to get to this part it requires a very <unk> squat over the toilet lifting man parts up and peering under to see what you 're doing 
 music on full volume and concentrating <unk> on not <unk> myself what better than my <unk> agent accompanied by two innocent prospective <unk> to see me balls in hand squatting over the toilet staring at my gooch and singing riders on the storm '' <unk> 
 i forgot they sent me an email yesterday to remind me of this viewing 
 i made a sound similar to that of a balloon being deflated whilst hold the neck closed 
 i also <unk> the clipper into my gooch which was a perfect way to finish this <unk> 
 so now i sit after showering for what could have been years with a plaster on my gooch 
 i doubt i 'll hear back from them 
 edit : riders on the storm 
 i 'm sorry <unk> friends on my facebook list have <unk> names they are literally only one letter off 
 both are diana k ... '' one is a fitness instructor at my gym the other is an enormous person 
 it 's diana 's birthday '' 
 popped up in my feed and getting confused and thinking it was the fitness instructor i wrote : happy birthday 
 i 'm going to eat pizza cake and all other sorts of garbage so i can be just like you today '' 
 because you know fitness instructor 
 <unk> 
 a week later it 's diana 's birthday '' 
 popped up in my feed again and noticing it was the fitness instructor i wrote how many <unk> do you have '' 
 ten minutes later it dawned on me ... yup 
 i felt like the world 's biggest <unk> tifu happened a few weeks ago but i 'm new and just discovered this subreddit 
 i love my sister but she tends to make incredibly bad life decisions 
 i do my best to be sensitive and not to judge her or be condescending in anyway which is why she usually comes to me when she 's f 'd something up 
 but this time i f 'd up too reddit 
 i randomly text her to see how she was doing 
 she says not so great so of course i asked why 
 that 's when she said she really needed to talk to me but she was afraid of what i would think of her 
 i told her that if she needed to talk i was here for her that she knew she could tell me anything 
 she insisted that she was sure i would be disappointed in her 
 trying to keep it light hearted because she sounded so upset i gave her an extreme example of something i knew she would n't have done to show i could never be disappointed in her 
 i texted her back this sis i love you no matter what 
 it 's what sisters do 
 did you murder your children 
 because that is literally the only thing you could do that might make me think less of you lol '' 
 i have no idea why i said that reddit 
 because i could have given any other crazy example like if you murder someone '' or if you sleep with my husband '' but no 
 i had to say if you murder your children 
 she has kids i have kids too so it was the perfect example because i knew neither of us could ever harm a hair on our kid 's heads 
 my sister texted back that she was pregnant and it was not her boyfriend 's 
 she wanted my advice about having an abortion 
 cue the longest apology via text ever 
 update and clarification : i am a woman which makes me a sister 
 my sister has kids from a previous marriage 
 they are not the bf 's 
 technically i should have written ex bf because he left 
 they had been having problems for a long time 
 <unk> ex bf did n't know about the pregnancy or cheating 
 and ex bf definitely would have known it was n't his 
 she would n't have nor could have passed the kid off as his 
 she said she used protection 
 i do n't know what she has decided to do 
 i did offer to help her anyway i could but only if she faced the music and told ex bf he was not an ex at the time i made this offer 
 and the father what happened 
 because i believe that the father deserves to voice his opinion 
 and who knows maybe ex bf would have tried to make it work 
 crazier things have happened 
 in my experience coming clean results in better <unk> 
 tl dr put foot in mouth about my sister murdering her children to find out she wanted to discuss an abortion after a one night <unk> coming home saturday evening after many many beers with a mate 
 there 's a brothel near my place and i was feeling drunk horny and foolish so figured what the hell and went in 
 ended up booking two hours with a young lady there 
 in amongst other things we made small talk and she mentioned that she was only 19 years old 
 i 'm only 27 but even so i felt momentarily awkward about this new piece of information 
 <unk> we continued and as the minutes passed she became more and more friendly kissing me and generally making it into some kind of <unk> <unk> 
 i found myself having a lot more fun with this girl than i was expecting 
 about half way through she offered to get me a drink noting that she herself did not <unk> alcohol 
 when i inquired further about this she said alcohol made her a bit crazy and offhandedly noted that she preferred to smoke crystal instead 
 wait what 
 i 'm pretty easy going but even so i was taken aback 
 i must n't have shown it however because she soon returned both with a drink and a glass pipe and asked me to join her 
 i do n't know if it was the alcohol or the rush of the moment or severe lack of blood flow to the brain but i simply nodded and said sure '' 
 <unk> artificial confidence and a <unk> on <unk> we go at it like rabbits 
 then she stops me with a sly grin and tells me that for a bit more cash we can continue <unk> the condom 
 if it 's not <unk> to you by now i am a very poor decision maker 
 took her up on the offer because what could possibly go wrong and commenced act <unk> 
 afterwards she gave me her number is it just me or is that weird i got home and passed out on the couch 
 woke up the next morning and slowly began to feel a wave of horror wash over me as i remembered the events of the previous night and the <unk> number of firsts i had unwittingly achieved 
 and soon i will be taking part in yet another first : my first <unk> blood test 
 tl dr : did crystal meth and <unk> a 19 y/o <unk> dr basically i got into a wrong truck and drove across state lines 
 today i drove to oregon which is a good <unk> drive as i 'm in washington to go to the outlet stores 
 i parked about <unk> away from the side of the mall and did my shopping 
 i was there a good hour as i had a plan of hitting 4 stores only for a few items and leaving 
 i make it to my truck and set everything in the back of the bed 
 i noticed some rude person had thrown a half full bottle of pepsi and an empty cigarette in the back 
 i <unk> and unlocked the door and hopped in 
 i turned the ignition and my radio station comes on - just how i left it 
 no reason to really think otherwise 
 i drive an hour back to washington and pull into my driveway 
 i start to put down my tailgate to <unk> what i bought - and i just froze <unk> i got pissed 
 on the bumper was a sticker that had some <unk> quote on it 
 thinking the perpetrator who put the pepsi bottle and cigarette pack in the bed of my truck thought it would be funny to put a sticker on my truck 
 i happen to have a glass <unk> in my glovebox from a painting job 
 i open my glovebox and shit bricks 
 inside was a <unk> im a dude with short hair a photo of some strange kid i do n't have a kid a dog leash i own a cat and a coupon book for a <unk> town that happened to be about 22 miles from my home 
 at this point i am fully aware this was not my vehicle 
 i 'm certain my heart stopped beating for a few seconds 
 i googled oregon 's police and notified them that i had just been at the outlet store and i believe i drove off with another person 's truck by mistake - all the way back to washington 
 they asked what year and model and the same year ranger truck was stolen '' and gave them the license plate number to confirm 
 the officer said <unk> there is the same year and model ranger parked two spots away with washington plates too 
 i take that is you car can you confirm the license plate 
 to make a long story short i made it there in 40 minutes to the outlet store - right by an officer and a woman who waved me down 
 after the officer taking my id and the owner 's keys from me the woman could actually make a joke about the situation 
 i jokingly asked her to see if her keys would start my truck : and they did 
 found out she lives in the next town over by me 
 after filling out paperwork with the officer i drove sheepishly back to washington - in my own truck 
 so readers of reddit tifu by getting in the wrong vehicle and traveled across state lines 
 this happened a couple of months ago 
 while in the midst of having sex we get the idea of me being blindfolded and my hands tied while she rides me 
 it feels amazing and at the same feel <unk> comfortable 
 just laying down enjoying it all head resting on a pillow unaware of how suddenly drowsy i felt 
 slowly drifting aware without noticing 
 all of a sudden ... <unk> she <unk> the condom right off 
 this immediately gets my attention as you can imagine 
 <unk> fell asleep while we were having sex 
 ** '' i ... 
 <unk> '' 
 yes i must be that bad huh '' 
 wait really 
 what no '' 
 should be noted she was <unk> <unk> 
 yeah while i was riding you *you started snoring* '' 
 ... <unk> '' 
 and then i asked '*are you sleeping 
 * before ripping it off '' 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> '' 
 cue me <unk> her for the next 30 or so minutes convincing her she was n't bad at all and i just was really *really* comfortable 
 edit : achieved gold status 
 i think i won the game 
 thanks for enjoying <unk> nights prior to a scheduled doc 's appointment i had drawn a face on the top of my penis 
 i had used a black magic marker 
 when i am bored and drunk on <unk> sometimes i draw a face on my penis and then enact a sort of <unk> show for myself 
 i just move it around and do a weird voice or whatever 
 or i use it to talk to myself 
 anyways i somehow forgot that i had drawn this face on my penis and i did n't realize it until the moment right before the doctor told me to remove my pants 
 i was thinking oh ... shit 
 i drew a face on my penis '' 
 i asked the doc if it was really necessary to examine my penis 
 he gave me an odd look 
 i felt compelled in my idiocy to just drop my pants 
 i have never been so shamed or humiliated in all of my life 
 the doc just said um ... '' but i guess his professional <unk> or whatever <unk> him from further comment 
 the rest of the visit was extremely awkward 
 i will never visit this doctor again 
 never 
 i will always wash my penis from now on the morning after i have drawn on it 
 not washing the face off of the penis can lead to so many potential risks 
 i almost had a panic attack realizing this 
 like what if i was in a car accident 
 and they had to remove my pants or whatever 
 and all the emergency crew and doctor 's would be seeing a face on penis 
 oh my god 
 it 's so awful 
 oh god 
 what does this doctor think of me 
 shit 
 well that 's how i fucked up 
 alright 
 the other day i was having a few drinks with some buddies after awhile 3:00 a.m i leave 
 on my way home i pass my friends house we are gon na call him fred 
 at the time i thought it would be a grand idea to stop in unexpectedly i do n't know why i wanted to go but i just did 
 i 'll tell you how this turned into a shit show 
 i walked up to the house and i thought i saw fred at his computer in the front window he <unk> has his front door unlocked and the door handle is broken it 's very hard to open sometimes 
 i shut the door behind me and look into the living room where i believed he was sitting well no one was there 
 at the same time a door closes up stairs 
 i moved toward the bottom of the stairs and look up to find myself staring at a floating dick in the dark 
 my situation is me standing in fred 's house with a mysterious wiener staring me down from upstairs 
 nothing moves for a solid minute just awkward wiener staring and trying to break down what i walked into 
 after all that the wiener just takes off after me down the steps 
 instantly i turn around for the door but the door handle is n't working properly and i 'm stuck trying to get out of the house 
 by some dumb luck the door opens and i 'm sprinting towards my car a bit down the street 
 i look behind me while running to his fred 's dad chasing me with no clothes on i stay focused to my <unk> and turn to my objective 
 the car was half a block away 
 the only thing i heard was this guys johnson smacking his thighs as he ran could n't help but laugh uncontrollably as i got into my car and started it 
 fred 's dad still <unk> ass i start my car and shift it into drive 
 before i could step on the gas i look to my left and see his dick all over my side mirror and window as well as him hitting the top of my car 
 drove home and never told fred of what went on 
 he did tell me that someone broke into his house though 
 tl dr went to a buddies house at 3 a.m got chased by a naked guy 
 it actually happened a year ago 
 my friend a lady from and old italian family who works for theaters in <unk> posts the following status on fb : <unk> is an entire population in my head and i do n't know who i shall listen to 
 i comment below <unk> to the old skank she 'll always tell you the truth and go to bed 
 apparently her very <unk> mother had commented seconds before me suggesting a selected <unk> of the people in her head 
 my comment appeared like i was inviting my friend to listen to her mother an old skank who always tells the truth 
 the mother was n't <unk> today i was talking to this girl i like 
 and was trying my hand at flirting 
 it was going pretty well and i said i 'm sure you make all guys feel this way '' 
 she got pretty defensive after that and told me i made her feel like a slut 
 anyways the conversation went back to normal and then she said <unk> you 're not a slut '' you bitch 
 at that point my brain stopped working and i did not even <unk> the not in her sentence and replied back to her you 're not just any slut 
 you 're my slut '' 
 have n't heard back since ... gg get <unk> 
 edit 1 : holy fuck this blew up 
 well i guess i am pretty retarded hahaha 
 slut '' texted me a couple hours after the incident and all order has been restored 
 i 'm glad i could entertain you guys with my stupidity this <unk> this actually happened today i know never happened before on this sub 
 but anyway were gon na need some context 
 so i live in a pretty nice apartment building with a roommate lets call him tim 
 i met my girlfriend because a few years ago she moved into the apartment next door 
 lets call her hannah 
 anyway 
 i 'm on the couch in the living room this morning when i 'm eating a tub of ice cream 
 no shame really just going to town on it 
 i dont ever tell hannah when i have ice cream because the moment she finds out its in my freezer i have about t minus four seconds until it 's gone 
 tim and i have this kind of running joke about the fact that we do n't tell our girlfriends about the ice cream we have because we do n't want them getting <unk> 
 now mind you neither of them are fat at all we just dont want to share the ice cream 
 so i have about a quarter of the container left when tim yells hey op dont you think hannah would appreciate it if you shared some of your ice cream with her '' so naturally my response was if i give hannah one more bite of ice cream she 's going to be a clone of <unk> <unk> so i 'm gon na <unk> this for her sake '' 
 see here 's where i fucked up 
 hannah was in her bathroom when i said this 
 and her bathroom shares a wall with my living room 
 so she heard every word of that 
 now i didnt know she was in there 
 but i assume she must 've already been in there an hour because it took about twenty seconds for her to knock on my door and we all know women ca n't pass throw the door of a bathroom twice in the same hour 
 so anyways 
 hannah knocks on my door 
 immediately i knew she had heard that 
 the look on her face was not anger it was just blank 
 so what did i do 
 i offered her the ice cream you know because i 'm a dumb ass 
 so she takes the ice cream and as if she briefly became <unk> by michael jordan launches it across my living room and <unk> it right into the trash can 
 at this moment i thought one of two things was about to happen 
 either my girlfriend was about to use the remaining magic spells she had left to <unk> me down like <unk> cutting down <unk> parents 
 or i was about to do a really poor job explaining what i just said 
 sadly despite the incredible shot hannah was not really a wizard and i had explanations to give 
 so while i 'm fumbling over my words tim looks this girl in the eye and said to her op makes jokes about your weight to me so that i will feel better about never having a girlfriend as pretty as you '' 
 i dont know what <unk> this guy was using but hannah looks at me and says <unk> you really think i 'm that pretty 
 tl dr my roommate is the greatest bro of all time 
 my girlfriend is probably a little slow 
 edit : we have reached the magical land known as the front page 
 i didnt know reaching this place was possible for mere <unk> but here we are and it could n't have happened without you guys edit2 : gold 
 youre the best internet stranger edit3 : tim is not black 
 tim is the most pasty white person to ever walk the earth edit4 : tim is not a redditor but i sent him the link to let him know he was the internet 's white knight of the day 
 he had two things to say why did you say lets call them tim and hannah when that 's our real names '' 
 and that <unk> was definitely onto something and we 're going to show hannah this and see what happens 
 should it end up being funny i 'll make another post about it but not until tomorrow monday is chinese food night and it 's hannah 's turn to buy so there 's no way i 'm risking that 
 edit5 : guys the joke was that i was going to town on a tub of ice cream and hannah was the fat one 
 we seem to be missing this crucial piece of evidence so i would like to point it out 
 final edit : i swear its the last one okay so i got home from work a few minutes ago and as soon as i got back hannah knocked on my door 
 she looked really worried and my first reaction was okay shes trying to get me back do n't buy into it '' 
 so i ask her whats wrong and she reaches into her pocket and pulls out a pregnancy test 
 what is this '' 
 its my new ipad what the fuck do you think it is '' 
 theres two lines on it so she shows me on the thing it comes with that this means positive 
 so i 'm freaking out and ask her what the hell we do 
 she tells me she already called her parents and they were pretty happy about it but shes still really nervous 
 okay ... yeah 
 i can call my mom 
 except that my mom is incredibly religious 
 i could tell my dad but he would make me call my mom and tell her where as my mom will at least tell my dad 
 okay one call is better than two 
 hey mom it 's op i 'm calling with news '' yeah what 's up '' 
 well uhhhhh hannah is pregnant '' ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... i said hannah <unk> '' yes i heard you '' 
 so uhhh i 'm gon na be a dad '' 
 that 's ... .. exciting '' yeah 
 so you 're gon na be a grandma '' 
 yes honey i ... i realize this '' 
 <unk> i guess that 's it '' alright i will i will talk to you later '' i hang up the phone and hannah bursts out laughing 
 what the fuck was so funny about that 
 oh i had a girl pee on it at lunch today '' you had a pregnant girl pee on a stick so i would call my mom to tell her you were pregnant '' no i never thought you would call your mom and tell her that was all you '' tl dr again i know i 'm sorry girlfriend got me back big time 
 admitted to my religious mom i have pre marital sex 
 not going to really be a dad 
 oh well i guess i deserved that <unk> having another redditor find it 
 you forgot your phone at 7 eleven and you can meet me here at 2:30 to get it 
 i ca n't think of another way of contacting you due to your only two contacts being pizza '' and free ride '' 
 you are now <unk> to some *ahem* long and hard subreddits and i hope you enjoy that 
 i also took a selfie with the cool cashier so that will be in your photos and as your wallpaper 
 edit : just 40 minutes till i meet imelted at 7/11 
 hopefully he saw this edit 2 : 20 minutes 
 also everyone keeps wanting me to post the picture of me and the cashier but i really like to keep my identity to myself 
 it will be up to imelted if he wants to post a picture of him and the phone if he sees this and meets up with me but i 'd prefer to keep my face to myself 
 edit 3 : using up all this guy 's battery posting : edit 4 : tried calling pizza '' and it is a dead line edit 5 : 2:30 ... no sign of imelted but i 'll stay for a half an hour 
 i 'm gon na shut off his phone due to 10 percent battery so no updates 
 if he does n't show up by 3:00 i 'll kick it back on and update you all edit 6 : holy shit i just got my phone back from the guy at seven eleven 
 he told me to not use his name on reddit so i will keep referring to him as guy '' 
 so before i do anything else i would like to explain why my contacts are only free ride '' and pizza '' 
 free ride is my mom just like the one comment he put said 
 i really am surprised that the guy did n't try and call free ride and i 'm not sure his logic in not calling it but i did n't ask 
 the contact pizza is <unk> 's pizza so i have no idea why it was a dead line for the guy 
 i only have 2 contacts because i just bought this phone about a week ago and the guy at my <unk> forgot to change over my contacts from my old phone so i 've just kept with my 2 needed contacts yes pizza is needed until i can go back to the store and get them to transfer them 
 i found out about this post by after freaking out that i just lost my new phone checking reddit during my computer class at school 
 i logged in and saw i had a lot of messages that lead me to this post 
 we only have 1 seven eleven near us so i knew that was the one he was referring to 
 i will try and answer any other questions you all may have 
 i am just really <unk> that this guy did not just run away with my new phone and leave me screwed - he went the extra mile to meet me at seven eleven and i am really thankful for that 
 i am home now and i will show you a picture of my phone sorry i removed the background at his request and i added a <unk> 
 picture ps : fuck <unk> not today-today but this is the first day i could write 
 so for christmas i got my son a swiss army knife along with a couple of other things 
 he wanted a butterfly knife but i had <unk> ... for a good reason 
 i gave him the standard this is not a toy '' lecture and made him watch the <unk> where <unk> gets a knife the 10 do 's and 500 don'ts of knife safety 
 five minutes after lecturing him i 'm attempting to put together my youngest son 's <unk> big wheel when i come across some pieces held together by a zip tie 
 i grab that trusty swiss army knife and while again lecturing my son i place the biggest blade to those plastic <unk> of satan 
 not realizing how sharp the knife was i apply the <unk> amount of pressure and like a hot knife through butter the blade cuts through the zip <unk> plastic wrapping my children 's respect for me and <unk> into the hand holding those bastard parts 
 the only thing that stops the blade is the hard bone it dug into 
 i immediately apply pressure my 3 yo is screaming at the sight of blood gushing onto his new toy my wife is on the verge of <unk> and my daughter is <unk> on her new <unk> right next to that bloody blade 
 i shout at my oldest to get the knife get the knife '' 
 he 's panicked does n't know what to do picks it up and closes it on his <unk> finger efficiently slicing it 
 he 's screaming wife is done daughter is oblivious and youngest has successfully moved on to playing with his new star lord toy 
 tldr : the only two mexicans on the planet who do n't know how to handle a knife 
 edit 1 : i 've been narrated 
 edit 2 : because so many people are making the comment the knife was for my 11 year old son 
 my 3 yo is whose gift i was attempting to assemble when i forever lost my children 's respect and admiration 
 edit 3 : i made the front page 
 i love all of you 
 edit 4 : proof : edit 5 : thanks for the gold not today never today 
 this was roughly 10 years ago however it is my biggest fu in high school 
 on my first day of high school we had physical education 10 for our first block 
 what a amazing way to start off the semester our school split up the classes so only males participated together and same with girls because of this there were two separate gyms in the school which we referred to as gym '' and small gym '' 
 in order to get to the small gym from the locker room you had to travel through the gym 
 now seeing as this was the first day of classes naturally we played dodge ball 
 i am truly competitive at sports and it is a burden sometimes but i do n't like to lose or take it easy on people 
 now while we were playing dodge ball a classmate of mine named anthony was destroying us 
 i knew him from the basketball team and he was a natural athlete he actually plays in the <unk> now 
 so naturally at the beginning of each round i specifically sought to hit him square in the face to make him fall on his ass in front of the entire school alas anthony would live to see the day unfold 
 the class was near ending and i was n't going to let anthony continue to embarrass our team no matter how much skill he had 
 <unk> the end of the round the girls had finished up their class and were coming up from the small gym to go to the locker room 
 now for some reason the girls decided to run across the middle of the court instead of simply walking around the ends of the gym as if it were some kind of game to not get hit by the dodge balls completely not seeing this starting to happen at all because of my blood lust i saw my opportunity 
 anthony was just running up to the midway point to throw with his back toward me perfect i thought 
 his mortal life ends now 
 i used every muscle in my body and ran towards the mid way point <unk> my head back like a <unk> <unk> i threw the ball with all my might anthony was <unk> 
 as i was watching the ball leave my hand i saw from the corner of my eye a girl who had already started running across the court 
 it was too late 
 i unknowingly had set this girls fate and <unk> her to the shadow <unk> 
 when the ball hit her dead square in the face the result of the momentum from the ball knocked her backwards to where she hit the floor face first 
 <unk> you could not hear a single thing it seemed like the entire world had stopped for a moment of silence for this poor girl 
 her friends rushed over to her in fear of her death only to find here laying on the ground sobbing in tears while literally everyone else in the gym including the teachers stood there silently 
 she stood up with the assistance of her friends and ran out of the gym crying 
 <unk> your an asshole <unk> jokingly says my friend in the background 
 it was n't surprising that in my second block that i got called into the office but i was not in trouble 
 i told my side of the story and from my gym teachers it was roughly the same as we believed it was her fault 
 i apologized at the principals request and she never talked to me again 
 tldr : hit girl in face with dodge ball made her cry and go home on her first day of high school 
 seriously read the post 
 edit : this blew up i 'll fix some spelling mistakes when i get home 
 thanks for reddit gold although i have no idea what it does 
 inbox me some pictures of cats please 
 i 'll do my best to answer questions and <unk> : some people have been sending videos of cats you misunderstood i want pictures of cats your moving pictures <unk> and scare me 
 faq : did this really happen 
 : of course who was anthony 
 : what school did you go to 
 : one in <unk> if you went to my school you would know who anthony was 
 how did you hit her in the face and her land on her face : what is the meaning of life 
 : good question i would have the say the most important thing in life is that i 'll make this very short 
 being the cool dude i am i try my best to entertain my brother with autism 
 one thing he really enjoys is me reading tifu 's to him or other threads but his favorite thing are the comments 
 he <unk> the comments 
 so.. if most of you have n't caught on by now loads of people have realized that when in an awkward situation peeing everywhere <unk> dominance and makes you alpha as fuck 
 well 
 today my brother while in school was scalded for not listening to his teacher who repeatedly told him to stop breaking the <unk> off his pencil so he could just <unk> it again 
 he casually said 'i 'm the dominant person mr. <unk> dropped his drawers and urinated all down the cabinets and onto <unk> of graded tests and medical forms for an upcoming field trip 
 immediately blames me for teaching him how to be <unk> and i get my lunch breaks taken away from me for 2 weeks 
 fml 
 edit : let 's clear some stuff up 
 -my brother is actually a very smart kid just he does n't understand certain concepts 
 he thinks very differently than the normal person 
 -i mean that i lost the ability to eat with all my mates in the cafeteria and i eat it in the detention room 
 -i got in trouble because 'i was training him to blatantly disobey 
 ... <unk> way dick <unk> thousand people agree with me that pissing on your papers is in fact a boss ass move and he deserves to be alpha male 
 i can read what i want to my brother 
 -my dad laughed so hard when i explained the situation to him and agrees that x is the man for once this actually happened today 
 i work for a small <unk> company we only have a handful of employees 
 this morning i was driving to the airport and was on the phone with my colleague let 's call him jesus for shits and giggles 
 anyway due to the small size of the company we 're all very informal with each other and jesus and i get on quite well 
 we go for beers together out of hours and have a good time 
 it 's nice to get on with colleagues and actually be able to call them friends as well 
 as i was saying we were on the phone when i needed to pop into a petrol station to get fuel for my car 
 i told him that i needed to go because of this 
 he said ok and started to end the conversation 
 at this point my wife called 
 yep 
 i 'm a straight male as is my colleague jesus 
 anyhoo as i look at my screen which is telling me that my wife is trying to call me and while simultaneously ending this call with jesus my brain decides to go into end call with wife mode '' and i hear myself saying '' speak later love you ... '' to which jesus replies wtf ... <unk> '' i call myself stupid fill up the car then call the wife back explaining to her what i just said to jesus 
 she laughs and tells me to call him back and apologise 
 so less than ten minutes after shaking with jesus earlier i do ... and our office manager answers the phone i ask to speak to jesus and just before she puts me through she says speak later love you ... '' i get through to jesus and he 's laughing about it all 
 i apologise profusely but i realise at this point that it 's all around the office already and from now on all calls will be ended with speak later love you '' ... edit : some people seem to think he 's actually called jesus 
 edit 2 : some people still think his real name is jesus 
 i think he found me 
 i 'll find out when i speak to him in the morning 
 and some fucker has gone through my comment history replying speak later love you '' to everything 
 rip in peace my inbox 
 edit 3. shaking 
 should be talking 
 stupid <unk> 
 it took over 12 hours for that to get noticed 
 edit 4 : he just called and played that stevie wonder hit down the phone at me 
 then hung up 
 i do love the guys i work with 
 like the majority of stories here this did n't happen today 
 here it goes 
 my cousin has a cabin right next to our house and every once in a while him and his family would come to visit the cabin and we would hang out 
 my mom had this old creepy babydoll that looked like it had the soul sucked out from it so we thought it would be funny to prank his dad with it 
 we found a broom and tied the baby to the end of it so we could lift the baby up to the living room window 
 now it looked like this <unk> babydoll was hanging in the air by nothing 
 this would surely scare his dad 
 or so we thought ... we left it there overnight and the next day we went over to their cabin to hear what their reaction was 
 apparently they had visitors with them who were the first people to wake up 
 now this seems like a pretty harmless prank but the fuck-up was that the family had a <unk> and now the first thing he wakes up to see is a <unk> floating baby hanging in front of the window 
 he apparently had to take <unk> to calm down 
 we felt pretty shit <unk> i 'm an easy going <unk> 
 i let guests and their partners stay at my house as they wish 
 i let them <unk> the house however they may ... but that stops today 
 i let two stay over and they arrived when i was at work 
 when i came home they were in my room and i kindly escorted them to the guest room 
 i rarely ever saw the two they 'd typically be in the room or <unk> for food 
 what i was n't really expecting was for them to partake in some shower sexy time 
 i 've been going to the gym 5 days a week so i use their showers 
 weekends are cardio days so i run to work and shower there 
 my guests left after a week and i decided to take a day off from the gym to clean the house 
 and then came the glorious moment of showering in my own shower 
 the steamy water massaging jets <unk> soap ... and my loofah 
 it has been at my house waiting for weeks for me to <unk> it up 
 without hesitation i load it up with soap and lather away 
 it takes me moments to realize something is n't right 
 babies 
 little baby <unk> all over my torso upper body and right arm 
 drowning ... hopeless disgusting 8 <unk> freaks 
 mashed up mangled and dispersed on my skin 
 why i ever let the <unk> <unk> spiders stay in my house is beyond me now 
 fuck yo <unk> system fuck yo choice of nesting and apparently fuck my <unk> 
 tl dr : do n't actually have friends 
 spiders were the guest 
 let spider guests stay in my home loaded egg in fluffy loofah ended up with spider babies on <unk> this did n't happen to me today but about a week ago 
 let me set the stage a little bit for those who do n't know about video games 
 a squeaker is what we in the gaming world like to call a young male who has yet to hit puberty but still likes to <unk> describe the sex he had with your mom 
 he also loves to rage and yell obscenities that i am <unk> someone this young knows their meaning or even their existence 
 now the fuck up ... i was playing black ops 2 and the day had not been going well 
 in an attempt to unwind i decided to fire up the trusty ol <unk> and play a few rounds 
 one of these little fucks was in the very first match 
 right from the get go he was full-blown raging 
 and i do n't mean the oh fuck you '' rage i mean the stand up yell throw shit rage 
 well about 2 rounds in his parents must have came home because he suddenly stated whispering his threats and insults and his various your mom '' jokes 
 i decided to get him back 
 i first started by annoying him in every possible way 
 once he was sufficiently annoyed enough that he was back at a half whisper half shout i stared giving him ever opportunity to use the your mom '' insult 
 well at some point he finally got so fed up with my shit that he lost control and went on a full tirade about how he fucked my mom and anal and blah blah 
 well in about <unk> seconds his dad comes racing down or up the stairs and starts unloading on the kid 
 i mean the poor guy i almost felt bad for him 
 i convinced myself that the little <unk> deserved it 
 that was until i heard his dad drop the you 're adopted part ... in his full rage and fight with his kid the dad said your opinion does n't even matter because you were adopted '' 
 this was obviously the first time the kid had heard this because right after the dad said this there was complete silence 
 i then heard the mom yell from wherever she was for the kids dad to come back and talk to her 
 i exited the lobby after 5 mins of complete silence minus the kid bawling his eyes out ... tl dr : you 're adopted edit 1 : thanks for the responses 
 as many of you have suggested i will probably be posting this in <unk> soon but as i am currently at a funeral with hardly any cell service so it wo n't be for a little while 
 edit 2 : many of you are suggesting that this story is fake 
 and to those people i apologize that i have no video to go with this but i assure you that this actually happened 
 edit 3 : thanks random stranger for the gold 
 and to anyone who still does n't believe me then you have n't played any or enough cod to know the <unk> of these squeakers 
 anybody who actually plays will know that this is entirely possible 
 edit 4 : as this happened a week ago i do n't remember how the your adopted part came out but i seem to remember it being something along those lines 
 and as for the mic not being able to pic those sounds up yes if it was a headset but i believe it was a playstation eye because i could hear his game echoing in his mic as well 
 edit 5 : <unk> parents are from south korea but i was born in the united states 
 last week i got to visit my native land for the first time 
 my grandmother who still lives there with other family thought that at age 16 i was <unk> <unk> to see where i came from 
 she’s always encouraging me to get in touch with my roots because i’m sadly what <unk> of the <unk> calls a banana '' 
 yellow on the outside white inside 
 she took us out and encouraged us to eat a lot of south korean foods i’d never tried 
 some were delicious others i pretended to like as they secretly repulsed my <unk> <unk> 
 one dish that especially turned my stomach was the sannakji a whole tiny <unk> legs cut off and served alive 
 not wanting to upset grandmother i gave it a try 
 it was kind of bland but not horrible 
 wait no here came one little surprise for me : the legs may have been <unk> but they can still attack 
 the suction cups grabbed hold of my cheeks like there was no tomorrow and i would’ve choked if my father hadn’t reached in my mouth and yanked the things out 
 thank god it didn’t get all the way into my throat 
 the dangers of this dish are apparently well known with people being encouraged to chew it thoroughly but a dumb american girl like me was totally ignorant to this 
 an internet search tells me that six people a year die from eating sannakji 
 there’s a warning label on my shampoo but not on this thing 
 let me just say as a young asian woman i did not want to be remembered for getting killed by a <unk> <unk> happened about 90 minutes ago ... and yeah 
 so my mom has been <unk> her backyard and my wife and i have been helping out 
 well we 're wrapping up for the evening and my mom asks me to move this big black rolled up plastic whatever it is that is basically a big black tube 
 so i pick it up by one end and this <unk> fucking spider is underneath and proceeds to dash toward me 
 naturally like any grown man i dropped the tube and screamed like a little girl 
 and <unk> face eater thought it would be a good idea to take up residence inside the giant tube 
 well like all spiders this bastard needed to die 
 being the genius i am i grabbed a can of mosquito <unk> and a lighter 
 i proceeded to <unk> the inside of the tube 
 well ... it did n't work as intended 
 not only did the plastic tube <unk> catch fire but a giant pissed off spider that is covered in flames darted out of the tube toward my face 
 i proceeded to run and scream like a little girl as a flaming spider chased me like some bad horror movie 
 my wife thought it was hilarious my mom was annoyed i destroyed her plastic thing and i never found the dead spider 
 so ... somewhere out there is a pissed off horribly <unk> giant spider with a grudge 
 i may have created a super villain 
 edit : well this got bigger than expected 
 i guess i will answer some stuff up here 
 the spider was a large brown spider maybe and inch or so big 
 so giant 
 also that fucker was fast 
 the plastic tube was some rolled up garden mesh stuff 
 yes i sprayed fire at plastic ... i never claimed to be intelligent 
 my genius comment was sarcasm 
 i dunno if the spider was ever actually on fire 
 but everything else was it darted right towards me i dropped everything and ran like a true man 
 yes i really screamed like a little girl 
 spiders suck 
 no i am not in <unk> i decided to scare my boyfriend 
 i wanted to get revenge for the amount of times he has jumped out on me wearing one of those <unk> terrifying guy fawkes masks 
 he had just started a new job and i was home alone 
 i found the mask and put it beside me ready to put it on just as i heard him coming up the corridor 
 i hadn’t really planned much further ahead than that to be honest 
 several people came in and out of the building and i had no way of knowing whether or not it was him so i was repeatedly putting the mask <unk> <unk> and taking it off 
 after about 10 times i decided i’d just keep it on and put up with it until he got home 
 so i sat there with the mask on for a few minutes and couldn’t stop laughing about his imminent reaction 
 i ended up needing the toilet 
 for obvious reasons i decided it would be best if i went before he came through the door 
 so i <unk> off to the bathroom 
 our light is attached to the fan and not wanting to alert him to the fact i was home i decided to turn on the silent hallway light instead 
 the light came through the <unk> window in the door so i could just about see what i was doing 
 when i was done i approached the sink to wash my hands 
 out of habit i looked up to see myself in the mirror and was greeted by a <unk> lit grinning guy fawkes mask that i had momentarily but completely forgotten about 
 in sheer terror i screamed fell backwards and almost knocked myself out on the wall before scrabbling to escape from the <unk> <unk> making it all the way back to the living room before realising exactly what i had done 
 he got home 10 minutes later 
 i’ve not tried scaring him since 
 tl dr : i tried to scare my boyfriend with a guy fawkes mask and ended up terrifying myself instead 
 -- edit : i 'm having the best time reading through the comments and <unk> at myself 
 here are some answers to some of the questions 
 how did i forget i was wearing the mask 
 short answer i 'm just that kind of person 
 but <unk> i do n't know it was weird 
 i usually wear glasses so i 'm used to stuff being on my face and i guess the bathroom was dark 
 i was also thinking more about how hilarious it was going to be for me than how terrified he would be 
 why is the guy fawkes mask scary 
 i find the guy fawkes mask the <unk> out of all the masks i 've come across and it only has to be left on a table for it to upset me 
 it 's <unk> to me than <unk> faces <unk> faces or any of that supposedly creepy stuff 
 v for <unk> is an amazing film but it gives me the creeps for days 
 needless to say i do n't watch horror films 
 i also do n't like being home alone 
 how did it take so long to realise 
 i 'm in a little flat so it only really took about 10 seconds for me to get out of the bathroom and into the living room 
 i know it 's still a ridiculous amount of time but it was n't 10 minutes before i realised 
 did i tell my boyfriend what had happened 
 i was still trying to recover when he came in the door going from trying to breathe to laughing at myself 
 so i could n't really get away from telling him the story and getting laughed at 
 why do i shut the bathroom door when i 'm home alone 
 the door is on one of those hinges that automatically swing shut 
 i have a <unk> but it 's <unk> and i was <unk> our <unk> meeting an upcoming <unk> leave was announced 
 we <unk> onto the topic of waters breaking 
 another colleague explained that when she used to work as a bartender a lady 's waters broke 
 fortunately this had occurred in the beer garden outside area of the <unk> 
 we asked how she cleaned it up she said it was just left as is due to the fact it occurred outside on a patio area 
 <unk> the area down was suggested but she shook her head and said it was fine to leave it alone 
 at this point i stupidly said and that 's how you get ants '' 
 no one watches archer except me my colleagues all think i was being <unk> 
 tldr : <unk> archer when discussing waters breaking 
 except no one realised i was quoting they think i crossed the <unk> burned my dick 
 edit : automoderator said my post was too short so i 'll add some dialogue 
 bacon : sizzle sizzle pop pop 
 me : ouch ouch no 
 my penis <unk> ow ow ow 
 bacon : sizzle sizzle <unk> it 's pretty much a half of my life '' fuck up 
 i do all the cooking at home and i love it 
 but i 'd always been frustrated that whenever i made rice it always came out in sticky clumps never the lovely fluffy clouds that i wanted 
 why 
 i never rinsed the rice <unk> beforehand 
 just last weekend i finally did this and <unk> : a bowl of fluffy delicious rice that does n't have the texture of freshly mixed <unk> 
 yep i 've been making shitty rice for almost four edit : three decades until i finally realized that i should probably follow the directions 
 5 extra minutes of extremely easy prep and i was too fucking lazy to bother 
 damn i 'm dumb 
 and stubborn 
 and lazy 
 better late than never i guess 
 edit 1 : i should have clarified that i usually on buy <unk> or <unk> rice from trader joe 's 
 do n't know how much of a difference <unk> would make with other kinds 
 btw it should be about thirty years 
 yeah i ca n't tell time either 
 i 'll be forty six in july 
 edit 2 : holy crap 
 front page 
 what a great feeling to know that such horrendous <unk> <unk> for decades could <unk> such <unk> <unk> 
 i feel like patrick star 
 my dad and my six-year-old sister often have playful fights '' about who my mom likes better 
 it 's kinda stupid but she 's a kid so whatever 
 i was home for new years and i hear my sister and dad at it again jokingly making up silly ways why mom likes either of them better 
 it usually goes along these lines : sister : mom likes me better 
 dad : <unk> she made me bacon for breakfast 
 sister : well she let me insert activity fun for a kid dad : yeah well she let me one ups my sister playfully eventually they moved into the living room where i was sitting and i hear my sister say to my dad : well i 'm so close with mom i 've been <unk> her referring to being in her womb as a baby '' to which i stupidly interjected : yeah well so has dad '' 
 she looked really confused as if actually contemplating the idea that my mom had birthed my dad 
 to clear that up and prevent further <unk> today my six-year-old sister learned about sex.allow me to set the background for this tale 
 it was my best pals 22nd birthday on the <unk> of december 
 he decided he wanted to suit up and hit up glasgow visit a casino and do a pub crawl 
 by the time we got back to the train home the party of about 10 of us including his sister and dad are all pretty drunk 
 we all take seats that are just next to the toilet 
 the toilet has a sliding door in a quarter circle shape that automatically slides open and shut by a set of two buttons on each side of the door 
 the door is also visible all the way down the train carriage which is packed with people just as merry as we were that night 
 anyway being the wee annoying drunk dick i am whenever one of us went up to use the toilet just as the door is about to slide fully shut i would press the open '' button adding to the <unk> drunken banter of the night the set of buttons is just by my head at the seat i 'm sitting in obviously once the door is fully closed it can be locked from the inside 
 so this <unk> carries on for a while even with just random folk on the train until the game changes completely 
 a tiny little old woman with a walking stick comes <unk> up the carriage a poster child for <unk> and makes for the toilet 
 those of the squad that was standing politely move out way 
 this is sadly the only courtesy she 's going to get 
 she slides the door shut and normal conversation <unk> 
 maybe a couple minutes go by and note to my friends that <unk> sign is still lit and she has n't locked the door and in all honesty said should probably make sure nobody opens that '' but alas at that moment i seen a shiny black object in my peripheral heading for my head i turned around to only see my friends well <unk> black shoe stop short of my ear but hit <unk> on the open '' button 
 things are in <unk> i look round at my pal who has just done this terrible deed with a shit eating grin on his face and back round to see the door slide open to reveal a old woman pants around her ankles taking a shite in full view of the entire train carriage 
 like a dear in <unk> she <unk> for second and and then promptly closes the door 
 once the <unk> shock passed i tried to scold my pal i wanted to be angry at this point give him hell 
 what the fuck are you playing at mate '' 
 was supposed to come out in angry conviction but my voice cracked eventually there 's tears rolling down my face and everyone else is in hysterics apart from my friends dad who has fled in embarrassment 
 however things do n't end there 
 the woman was still on the john and things had calmed down a little when all of sudden this drunk old guy out his <unk> comically dressed in double <unk> came <unk> up non <unk> by us and before anyone could say <unk> here mate do n't bother pressing that bu ... '' the door <unk> open a revealing this woman on the bog a second time 
 this big guy shat himself figuratively shut the door and high <unk> it down the carriage in embarrassment 
 leaving the rest of in <unk> hysterics and guilt 
 before long she emerges from her cage of shame and walks by a group of young men suited in there sunday finest trying to unsuccessfully trying to stifle there laughter and rightly says in her glasgow accent yous lot should be damn ashamed of yourself '' which i feel like saying i was truly 
 but the comedic effect of a sliding door opening and revealing a old woman indisposed <unk> any <unk> of decency i had 
 but the story does n't end there a short while passes and the woman returns this time with company could be daughter or <unk> 
 the old woman once again returns to the toilet while her friend makes the shape of a angry star fish outside the door protecting protecting this old woman 's last few scraps of dignity who upon entering the bog again has repeated her fatal error 
 now this woman is <unk> with rage giving everyone an <unk> and threatening police action against all of us and anyone else down the carriage that is laughing 
 i 'm still holding back tears of laughter as are my companions 
 all eyes on the train are on this woman as she goes on tirade that we are <unk> against her old disabled friend 
 to which the actual first offender replied 
 mate it would be discrimination if we <unk> fuckin laugh at her and plus it 's not our fault she has n't locked the door in the first fuckin place '' she replied with of course she has fucking locked the door 
 look '' 
 and with the conviction that only a pissed middle-aged woman can muster she battered the open button with the side of her fist 
 once again revealing this poor old indisposed woman sitting on the bog for the third time 
 oh for fuck sake <unk> '' the middle-aged woman shouts at her poor old friend 
 you said you fuckin locked it '' 
 the train erupts at this point 
 i do n't think i 've ever cried with laughter harder in my life 
 the final blow is dealt the hangover after that night was ridiculous 
 the whole day after i was convinced i might be some horrible <unk> <unk> monster but having told the story a few times now it 's never failed to make folk laugh 
 so i 'd thought i 'd share it with you guys tl dr. laughed at poor old woman caught indisposed 3 times obligatory happened a few years ago 
 i 'd just gotten married and i had one final semester of college left 
 my advisor recommended that i take an online course called electronic <unk> '' 
 it was actually really awesome 
 we made <unk> files and uploaded them to <unk> and made huge <unk> charts 
 one assignment required us to match a phony list of 5,000 ip addresses to a phony list of like 10 child pornography ip addresses to see if a certain employee at our company was watching it at work 
 i downloaded the assignment an excel file with two separate sheets as child porn ip addresses '' 
 i left it on the desktop and left for work before my wife got home 
 while at work i get a text telling me that we really need to talk about something as soon as i get home 
 i get home and my wife has a list that she believes to be 5,000 ip addresses for child porn <unk> 
 she 'd been very upset the entire night but had n't actually checked any of the <unk> 
 i explained it and things were okay but she deeply regretted marrying me for a short time 
 tl dr : i was trying to get through college to get a degree but my wife thought i was more interested in going to elementary school 
 reddit i love you and all but you made me fuck up bad 
 i 've been a lurker for quite some time but i 've got nothing else to do and i figured this story was too good to pass up 
 **the story : ** i work in an older office building and occasionally have to answer the calls of mother nature 
 <unk> at work was n't great until to weeks ago when i finally got a smartphone 
 i started browsing reddit on the can as soon as i got it and at work i retreat to the hidden restroom stall in my building to do the deed 
 it 's private there and i 've spent upwards of 20 mins redditing when i was supposed to be working 
 today was a little different 
 the last few nights i 've been caught up in watching <unk> on netflix and have n't gotten much sleep 
 so today when i went for my end of shift poo '' i <unk> off a little while redditing 
 i finally woke up when a janitor <unk> or whatever is pc came in to clean '' 
 he knocked on the door and asked if anyone was still in here 
 of course too embarrassed to say i had been sleeping on the toilet for hours i quietly hid in my stall 
 he immediately left without cleaning the place i guess because it did n't have much traffic 
 i waited about five minutes to leave got up washed my hands and tried to leave 
 to my surprise the door was locked 
 apparently since my office building is really old and the bathroom i 'm in was n't always a bathroom the door had a lock on it that has to be locked daily 
 i 've tried everything i 'm on <unk> so as you can imagine there 's no service 
 i 've sent out some emails to my boss and <unk> ... but who checks their email after work anyway 
 so now all i have is reddit to entertain me until someone <unk> the door 
 edit 1 : i appreciate people trying to help 
 as you can imagine i do n't want to many people to know about this so i 'd like to avoid the fire dept or police 
 i also know i 'll be free tomorrow so its not like its a big rush 
 also i do n't have the phone number of any one with access so that 's out 
 i do n't want the police or anyone involved 
 edit 2 : i 'm going to try making calls see where it gets me 
 i 'll call the building maybe some coworkers 
 edit 3 : i 'm working on 26 % battery i charged it before i left my desk 
 i 'm fighting with imgur on my phone but i promise pics asap 
 i 'm working on plans for sleeping 
 i 've got some snacks in my bag 
 **here 's the lock 
 pretty standard stuff : ** **the view from my throne i 'm still not comfortable with an open stall door : ** <unk> the last edit : ** i finally called the building 
 i had to call 6 times before a security guard picked up 
 he 's on his way 
 thanks everyone for the support 
 **update : ** finally got out 
 the security guard was not as happy to see me as was him 
 he escorted me out of the building and i 'm going the fuck home 
 i might do an <unk> to explain everything if people are really that interested 
 i ca n't imagine they will be 
 so goodnight reddit thanks for being here with me 
 maybe i wo n't have to work <unk> is literally happening right now 
 like most of us i use the same really complicated password everywhere because i ca n't be bothered to have to remember multiple passwords 
 so as you can imagine this came back to bite me in the ass ... i got an email from steam saying that someone tried to log into my account from the middle of <unk> using my password 
 i was in a class when i got this email and knew that i did n't have any credit card information or anything on steam so the guy could n't screw me up too hard right 
 well yes and no 
 he did n't do anything on steam but did try to log into my facebook since it used the same password and email address 
 now i 'm in full freak out mode and change my password for facebook steam twitter my bank account and anything else i could think of off the top of my head 
 still a week after the initial steam login i get emails from random websites saying that someone logged in or tried to change passwords or whatever the hell else 
 tl dr do n't use the same password for all your accounts <unk> 's fuck up has roots about two weeks ago 
 i was walking around the upper part of my university 's campus and there was this <unk> club basically <unk> people to take condoms and if you do n't they purposely make you feel really uncomfortable 
 so because i learned through watching that you should not reject these condoms i took the 15 they offered me and tossed em in my backpack 
 now keep in mind that these are like pride condoms they have rainbows and <unk> <unk> wearing suspenders on the wrapper 
 ** today i was in my music theory class and near the end i needed my planner to write some upcoming assignments up 
 little did i know about 8 or 9 condoms were between the pages and stuck to the planner 
 i leaned over to my backpack grabbed the planner and yanked it out 
 sooner that i could react there was rainbow of <unk> condoms and shirtless <unk> gently <unk> across the room in a gesture of pure <unk> 
 <unk> : pulled my planner out of my back pack too fast 
 condoms condoms everywhere 
 **so here i am just got off work drinking a beer standing in this amazing hot shower and browsing reddit on my phone 
 my wife is asleep and refuses to wake up even though she promised to sex me up in the shower when i got home 
 she just walked in butt naked and slides the door open to step in and stops 
 are you really on your fucking phone 
 ... <unk> you on reddit '' 
 uhhhh ... 
 yes '' 
 she just turned around and walked back out 
 so here i am 
 enjoying my hot shower cold beer and browsing reddit 
 i hate you guys.so this happened two weeks ago but i 'm only getting out of the hospital yesterday 
 here goes with a throwaway cause you 'll see.. here i am day 6 the pipes are clogged not even gas is able to escape this 
 doctor on day 5 said to take some laxatives no effect the urge is great the pressure is extreme and the pain my god the pain 
 but he said whatever you do let it come naturally and do n't force you do n't want to hurt yourself 
 he also said go to the er if nothing after morning attempt so here i am morning after taking a ton of laxatives the doc gave me the day before still nothing except the laxatives overnight made things way worst i swear to god my stomach was twice it 's size and i felt like it was going to explode 
 so i 'm sitting on the can approaching hour 3 i felt a bit of movement and decided to push '' and low and behold after 15 minutes of pushing i get this huge relief 
 i finally had a crap 
 then came the spine chilling feeling my inards felt like ice my spine went numb my legs go numb 
 thinking i was just sitting there too long i go to wipe and i hit something 
 i stand up a bit to see something dangling from me 
 it was my colon 
 i forced my asshole right out of my body 
 freaked out by having a <unk> piece of asshole hanging out of me i called an ambulance and off to the hospital i went 
 i was in the hospital from new years eve until yesterday night 
 on new years day i seen my doctor who told me not to force 
 i told him what happened and he said that 's why i did n't want you to force you have a chance on big <unk> like that to <unk> parts of your intestines and it can come out with the poo 
 well shit 
 so here i am 3 operations later sitting on a <unk> for the next <unk> weeks shitting in a bag for the next 3. all because i forced when i should n't of 
 til : do n't force out a crap when you are extremely constipated you might shit out your own ass 
 tl dr : i shit out my own asshole 
 so lots of people are telling me my spelling is shit 
 it 's shit cause it 's my 3rd language and i do n't give two shits 
 please realize that some people in this world speak different languages before english 
 went to take a poop 
 everything was fine except it took some extra effort to get it out 
 went to wipe and noticed a decent amount of blood and no poop on the toilet paper 
 freaked me out because i 've heard this can be caused by <unk> cancer 
 looked down at the poop in the toilet no blood in it 
 really confused me 
 only thing i could think of was to set my phone on the bathroom sink <unk> up so i could take a video of my own ass hole 
 took the video did not see any blood anywhere 
 later on in the day i had accidentally left my phone sitting on a counter at work that is sort of a public gathering place 
 when i leave my phone <unk> it 's set to go to the lock screen 20 seconds after no activity 
 a co-worker of mine must have grabbed it right away and started looking through my phone 
 of course he goes to the picture section first which is also where the videos are located 
 starts playing the first video which is me showing my own ass hole to my own camera 
 from my desk area i hear a mixture of <unk> laughter and horrified <unk> 
 by the time i reached the public gathering space i saw my boss and three of my co-workers watching a video on a phone 
 <unk> i reached for my phone to make sure i had it and sure enough i did n't 
 my heart sank 
 the co-worker who went through my phone looks at me and says ha ha ha dude what the fuck is wrong with you '' 
 and my boss looks at him sort of confused 
 once my boss had realized what he was watching and that the phone did not belong to who was holding it he immediately called us both into his office 
 he fired my co-worker on the spot right in front of me 
 told him to pack his things and that he would be escorted out 
 when my co-worker left the room my boss looked at me and apologized for the invasion of privacy 
 i could tell he was trying to hold back all of his laughter questions etc 
 he told me to go on about my day as if nothing happened and that if the other two co-workers mentioned it he would put an end to it 
 i 'm assuming he wanted to get this over with quickly so that i would n't end up suing the company somehow for emotional damages or whatever 
 i actually explained to him what happened and he said something along the lines of well that 's more information than i wanted to know but that makes more sense than actually wanting to look at your own ass '' 
 we both kind of awkwardly laughed and went back to business 
 now i 'm wondering if that co-worker is going to post a tifu by looking through my co-workers phone '' 
 tl dr my co-workers think i 'm aroused by my own ass hole using a throwaway account for this 
 earlier this week i was in class preparing to do my history presentation in front of everyone 
 i already suffer from extreme stage fright and the idea of standing in a crowded room talking about the fucking <unk> war scared the shit out of me 
 when it was my turn to deliver my presentation i stood up and slowly walked to the top of the classroom holding tightly onto my <unk> to stop my hands from shaking uncontrollably 
 as soon as i turned around to face everyone there was a still silence followed by loud gasps and <unk> laughter 
 i thought it was due to something that happened at the back of the classroom that i missed out on 
 when the laughs and oh my fucking gods '' continued my teacher who was sitting at his desk behind me got really pissed and shouted at everyone to shut up threatening to kick out anyone who made a peep 
 still confused as hell as to what was happening i noticed my classmate 's faces turning bright red trying to <unk> their laughter 
 as soon as i started talking one boy burst out laughing which set everyone off again 
 this time the teacher got more pissed off than i had ever seen him and he ended up <unk> out of the class telling us that he 's not going to bother teaching us if we ca n't learn to behave 
 he then slammed the door behind him leaving me standing at the top of the class with my penis unknowingly exposed not knowing what to fucking do 
 i then heard one guy shout you 've got a lovely willy <unk> '' i looked down and saw my soft flaccid penis poking through the hole of my boxer shorts and out through my unzipped fly 
 the moment of realisation hit me like a ton of bricks and i thought i was going to pass out 
 i hurriedly put my penis back into my pants and everyone started <unk> and clapping 
 it really felt like i was in a nightmare and i am extremely overwhelmed and embarrassed by everything 
 i immediately ran out of the class and locked myself into a toilet cubicle 
 as soon as the coast was clear i ran home and have n't been to school since 
 tl dr doing a presentation in class - penis unknowingly exposed - social life ruined edit thanks everyone for your kind and helpful words 
 my facebook is full of comments from my friends who are worried about me not showing up to school 
 they are also <unk> me just to man up and laugh it off 
 the free willy t-shirt idea is definitely something i 'll consider too lol 
 i 'm going go back to school on monday mainly because the teacher is aware of what happened and im worried he 's going to ring my mom and tell her <unk> am still on his account and going to subscribe to every gay porn subreddit i can find 
 sorry kiddo love <unk> happened like two days ago and i 'm still not able to shake it off 
 i will try to keep this short but no <unk> 
 background first i am a <unk> teen 18 living in saudi <unk> 
 now it 's not well known but saudi <unk> are way more conservative than <unk> they 're ridiculously <unk> about their wives and have <unk> of males and females at events like <unk> and parties etc 
 my dad works here as an engineer and has befriended hell a lot of arabs while i am <unk> newer to the country and do n't know much about the culture 
 so on sunday my dad tells me about this dinner we 've to attend on his saudi friend 's place let 's call him <unk> 
 now i 've seen ahmed quite a few times and i know that he has a little daughter probably 3 year old named ayesha and son about 4 named ali 
 so fast forward to dinner 
 i 'm sitting along my dad 's colleagues all <unk> arabs they 're all speaking arabic probably talking about work while i am busy eating 
 also wondering where the little kids at 
 when suddenly ahmed in broken english ask me am i getting bored to which i reply no it 's great to meet you guys where 's ayesha though 
 is n't she the cutest '' 
 right after i said this literally everyone looks at me and they all stop chewing 
 ahmed starts shouting at my dad in arabic and i can tell he 's way too upset 
 he stands up and asks us to leave 
 i am thinking what the hell 
 turns out ayesha is his wife 's name not his daughter daughter 's name was <unk> 
 ahmed is still pissed at us and thinks i 'm some sort of <unk> <unk> who 's after his wife 
 tl dr confused names of wife and a kid in a conservative family got kicked <unk> last night i was in bed waiting for my wife to finish her before bed <unk> when my 8 year old daughter comes in for a good night hug and kiss 
 we get to talking and i use the line girls rule and boys drool '' cause she 's at that age where the boys at school think otherwise 
 the part where i messed up was at that exact moment i catch the eye of my 4 year old son who was also in the room and the look of pure defeat on his face was so depressing and his poor little soul crushed i thought maybe i scared him for life 
 in an attempt to bring back his manhood i had to tell him girls go to <unk> to get more <unk> and boys go to mars to get more candy bars 
 he likes candy so he probably wo n't be scarred for life 
 this was n't today but i 'm still living the consequences 
 a few days ago my girlfriend came over to my house and things got heated as they do 
 i decided to go down on her which i love to do and will put 110 % effort into because i enjoy it 
 <unk> enough she was enjoying it too and we were in a position in which she was sat on my face facing me whilst i licked her out and she rocked back and forth 
 what neither of us realised was that because she 'd shaved a couple of days ago she had a mass of sharp stubble that was protruding from her pubic mound 
 and every time she rocked forward and <unk> whilst applying a lot of pressure on me this was brushing against my face 
 now i 'm not gon na say it did n't hurt in the moment because it did but when you 're caught up in <unk> there 's little you want to worry about except getting your partner off so i kept going and this went on for maybe 10 or 15 minutes 
 i just ignored the pain because i was keen to let her enjoy herself and knew 
 i could deal with it 
 when i finally took my tongue out of the ham cabinet what became very apparent was the burning pain all over my lower face 
 we turned the lights on and the bottom portion of my face from my nose down was as red as a tomato like it had been painted with the blood of my <unk> 
 suddenly clarity of the situation came flooding in in the activities <unk> in i had given myself a severe friction burn that was both ridiculously painful and <unk> to anyone with a reasonable explanation 
 i mean how the fuck do you explain that 
 i felt like not leaving the house until it had healed but i still had my parents to make an excuse to and college and other <unk> 
 it was funny for her and she was laughing hysterically with <unk> sympathy but i was legitimately worried about how i was going to explain this without utter embarrassment 
 in the end i did the only thing i know the <unk> british thing to do ... i told everyone that i had spilled hot tea on my face my parents wanted to take me to a doctor just to check it out and make sure it was n't going to scar but i would n't let them otherwise they 'd realise it was a friction burn and not a liquid based splashy burn 
 this is 3 days later and it 's worse now skin slightly peeling and redness is just as bad as it was 
 hopefully it goes away within a week that seems to be the general consensus regarding first degree burns from my research 
 luckily no one has questioned my excuse 
 **tl dr : carpet munch carpet burn god save the queen 
 ** edit : not sure the comment i posted it in is ever gon na surface so i 'll chuck on an edit 
 this is a photo immediately after we realised what had happened it got more red and <unk> and painful but i 'm not in a good position to take a new picture atm 
 enjoy ... edit 2 : to the person who decided to <unk> me come forth for i wish to present you with your very own ham cabinet 
 pretty straight forward 
 about thirty minutes into a job interview of very mundane questions i start to zone out 
 i used to work in childcare on cruise ships but my last role was in an office similar to the new job i had applied for 
 interviewer asks : how did you find the transition from childcare to an office '' 
 i respond with yeah it was great really nice to get up and you know wear pants to work '' 
 cue 'oh shit face 
 i start to sweat profusely and proceed to make it worse 
 just to clarify i wore pants when playing with the children 
 i always had pants on '' 
 interviewers continue to stare <unk> 
 i just meant it was nice to dress up and go to a more professional environment '' 
 interviewers look at one another uncomfortably and proceed to end the interview shortly after 
 edit : guys 
 there 's two <unk> : pedophile and <unk> 
 i apparently chose neither 
 edit 2 : til i 'm really bad at spelling 
 to begin this did n't happen today or a few months ago 
 i was in the fourth grade <unk> <unk> 
 i 've never spoken about this since it happened but out there somewhere there are around 30 former 4th grade students who if asked can recall the horror on my face 
 it all began over the summer of <unk> we had taken a family trip to mammoth caves in kentucky 
 we had a great time <unk> the caves 
 my dad had taken with us a camcorder he had recently purchased and video taped many of the tours we went on 
 fast forward the summer and onto the school year 
 we were studying science at the time 
 different types of rocks and how they were formed if i recall correctly 
 the teacher told us that we were to have a show and tell of the different types of rocks that we were able to find around our neighborhood 
 naturally i <unk> all of the awesome rock formations i had seen at mammoth caves and asked if i could bring the video instead 
 excited to see some of the footage my teacher agreed 
 i went home and asked my mom and dad if i could share one of the tapes 
 they said i could and asked if i knew where they were 
 i said that i did 
 <unk> <unk> the tapes that were stored in their dresser drawer were n't footage of our family vacation 
 now let me <unk> a little before i get to the <unk> <unk> 
 i 'd like to add that i was a very curious kid 
 i would sneak into anywhere i could just to explore and see things 
 my parents room was one of the locations i would sneak into 
 thats how i knew that there were some camcorder tapes in their dresser 
 moving along i grabbed one of the camcorder tapes from the dresser 
 it was marked # 3. i think that i figured that it was labeled that way because my dad took several videos on the trip and i had never really seen him use the camcorder for anything else 
 being a 4th grader i had no idea that my parents would have used it to record *that* 
 so myself with video in my backpack went to school skipping happily not knowing the horror that was to come 
 show and tell day was finally here 
 i could n't wait to knock the socks off of everyone with my videos of <unk> and <unk> and cave rooms filled with <unk> <unk> 
 at last my turn was next 
 my teacher rolled the tv and vcr to the front of the room and announced that you are all in for a <unk> special treat '' 
 little did we all know that treat '' was in fact going to be special '' 
 she popped the video into the vcr and pressed play 
 i immediately recognized the room on the screen 
 huh thats odd '' i thought to myself 
 then in the corner of the screen appears my mom 
 luckily with all her bathing suit areas covered by lingerie 
 then dad ... <unk> god 
 hes in a <unk> 
 right then my teacher noticed what was happening and raced to the tv to shut it off before the class witnessed anything rated <unk> '' 
 10 seconds of footage that seemed to last an eternity we 're now burned into my memory along with the <unk> laughter of 30 10 year old kids 
 my teacher grabbed the tape and called me to the hallway 
 i was in tears 
 mortified 
 she asked me what the hell 
 i told her i had no idea that *that* was on the tape 
 she believed me and took the tape to the principal who called my parents 
 they told them that they had to go and pick up the tape and made me return to class 
 stepping back into the classroom was the single most embarassing thing that has ever happened to me 
 and i 'm 30 now 
 my parents never spoke of it 
 i 'm sure they figured the embarassment was <unk> enough 
 they never came to get the tape 
 i was <unk> for weeks 
 eventually people forgot and life returned to normal 
 hopefully you werent expecting to read that my whole class watched as my dad had explicit relations with my mom 
 not so sure i 'd be sharing if that were the case 
 tl dr took family vacation to mammoth caves dad took videos 
 i then took what i thought were those videos to class for show and tell ... <unk> out to be parent <unk> time lurker first time poster 
 this happened awhile back but it 's a pretty perfect story for tifu 
 a few years a go i had just finished going through a bad breakup with this <unk> of a girl 
 essentially i went home from college for my dad 's birthday and she decides to tell me that she had to sleep '' with someone else 
 the reason was that i was n't there to <unk> her '' for the 3 days in which i was away from my university town 
 anyway she called me while i was at home to tell me the news and i was devastated 
 my mum being the strange woman that she is decides that she 's going to invite me to an amateur fashion show so that hopefully i 'll meet a nice girl to eventually marry and have beautiful children with - i know 
 <unk> i run into this girl called sara who seems into me 
 we arrange a date for the next day and i thank my mum for the invitation 
 side note : my mother has caught some virus and feels ill. continuing the story : i go out with sara - and i am just on full form 
 i 'm charming witty and i 'm pretty quickly forgetting about the <unk> 
 so now we 've had about 8 drinks each and sara is a <unk> girl -- and i 'm pretty <unk> too 
 it gets to the point where she gives me this <unk> look and i just say let 's just get out of here and fuck '' 
 not my best line but she agrees 
 i mean we 're both pretty slaughtered by this point 
 it 's 2 a.m and we 're stumbling down the street 
 she even falls over she’s so drunk 
 after making sure she’s okay we walk to the taxi rank 
 i ask if we can go to hers and she demands that we go to mine - something about a <unk> roommate 
 forgive me on details - this was a long time a go 
 i 'm now in this awkward situation where i want to take this girl back to my parent 's place but i know they would not be cool with this 
 i decide fuck it - and we get a taxi back to my place 
 anyway we sneak in my parents are asleep and we quickly get to work 
 now i don’t mean to be rude but this girl moans 
 but not like a sexy moan i mean a kind of sleepy / slightly in pain moan 
 after making sure that she was still into it she was i continue 
 this is where things get bad 
 i hear a knock on my door 
 it’s my mum <unk> 
 james 
 is that you 
 are you ill ” 
 i respond in a strained voice <unk> mum i’m fine i was a bit ill but i’m feeling okay <unk> 
 my mum says something and buggers off 
 so i’m going at sara in missionary and she won’t shut up 
 here’s where it gets really bad 
 there’s this pillow next to her face and i kinda <unk> put this pillow over her face a bit 
 <unk> - to <unk> the noise 
 i did check with her the next day - apparently she was okay with this 
 anyway this seems to help 
 her moans are now <unk> and i think i’m in the clear 
 <unk> so i thought 
 my mum now just barges into my room <unk> that i’m ill. she’s carrying cough syrup painkillers a sick bowl and all sorts 
 then she sees me pounding away at this girl with a pillow over the head and a guilty look on my face 
 this is not the climax of the story 
 anyway after an awkward 10 second silence 
 she leaves and sara and i go to sleep 
 sara then leaves at 5am 
 i’m now just praying to god that we’re english enough such that this will never get brought up out of awkwardness 
 my mum looks at me with disgust over breakfast 
 <unk> silence 
 after some small talk she decides that she needs to do the washing 
 she then says that i will need to <unk> my <unk> 
 i take the hint and bring down the semen stained duvet 
 except my duvet isn’t white 
 it’s red 
 it turns out when sara fell down on the way to the taxi rank she cut open her leg 
 there was then a lot of discussion 
 long story short : my mum thinks i have a fetish for <unk> girls on their period and <unk> them 
 tl dr. my mum thinks i 'm into some strange fetishes 
 this happened last night but i 'm still laughing at it so i thought you guys might enjoy it 
 about 6 months ago my girlfriend took a kitten in that we had seen wandering around the apartment complex for several weeks 
 the cat has been attached to her hip ever since and walks around meowing whenever she 's not here 
 keep in mind that my apartment walls are very thin 
 so last night i come home from work as my girlfriend is leaving for her shift 
 i take the dog out for a walk feed both pets open the back door because it 's extremely nice outside make myself dinner then turn on the xbox to play some halo 
 as i sit down the cat starts meowing louder than normal so i pick her up and put her on my lap and start petting her to try to calm her down which usually works but she just keeps getting louder and eventually jumps off my lap to <unk> around the apartment and continue bitching 
 she does this for a solid 30 minutes before i yell bitch i will cut you 
 a few minutes later i decide i 'm gross from work and need a shower 
 so as i 'm showering the cat pushes the door open hops up on the toilet seat and continues her fit 
 i peek my head out of the curtain and yell shut up 
 i will fucking throw you away '' 
 before people complain i would n't actually do that i love the cat she was just getting on my nerves 
 she continues her <unk> after my shower while i clean up around the apartment and yell <unk> threats at the feline 
 i finish up cleaning and sit back down to play some halo with my cousin online 
 5 minutes after doing so there 's a stern knock at the door followed by the words <unk> police open up '' 
 my heart speeds up a little bit as all i can think is why the hell are the cops here '' 
 so i answer the door to see two officers while i stand there like a deer in the headlights xbox controller in hand headset still on 
 we got a report of a possible domestic <unk> in this apartment mind if we come in '' 
 i 'm standing there with an <unk> and confused look on my face uh you sure you 're in the right place 
 i 'm the only one here '' 
 the complaint said my apartment number we need to come in and make sure everyone 's ok. '' yeah sure come on in '' 
 i put my controller and headset down and waited as they did their thing 
 after going through my small place and obviously not finding anyone they asked if anyone else had been here at all to which i told them it had just been me all night 
 the report we received mentioned people hearing threats of you <unk> someone and throwing them away '' 
 i immediately relaxed and started laughing to myself once they said that 
 i told them i had not seriously yelled that at the cat who was still meowing the entire time they were there because she would n't be quiet 
 they laughed a bit decided that i in fact had n't actually cut beaten or thrown anyone away told me to keep it down next time and went on their way 
 i sat back down and put my headset back on and hear my cousin laughing his ass off saying did that really just happen '' 
 yeah 
 yeah it did '' 
 tl dr - do n't yell at the pussy 
 the cops will come edit : apparently this made front page 
 thanks guys and annoying cat 
 glad you enjoyed the shenanigans edit 2 : here is the pussy 
 i use her as a pillow 
 sorry not sorry for potato quality edit 3 : gold 
 thanks guys 
 i guess i wo n't throw the cat away after <unk> i was at a popular mexican resturant named <unk> and while i was there with some friends the conversation starting to get pretty <unk> since we had been there for about an hour or so 
 to get to the point i decided to hop on tinder and look for some potential mates 
 after a few minutes of swiping left and right i saw a questionable swipe and handed it over to one of my friends 
 who immediately started to laugh and handed the phone back to me and said she was extremely ugly she was n't he is just a douche 
 so im coming to an <unk> with his opinion i <unk> left 
 simple as that right 
 no 
 upon looking up we see our waitress standing over us staring directly at my phone 
 it was then that we realized she was the exact same girl on tinder 
 i could see the pain in her eyes as she dropped the checks onto our table and went to the back of the resturant to presumably cry her eyes out 
 we did n't see her for the rest of the night and the manager came over to apologize to us that our waitress was feeling ill and could n't finish helping us 
 feeling like total <unk> we managed to pool together $ <unk> in tips to give her 
 left a little note on the bottom that said hey we are just dicks 
 you 're actually really pretty : '' and left 
 so yeah today i fucked up by swiping <unk> tifu happened many many years ago however is definitely one of my favourite stories 
 i was out with my family bundled against the cold in my winter jacket when i found a piece of coal on the ground 
 i was incredibly excited because as we all know and i had probably just recently learned coal turns into diamonds 
 now i knew to turn this coal into a diamond it had to be in a warm place and in the dead of winter what better place to keep something warm than in my toasty winter coat pocket 
 rather than share the news of our new found fortune with my parents i decided i wanted to be able to surprise them with my genius when i eventually procured a diamond from my pocket 
 however as i had many other important child things on my mind i soon forgot about the coal spring came around and winter clothing got put away for the warm weather 
 fast forward to the next winter and i am standing in the foyer with my dad while he pulls out my winter coat and starts checking the pockets 
 suddenly i remember the coal that has slowly been turning into a diamond over the past year and i am so fucking excited 
 my dad is going to find a diamond in my pocket and he is going to be so happy with me 
 i can barely contain myself watching <unk> as he pulls the object out of my winter pocket and turns me with a look of utter disbelief on his face and goes <unk> why do you have a piece of dried dog shit in your pocket ” do i get bonus points for this happening today 
 little back story i hate my job with a passion 
 i <unk> very far in a certain field and got all other roles takes away from me to focus on this mind numbing process that i can apparently break records in 
 i have a <unk> office and can get away with playing on my phone most days if certain people are n't in that day i can get away with netflix 
 but the safe option has always been just playing around on my phone since my data <unk> starting taking a real <unk> when i found a new way to speed up my working routine i decided to switch to my old pokemon games fire red for those that must know 
 so over the last two weeks i 've managed to train myself up a good little team decided that i would n't use any <unk> or cheat codes to get certain pokemon 
 leaving the only real challenge for the most part was catching a <unk> in the safari zone 
 i had n't played a new pokemon game since silver/gold/crystal 
 and fire red was a recent purchase to <unk> old <unk> 
 so trying to remember the <unk> / <unk> / everything else to be the best like no one ever was 
 it actually turned out to be quite challenging and really enjoyable 
 until the <unk> four i was fucking up pretty much all day monday maybe two or three hours worth of playing and i 'd fall at either lance or the ghost woman 
 simple mistakes or risks that i should n't take i had a splitting headache so i was n't concentrating that much anyway 
 i gave up turned my phone off and went back to work for once 
 then comes today 
 i 'm through to lance all 6 pokemon still going an healthy i 'm halfway through the battle he 's already lost three of his pokemon and i get a call from the other office telling me there 's a conference on line 1. this is an important phone call there 's our manager his manager the area manager regional manager regional director and that guys boss i do n't even know what that guys title is but he probably made what i make in a year just listening to the next five minutes of awkwardness 
 i defeat lance during the opening the conference i lost two pokemon no <unk> left a few max <unk> so i restore my four remaining pokemon and head off to face green 
 i 'm not involved during this part of the conversation on the phone so i focus on my battle it 's tense it 's down to one on one my riachu hits a <unk> on <unk> and i win 
 forgetting where i am i shout fuck yeah '' 
 ... silence 
 and then ... silence is broken ... who the fuck said that 
 i will find out who said that and i will make sure i come down there and fire you personally 
 god help whoever that was '' 
 end of phone call 
 i hang up pretend not to know anything and go ask my manager in the other office what just happened explaining that i was n't listening to that part of the conversation since my part was n't for another ten minutes in the <unk> 
 the explanation is horrifying 
 this is pretty much a quote from what he said : it was insane boss man 's name was talking about charity work and the <unk> in each of our stores he said something like 'this is a charity that i set up in <unk> for my daughter who died last year 
 and someone yelled fuck yeah 
 whoever that is is screwed 
 just keep quiet the rest of the day and try to keep all <unk> in this office give him time to find out who that was '' 
 so that 's where i am now ... probably gon na get fired 
 at least i hated this job right 
 update : holy shit my inbox exploded and front page kind of awesome 
 for those wanting an update i posted this about 11pm over here so i 'll give a proper update <unk> when i 'm back in and find out whats going on 
 the conference got <unk> so hopefully i wo n't do the same thing again 
 also no my phone did not have a mute function 
 mute functions cost money 
 update 2 : okay so most important question out the way first : my team was charizard <unk> riachu <unk> <unk> with that club that increases its attack and <unk> 
 question 2 : my phone really didnt have a mute 
 question 3 : yes in 2014 this phone did not have a mute 
 the other phones do n't have a loudspeaker 
 in all seriousness in the mix of people wishing i 'd get fired calling bullshit or just crying about something else some people asked for an actual update 
 i walked into work this morning and the big boss guy who as someone suggested shall henceforth be known as <unk> has scheduled a new meeting and blamed unfortunate timing and inappropriate actions on both ends '' and the matter is pretty much over with 
 seems like all will be okay i 've decided to chat with my boss about <unk> new roles into my job and looks like i 'll have some more things to do around the office 
 yay 
 i 'll try to respond to replies on my lunch break the nicer ones anyway today this office shall stay pokemon free 
 although i 've heard good things about <unk> ... **tl dr used waze to report a speed trap got harassed '' by a cop that spotted my <unk> well this just happened minutes ago 
 i had to go get an mri this morning and on the way there i pass a speed trap on the other side of the highway 
 i see this trap every morning and i always use waze on my drives so i plug in a map chat to warn people 
 i 've done this on other days and figured i 'll just do it again 
 i arrive at the mri facility and i get a notification from waze that someone thanked me for the note 
 after the mri i take the same way home and pass the speed trap again 
 the speed limit is 55 in that area and i 'm only going about 52 so i 'm good right 
 nope ... two motorcycle cops come rolling up behind me and pull me over 
 i turn off my jeep and roll the window down and wait 
 one of them approaches and i say hello 
 he asks me for my license and says it 's not nice to <unk> on people '' 
 i say sorry i do n't follow '' and he says oh you did n't get my note on waze 
 i then realize that he was the one that thanked me for the warning 
 he used the app and saw me coming on the way back 
 then he asks how long i 've been in town and i tell him i moved here about 3 months ago 
 he starts to tell me that i have to register my vehicle in state after 10 days and then asks why my drivers license from <unk> has a texas address on it and that it must be bad 
 i explain that in military and exempt from having to register my vehicle here and that is the same reason why my license had a texas address ... <unk> while out of state 
 he walks back to his bike and calls it in 
 he finally walked back up and hands me back my license and says stop reporting our speed trap we can make your morning commute a lot more difficult every morning 
 have a nice day '' edit/update thingey : damn did n't expect a full inbox after work 
 i do n't view this as harassment people 
 i drive a rather recognizable vehicle and was the only one in that lane for a good distance and slowed down as i passed them habit from florida and the move <unk> down law '' i got a good distance passed them when they rolled up 
 so for those calling bs on the waze constant tracking i could have been on his map by then who knows 
 i 've been pulled over before for my out of state tags and considering i only have a rear tag some cops have <unk> in on me in the 2 tag states 
 when he walked up he was n't condescending that means you talk down to people or rude 
 it just seemed like he was blowing off a little steam 
 after he figured out the whole military out of state thing and the dl address thing he made a quick stab and let me go 
 i 'm only going to say it was <unk> pd ... no reason to drag this shit out and bring in the supreme court 
 for those who do n't understand waze and the map chat thing ... it shows the chat bubble on the map and when you click on it it shows who posted it 
 for all i know the cop could have been stopping me for something else and then realized i was the one who posted that ... i do n't care 
 i just thought this fu was different because of the circumstances 
 and for those calling bs on my plate being my waze username ... its a vanity plate not a standard issue one 
 oh and thanks for the gold <unk> 7th grade like many other pubescent girls i went through a bit of a hot topic '' phase 
 lots of rubber black <unk> leather <unk> pants with suspenders ... you get the idea 
 one night as my family was getting ready to go to dinner my dad asked my to get some quarters from his night stand to feed the parking meter in front of the restaurant 
 i went into his night stand grabbed some quarters and noticed this really awesome bracelet 
 it was black leather with <unk> and a series of <unk> so you could adjust the bracelet to fit your wrist 
 i did n't remember buying this particular bracelet but i figured it was mine and i probably misplaced it and it ended up in my dad 's night stand junk drawer 
 we 're halfway through dinner when my dad notices my wrist and literally <unk> his food out on the table and angrily asks me where did you get that bracelet '' 
 i told him where i found it and he said you need to put that back as soon we we get home '' 
 i put it back and did n't think about it again until years later when i stumbled upon a porn site where a male actor was wearing a familiar looking leather bracelet around his penis 
 a feeling of hot sweaty dread filled my veins as i had a <unk> to that moment years before at the dinner table when my dad got angry at me for borrowing his special bracelet 
 i realized that i gone out to a family dinner while wearing my father 's leather cock ring 
 and that 's probably the reason that i work in the adult industry today* 
 <unk> the scenes edit : a lot of people have asked me how big my wrist is 
 it 's normal size 
 not giant penis size 
 i just made a little video a couple of days ago and if you 'd like you can see it here and check out my wrist : **this actually happened today so i guess i get bonus tifu points 
 well for some background first : i 'm a 17 year old guy currently in high school 
 iv'e had a girlfriend for almost 2 months and today we decided to go ahead and have some fun 
 i 'm a virgin she 's not 
 had a condom felt pretty relaxed about the whole situation all that jazz 
 overall i thought stuff was gon na go okay 
 alright so i go to her place we get in bed start making out i get a hard-on from the start of it 
 stuff was going pretty well but slow as fuck 
 it took me like 30 minutes to see her bra 
 fast forward a little after about one hour and 30 minutes im only in my boxers she 's in her panties 
 after having my dick up for almost 2 hours my heart sinks when i notice i went soft at this exact time she wants to get to fucking 
 i try to play it cool go on with some more foreplay try to stealthily rub it but it 's dead 
 it 's fucking dead it feels <unk> by now im barely even feeling it when she goes for a grab 
 i try to go call for a bathroom break i take a piss try to mess around with it a bit more but still nothing 
 i go back to her room and there she is with a ripped condom wrapper in her mouth 
 good luck playing pool with this <unk> sweetheart 
 before i can even say anything she pulls down my boxers and boom no boner only tiny bald <unk> in here 
 she tries to grab it suck it whatever man i do n't even feel her down there anymore 
 seeing as i wo n't get anything done i try to cut my <unk> and go for some fingering 
 i get pretty turned on by moans so by some sort of miracle i get back up 
 she notices and goes in for a blowjob 
 at this point i should mention iv'e been standing around naked for almost an hour and its pretty cold in here 
 i realize im actually shivering 
 i start shivering even harder to the point where im basically having a seizure dick still in her mouth 
 during my little seizure i manage to lose it again 
 with my cock <unk> her goddamn <unk> 
 i do n't even wan na know what it 's like to <unk> a guy and feel his dick <unk> ... i decide go back in for some more fingering this time stuff gets pretty heated i actually raise the fallen soldier again and as i take my hand out to grab the condom before its too late ... period blood 
 motherfucking period blood on my fingers 
 she notices and just kinda starts sobbing and just ran away to the bathroom locked the door behind her 
 well no fuck '' is all i could mumble as i stood there butt naked with period blood on my hand and my girlfriend crying in the bathroom 
 **tl dr** : got to have sex with girlfriend too much foreplay leads to dick getting tired 
 **edit** : apparently my gf browses reddit every now and then 
 that seems like a pretty bad thing right now but it makes this whole thing even funnier 
 **second edit** : this shit blew up 
 i do n't know which one of you crazy motherfuckers glided me but damn i feel like i just got a medal for not getting it up 
 and it 's awesome 
 so for the last two years my wife and i have lived in a house just outside of <unk> city 
 it 's a quiet neighborhood 
 very <unk> 
 anyway i 'm a smoker and usually stay up later than my wife - sometimes deep into the night 
 i always step onto our back deck to light up and for the duration of my cigarette i typically stare off into the fairly <unk> forest behind our house 
 sometimes i 'll see a deer or something but that 's usually it 
 then about a week ago i started noticing something else : a <unk> light very deep in the woods 
 it would <unk> occasionally like a fire or a candle 
 over the next few days i continued to see it and stood on my porch pondering what it could be 
 oddly it would n't appear before midnight and often not until around 2 or 3 in the morning 
 i google <unk> my house to see if there were any other houses on the other side of the woods 
 there were n't we 're basically on the edge of town 
 other strange things started happening around the same time of night : sudden <unk> of traffic odd for a small suburb at 3am car doors slamming inexplicable noises 
 eventually i decided i would go to investigate but figured i would go during the day because - let 's be honest - i read too much <unk> at night and my brain was filled with the horrifying scenarios that could be awaiting me out there 
 so i go during daylight hours not even sure what i am looking for 
 we 've recently gotten a good bit of snow in kc so the first strange thing i find is human footprints 
 there were only a few at first but as i followed them they grew in number until the snow was so <unk> the dirt was visible 
 i also saw some sort of fire pit liquor bottles and a dirty old coat 
 i returned to the house and told my wife 
 in our relationship i 'm definitely the more laid back one and i assumed it was a bunch of high school kids who went off to get drunk in the woods 
 after all the occurrences were much more frequent on weekends 
 but in her <unk> mind she would have none of it 
 so the next night she stays up with me 
 sure enough around 2am things start to pick up again and that light appears - even brighter than usual 
 she calls the cops 
 two officers arrive 
 i explain what 's been going on and show them the light 
 they go off through my backyard and into the woods while my wife and i wait on the deck and watch 
 the whole time i 'm thinking these poor kids are probably drunk or stoned or both ... and <unk> going to be the guy that breaks up the fun '' 
 when did i become *that <unk> 
 but i did n't have much time to think about my advancing years oh no 
 because suddenly - deep in the woods - two blazing police flashlights light up the woods and our mouths dropped 
 silhouetted around trees and bushes are the shadows of *at <unk> 30 very frantic people darting off in every direction 
 there is shouting and howling and even <unk> laughter as the police give chase 
 it 's about this time we realize some of the shadows are running toward us 
 then about half of the group bursts out of the woods and i finally know what we 're dealing with : it 's a bunch of naked dudes 
 and they ran right through my yard and into the street some carrying bags and others carrying massive erections 
 one of them shouted hey there '' 
 to us as they ran by naked as can be and into the street 
 my wife is horrified 
 i on the other hand have fallen in the snow from laughter 
 the next day the police come back and question me 
 turns out they only got one of the guys 
 and he says i was hosting them 
 he does n't know my name but he pointed to our house as the <unk> point '' 
 turns out my house has been the <unk> for several gay orgies over the years 
 the cops question me some more before they find me innocent or whatever 
 then they advise me to clean up my yard 
 so i go out there and what do i find 
 condoms and dildos and strap-ons <unk> just dumped out of panic in my yard 
 needless to say the next trash day was an interesting one 
 tl dr : <unk> a small light in my woods accidentally broke up a massive gay orgy 
 edit : the cops let me take a picture of their evidence bag : notice the single dildo and asshole shaped fleshlight ... the cops left the rest of them in my yard 
 edit 2 : glad i could wake up to see this on the front page 
 for those kc residents who are curious i 'm in <unk> <unk> which is near <unk> park 
 the <unk> question seem to be why would a gay orgy need strap-ons '' 
 although i can only speculate i assume the cold air had led to ... performance issues 
 edit 3 : gold 
 thank you reddit stranger so this happened about ten years ago 
 my father owns a pretty large heavy construction company and every so often we are tasked with demolishing houses 
 my father won a public bid to <unk> a few homes in a public low income housing complex that were <unk> by the city for <unk> 
 my dad goes to florida in the winter and i become the <unk> of our sites for a few months 
 the day before he leaves he gives me the paperwork for this job 
 it 's in a rough neighborhood 
 and by rough i mean <unk> post <unk> rough 
 oh well seems like an easy enough job 
 two house demos in three days 
 the following day i load our machine on the <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> with a grapple and drive over to the neighborhood 
 i call the recycling company before i get there to make sure they 'll have enough <unk> <unk> for the debris from both houses 
 everything looks good and i tell my guys to meet me at the houses 
 once i arrive in the neighborhood i realize that the only thing i have to go by is the description of the homes on the contract because there are no house numbers and a community mailbox 
 i pull up to a blue three story <unk> <unk> by a wooden porch '' just like it says on my contract 
 it 's important to know that for all other demos we usually go into the homes and take out all the copper for recycling 
 this contract stated that the housing authority has already <unk> everything so there was no reason to enter the home 
 we only have three days so i get to work unloading the machine 
 once we are all set up its around 8am 
 people are <unk> in the neighborhood getting up and going to work for the day 
 i start by taking off the roof load by load everything is going smoothly 
 i load up the first truck with the debris until it is filled 
 the truck leaves and an empty one pulls up to replace it 
 i now start with the second floor 
 i see a dresser in my grapple 
 i think to myself oh well the previous tenants must have left some furniture '' 
 next the grapple has a bed in it 
 then a pile of clothes 
 then a tv 
 at this point something seems <unk> so i get off the machine and walk up to the side window of the half <unk> house 
 i look inside and my heart sinks 
 there are pictures on walls a fridge dining room table and a typical family living room 
 this is the wrong house 
 someone obviously lives here 
 i run to my truck and grab my phone but before i can even call my dad the housing authority representative pulls up and judging by the look on his face this was absolutely positively the wrong house 
 long story short this home was also owned by the housing authority and the tenants were on vacation 
 we paid <unk> to take the remaining <unk> items from this half destroyed house to another much nicer in my opinion 
 they set everything up as best as they could and we finished demolishing the house we had started 
 the worst part was no one had a mobile contact for the tenants 
 they arrived home a week later to the plot of land where their home once stood 
 in the end they got a sizable <unk> from the housing authority for not <unk> the demo which was stated in our contract 
 dad did n't talk to me for months 
 edit : wow front page 
 thanks for my first gold kind stranger 
 a few updates to clear some things up : <unk> couple in their early <unk> lived in the house rent was partially <unk> by the city 
 yes they were on vacation and <unk> ... -i only damaged items from their guest bedroom and hallway they walked away with 90 % of their items <unk> i do know that i could have killed someone and i have paid for this mistake throughout my life 
 -i met the couple about a month after the incident and they harbored no animosity 
 really nice folks actually ended up moving south after the settlement 
 -i am still in construction today and have my <unk> 30 training a lot more mature and careful now <unk> who does n't believe my story can pound sand i 'll look for some proof that does n't give away the location or my business when i get home edit 2 : sorry about the link at work now but proof that i am operating machinery in construction <unk> around a bend and there he was just sitting there in all his majestic glory 
 then all his majestic glory was all over the road 
 i 'm sorry america 
 edit : a few notes : yes he was splattered no chance for <unk> 
 not going to jail i did n't do it on purpose 
 edit 2 : drivers ed <unk> do n't swerve to avoid small animals that wo n't hurt you 
 it was n't a human so calm <unk> today i decided to jack off in my bathroom before i took a shower 
 i lied down on my back on the floor you should try it and started fapping away 
 i hear a thud on the roof about halfway through my session and thought it was no big deal 
 <unk> i forgot that my house was getting re-roofed today 
 so as i am furiously <unk> my sausage looking up at the skylight directly above me this heavy sweaty mexican guy looks down at me 
 we locked eyes for about two seconds before he moved away from the skylight 
 i jumped up got dressed and hid in my room the rest of the day until they left 
 edit : was not expecting to make the top page 
 thank you all for laughing <unk> me 
 for everyone saying how do you forget your house is being re-roofed '' 
 its my parents house and they mentioned it a weeks or so <unk> about an hour ago 
 lunchtime i 'm walking the short distance from the separate building where i work to the main office where the cafeteria is 
 as i approach the doors from the side i <unk> a pretty girl i 've never seen before approaching the same door from straight on 
 the timing and the fact that the door opens towards me means i can do the <unk> thing and open the door for her and let her through first 
 i plan to bow and smile cool 
 i reach the door and these doors are quite heavy so a little effort is needed to open them 
 as i reach for the handle i turn my head to do the <unk> you smile 
 this is where i fu 
 by looking at the girl i miss the handle 
 but i’m already leaning back to counter the weight of the door and i fall over in the most <unk> fashion imaginable 
 by brain fails to react and i literally go down backwards like a <unk> tree 
 i hit my shoulder hard on the post which supports the <unk> over the door 
 had it been my head that i hit i would 've been out cold 
 i get up pretending to be fine she seems concerned but is trying not to laugh 
 i 'm trying not to cry 
 i am not <unk> was sitting in my room talking with friends online when someone linked a photo that was one of the <unk> colorblind tests 
 i could not see what was on it and my friends were laughing hysterically at the joke that i could n't see 
 they refused to tell me so i called my mother into the room to tell me what is was 
 mind you it was a <unk> <unk> photo that filled my entire monitor 
 she promptly yelled why is there a giant dick on your screen '' 
 and i was greeted by even more laughter from my friends and then my own mother laughed at me and walked out saying *you <unk> '' 
 edit : tifu within a tifu : looked for the photo 
 realizing five minutes later ... i can never find it because i am in fact colorblind ... edit 2 : being colorblind is hard 
 edit 2 1/2 : this is an example i can sorta make out the ballsack that 's it 
 edit 3 : yes i thought peanut butter was green for 18 years 
 edit 4 : apparently i am loved elsewhere also no i am not <unk> people by attempting to make you see a dick as great as that might be 
 edit 5 : gilded 
 wow thank you so much 
 this all has literally made my day 
 edit 6 : post was removed and shortly <unk> 
 my bad for not reading the rules on donation <unk> it 's ok guys i can live colorblind it 's a good <unk> piece so this happened when i was 19 near my home town 
 i was at a house party when i met a girl and we proceeded to go back to her house 
 well she was 18 and attending college later that year so she still lived with her parents 
 so we sneak in go up stairs to her bedroom for some sexy time 
 i was there for maybe a couple of minutes when we hear the phone ring and her father come walking down the hall 
 she freaks out and tells me to get out on the roof her room was on the second floor and they had an <unk> type roof covering their porch 
 i was drunk and was not in the best state of mind to make rash decisions 
 so i reluctantly go out the window and lay down on the roof 
 this is where it gets fucked up 
 the father comes bursting in the room and tells her that her little sister was in a car accident and that they are leaving for the hospital right now 
 so she waits for her father to leave opens the window and tells me she will leave it unlocked and that i can leave after they leave 
 night is just getting better and better 
 well the mother comes in crying and starts helping her pack some things for her sister 
 she then notices the window is unlocked and locks it on her way out 
 i guess the girl did n't notice 
 so here i am around 1100 on a friday night its about 45 degrees outside and i am only in my boxers and socks 
 after they left i tried everything i could to open that window no luck 
 there was no way i was jumping as it was the second story and they lived on a steep hill 
 so instead of 20 ft it would have been around 30 and a painful roll down 
 i had no phone and no other way of signaling anyone for help 
 im not sure someone would help a half naked boy on the side of a house anyway 
 so after about an hour of me losing feeling in my extremities and full of false hope that the girl would return any minute to open the window 
 i decided the only logical thing would be to break in 
 surprisingly its not that hard to break a sliding window off its tracks and i managed to keep it from completely shattering all onto her floor 
 i grabbed my <unk> and booked it out of there 
 the following day i get a call from her apologizing to me about how she left me 
 yes thats right she apologized to me because i had to smash in her window 
 the sister ended up being fine and her father got the police involved for my little <unk> but she is the only one that knows it was me 
 never saw her or talked to her again after that 
 tl dr met a girl she was rad 
 got on the roof to hide from her dad 
 broke in and was n't half bad 
 never saw her again and i ai n't even sad 
 edit : sorry for the <unk> 
 as you can tell by most post history i have been mostly a lurker on this site for the past couple of years 
 guess i should have posted this on my computer instead of my phone 
 i 'm glad tifu enjoyed my fuck up 
 here 's my original post : and here 's what it said : i was emailing with my dad about a road trip we 're about to take together across <unk> next month and went to send him a link to a desert quad biking company 
 but instead of copying the url from the quad biking site i accidentally copied the url from a <unk> video i had open in another tab which was of a very funny but very twisted short film about <unk> incest 
 so yeah now my dad thinks i want to suck his dick 
 here 's the film i sent him by accident 
 and here 's my update : well i met with my dad for dinner and to be honest things didn’t quite go according to plan 
 i immediately explained to him how i’d mistakenly sent him the link to the incest comedy rather than the quad bike company and that my <unk> should do <unk> comment was about quad biking and not sucking each other’s dicks 
 he seemed to believe me and we laughed about it 
 so far so awkward 
 but then drunk on the relief of how i’d managed to resolve the whole thing i went and made a fatal error 
 i told him about my reddit post and about how i’d told half the internet about our little misunderstanding 
 i even showed him a bunch of all your comments on my phone 
 my dad did not like that i’d gone public with this 
 he did not like it one bit 
 in fact he got very fucking pissed and walked out the restaurant saying i was a stupid kid a creep etc etc 
 i’m thirty fucking one by the way 
 anyway i’m sure <unk> get over it but right now i’d say my chances of getting a blowjob from him any time soon are virtually <unk> 
 <unk> to the <unk> a number of people asked me to post an additional update on the situation with my dad 
 so like before here it is a fresh post as requested 
 ok i just fucked up about 2 days ago 
 i tried posting before but it was removed 
 i am on my phone as well so excuse my formatting but i think i can manage 
 so backstory real <unk> i went snowboarding not long ago i ate shit it was my first time and i cracked a rib sprained my wrist 
 i 'm visiting in town for my grandmother 's funeral 
 i 'm at my other grandmother 's and i decided to run a bubble bath 
 soaking these <unk> cracked and sprained bones in hot and heavy water would be amazing right now 
 so ... this is where i fuck up but did n't know it yet 
 i run a bath i normally check the tub for things like hair or whatever before i get in but i 'm high on xanax so i do n't pay any attention to the tub 
 i just run the bath squeeze in some shampoo or something to make bubbles grab the clothes i am going to put on come back and it looks good 
 it 's hot it 's heavy 
 i soak and <unk> 
 it 's <unk> 
 the <unk> bathtub the warm water the bubbles but <unk> the smell ... my grandfather has <unk> 's and dementia 
 he 's gotten progressively worse 
 he was known to hide his diapers in random places he 's even tried to flush one once 
 so i soak i feel great right 
 no left 
 turns out earlier that day he had an episode and as i went to get out i could feel small chunks hitting my body 
 i noticed small brown chunks on me as well 
 i felt something <unk> to my foot 
 turns out i soaked in murky brown water for <unk> minutes with a diaper 
 a shitty diaper 
 i puked 
 tl dr : cracked a rib ran the bathtub clung a diaper became the <unk> edit : you guys are fucking hilarious 
 i love reddit 
 tifu by posting a truly bizarre thing that happened to me on a subreddit meant for truly <unk> <unk> 
 so this actually happened about nine years ago but tifu by trying to chase a girl 
 there was a new girl that worked at a store where i was a regular and i had a crush on her from the first day she started 
 i hit it off with her pretty well and would talk to her when i came in along with the rest of the employees since we knew each other pretty well small store 
 once a month the employees would get together and go see a movie at the theater next to their work when they all got off 
 i wanted to be a part of their next outting since the new girl would be joining them as well 
 one of the employees steve got off work so i started asking him about the outting telling him that i wish i was a part of the group since they all know me pretty well and i was also want to work there 
 i did n't want to flat out say i wanted to tag along for her so he invited me along 
 needless to say i was excited to be able to try to spend some time with her outside of work 
 we all went to the movies and i ended up sitting next to steve and my good friend matt while the new girl was a few seats down and i never really got to talk to her while steve was acting kind of strange which was slightly <unk> 
 i went back to the store the next week and matt tells me i did n't know you were into dudes '' 
 i gave him a <unk> look and said i 'm not 
 i 'm into the new girl that works here 
 what makes you think that '' 
 matt starts laughing did you know that steve is gay '' 
 i unwittingly reply did n't have a clue '' 
 but my eyes began to <unk> as i started to realize the truth 
 matt told me that steve had asked me to the movies thinking it was a date and that my excitement had him thinking that i was of the same mindset and everyone else thought that i was there on a date with him 
 never lived that down tl dr was chasing a girl and unknowingly was asked out by a gay man and unwittingly accepted thinking it was a hang out with friends 
 also i did eventually get the girl edit 1 : grammar and why i did n't mention the girl to steve edit 2 : for those of you wondering about the girl it is a far less interesting story sadly 
 we ended up together for about a year and while we split up we still remained friends for quite some time 
 i got her mainly through <unk> and explaining that i was trying to be there that night for her 
 she cut off an engagement the day before her wedding and i 'm currently in a long term relationship getting ready to propose to a girl <unk> came to the end of the massive organic synthesis unit in <unk> chemistry uk and decided that the best way to keep all my notes together would be by stapling them so they 'd stay in order 
 we 're talking pretty bulky here too many pieces of paper to use a normal stapler - too thick 
 <unk> 
 lightbulb moment 
 let 's use a staple gun 
 more <unk> let 's put all the pieces of paper down on the dining room table and staple them that way 
 fast forward 5 seconds and over a month 's worth of organic chemistry notes are stapled to an <unk> wooden table along with the tablecloth and my dignity 
 i 've managed to <unk> them free with only <unk> ripping but i 'm unable to free the tablecloth without damaging it so i 'm just leaving it in place until i think of a solution 
 i feel like such an idiot right now 
 update : i got the staple out using a butter knife with minimal damage to either table or cloth 
 thanks for your uh support <unk> handcuffed her in the front 
 after we were done i threw her the key and went into the kitchen 
 i came back and she said she could n't open them 
 i saw the key in the lock and just thought it was an awkward angle to turn for her since she was cuffed 
 nope 
 i tried to turn the key and it was stuck i tried to turn it more and the tooth broke off 
 shit 
 i do n't have an extra key 
 okay 
 starting to worry now 
 i youtube how to pick handcuffs 
 i try for an hour using one of her bobby pins 
 no success 
 fuck 
 the next step was trying to drill out the key hole hoping the mechanism would fail 
 it did n't 
 fuck 
 we 're on the 3rd hour 
 i ca n't call the fire department i 'm a firefighter on the fire department 
 <unk> going to walmart at 3am and buying bolt cutters 
 i 'm not leaving her alone cuffed and she ca n't put a shirt on i spot a <unk> doo blanket and tie it around her 
 surely these will work 
 the cutting of the chain was easy 
 i tried to cut off one of the handcuffs and struggled for about 5 minutes before getting it cut off 
 next 
 oh no 
 the bolt cutter blades seemed to have came out of <unk> 
 every time i would try to cut the handcuff it would twist obviously hurting her 
 i tried cutting different spots to no avail until i finally cut along the hinge where it finally separated 
 pictures : edit : by popular demand a picture of me during the whole situation 
 and her my job requires me to wear a name badge but it 's a clip on badge that always leaves holes or marks in my clothes 
 i noticed that other staff members were <unk> badges onto <unk> instead so over the weekend i dug out the lanyard i carried around while in college and took off my old keychain that was looped in it 
 <unk> on the badge wore it to work this morning was very pleased with the lack of holes in my chunky sweater 
 so about 45 minutes ago this happened today reddit 
 my name badge comes off and as i 'm fiddling around with it i put the end of the lanyard into my mouth to chew on 
 i 'm bored <unk> out then suddenly my mouth starts to burn 
 it quickly gets worse and i 'm sweating 
 it 's at this point i remember that the keychain i 'd had on the lanyard was used to hold my pepper spray 
 the same <unk> that had been used <unk> to see how far it would shoot and if it indeed had uv <unk> 
 the same pepper spray that had inevitably gotten on the lanyard itself 
 the nature of my job of course is such that i ca n't leave my post until my break or another staff member <unk> me 
 so twenty minutes later i -- the girl who sometimes thinks <unk> de <unk> is too spicy -- finally am able to wash this awful burning taste out of my mouth 
 tl dr : oral <unk> leads to pepper spray consumption 
 this happened to me maybe 9 years ago it 's one of my best/saddest stories 
 also it was n't a sweet 16 it was a quinseniera which is the hispanic sweet 16 which happens at 15. my dad drags me to a party in <unk> <unk> that i do not want to go to it was in a very crowded apartment with very loud music and drunk hispanic people 
 these parties can be fun in hindsight but i was a broody 19 year old who did not want to waste a friday night going to a lame <unk> 
 for context this is n't like a sweet 16 full of girls it 's full of older family in a <unk> apartment with maybe 2 of the girls friends and everyone is drunk 
 anyway my master plan is to simply find a seat at the party stare into space for 3-4 hours and then leave 
 upon arriving every single seat is full 
 i am so broody and <unk> and just want to sit down 
 i decide to improvise '' 
 i find a table and just lean my butt on it 
 this table was covered by a <unk> i assumed it was a wooden table bad assumption 
 it was a glass table 
 the table <unk> and i fall to the floor 
 not only that this table has the <unk> cake on it untouched no one has had a single bite ruined on the floor 
 everyone turns to look at me in a perfect <unk> and the music stops just like the movies 
 i 'll remind you that all these people are perfect strangers to me it was my dad 's friends friend 's daughter or something 
 it is the most awkward moment of my life i manage to make some kind awkward sorry face the kind where you show your teeth and kind of frown 
 no one says anything no one knows how to react 
 finally a younger guy thinks of the only appropriate thing to say are you okay 
 i was about to say yes when i feel a dripping on my leg 
 i realize i cut myself somehow 
 so i say no i think i cut my leg '' 
 my dad get 's very nervous because if the cut is deep enough it could be real trouble because of the <unk> artery it was n't that bad fyi 
 he rushes me to the bathroom and tells me to pull my pants down then and there and for whatever reason two other guys come with him who are strangers 
 i 'm bent over with my bare ass out with my dad and these two men looking at my ass and the cut they do n't close the bathroom door because they are in such a rush and worried so everyone crowds around the bathroom to look 
 it 's so insane i could n't believe what was happening i felt like it was like a scene from american <unk> or something 
 i 'm something of a <unk> so i of course am convinced i 'm dying as there is a steady drip of blood coming down my leg in hindsight it was n't that bad at all 
 a kinda silver lining was that since i was convinced i was dying i requested an ambulance and kept feeling like i was going to faint 
 this is a silver lining because i got to immediately leave the party with my dad to get into the ambulance 
 which was so much better than having to apologize to everyone at the party and face what i did 
 i remember the mom of the quinseniera girl crying about the table as i left the apartment 
 now since the glass pierced my leg near my ass they pulled my pants down exposing my ass in the ambulance and rolled me into the hospital there so i 'm rolling through a crowded hospital with my ass out in the er 
 now this was a crowded er with real wounds like gunshot wounds etc 
 i waited for hours 
 i ca n't remember how many because it was so long ago but i remember it was the morning when i left 
 i never got treated i just could n't wait any longer and just walked out with a limp and went home 
 i still feel the injury during certain yoga poses 
 it was a terrible awkward hilarious experience 
 i feel really bad for that girl that i ruined her party 
 and that 's how tifu 
 tl dr i sat on a glass table at a quinseniera ruining a girls birthday party and went to the er for a cut near my ass 
 edit : people are asking if i 'm a guy yes i 'm a guy and do yoga 
 also people keep asking why i did n't write <unk> in the title 
 mostly because i assumed people would n't know what it was 
 recently my wife and i got two kittens harvi and moxxie 
 they have been <unk> little <unk> and they love to run around climbing on things 
 their new favorite thing is climbing up our pant legs and fighting on our laps 
 tonight was the breaking point 
 i could n't take the kittens constantly clawing their way up and down while i was at the computer so i finally <unk> that 's it 
 you ca n't climb up my pant leg if i 'm not wearing pants '' 
 with a flourish i whipped off my pants and sat back down 
 it was a glorious five minutes before moxxie leapt into the air sunk her sharp little kitty claws into my skin and then stopped to contemplate climbing up the rest of the way 
 distracted by the devil attached to my leg i failed to notice harvi running toward me in an attempt to get to moxxie 
 as the poorer climber harvi has always gone for the easiest route 
 she went for the only cloth she saw ... and promptly sunk her claws through my boxer <unk> and into my scrotum 
 my wife claims to be in as much pain as i am due to laughing so hard 
 here are the <unk> 
 tl dr - my kitten 's claws have touched my balls more recently than my wife 
 edit : apparently the picture is titled as a lonely college student living alone i decided to adopt some roommates '' 
 it appears that someone has taken my image and <unk> it as their own roughly 30 minutes before this edit 
 here is the thief 
 edit <unk> : i have added new pictures of the kittens one including my wife 
 you may now <unk> your claims of bullshit '' if you would <unk> happened at my local <unk> store 
 as i was browsing the inventory a guy needs to walk in front of me and as i back up i feel myself bump into a <unk> display of movies behind me 
 <unk> it was about to fall i instantly get the clever idea to do a fancy 180 to grab it before it tips 
 <unk> with my hand a little below shoulder height i place my palm directly on the breast of a completely unseen girl behind me 
 very nervous and wanting to explain the innocence of the situation i instantly say i was just trying to grab that rack '' without realizing the double meaning 
 she gives me the most curious smile 
 slightly confused and completely embarrassed i walk away not realizing what i said until 10 minutes later driving away 
 tl dr - walked away from the smoothest move i 've ever made without realizing it edit - the 2 most popular responses i 'm getting are 1. fake and 2 
 how hot are <unk> '' 
 1. this story is 98 % true the only thing not true is that it did n't literally happen yesterday it was at a <unk> store in the mall 
 no the rack did n't fall it just rocked back and forth for maybe 2 seconds 
 2. i 'm maybe 7 material on my best day i remember her as an 8 but considering the situation 6 is entirely possible 
 3. for the non english speakers rack '' is slang for <unk> i knew this day would come 
 the day i visit this subreddit with the intention of posting as opposed to browsing 
 i 'm aware of the general opinion that the majority of posts <unk> this community are fake though they make great stories 
 i 'm afraid this one is n't fake 
 i know ... that 's just what a dirty lying bitch would say 
 a few <unk> ago i had smashed a picture frame hanging on my bedroom wall 
 i threw a screwdriver at it 
 i ca n't quite remember why i threw it but i remember that i did it 
 the glass smashed and fell to the floor along with the frame itself 
 there were some clothes underneath clothes which were used to gather the broken glass and subsequently thrown out 
 fast forward to the day before yesterday 
 <unk> '' does n't have the same ring to it so suspend your disbelief regarding the title 
 i 'm sat at the pc and like any <unk> member of society i decided to play with the member of my pants 
 it was a <unk> decision one i took on board with enthusiasm due to the urge not striking me very often because of my medication 
 i 'm reaching the <unk> strokes and things are looking good 
 as good as things can look through the <unk> eyes of a man <unk> to his base urges 
 i suddenly realise that i have nothing to catch my maybe babies 
 one hand fumbles for something while the other fumbles my ding dong 
 i feel fabric and <unk> it up 
 it 's an old t-shirt one i 'm happy to <unk> after the deed is done 
 it feels great 
 i catch the result with the precision of a cat <unk> a <unk> 
 now comes clean up time 
 let 's not kid ourselves 
 we know how this ends 
 my thoughts turn from post fumbling bliss to pure horror as i drag shards of broken glass across the tip of my <unk> doodle 
 it took me a second to realise what had happened 
 the fact that things are still super sensitive down there coupled with the glass being razor sharp means that i do n't quite notice until one complete wipe 
 yes there was blood 
 yes there was mental scarring 
 it 's healing nicely though which is good 
 tldr i almost gave myself a <unk> we were having a discussion about 9/11 
 keep in mind this is australia where we do n't really care that much 
 one of my friends brought up the fact that her family friend died in 9/11 
 without thinking i said what were his last words 
 <unk> <unk> '' 
 i <unk> stop and think wtf did i just say '' 
 it came from a joke i heard : & gt my dad died in 9/11 but at least i 'll know his last words 
 <unk> <unk> anyway it was followed but 2 people laughing their asses off 
 3 people going <unk> as in dude wtf '' 
 and her ignoring me indefinitely 
 **edit : ** i just want to clear up something 
 i said australians do n't care that much '' not australian 's are glad 9/11 happened and are planning another one '' 
 calm <unk> boyfriend and i have been dating since high school 
 when we went to prom together three years ago i asked him what color dress i should wear and he <unk> told me anything but purple '' 
 the last three years i have been avoiding wearing purple buying purple <unk> with purple etc 
 because i thought he hated the color purple 
 today i told him i found a shirt that i liked but i did n't get it because it was purple 
 he was extremely confused so i explained to him why i have been pretty much avoiding purple for years 
 he laughed and told me he does n't remember saying that and that he was probably just messing with me 
 so much wasted time and energy trying to keep purple out of his life so he would n't have to look at what i thought he believed to be a disgusting color 
 edit : everyone is taking this post way too damn seriously 
 i thought my boyfriend did n't like a certain color so i did n't fill our lives with that color it 's not like i put myself into some extreme <unk> or something to think about what he likes too 
 it is possible to take into consideration what other people like while still having respect for yourself 
 <unk> this fu just happened about 20 minutes ago 
 i 'm 21 m and i 've known this girl 20 for about 5 years now and we 've been pretty good friends since then 
 we 've never had a romantic history as we 've always just seen one another as friends but <unk> she 's gorgeous 
 <unk> '' blonde hair model type really 
 so about 20 minutes ago i get a snap from her and i opened it right away 
 to my delight and shock it was a full-blown <unk> shot of her bent right over on her knees mirror selfie 
 hands down one of the most perfectly shaped <unk> i 've ever seen 
 thinking quickly and coming to terms with the <unk> time i had to gaze upon this smooth magnificent <unk> work of art i find it wise to take a screen shot 
 mistake 
 mind you this happened within about 2 seconds of opening the snap 
 as soon as i finish taking the screenshot i get a flood of texts from her pleading me to not open that that it was n't meant for me that i should n't see what it is etc 
 it occurred to me then that it had n't occurred to me that it may not have been for me 
 the texts stopped as abruptly as they began as i assumed she got the screenshot notification 
 still awaiting the aftermath but yeah 
 in the most glorious and <unk> way i fu 
 edit : <unk> 
 front page 
 <unk> update : i talked with her and of course i deleted the image entirely 
 did n't back it up or anything 
 she 's a sweet girl and is really embarrassed and i could n't keep it with good conscious 
 i told her i 'd never bring this up again and she 's actually being pretty cool about it no awkward feelings 
 edit 2 : nice 
 popped my gold cherry too 
 thank you kind stranger this girl texted me the other day and i was reminded of my huge fuckup on our first date which was about a year ago 
 so i know her from highschool in our hometown but i had n't seen her for 5 years 
 i saw her working in a bar we talked a little and exchanged phone numbers 
 few weeks later we planned our date which was at 22.00 but we had n't decided on the location yet 
 the day of our date the fuckup <unk> she texted me that morning saying : '' you should really know i had a huge crush on you five years ago.. '' 
 i kind of freaked out and didnt know how to react 
 i was hanging out with some friends of mine when she called me to ask where we were going to meet 
 having set the location i hung up the phone and told my buddies about the text i had recieved that morning 
 one of them told me i was definitely getting laid that night that i should take advantage of the situation 
 some typical drunken male trashtalking ensued 
 i told them there was a thin line between taking advantage and being taken advantage of and left for the date 
 so it 's 22.00 and she isnt there 
 <unk> still no one 
 at <unk> she walked in and acted super cold 
 she didnt order a drink and was obviously not willing to have a normal conversation 
 after ten minutes she asked : so who are you going to take <unk> of tonight '' 
 turns out i did n't hang up the phone when i meant to and she heard everything 
 everything 
 tldr didnt hang up the phone when i meant to and my date overheard me and my friends trashtalking about me getting some tonight 
 didnt get <unk> past week i 've been exhausted and have had some trouble getting up at a decent time 
 i am supposed to be up at six but even with my seven different alarm <unk> set up on my phone to play eye of the <unk> at <unk> times i have been unable to wake myself any later than <unk> so of course i thought that the sound of shia <unk> 's do it '' would be a good alternative to help wake me up 
 so i set it for <unk> with max volume and thought everything would be <unk> 
 unfortunately i forgot i had set the alarm and the next morning my phone began blaring shia 's screams 
 i immediately thought a man had broken into my home and was screaming at me 
 i jumped out of bed with my eyes half shut my pulse furiously racing and throwing karate kicks ... only to eventually notice the <unk> yelling things like yesterday you said tomorrow 
 ... so just do it '' 
 long story short it woke me up but i was freaking terrified 
 edit : <unk> some fellow redditors were kind enough to make this into a video 
 here 's the link for those interested : tifu when i decided that i would try to be extra sexy while going down on my boyfriend 
 as he was close to <unk> i tried partially successfully to deep throat him to give him that extra <unk> 
 well i managed to gag right as he was finishing 
 <unk> 
 while he 's in the <unk> of ecstasy i have cum shooting out of my nose and tears running out of my eyes semen in the <unk> burns 
 i 'm trying to <unk> it back in quietly and cover the lower half of my face 
 me : was it good for you '' 
 sniff 
 sniff 
 <unk> -- hand still over the face trying to hide it and act as normally as possible 
 i pretended everything went exactly how it was meant to 
 him trying not to laugh because he completely knew what had just happened even though i was still in denial : do you need to go to the bathroom '' 
 me : yes please '' i spent the next ten minutes trying to rinse what could have been my children out of my <unk> fuck up actually happened 6 years ago and i think my family will never let me forget it 
 & amp nbsp when i was 18 me and my bf decided we should have sex for the first time 
 all went well ... yay us 
 life goes on a couple of months later and i am sitting at the doctors appointment 
 after i tell my doctor i am no longer a virgin she informs me i should do a pap test and i was like oh ok yeah maybe i should '' 
 for those of you who do n't know a pap test is used to look for changes in the cells of the <unk> or vagina that show cancer or <unk> that may develop into cancer 
 she goes to set it up but the hospital computer system was n't working so she says i ca n't set up a date right now your mother is scheduled to come here next week can i tell her the date or do you prefer that i call you '' 
 i was very social awkward so i say no no just tell my mother the date and she will tell me '' 
 this is where the fuck up begins ... i am home both me and my older sister are helping my mom preparing dinner you know just chopping <unk> potatoes while goofing around and i tell her so hey mom next week when you go to the doctor please ask her the date for my pap test '' complete and absolute silence ... and i was like hey mom 
 you heard me 
 ... and she looks at me strange and puts down the knife and just keeps staring while my sister <unk> really hard 
 so i realize something is wrong and i start to get nervous 
 my sister says we will be right back '' and pulls me to the living room while my mom just stands there looking at me in complete silence 
 i was so confused and my sister starts laughing and says wtf are you doing 
 are you stupid 
 i did n't understand what this was about and my sister realizing that starts laughing even harder <unk> my god 
 you did n't know 
 at this age the only reason for you to do a pap test is if you had sex '' 
 as soon as she ends that phrase in comes my father and he just looks at us and asks who had sex '' 
 oops ... it was at this moment i knew i had fucked up 
 & amp nbsp & amp nbsp tl dr : told mom my doctor was going to inform her of my pap test date 
 sister laughs pulls me aside and explains that the only reason to do a pap test at this age is if i had sex 
 father arrives and hears everything 
 & amp nbsp p.s sry for my english 
 & amp nbsp edit : correcting grammar so this really happened yesterday but it 's still bad 
 so i was out shopping with my gf at a popular <unk> goods store 
 she generally does n't like going with me because i take my sweet ass time looking at anything i find appealing 
 kinda like she does to me when she shops 
 it 's a good way to get back at her for her shopping <unk> 
 anyway the entire time she was following me and she kept running into me 
 so i asked her why do you keep <unk> into me '' 
 she replied <unk> ... '' without thinking i said well maybe if you did n't have so much mass ... '' her jaw dropped so fucking fast she probably has lock jaw 
 update 1 : so i told her about the post and told her about what yall were saying 
 she found the post 
 now i owe her something shiny and a <unk> 
 my son has been in college since last fall 
 last november my 16 year old stepdaughter brought up allegations that my son had abused her repeatedly for several years 
 i confronted my son and he <unk> denied it 
 but i knew that even though he was my son i could not defend him for such an awful act 
 my wife and i reported him to the authorities 
 my son was arrested in december and held in prison for a several weeks because i refused to provide him bail money 
 he was eventually expelled from his ivy league college 
 in the middle of january my stepdaughter broke down and admitted she lied about everything 
 she had actually been having sex with her boyfriend and was scared the news would reach us 
 the charges were dismissed and my son was released immediately but the damage was done 
 his first girlfriend from college ended things with him 
 the news spread about the allegations and all his childhood friends have decided to just stay away from him even though i called each and every one of them personally 
 i have called the school and explained the situation and even though they sympathized they said he needed to <unk> for the next school year and go through the <unk> process again 
 my son is understandably furious at us 
 he has moved back home and refuses to talk to me at all 
 both my wife and i have apologized to him repeatedly 
 we have banned my stepdaughter from our home permanently and she has been sent to live with her father in another state 
 my wife and i also agreed to completely <unk> her from our <unk> 
 it has been a very painful situation 
 all of us started therapy 
 the realization of how badly i ruined my <unk> life hit me when i picked up his first prescription of <unk> today 
 i <unk> my eyes out in my car 
 he is the pride and joy of my life 
 he is <unk> funny intelligent and the kindest person i know 
 but when i handed him his medication i could not even recognize him 
 he locks himself in his room does not eat properly and has lost several pounds so far 
 whenever i try talking to him i just see the hate he has for me in his eyes 
 i don’t know if i can ever get him to love me again 
 i know he is on reddit very often 
 t if you are reading i want to tell you again how sorry your <unk> and i are 
 i promise i will get you into college again 
 i know i can’t get you back the year you lost 
 but i will do everything in my power to make this right 
 everything i have has always been for you 
 i hope you will give me a chance to fix this 
 i love you so much it hurts 
 i failed as a father and i hope one day you will forgive me 
 tl dr i played a part in getting my own son getting falsely arrested and <unk> so this did n't happen today but a few years ago 
 i recently discovered tifu so i thought i 'd submit my fuck up 
 ok so my family was chilling next door at the neighbours so i decided to get my vibrator out i 'm a girl and was 18 at the time so anyway i plug the toy in and get to work 
 it was going great until i squirted <unk> but it 's important i must 've got some of it on the plug or whatever and it ended up shocking me 
 it was the single most painful thing that has ever happened to me 
 in the shock my vagina decided to completely fuck me over and clamped down on the toy and would n't let go 
 there 's a technical name for it but i ca n't remember it in pain from the shock and now the muscle spasms in my vagina 
 i spent forty minutes trying to pry the toy out 
 in the end i gave up and shouted for my mum from across the <unk> 
 she came in i explained what had happened 
 she took me to a & amp e and i was given a muscle <unk> 
 the toy slid out and i left mortified 
 imagine explaining what had happened to <unk> staff and watching them trying not to laugh 
 i could n't look anyone in the eye including my family for the next year 
 tl dr electrocuted myself with a sex toy and was sent to a & amp e after my vagina would n't let go 
 update : wow front page 
 : to answer a couple questions 
 yes my vagina is working properly there was no lasting damage 
 have n't used a toy since haha : and it was n't the wand thing i used : d just a regular vibrator that was plugged in whilst charging : i 'm british so sorry for using a & amp e which means accident and emergency : and i 've never questioned electrocuted until i read the comments 
 : d some of these comments have me crying 
 this happened like 20 minutes ago <unk> 
 so for some back story here our house has two bathrooms the old nasty one my siblings and i share and the glorious palace of a <unk> that my parents have attached to their bedroom 
 it 's larger than my bedroom and has a jacuzzi and all kinds of goodies 
 anyway we recently got a new clutch of chickens and they are still too small to survive the outdoor nights so they spend the night in a cardboard box in the chateau de <unk> 
 so here 's the fu 
 i had just come in from cutting the grass 
 i have pretty nasty <unk> so <unk> # 1 was get this shit off me 
 so i head to my normal shower but it is occupied by my sister it 's worth noting she usually takes at least an hour to empty her bowels so i figured my parents are n't home yet i 'll use theirs 
 bad idea # 1. so i spend a good fifteen minutes using all the fancy <unk> and stuff i found in there and step out admiring the now steam filled palace 
 then it hit me 
 i do n't have a towel with me 
 no problem i thought there is a closet right behind the box with the chicks 
 so my american ninja warrior mindset kicked in 
 who cares if the floor is wet i can jump it 
 right 
 bad idea # 2. i slam butt first into the <unk> shaving filled shit hole and managed to burn my back on the heat light in the process 
 meanwhile all the chickens went full panic mode and started flying all over me in my birthday suit 
 i ca n't hold back a scream as my willy gets <unk> at by the force of 6 angry peeps 
 bad idea # 3 so my dad had gotten home in the time of my shower and he burst through the door concerned about my health and bam 
 he i am 
 butt naked 
 in a box 
 with 6 baby chickens 
 have n't left my room since 
 tl : dr caught naked with some chicks my <unk> got pecked by a pack of little peckers 
 edit we only keep the chickens in the box at night to prevent them from freezing 
 so it 's not a 24/7 thing 
 also no chickens died and my dad was not naked 
 okay so this was not today but years ago 
 when i was in 4th grade my little sister in 1st grade had to do a show-and-tell on what their favorite fruit was and present it to both my class and hers at once 
 my class had to be there to give my sister 's class experience in presenting to their peers or something i am not sure 
 i was unaware my class would watch her class 's presentation until the day of 
 the day before the presentation my little sister asked me what is my favorite fruit '' 
 and thinking she said food '' i said well you sure love ham a <unk> 
 day of the show-and-tell her classmates are presenting their favorite fruits in front of all of us 
 i realize oh no ... she said <unk> not <unk> yesterday '' 
 she was in line to the front of the class with a proud look on her face not realizing the impending doom 
 she gets to the front of the room and holds up a fucking slice of ham in a little ziplock baggie 
 she states confidently my favorite fruit is ham ” the <unk> of my class and hers laughed in her face 
 the teacher had to explain to her that ham is not a fruit while i was silently shaking with laughter 
 i couldn’t make eye contact with my sister for a few days after that 
 she still brings it up to this day 
 edit : okay so i have not made contact with my sister yet 
 i am sure she will kill me maybe i should write my last will and testament here 
 edit edit : my sister username <unk> said i 'm going to make you wish it did n't happen either 
 <unk> your sister '' bring it on sis bring it <unk> to give credit to my little sister she asked me what her favorite fruit was 
 and i <unk> her said ham '' 
 she believed me because being 3 years older than her she trusted my authority on what is and is not a fruit 
 sorry sis i love ya 
 also thank you for the gold 
 i can use it to make me feel better about <unk> my sister 
 ha just kidding this is hilarious i expect a more embarrassing story to show up on reddit soon from her about me 
 that 's just straight up karma but i will ride this high for a while until my inevitable <unk> 
 like most of the tifu stories this did n't happen today but rather 5 years ago when i was about 12 years old 
 my brother we 'll call him mike and i were in my room late at night bored when he showed me his new laser pointer he 'd just bought 
 after minutes of messing around with the laser my 12 year old mind thought it would be a funny idea to shine the laser up my brother 's ass to see his lit up anal cavity 
 keep in mind we were just weird little 12 year olds when this happened so we did n't think it was all that odd 
 after a few minutes of exploring the depths of my brothers butthole we both thought it would be even funnier to poke a hole through a water bottle and pour water up his butt and then shine the laser to see what that looked like ... we did this and mike muttered the words i do n't feel good '' because honestly who would feel good with water poured up their butt 
 what happened next was a moment of my childhood that i 'll never forget and is still one of the most embarrassing moments of my life 
 my dad opened the door to see the sight of me shining a laser in my brothers butt 
 this must have been <unk> for my brother because he tensed up and shot poop water directly in my face as my poor dad witnessed the entire scene 
 my dad immediately closed the door once he saw this and he has n't spoken a word of it since 
 **tl dr : ** shined laser and poured water in brother 's butthole dad walked in frightened brother spewed his butt juice on my face 
 **edit** : thanks to /u/cyae1 for narrating this tifu **edit 2 : ** thanks for the gold 
 **edit 3 : ** wow 
 did not expect all the <unk> and i 've been reading comments all night laughing 
 as for my brother i showed him the post and he ca n't believe this is so popular also he seems to be <unk> the worst part of his childhood 
 so it was n't today but last week 
 my son is 6 years old and has recently become obsessed with cars and <unk> so being an idiot i thought it would be great to show him the transformers movie 
 now i have not seen the movie in a few years 
 and i do n't know if you remember but in the movie <unk> the main character is in his room with the door locked 
 his parents come up and try to get in and ca n't 
 his mother them asked him if he is masturbating 
 my son being curious asked what that means and i panicked and decided to tell him it just means playing with toys 
 he accepts this <unk> and i hope he forgets about it 
 the next day comes and my wife calls him down to dinner 
 she asked what he was doing up in his room and he says wanting to be cool like to movie that he was masturbating i start laughing and she yells what '' 
 he replies that he was just masturbating with the new toys i bought him 
 i at this point can not stop laughing and she asks him where he learned that word 
 after we figure everything out we explain only <unk> can use that word 
 sorry for poor english and grammar 
 english is not my first language edit : i 'm on the first page 
 wow 
 thanks everyone 
 also i have taken some of your advice and talked to my son to clarify some issues 
 i basically told him masturbating is what grown ups do on their own in their rooms '' 
 and to ask me again when he turns 10 to learn more i hope this will clarify previously stated issues some of you had about my <unk> 
 thank you for all the feedback i shall read every single comment you leave 
 thank you 
 edit : thank you for the gold stranger 
 i have never had gold before 
 i 'm happy you enjoyed my post 
 thank 
 i was eye flirting with this girl earlier while pumping gas 
 she came over and introduced herself 
 being the flirting dude i am i smoothly smiled and said <unk> '' 
 i wanted to say <unk> but i screwed up and she laughed and went back to her car and left after pumping gas 
 so this literally just happened ... i went over to subway for lunch and there was a large black man in line in front of me talking on his phone all the way up to the order line 
 the woman taking his order was rightfully pissed off at him for ignoring her and continuing to talk on the phone when he finally hung up saying call me back in a minute i need to order this shit '' 
 he progressed to place his order changing the bread choice 3 times and then demanding they put <unk> on the bread before they toast it 
 this is where things start to get ugly 
 as he is arguing with the lady behind the counter his phone goes off and a photo of a large black woman pops up onto his phone in a bikini of all things trying to look sexy ... or so i would assume 
 the name chocolate butter '' caught my attention on the screen and that 's when things start to go horribly wrong 
 i burst out laughing uncontrollably only to have this massive beast make eye contact with his phone and then me ... his eyes looked like they could kill 
 he kept looking at me not blinking as my laughter slowly <unk> to a smirk 
 what the fuck you laughing at 
 you laughing at my butter 
 fuck you '' 
 he took a step in my direction and i noped the fuck out of there ... i 'm currently sitting back at my desk in my office without any food 
 sorry butter lover going to start off by saying that this person <unk> a really good friend before this this is happening <unk> <unk> 
 1. start seeing a girl 2. girl and i have fucked up thoughts and say the worst things to each other 
 3. we love each other a fucking ton 4. end up showing an out of context joke between us about her period 5. basically saying things like * '' bitch you wanted this you asked for it you like this do n't you yeah take this <unk> mess you little bitch '' * to each other 
 we me and the girlfriend think its hilarious 
 6. i being the stupid shit i am think my good friend will also find it hilarious 
 7 
 <unk> 8. turns out she is a <unk> feminist justice warrior <unk> her words not mine <unk> to google justice <unk> and is calling me every fucking name in the book sexist <unk> woman <unk> <unk> <unk> male etc has started making <unk> posts about me on facebook and twitter 
 9. the fucked up part is that the girlfriend was the one who said the things she is upset about 
 gf is now defending me and they are fighting gf has expressed she wants me to drop this person as a friend 
 10. girl has threatened to bring friends to teach me a lesson '' to my gf 
 11. gf laughed and told her to do it she knows i can stand my ground and said she will be there to watch 
 at this point ... i 'm not sure what to do 
 this went from funny to me having to potentially defend myself for my gf jokes about herself to some overly sensitive person ... **tl dr** gf & amp i joke around about periods tell friend she blows out of <unk> and threatens me with violence gf <unk> situation 
 -- - **update 1** i blocked her 
 this only added fuel to the fire according to gf who has yet to block her **update 2** her friends are jumping in on it messaging me directly 
 apparently i promote rape and self hate 
 -- - **update 3** they contacted my place of work 
 my boss is calling me ... **update 4** my boss is on the floor laughing did n't know <unk> were a real thing -- - **update <unk> what a rollercoaster this has been 
 so one kid lets say his name is <unk> asks me if i said those things wow what a cool dude everyone else just jumped on me i tell john which one were mine and which one were hers he tells me that 's not what the girl is telling everyone and how she is portraying it so my gf confirms what i 'm saying to john 
 now john is livid ... john hates being lied to 
 john is a really cool dude at this point in my eyes i can see us being bros. so john goes back to this hivemind and essentially starts telling them the true story 
 john is <unk> of <unk> to them so they all start believing john and turning on the girl 
 girl posts a video of her crying gf shows me saying that john is spreading lies and now nobody is believing her 
 john comes back saying that this girl likes me and was trying to break me and my gf up 
 i have no idea how she would do that since it was my gf messages 
 she thought if people hated me my gf would leave me 
 what 
 she tells my gf to tell me she is sorry and has started deleting all of her posts and videos and my gf told her that i want nothing to do with this and she 's toxic etc and to go cry to someone else 
 **tl dr** john is a total bro girl gets <unk> from her hivemind gf tells girl to get <unk> and girl was trying to use this to <unk> my relationship 
 -- - i showed this to my boss he 's laughing even more now and learning a bunch of new words and says you all are <unk> tonight the wife made italian <unk> with garlic bread it was delicious to the last bite 
 2 large glasses of milk to wash it all down and i was ready to pass out for the night 
 i had just fed the puppy and she was finishing up her food as i <unk> down onto the couch 
 i was laying facing towards the couch when i felt the burn and the pressure building the compilation of smelly foods that i had <unk> an hour ago was already sending it 's own <unk> '' in the pacific rim sense toward the portal to our world in my nether regions 
 upon releasing my <unk> i could tell it was a particularly foul smelling concoction as it literally burned when it passed through the poop shoot canal 
 i had not realized my dog had come over to see what the loud crack of noise was and decided on saying hello to me while she was there 
 i rolled over to see the final seconds of a face of complete and utter terror 
 i burst out laughing hilariously while apologizing to her but she was frozen in place 
 i do n't think anything could have ever prepared her for what she just had experienced 
 she eventually started to walk away and i rolled back over to rest and then i heard her <unk> 
 she puked everywhere on the area rug that my wife bought a few years ago 
 guess she could n't handle the dutch oven she stuck her nose into any longer and just lost control of the dinner she just had 
 tldr : farted on my dog on accident laughed <unk> turned around and she threw up all over the rug from what i can only determine to be the smell of halfway <unk> <unk> this afternoon i was mid fap and i heard my phone buzz 
 i looked over and saw that i had received a snapchat from a girl that i know pretty well from my <unk> team who is also pretty hot 
 so feeling frisky i decided that right before the moment <unk> i would open the snapchat and cum to her picture 
 i was fapping away and was almost about to come when i opened the picture ... it was a picture of a dead pigeon she had found lying on the street 
 at this exact moment i came and because i was caught off guard it got all over my shirt and <unk> after a few seconds of cumming the entire realisation of shame and disgust came over me and i hobbled to the toilet to clean myself up 
 tl dr : <unk> to a dead <unk> just this morning 
 while brushing our teeth i left the water running which i usually do n't 
 my son says to me we need to conserve water you should turn that off '' 
 it was so unexpected especially coming from my little dude that i reacted without thinking and asked what are those godless liberals teaching you at school '' 
 of course kids pick up new interesting phrases and he started <unk> it back to me all morning and all the way to his <unk> 
 apple juice is godless liberals i do n't want it '' 
 mommy is that tree a godless liberal '' 
 mommy traffic is godless liberal '' 
 godless liberals are making the air stink '' 
 as we 're passing the local paper mill 
 i really really tried to <unk> him saying it but damn it was funny and i laughed just a little too much 
 i did n't notice all last week but they 're doing a <unk> '' theme at school this month and he noticed me noticing all the <unk> swag on the walls when we walked in 
 so of course the first thing he says when we greet his teacher is <unk> water is godless liberals '' 
 <unk> 
 now everyone thinks i 'm a raging <unk> <unk> 
 i mean there are worse things to be in south <unk> but damn 
 tl dr <unk> just read it you lazy godless liberal 
 edit : removed personal information dude deleted it anyways 
 edit 
 part <unk> : first thanks for the gold 
 there goes my cherry 
 second holy shit 
 <unk> 's are out in force 
 i 'm a godless liberal living in the seat of religious political <unk> 
 you got ta laugh to keep from crying sometimes 
 calm <unk> 's not a very entertaining story but it will have a good moral at the end for all you young people about my stupidity 
 slightly nsfw 
 i had a <unk> of 4 years and we broke up 
 there 's a quote from an old movie that goes something like this : you can love them all your life and then stop loving on thursday 
 you know it comes to a point when you just ca n't bear the person anymore even if you still love them 
 so when we broke up it was n't even hard or bad i was relieved 
 for the first time in years i felt some peace in my soul this <unk> and i almost remembered what it 's like to be happy 
 and i thought to myself that i want this feeling to stay i will not do anything against my will ever again and will be open to everything i come across 
 just let go and flow with the tide right 
 of course it backfired just a couple of days later 
 my friend had a birthday and we went to the woods camping for three days 
 and there was this girl : 19 years old <unk> great tits and was the most strange thing ever — seems like she was into me 
 so we hit it 
 my friends at this point do n't know me and my gf broke up so they 're giving me these angry looks like wtf man 
 what are you doing 
 are you seriously considering doing her 
 that was hard to <unk> and also funny in some weird way 
 anyway we get drunk and she 's more and more willing 
 i have to say that i 'm a shy guy 24 and never even came up to a girl on the street and all my sexual adventures '' was with someone i knew for some time and i never had any random one night stands 
 this is new strange and exactly what i want cause hey i 'm a yes man for tonight 
 my friends are already starting to be vocal trying to pun me and joke about us so i get pissed at them mostly because implying she 's a whore may offend her and then i wo n't get any say them to fuck off and storm off to the beach alone thinking it 's over and they <unk> done it to piss me off and to prevent me from having sex those bastards 
 and then she comes like nothing happened calms me and we almost have sex right there on the beach 
 we run to my <unk> drunk as hell hot and all over each other 
 she 's probably the most gorgeous woman i 've been with : young very smooth skin big tits and ass lips that you wan na just bite off and the <unk> most magnificent pussy ever 
 we undress each other and i lay on the bottom and then something terrifying happens : she starts giving me a blowjob and i close my eyes but in a minute she stops and sits on me 
 i was n't prepared for that 
 i sobered for a second because i did n't use a condom and she 's already fucking me 
 never having any unprotected or with an <unk> partner sex this really <unk> me even through all the alcohol 
 i was so mad at her for not saying anything for just going in never asking me shit and all that but in the end it 's my fault and responsibility too so i say something like hey <unk> move '' dump her off me and finally get a condom from by backpack 
 we proceed and i fall asleep with the thing on 
 what can go wrong right 
 she 's 19 <unk> girls are shy and <unk> right 
 you probably can guess what happens next ... we did it again the next night 
 and then couple of times again when we returned to the city 
 protected now of course 
 it was awesome but i could n't get that first time out of my head 
 but in a week my dick starts to hurt more and more and i freak out 
 i go to the doctor and get like 7 or 8 tests done even for hiv because fuck it 
 <unk> — herpes 
 i have a fucking herpes probably the worst thing after hiv cause you ca n't cure it 
 i had unprotected sex <unk> one time in my life for less than a minute with a young and <unk> girl and bam — herpes 
 i have a <unk> immune system and it sticks and i have to eat <unk> every damn day or i get <unk> and ache on my penis 
 probably for life 
 oh and also now i need to have the talk '' about it with every woman i 'll intend to have a serious relationship 
 she even said to me once that her mother always told her it 's better to have an <unk> than get pregnant 
 lol 
 yup 
 do n't get me wrong the disease itself is fine you live a normal life like with an <unk> just eating pills from time to time 
 it 's my own fault and i promised myself to never be sorry about that week 
 what gets me is this ... <unk> i 've got 
 the only time in years i let myself go and this happens instantly 
 stupidity alcohol nice tits and you can lose your head and do the <unk> things 
 it could 've been worse 
 but it could 've been much <unk> better it 's been almost a year since that and i still do n't know how will i tell a girl i really like because fuck one night stands that i 'm sick and we 'll have to deal with that 
 **tl dr** : had first unprotected sex ever <unk> herpes 
 do n't do that 
 the moral of this story is simple : kids always use a condom and do n't you ever fuck a stranger even if it 's a hot barely legal girl that wants you bad 
 edit : here is what happened after edit : people are suggesting i might had it before 
 i read a lot about it double checked it talked to a few doctors and i 'm sure that was the date and place i got it 
 my ex tested negative yup i told her just in case and my previous relationship was almost 6 years ago so having health issues with immune system i think there would be some <unk> in 6 years if i had it before or i would transmitted it to my gf of 4 years 
 hopefully last edit : so this is over 2000 posts now i ca n't catch on 
 if <unk> have any questions please pm me i ca n't read all these posts 
 **last one important edit** : i 've had so many pm 's people asking advice or what to do so i decided to keep this account 
 if you have any troubles questions or just want to talk to someone feel free to pm me i will read and answer to <unk> met a girl a few weeks ago and we 've been on one date so far just casual <unk> 
 today was our second date i invited her to my place and i was going to prepare dinner for us both and watch a movie 
 she told me before we met that she 's incredibly allergic to peanuts 
 no biggie 
 i 'm not too <unk> for peanuts but sometimes i cook with them 
 i buy some peanuts roast them grind them up a bit and put in a peppermill for when i feel a meal could use with a bit more <unk> <unk> 
 i use them maybe once a month 
 a buddy of mine is also allergic to peanuts so i do wash my things thoroughly so as to not have lingering <unk> for when he visits 
 so i make a beautiful dinner : pork roast rolled with prosciutto and olive oil with some vegetables and beans and a little bit of gnocchi 
 i made a nice sauce to go with it 
 to note i did n't add any peanuts 
 i ask her to set the table : she grabs <unk> knives spoons wine glasses salt shaker and peppermill 
 you can probably see where this is going but the tl dr is she grabbed the wrong peppermill she did n't grab the one sitting beside the salt shaker but instead went into a cupboard to get my peanutmill 
 <unk> some on her food took a bite and immediately had a violent reaction 
 she <unk> up could n't talk was burning up the whole nine yards for oh fuck what do i do 
 i went into her purse my father always told me to never go into a woman 's purse for any reason but i felt this was an emergency to look for an epipen 
 thankfully she had one 
 i 've got no idea how to use this thing : i know you jab it in your thigh or butt but is it over clothes 
 under clothes 
 reading instructions be damned i had to take her pants off 
 undid her belt slid down her jeans and unfortunately her underwear slid off when the pants came down 
 i get a good look at the sight but there was no time for that into her thigh the epipen went 
 she calms down a bit and 911 is called since i honestly do n't know what else to do 
 she hurriedly struggles to put her pants on and begins to cry and she sits in silence shaking for the ambulance 
 i feel real bad and have n't moved from my couch since 
 this happened just under two hours ago and have n't called her or received a call back 
 i 'm sure she 's okay but i do n't think this is how our second maybe final 
 date should have gone 
 **tl dr : <unk> date accidentally <unk> peanut dust on the meal i made 
 had a reaction 
 took off her clothes to use an epipen not knowing if it could be used over clothes or not 
 ** *update <unk> : i gave her a call and her mother picked up 
 i explained what happened and she said her daughter was fine 
 she 's resting right now and said she 'll have her give me a call tomorrow 
 she completely understands and says she is n't upset just awkward the date turned out like that 
 *update 2* : she stopped by about fifteen minutes ago completely <unk> and wanted to apologize to me for how she reacted 
 i do n't know why she 's apologizing : she did n't do anything wrong but she gave me a hug and said we can continue the date another day but asked me why i had peanuts in a peppermill 
 *update <unk> : to those asking why i have a peanutmill '' it 's just for ease of use 
 if a recipe calls for a dash of peanut dust or something i 'm not going to take out my mortar and <unk> take out a peanut or two grind it up then put in the meal every time i need 'em 
 i put them in a food processor so they 're small enough to fit in a peppermill put it in the mill then whenever i need it it 's handy 
 i 'm sure lots of people put things other than pepper in a peppermill for a similar reason 
 i keep my peanutmill '' in the cupboard and the peppermill and salt shaker on my <unk> 
 i would n't have assumed she 'd have to look for the peppermill and stumble upon the peanuts else i 'd have hidden them a bit more 
 *update <unk> : here 's a way i 'd use a peanutmill : - chicken breast <unk> maybe 
 <unk> so it 's thin - knead peanut dust into the meat add salt and pepper - wrap in prosciutto keep a small <unk> or something on the top side to keep it bound if it does n't readily stay put - <unk> in <unk> olive oil on medium heat with half a crushed <unk> of garlic - i 'm not good at <unk> <unk> so i usually go 4-5 minutes flipping two or three times and then cut a piece off to check inside - set the wrapped breast aside to rest - add a knob of butter to the remaining olive oil 1 or 2 crushed <unk> a small squirt of tomato puree 
 <unk> with red wine only a little bit - reduce add corn <unk> + water for desired <unk> - apply to chicken breast and peanut dust also goes well with <unk> 'd vegetables mushrooms or just on top of food 
 most of the ways i use it is kneading into meat or on top of things 
 it 's wonderful on salmon 
 *update 3* : she 's inviting me to her house tonight she lives with parents so they can see the goof who almost killed their daughter 
 none of them are upset they think it 's hilarious 
 then we 're going to go see a movie 
 <unk> <unk> : her family is real cool and completely understanding 
 they like me and i like them 
 we <unk> our movie date and i 'm spending the night here 
 i think i 'm in <unk> did this earlier today and the anxiety rash is still fresh 
 i work in healthcare and it 's in an <unk> part of town in florida ... .so we get some interesting names and people 
 mind you my first name is very very strange by any typical standards thanks to my super traditional <unk> parents so i understand the struggle from a personal perspective 
 i do <unk> <unk> care and we see a lot of variants of names for little kids that were clearly taken from a <unk> individual but altered to make it unique 
 i 've seen <unk> of mercedes and <unk> i could have never been creative enough to come up with myself 
 when it comes to places : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> etc 
 and contrary to popular belief this is not just one kind of <unk> doing this with their kids 
 i think it 's more a southern thing than a race thing 
 anyway i 've worked here long enough that i know the drill - parents calls about a kid take down information if its a weird name have them spell it out 
 sometimes i 'm the only one <unk> phone calls and we have 3 or 4 lines lit at once - so i really need to do things as quickly and as efficiently as possible so everyone is reached in adequate time 
 here 's where i fuck up 
 had a patient call and say her child 's name is malaysia 
 i 've seen many variants on this name so for <unk> 's sake i ask her if it 's spelled like the country 's name 
 ... <unk> had no idea what i was talking about 
 i tried to brush by it and just spell it out rather than ask that question again 
 honestly all i really needed was an accurate spelling 
 i did n't realize at the time mom had just been floored by my <unk> harmless question 
 what in the hell you mean like the country '' 
 ma'am i apologize i just needed the spelling of your child 's name for medical record purposes 
 <unk> is correct '' 
 hold the <unk> up 
 you said country 
 you <unk> me there 's a country named after my child '' 
 no ma'am 
 well yes ma'am 
 but the country i think came first 
 it 's been around a while it 's in asia 
 what 's her date of birth '' 
 you tryna make fun now 
 you think you so smart and i 'm so dumb that you can say something like that about my child 's name and i wo n't catch it '' 
 no ma'am 
 i just am trying to get you into triage quickly ma'am 
 i 'm sorry 
 i did n't mean any offense 
 i just used the country for reference 
 i apologize '' 
 i start to clam up realizing this is <unk> from her raised tone of voice 
 fuck you and your <unk> ass talking to me like i do n't fucking know <unk> and shit that 's some fucked up dumb shit you racist you trying to judge and think i wo n't catch it no <unk> uh i want to speak to your supervisor right this second '' 
 anyway so now i have to do sensitivity training because i 'm an asshole and she did n't know malaysia was a country and not just her baby daddy 's favorite cousin 's name 
 **edit : ** i 've heard <unk> stories about things people say in healthcare settings and just ignorance in general from all levels <unk> and <unk> of people coming through 
 this is by far my <unk> yet 
 **second edit based on the messages i 'm getting : ** guys i 'm an asian woman with a strange as hell name 
 and <unk> redditors you guys know what i 'm talking about 
 **final edit hopefully : ** i did my sensitivity training early this week and everything is all good 
 pub subs for those of you that know them were a lunch option and the day was n't as terrifying as i had initially thought 
 thanks for all the support guys : and for all of you <unk> folk out there - go work in retail/clerical/call center type jobs and see how you feel 
 if you 're feeling brave try one in the south 
 i was at <unk> and was picking up some yogurt 
 most people know that there are usually people behind the yogurt and dairy sections of <unk> 
 when the displays get empty they load more in from the back 
 well there was a guy working behind the yogurts while i was picking them out 
 and it was extremely dark in that back space 
 and the guy working was black 
 so while i was reaching for the yogurts in the back i feel something smooth that does n't feel like a wall 
 i 've accidentally touched the guy 's face 
 i do n't think i 've sprinted away from anywhere faster than that 
 luckily there were n't many people around to see me.so my coworker recently showed me <unk> and we currently have a running joke in the office with the microwave which most people can hear from their offices 
 well i came in from lunch a little late and did not realize there was a meeting going on in the conference room 
 i have the door to my office about <unk> shut and did not see who walked into the kitchen 
 i few mins go by and i hear the microwave finish beep beep '' and bellow a solid <unk> <unk> 
 i just hear a confused what '' from an unfamiliar voice 
 it was a middle eastern guy that is our company 's main contact for a large account that we manage 
 i run out and try to explain that it is a thing on the internet and just a joke but it one of those things were you are walking on thin ice around a dicey subject and you start digging yourself deeper into a hole edit : grammar edit 2 : can gold be converted into a <unk> value i might need it jk and thank you stranger : so to start i 'll let you know i had a very big night last night and drank more than i should have 
 a lot more than i should have 
 anyways cut to this morning i wake up feeling surprisingly ok and have the biggest craving for some chicken nuggets 
 so i had down to the hungry jacks just down the road and proceed to eat 6 nuggets before i get the overwhelming urge to throw up 
 so being the polite person i am i run to the nearest bin outside which unbeknownst to me at the time had a pigeon <unk> on the food inside 
 i had already began violently vomiting up the contents of my stomach into the bin and all over this pigeon which then promptly freaked the fuck out and flew up out of the bin <unk> my vomit back up all over me in the process 
 last night my wife and i went to dinner an a <unk> sit down restaurant 
 it 's been a very good year for us financially and once a month we go out to eat and we will anonymously pay for a person 's meal 
 we usually try to find an older person who eats alone because it 's kind of sad and helps remind us of how lucky we are to have each other 
 so last night we sit down and we notice three separate people eating alone 
 right behind us is an <unk> 80 something year old black lady 
 she is almost finished so we tell our server to pick up her ticket and add it to our bill and to not let her know it was us 
 she was very <unk> and walked out with a huge smile on her face 
 the second person was an older gentleman with white hair and a <unk> 
 when he found out his meal was free he told the server to tell us thank you and he left with a smile on his face 
 the last person was a man in his 70 's 
 he was seated to our immediate right and when he asked the server for his ticket she told him that it was paid for by another <unk> 
 this guy flipped his shit 
 he started screaming at the top of his lungs 
 i do n't need anyone to pay for my meal 
 i can pay for my own meal '' 
 he started waving his arms in the air and going berserk 
 the server tried to calm him down and told him that if it was that important he could pay for his own meal 
 that seemed to calm him down and as he walk out of the room he turned back and shouted whoever tried to pay for my meal fuck you to hell '' 
 and he walked out 
 i have been doing this for years and i wo n't stop but i have to admit that made my night 
 <unk> thanks for the gold 
 <unk> # <unk> i appreciate all of the positive comments 
 not everyone is going to agree that paying for a stranger 's meal who can obviously afford it is the right thing to do '' 
 we also pay for service member 's meals whenever we can 
 we also donate quite a bit to charities 
 as i posted in a response earlier my mom is <unk> and these people remind me of my mother 
 they also serve to remind me of how much i would miss my amazing wife if she were no longer with me 
 my children live 1800 miles and <unk> miles away 
 if my wife were to die i would be the old man eating alone 
 while i ate i would be reminded of my wife i am sure 
 if someone were to pay for my meal i would like to think that it would brighten my day 
 that 's all there is to this 
 nothing more 
 we just want to brighten someone 's day 
 yes there are probably other ways that some of you think are more important but kindness does not have <unk> bought a cuckoo clock for my wife as a <unk> present 
 we moved in placed the furniture hung some pictures and all was right with the world 
 i hung the cuckoo clock on a short wall beside the window in the living room 
 it looked great and she loved it 
 the next day we went off to work 
 around 4 that afternoon i get a call from the police 
 they said they had to <unk> me <unk> because i hadn’t answered the number on file with the security company i immediately checked my cell and it was dead 
 there was a problem at the house and i was told the police were waiting for me 
 i asked what the problem was and the response was “can i let them know you’re on your way ” after i said yes that was the end of the call 
 i get home to find two police cars in the driveway 
 i got out of the car and walked over to them and asked what was going on 
 the first cop said <unk> for <unk> then put up his index finger 
 a few seconds later the house alarm starts blaring 
 “it’s been doing this all <unk> they told me even after the alarm company shut it down 
 the house was secure but the police went in first to clear it while i was on the phone with the alarm company getting instructions on how unplug the box and take out the battery 
 i was issued a ticket with a pretty hefty fine for repeated calls to a false alarm 
 the security company came in the next day to inspect the system 
 i was mad and <unk> 
 he couldn’t answer for why the system did not remotely shut down only saying that they reset themselves 
 still not sure about that 
 either way i was all set to name them in a suit for the fines and court costs until the guy said <unk> your <unk> 
 he showed me that i had hung the cuckoo clock next to a motion sensor 
 i brought pictures with me to court and the judge had a good laugh 
 he reduced the fine but basically called me an idiot 
 i can’t argue 
 tl/dr : don’t hang a cuckoo clock beside a motion sensor 
 so this happened like 3 weeks ago 
 me and my girlfriend of 3 years were sitting on her bed whilst she was doing here make-up and i was watching some tv 
 usually we have these weird conversations that do n't even make sense 
 we started talking about how everything we know and see could be fake and that it could all be part of our own imagination 
 when we stopped talking for a couple of seconds she looked at me and said : <unk> you are n't real either '' 
 my girlfriend is the type of girl that is easy to persuade when it comes to these things and is interested in supernatural things so i knew i had to do something evil 
 at this point im not even looking at her anymore and she continued doing her make-up 
 i lowered my voice and softly whispered : ''i 'm not real '' 
 loud enough for her to hear but she still did n't look at me 
 she then said : ''i mean it could be 
 maybe you are just someone i made up in my mind and i 'm just talking to myself right now '' 
 slowly i went to the other side of the bed while she was still talking about the same topic 
 when i finally got to the other side i hid myself behind the bed she could not see me if she turned around 
 she did n't look up for like 30 seconds but when she did she freaked out 
 real bad 
 real fast 
 she started crying out of nowhere because she really thought for a second that i did n't exist 
 i tried not to laugh and still hid myself but after 10 seconds of hearing her cry i showed myself 
 we did n't talk for 2 days

 the truth is that she has this thing that if she gets scared real bad she starts to cry first time she did i just did n't know she would be like this 
 the reason she did n't want to talk to me was because i could n't stop laughing and did n't take her serious 
 i still bring this up if i need a good laugh hope you did too 
 edit : we both laugh about it now and she does n't mind it all 
 we are both looking through the comments and we cant believe the theories people come up with to give this all a reason 
 she got scared - she cried - we laughed in the end 
 also my native language is n't english so <unk> wo n't be on point all the time 
 edit : thanks for the gold kind stranger i was christmas shopping with my wife i 'm 32 years old and she decided to go to ross 
 for those of you who do n't know ross is mostly a clothing store 
 she was going to buy some clothes so i decided to wait for her outside the changing rooms on some chairs they had 
 while i waited i was playing pokemon heart gold 
 i had just beaten the 2nd gym and was looking for the <unk> cut when this little kid who could n't have been older than 8 or 9 sat down next to me with his ds 
 he asked me what pokemon game are you playing '' 
 and i told him heart gold 
 he then pops out the game in his ds and puts in a copy of soul silver 
 i could see where this was going 
 i then playful exclaimed i challenge you to a pokemon battle '' 
 and i started heading back to a pokemon center so i could battle him 
 this is where the fuck up happens 
 i always nickname my pokemon really dumb <unk> 
 for example my <unk> 's name is <unk> '' and my <unk> 's name is penispump '' 
 right when we started the battle i asked if we could restart because i just noticed the name 
 of course his mom walks to him and looks at his ds and then looks at me in horror 
 she then starts yelling at me and causing a scene 
 i tried to calm her down but she was threatening to call the police 
 needless to say i head out to the car and waited for my wife to finish <unk> is from when i was young which is quite a few years ago before internet porn 
 first of all a bit of <unk> information 
 our house was in a cul-de-sac up on a hill and it was the only <unk> house in a neighborhood of <unk> houses 
 we were close to the road too so our house was very visible from everywhere in the neighborhood 
 when i was a teenager my parents worked late hours and i had the house to myself well into the evening 
 quite often i would spend a couple of hours leisurely browsing a stack of <unk> magazines that my father thought he had hidden from me 
 i had a particular jerking method i used 
 i would go upstairs to the living room open a bunch of magazines to my favorite pages and lay them out on the floor 
 then i’d stand up and jerk off looking from one girl to another until i finally came 
 i’d make this last as long as possible going slowly when i was close and then picking up speed again at the end 
 i could go for ages 
 what somehow escaped my attention was that the living room light silhouetted me through the curtains and projected my jerking off to the entire neighborhood like a <unk> warning families to keep their daughters away 
 i did this for years without realizing that everyone knew exactly what i was doing 
 no wonder the neighbors avoided us 
 lt dr : tifu by <unk> myself masturbating to the whole neighborhood like the <unk> of a lonely virgin 
 edit : thanks for the gold 
 edit2 : narrated by cyae1 
 edit3 : some people have been asking about how the <unk> looked how i knew etc 
 here is a diagram of the room 
 as for how i found out there was no great reveal 
 it was just a private <unk> of realization and embarrassment as the pieces mentally fell together one day 
 so my wife met an old friend of hers a few days ago and decided to invite her over with her husband for a dinner 
 we recently moved to a new <unk> and i guess <unk> wanted to show off how nice of a kitchen we have 
 i had a vague memory of who that friend is and i remember i did n't like her too much - let 's call her x for this story 
 anyway we prepared an oriental meal together for them we like oriental food and it 's what we usually cook for our guests too 
 x arrived with her husband soon after and we all sat for the dinner 
 it was n't going that bad at first i made them laugh with a few jokes and we had a pleasant conversation 
 suddenly x pulled out a hair out of her chicken strip 
 it was long and she looked at it with disgust 
 my wife turned all red and started to frantically apologize while x looked at us with that face of disgust and <unk> she 's a bit of a <unk> and clearly a false woman i really have no idea why my wife is friends with her 
 i wanted to save the day somehow my thoughts were racing and without any second thought i spilled the joke '' out of my mouth : ya know it could 've be worse could 've been a pube '' all of a sudden i have no idea why x puked all over her place at the table 
 she tried to cover her mouth with her hands but it did n't help too much 
 my wife was looking at me with eyes wide open 
 x let out some <unk> sounds and furiously walked towards the door slamming them 
 her husband gave us a quick look muttered sorry '' and rushed after her collecting her shoes from the corridor 
 my wife only said really 
 really '' 
 and closed herself in the bathroom 
 i think she 's taking a bath 
 i cleaned up all the mess but she still did n't leave the bathroom 
 **update : ** i think the things settled down a bit 
 my wife said i 'm the dumbest man ever but she still loves me 
 **update 2 : ** x husband texted us saying he 's sorry for the mess 
 according to my wife x did n't contact her yet 
 i hope it 'll remain that <unk> the past few months i have n't had sex or hooked up with anyone and i have n't even <unk> myself but last night i went home with this smoking hot guy and i had one thing on my mind : i was ready to end that 2 month streak 
 we are on the couch and things start getting steamy so i suggest we take it to his room 
 we are on the bed our clothes are coming off and this guy is turning me on like an <unk> oven 
 as soon as he has his fingers inside of me it 's like a juice box ruptured down there 
 his eyes are wide with surprise so i think he has n't encountered many like this if any 
 he slip and slides it in and he starts giving it to me good and my lady liquid just keeps flowing 
 i can feel it running down my legs my crack up my back 
 i am trying to enjoy this but i am starting to feel a little self-conscious because this guy 's face is showing concern 
 he flips me on top and i go for a ride but this just makes the whole thing worse 
 i can feel that his torso is literally drenched in my cum 
 it 's all both of us now 
 by the time he finished there was a puddle in the middle of the bed the length of my torso and double the width 
 we took the sheets off of the bed and the mattress was soaked too 
 now i have been known to get really wet 
 my ex used to juice my lady parts on a regular basis and he loved every minute of if 
 but i *never* squirted this much with the ex and this guy did n't seem to be all that into it 
 in fact he seemed a little frightened by it 
 and then i learned why 
 as i rolled away and chuckled nervously apologetic he say i hope <unk> does n't kill me '' 
 we were in his roommate 's bed apparently because his cousin was asleep in his 
 then i was mortified 
 i got dressed and left immediately 
 sorry <unk> this happened yesterday but i could n't post it as it was not the weekend 
 i put up my phone for sell on a local <unk> app because i upgraded and wanted a little cash to justify the cost of my new phone 
 it was up for a week or so and got a few dead end replies until yesterday 
 i got a email from someone who seemed very interested in the phone 
 they set up a time to come by and take a look and see if the phone worked on the network they had witch is a good practice when buying a used phone 
 so around 4pm i hear a knock on my front door i grab the phone and run to the door 
 i open it to find a girl and her dad smart move for bringing your dad 
 he proceeded to tell me his 15 year old daughter broke her phone and she saved up for months to buy a new one and he was happy i was giving her a good deal 
 they checked over the phone made sure it worked and cash was handed to me 
 i closed the door feeling a sign of relief that i had made back a little of my new upgrade and felt it was well justified 
 fast forward and hour later i get an email from her dad wanted to give me a call to talk about something 
 i was worried they had encountered an issue with the phone so i agreed 
 he gives me a call and says dad hey uh ... i wanted to let you know i came across some nude photos on the phone you sold me '' 
 at the moment i remembered i forgot to factory reset the device before i sold it 
 i thought this was the end i thought i was going to jail for exposing this 15 year old girl to such filth 
 me oh no 
 im so sorry i forgot to clean the phone 
 dad yeah i uh ... kinds figured the was the case i wanted to call you to see if you wanted these pictures back '' 
 me um ... ... no you can just delete them so your not mad '' 
 dad why would i be 
 its not the first time this has happened with something we have bought used 
 this is why i check through the device before giving it to my daughter 
 i called you to make sure the pictures were n't important and to remind you to factory rest your phone next time '' i told him how awesome of a parent he was and then slowly laid my head down on my desk and took a deep breath 
 holy shit 
 tl dr sold my used phone to a 15 year old girl that had nudes on it dad turned out to be awesome about it 
 edit : holy crap you guys are hilarious 
 the comments you have been leaving made me spit out various <unk> out my mouth through out the day 
 also thanks so much for the front page 
 love the reddit community & lt 3 at the school i go to there are <unk> for the entire student body however every student has a limit of how many pages they can print 
 this limit is supposedly enormous 
 i have been told by seniors i am a freshman that the limit is around 1000 pages 
 during my english class yesterday we got a chance to work on our <unk> which were due today 
 i had already finished mine and was bored so i held down <unk> and enter in my <unk> word document because i wanted to see how many pages i could create 
 after about 9000 pages i got bored again and saved my work and closed word 
 today i got to school and then realized that i had n't printed out the essay yet so i went to a school computer and sent it to the school printer but it did n't print 
 i tried a few more times but it still did n't work 
 then i emailed it to my friend and he tried to print it 
 guess what 
 it did n't print 
 my friend then noticed that the document had over 9000 pages that i totally forgot about 
 it was a sudden moment of realization that i had hit both mine and his print limit in a matter of minutes even though nothing had actually printed 
 we went to a teacher and explained the situation with emphasis on me being an idiot and he said it would be $ 10 each to reset our limits 
 so on monday i will be coming to school with $ 20 because today i fucked up 
 tl dr : forgot doc had 9000 pages used up my friend 's school printing limit along with my own 
 now down $ <unk> info : i 've done martial arts since i was a kid 
 my husband <unk> that and we <unk> sometimes for kicks and giggles 
 well the other day hubby was standing in the bedroom by the dresser watching the news so i thought that i 'd stroll up and lightly tap/kick his stomach and initiate some fun times 
 except i was wearing a pair of skinny jeans did n't get my leg up high enough and i ended up kicking him in the balls 
 also i snapped the kick at the end from pure muscle memory 
 the poor guy dropped to the ground and was in a fetal position for several minutes just looking up at me like wtf wife 
 i feel horrible 
 = edit : thanks for the gold kind internet stranger so this happened yesterday i 'm still trying to process it 
 i was at the library at my campus and i was putting the finishing touches on a lab report for my organic chemistry class 
 as soon as i get ready to leave this guy from the same program comes to sit next to me 
 a little background info ... this guy has made it a point to sit right next to me everywhere even when i 'm clearly trying to isolate myself 
 he asked me for my number and texts me afterwards <unk> saying it was good to see me even though we hardly talked 
 he then goes on to flirt blatantly with me i 'm a male by the way and i kindly try to <unk> him away to no avail 
 so back to the story he sees my finished report on the computer screen and asks if i 'd mind looking over his when he finishes 
 i say sure because it 's just glancing over and <unk> something no biggie 
 i tell him my email so he can send it to me 
 i say goodbye and go to my next class 
 after class i check my email and i see 5 messages 
 all from him 
 they all have a title talking about the lab report so i open the first one i see 
 there 's an image attached which is weird it should be a pdf 
 but i say whatever maybe he just elected to take a picture of it and send it instead of the file 
 there 's no thumbnail on the picture so going in blind i open it ... to see a picture of his genitals 
 i 'm afraid to open the other emails and i do n't think i 'm going to be replying to his texts anymore 
 edit : update 
 thanks to you guys i sent him an email and waited to get a response before updating 
 even though what he did is clearly too far i wanted to give him a chance before potentially devastating him with a report of the incident 
 so i emailed him saying that what he did is clearly harassment and that i am not interested in his advances 
 i said i do n't wish to cause him harm but if he continues with his advances i 'm afraid i will have to report him for harassment 
 yes i know it 's appropriate to report him right away 
 if he stops after this though i do n't need to ruin his life over it 
 so i get a reply back pretty quickly 
 it was readily apparent he did n't think of the consequences of sending such a thing literally over a school email of all things and he began to apologize profusely 
 he apologized for not coming to terms and <unk> the fact that i am not interested and claims he will leave me alone from now on realizing i will report him otherwise 
 hopefully this is resolved 
 if not i 'll update 
 edit : tl dr i emailed him saying i am not interested and to stop his advances or i will go through with reporting the incident 
 he replied understanding the <unk> apologizing and claiming to stop all advances 
 since so many people asked for updates i wanted to <unk> the masses with an update to this thread : the resume which was now in the garbage in 8 pieces could easily be <unk> to find the candidate 's email address 
 i then typed up this email : & gt dear name & gt thank you again for your interest in company 
 during the <unk> stages of our interview there may have been an event that could have been perceived as a negative reaction on my part 
 any such <unk> is regrettable and so i wanted to connect with you to clear up any <unk> 
 in fact in our company 's <unk> <unk> metric for interviewed candidates i even scored you as fairly competitive '' 
 best wishes here or elsewhere in this exciting stage of your <unk> search journey 
 & gt best & gt name next i copied and <unk> the email to reddit and deleted it since actually sending it would cause many redditor 's heads to literally explode and furthermore the candidate might respond by returning with a new resume and stapling it to my warm misunderstood heart 
 finally i went up to the hiring manager and we discussed the various candidates 
 as there were several that were essentially equally qualified and also several positions open a gentle <unk> in her direction was enough to get the woman hired 
 and there was much <unk> 
 yay ... admission 1 : this was never quite as dramatic or tragic a story as it might have seemed as the position is for a part-time <unk> professor 
 since usually they will teach classes at 2 or 3 colleges each semester getting or not getting a job from one college is probably not the end of the world 
 of course my original action was always a horrible <unk> that needed correction 
 but since we were able to get her hired and since i 'll see her shortly i 'm not going to awkwardly reach out now but instead laugh it off together when the time comes 
 admission 2 : through much of the first thread i felt like a wealthy land owner during the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of the working class <unk> really rising up at me : it was something to behold although i seemed to quickly develop a <unk> ability to dismiss negative feedback at will ah but never to <unk> it 
 tl dr : she was hired : <unk> yesterday morning started out like any other monday 
 getting to work around 8am i grabbed a cup of coffee and started going through the emails from the weekend 
 i have this co-worker in the cubicle next to me who is sometimes quite obnoxious 
 i 've occasionally had to tell her to quiet down when i was in the middle of a call because i could n't hear the person on the other end 
 well yesterday morning when i was in the middle of a call the same thing happened 
 she was making all of these strange loud noises and i could n't make out what the person on the other end of my phone was trying to say 
 so i yelled over the cubicle 'hey can you please be a bit more quiet i 'm on the phone 
 the noises did n't stop 
 so i was like wtf i put my call on hold and walked around to her cubicle to see why she could n't stfu 
 reddit ... she was having a seizure and i yelled at her 
 i immediately called 911 and ran to alert my boss 
 apparently she is mildly <unk> and she has seizures occasionally 
 she understood why i yelled at her but i still feel horrible about it 
 tl dr tifu by yelling at a girl who was having a seizure and not just being loud for no <unk> a teenage girl and my boyfriend spends a lot of time at our house 
 my parents are fine with it 
 my family has a pretty large lot and the back corner of the lot has a little group of trees and a hammock 
 it’s very secluded 
 i was relaxing in the hammock a few days ago when my boyfriend found me and decided to join me 
 one thing led to another and we started fooling around a little bit 
 then the hammock decided it wasn’t having any more of our shit 
 it gave out and we slammed into the ground 
 hard 
 the shocked noises and the sound of the hammock hitting the ground are enough to make my mom come running 
 my brother and sister followed 
 and what do they find 
 they find a <unk> girl in a <unk> bra and panties attempting to <unk> herself <unk> from the mildly <unk> <unk> <unk> boy lying on top of her 
 my mom jumps into action because first aid is practically a job <unk> when you have 9 kids 
 by the time we get inside our audience includes three of my brothers my sister my <unk> girlfriend and my sister-in-law 
 all of whom are trying extremely hard not to laugh hysterically in front of my mother 
 in the end my eldest brother had to take me to the hospital while my mom monitored my boyfriend for signs of imminent brain damage 
 two days later : * i’m wearing a massive <unk> cast on my left arm 
 * my siblings have only recently stopped giggling every time one of us enters the room 
 * two of my older brothers have made a jokes about giving my boyfriend another concussion if he didn’t keep his hands to himself 
 * my older sister has offered to take me bra shopping 
 * the story in explicit detail has been <unk> to three different family members 
 * i 've had to give my younger brother $ 10 to keep him from telling anyone at school 
 * multiple jokes have been made about how my boyfriend ca n't afford to suffer any more brain damage 
 * far too many of my immediate family members have <unk> their <unk> <unk> at us 
 * my mom is still obsessively <unk> my <unk> mental state 
 * my dad has asked us if we needed another talk about <unk> <unk> tl dr : boyfriend and i broke a hammock during sexy times 
 entire family thinks it 's hilarious 
 <unk> : ** it 's awesome to hear about all of the people with big families on here 
 there should be a sub for that 
 **edit2 : ** holy crap gold 
 thank you to <unk> and two other users 
 i will pay it forward 
 **edit3 : ** if anyone is interested i made a sub <unk> because a ton of people commented saying they had large families as well 
 parents siblings people with large extended families whatever 
 so i 'm <unk> to having a medical event called vasovagal syncope 
 in a <unk> it means that my <unk> nerve is retarded literally-people who have this condition from adolescence lose it as they age : when it <unk> a decline in blood pressure instead of increasing my heart rate and <unk> my blood vessels it does the exact opposite 
 this feeds back on itself until my blood vessels are so <unk> and my heart rate is so slow that i pass out 
 then my reflexes decides to play nice and correct itself 
 i 'm in my early 20s and i 've had less than a half dozen of these episodes 
 they 've only occurred when i was drinking heavily or was having blood drawn 
 today i went to my primary care physician and i had to have blood drawn 
 i had an afternoon appointment and <unk> through breakfast so i had n't eaten or drank anything in 16 hours 
 right after i had my blood drawn i had the worst vasovagal episode of my life 
 i could feel myself burning up sweating profusely and going into <unk> 
 i did what i was taught to do during an episode : i got out of the chair laid down on my back on the floor using my arms as pillows and put my feet up on the chair to <unk> <unk> to my brain 
 the lab technician called a code and several nurses came followed by office workers for reasons <unk> to me at the time 
 the last thing i saw before i passed was my spread out legs on the chair and my third leg pressing through my <unk> in between 
 i woke up outside the clinic 
 a nurse <unk> told me the following had happened : after i passed out she had taken my blood pressure and was unable to 
 she then took my pulse and could n't find one 
 for a while i was <unk> dead and <unk> on the ground with an erection note : during a vasovagal episode i experience <unk> throughout my body 
 meanwhile the clinic had some sort of <unk> <unk> and there was smoke coming out of the vents the office workers had come to the lab to inform us 
 the fire department had been called earlier and they arrived the <unk> is across the street and evacuated the clinic 
 the nurses could n't move me so the firefighters had to carry me out 
 i hope they did n't have to use a fireman 's carry the lab space was too small to fit a stretcher 
 tl dr : my body decided to make my heart stop and my blood pool in my penis at an unfortunate time and place 
 i took no precautions even though similar occurrences have occurred in the past 
 awkwardness ensues 
 edit : i just remembered this and want to share : for anyone wondering what dying and possible brain cell loss feels like ... it 's like an orgasm that 's 3 times as pleasurable as your best one seems to lasts for minutes a long time for a guy and <unk> with your vision fading to black from outside in 
 i thought i was ejaculating and that 's why i looked down before i passed 
 edit 2 : cyae1 did a great narration of this story : i 'm a daily train commuter and ride <unk> of the city with the missus 90 % of the time 
 today she worked from home and the empty seat next to me was eventually taken by a stranger a dude who happened to be one of those <unk> <unk> who thinks its ok to be <unk> <unk> his neighbor in order to <unk> his <unk> and while i’m completely within the <unk> of my own <unk> space 
 some people can <unk> and block out that kind of <unk> but i 'm not one of them though i 'm also not so <unk> that i 'd want to <unk> a stop touching me '' debate into a <unk> train car 
 so i 'm sitting there trying to nod off and not think about it but it 's pretty much impossible 
 i put on some relaxing music -- did n't help 
 i 'm starting to <unk> internally and even though it 's not like the guy was <unk> me the fact that his touching kept me from fading into a nap was driving me further and further into <unk> 
 suddenly it occurred to me that on an <unk> basis i 'm rubbing up against the person sitting next to me and so i just needed to think to myself that this person is simply my wife and to not focus on who it really is 
 it 's kathy 
 it 's kathy 
 it 's kathy '' i kept telling myself and it actually started to work 
 i was finally starting to doze off feeling that lovely <unk> <unk> begin to wash over me perhaps <unk> in part by mr. miles <unk> 
 i then suddenly awoke to the most aggressive shoulder shrug and opened my eyes to find suit dude looking at me with <unk> disgust and i immediately realized what had happened : once the <unk> “it’s <unk> <unk> reached the point of optimal <unk> with the process of falling asleep <unk> kicked in and i took a deep <unk> <unk> breath and <unk> my head into the <unk> shoulder not unlike the way a <unk> dog rubs its head against your hand in seek of loving pats 
 <unk> was said and faces were red and so began my day 
 tl dr - was dealing with <unk> touching from a dude sitting next to me on the train this morning 
 kept telling myself it was <unk> my wife as i tried to not think about it and nod off 
 wound up falling asleep and <unk> leaning into his shoulder 
 i picked up my 4 year old daughter at daycare yesterday 
 they have some playground equipment outside the building where the kids play 
 almost every time i pick my daughter up she runs to get a few more slides and <unk> in before we drive home 
 i decided to kill a few minutes and check my facebook out while her and some boy were playing by some fake wooden train 
 this guy i barely know on facebook had a video titled how to <unk> someone in 6 seconds '' 
 the main picture of the video was some guy looking at a boot on his car 
 looked like it might be funny so i clicked it ... ... bam 
 its a damn trick video that was playing the sounds of some woman moaning during sex 
 worse : my phone is on full blast 
 the phone is so loud the kids stop in a frantic and give me this wtf is going on '' look 
 i quickly try to stop the video but i guess the shock of it all stunned me.. took me a full 5 seconds to stop it 
 not sure who all heard it but i got out of there pretty fast ... .. hope they dont call the cops and get me on some list ... tl dr some dude had a gag video on facebook 
 i played it at my daughters <unk> 
 edit : 1 i 'm living in a foreign country 
 school <unk> do n't line up well 
 its basically like a <unk> but its daycare ... .. sorry for the confusion 2 also i went back <unk> no one said <unk> so i guess its all <unk> 3 i had my volume all the way up because i use my <unk> as a <unk> 4 no i did n't deserve that crap 
 its my daughters school 
 it has to be one of the worst places it could have happened ... edit : 2 thanks for the reddit gold 
 also i guess 2 days later.. i feel a bit better about the whole <unk> it looks like this really was n't a unique experience and lots of people have experienced this 
 2 i know my grammar is horrible my bad dogs 
 3 i live in a foreign country '' -- - i 'm an american living abroad ... is it really that weird to say that 
 i dunno 
 anyway thanks for listening <unk> this thread has run its course 
 so i am inspired by someone else 's tifu about giving a homeless man money 
 i too have a story from a couple years back where i fu 'd 
 i was in college and it was my junior year 
 i owned this really cool car that i had purchased in cash but in order to get the cash i borrowed part of the money from family friends 
 every month i would pay back some of the <unk> money about <unk> and per the rules of the contract i would bring that money in cash and visit with them 
 so one afternoon when i did n't have class i went to go run some errands and pay off these fine folks 
 i needed gas so i went to a gas station to fill up 
 i saw a beggar next to the entrance of the convenience store and i thought it would be good to get him something to eat and drink 
 so while my car is filling up i go inside and purchase a coke and sandwich 
 when i exit the convenience store to bring the food to the guy he 's gone 
 i looked around but he had left 
 a little disappointed i get in my car and toss the grocery bag into the passenger seat 
 i figured i could give it to someone else 
 i had some extra money from working and figured i would give these family friends two car payments 
 so i <unk> $ 500 which was enough for two car payments and some extra cash for ... stuff that has to be paid for in cash 
 that cash was given to me by the bank in a white envelope 
 i tossed the envelope into the passenger seat next to me 
 so i pull up to an intersection and perfect 
 another homeless beggar 
 so i honk my horn and he comes over to my car 
 my light turns green so i tell him god bless and hand him the lunch and go on my way 
 i glance over at the passenger seat and realizes the money is gone and perfectly timed 
 i look into my side view mirror to see the guy pulling the envelope out of the grocery bag 
 i had tossed the envelope into the lunch bag 
 so i quickly <unk> and park my car across from the intersection and run over to him 
 he 's already counting the money sees me and starts running 
 so here i am chasing a homeless man for money and yelling at him 
 i feel terrible but i 've got to have that money so i chase him for a couple blocks and finally tackle him in the <unk> of another intersection 
 so people are getting out of their cars and shit and trying to see what is going on and i 'm on top of this old man saying give me my money 
 i did n't mean to give it to you '' 
 and he starts crying 
 so then all these people start pulling me off of him and the homeless guy is saying i gave him money and then changed my mind 
 i look like a total dick but i try explaining my situation and this woman is calling the police but i see my envelope in the guy 's hand and so i quickly grabbed it 
 some guy tried to grab hold of me but i kind of sort of hit him and ran 
 i ran like hell back to my car and took off but it just looked like i had just assaulted people 
 i ended up driving around for an hour to get my wits and go to pay off my car 
 i never heard from the police 
 when i take a dump i always have some toilet paper in my hand folded up or sitting on my leg or the ledge of the bathtub 
 my wife always walks in on me when i 'm in there and over the years i 've developed this strange joke thing where i 'll stuff the toilet paper into my mouth when she walks in 
 i do n't know why i do it but she laughed at it years ago so i 've just kept it up 
 the toilet paper is always clean when i do that 
 she never walks in when i 'm wiping and if she does i would hear here coming and not wipe while she 's there i could never bring myself to wipe in front of her for some reason 
 well tonight i was wiping and of course i looked at what i wiped and the door swung open 
 i did n't miss a beat i stuffed the shit covered toilet paper right into my mouth 
 this was n't a <unk> wipe buildup this was number 1 the very first wipe the one with the most shit per square inch 
 this was n't a normally formed shit either it was <unk> chunky loose and for fucks sake it smelled horrid 
 as soon as it touched my tongue i gagged i gagged worse then i 've ever gagged before 
 then i puked 
 all the while my wife is just standing there laughing hysterically practically peeing her pants 
 thankfully the kids were down in the basement i did n't want them hearing or seeing what just happened 
 i calmed down she calmed down she left the <unk> 
 i got up and rinsed my mouth out several times brushed my teeth and used several <unk> of scope all the while my ass is covered in shit and there 's puke on the floor 
 i threw the toothbrush away finished wiping then i cleaned up the puke 
 never again 
 <unk> was around last week but anyways a bit of back story 
 i am a high school student at an <unk> school 
 even so we have a few female teachers my french teacher being one of them 
 i 'm not the most popular kid 
 i 'm that kind of guy who does n't say anything so that people do n't hate me if i say something stupid 
 because of that i am always quiet and respectful in her class which is filled with <unk> so she really liked me 
 anyways i was doing some work while the teacher had been helping others who needed it 
 my nose was running like a bitch and so i had to keep getting up to get <unk> 
 at one point she was bent over helping a group of students with some work when i went to grab a tissue 
 i tend to <unk> my arms really hard when i walk just habit really 
 while i was n't paying attention one of my hands flew towards her and slapped her ass really hard 
 she instantly stood up and screamed excuse me 
 she turned around and saw that i was the one who did it 
 she instantly calmed down a little and allowed me to explain myself because she liked me and knew that was n't what i would normally do but my social skills are so bad that i was n't sure where to start or how to explain it 
 so i stood there <unk> quickly while everyone else was laughing their asses off 
 we used to talk after school but now all conversations are plain awkward 
 i 'm seen as the god of the class now but that is n't the attention i want 
 **tl dr got up to get a tissue accidentally slapped her ass 
 we 're super awkward now 
 <unk> i have never been in a relationship so a mate told me to start using tinder 
 i 'm not a model i 'm just an average college guy looking for some girls to hang with so when i got matched with a few really pretty girls i was very happy 
 so this all started around 2 months ago i started talking to a girl let 's call her ella she was very pretty and we had a lot in common we went out 6 times we had fun and nothing was official 
 a month a go i got matched with another very pretty girl but at this point i was really starting to like ella but this girl let 's call her emily sent me two messages so being the nice guy i was i sent her a message back after a couple weeks of talking to emily she wanted to get some drinks i thought what the hell i do n't think ella is really that into me anyway 
 little did i know that i received a text from ella in the middle of the date i had with emily asking if i was interested in becoming a little more serious i was and she was one of the nicest and most interesting girls i had ever talked to 
 so at this point i had two girls that where in to me being a 20 year old nerdy virgin that sits on reddit all day i was stoked 
 after a few drinks emily asked if i wanted to go back to her place shit i panicked i was n't expecting this i had no condoms and was freaking the fuck out i said let 's get one more round during this i rushed to the bathroom hoping they had those baby prevention machines that spit out condoms for a buck 
 yes they did i bought 5 i was that excited and who knows i might break one or something 
 so i finish my drink and we start walking back to her place a little bit tipsy i start talking dirty but luckily she 's totally into it 
 we start walking up the stairs to her place and before she opens the door she says <unk> <unk> my room mates a huge nerd and is probably in bed '' 
 so we get inside i try to take my shoes off and just my fucking luck my fat ass hits the small fish bowl next to the front door ... who the fuck puts a glass fish bowl next to the front door 
 smash 
 water every where she starts freaking out and i try to pick up the glass 
 but we both just start laughing 
 then i hear my name mick what are you doing here '' totally confused half drunk and thinking that emily was just playing with me i <unk> to fuck you obviously '' i look up and turns out emily and ella are room mates and poor old mick is still a virgin 
 tl dr : virgin started using tinder 
 had two girls that turned out to be room mates 
 still a virgin 
 being a college freshman i 've been mercilessly studying for finals trying to <unk> as much information as i can 
 now usually i do n't believe in performance <unk> drugs but feeling overwhelmed i decide that the best possible solution to get the most studying is to pop an adderall first thing the next morning 
 my roommate as an assortment of <unk> drugs in his dresser and he says i could have one 
 after some late night studying i hope into bed at around 2am 
 i wake up at 7 stumble out of bed half asleep grab a pill from his dresser and grab some breakfast 
 i start eating waiting for the drugs to kick in expecting to feel something 
 about halfway into my egg sandwich i start to feel it 
 unfortunately it was n't <unk> like focus you would imagine getting in an adderall 
 no it was more like the largest boner i ever had in my life 
 then it hits me ... *oh fuck i took one of my roommate 's viagra 
 * i do n't know why my roommate has viagra but it sure does work 
 try studying for finals not being able to focus <unk> with a four hour erection tl dr tried studying for finals ended being the hardest day of my life 
 edit : my roommate told me they were the pills loose in his drawer me not knowing what the difference in pills were just took the first one i grabbed yes i 'm stupid i get it 
 also it deflated on its own in four hours if it lasted any longer i would have called a doctor 
 edit 2 : wow first front page thanks 
 you can call this story bullshit '' or fake '' all you want but my dick begs to <unk> happened about a year ago when i was 17. i was home alone and did what any teenager does when they have five minutes to themselves i began to watch porn and masturbate 
 all was well and good for ten minutes until i heard someone coming up the stairs through my headphones 
 i realised it must have been my dad coming home from work and i did n't hear him open the front door 
 trouble was my door was slightly open so i convinced myself to get up and shut it 
 i was also close to orgasm at this point and it is very hard to stop that feeling once it has <unk> 
 anyway my dad is coming up the stairs and i rush from my bed to close my door yet my climax had already begun and i could feel the orgasm 
 he had reached the top of the stairs and came to my room 
 i could n't shut my door in time and there he was bursting into my room coming face to face with me stark naked and holding my erect penis as it shoots out cum which unfortunately landed on his trousers 
 i immediately slammed my door feeling absolutely horrified 
 i got dressed real quick and did n't speak to him for a few days 
 definitely the worst possible thing i could imagine to do to one of my parents 
 edit : my dad was probably going to check if i was studying after this incident '' my parents always knocked before coming in 
 but the days following this i did n't make eye contact with my dad until he finally said it was embarrassing for both of us '' i do n't think he told my mum but each time i look at my dad i ca n't help but thinking you were the first person i shared my <unk> with '' tl dr : did n't hear my dad coming until the last minute 
 turned out i then accidentally <unk> on <unk> this happened years ago 
 if this is against the rules i apologize 
 but i saw the post about the restaurant employee who told about telling off a rude customer and figured i 'd share my tale 
 let me start out by saying i have manic depression and anxiety 
 not self diagnosed actual doctor diagnosed 
 and for those who are fortunate enough to have neither do n't pretend you do 
 no sane person would want this 
 during my <unk> years i worked full time at mcdonalds 
 a fate worse than death for me 
 i 'm real nervous and tense all the time 
 i 'd describe it was always having a feeling something awful is about to happen but it never does 
 i would have <unk> to death if it was n't for left over mcdonalds which still makes me sick thinking of the smell 
 for the most part i stayed in back 
 but there were times when i was in the front lines 
 i 'm not suppose to work at restaurants 
 it 's on file on my therapist that i ca n't do work <unk> to social interaction 
 but files do n't pay for college nor feed me 
 there was this bitch who came in 2-3 times a month 
 maybe more 
 she would always complain about her food 
 you could just cook her food and bring it to her 
 she 'd bring it back half eaten and claim it was cold 
 management always gave her free food just to get rid of her 
 that only encouraged her antics 
 well i graduated college and was set to move back home 
 i was gon na put my two weeks notice in a few days later when it happened 
 someone did n't show up and i was stuck on the front lines 
 for the most part people were decent 
 they would n't mind me looking at the counter or my stutter which goes away when im pissed which comes into play 
 4:30. here she comes with two kids 
 my heart drops seeing her 
 i heard co-workers complain about her but this was my first and last time dealing with her 
 maybe she 's not as bad as they say '' i think 
 first fucking thing hey 
 look me in the eyes when i talk to you '' 
 sorry i ca n't help it 
 she orders a ton of food 
 it was the worst experience 
 i have a habit of asking to confirm 
 4 medium orders of fries <unk> '' 
 that 's exactly what i said 
 can you hear 
 i prayed for a co-worker who knew me to help but it never happened 
 i got it over with 
 she went to her table 
 she came and got her food 
 sure enough 20 minutes later here she was 
 um my fries and my kid 's fries were cold 
 can i get some actual fresh ones 
 of course that did n't stop them from eating it all 
 but i comply 
 i tell one of my co-workers i am going to snap 
 he gives me a look of <unk> 
 i watched them come out of the grease 
 i give them to her 
 she says something rude like about time '' and leaves 
 then she comes back in 
 hey 
 these fries are cold too 
 i think i said i wanted warm and fresh fries '' 
 i try to tell her that i saw them cooked myself but i was stuttering 
 then she crossed the line 
 uh uh uh uh 
 stop stuttering 
 no wonder you ca n't get my fucking food made right '' 
 that pissed me off 
 i snap 
 my <unk> heard this and fixed her 4 orders of fries again 
 that 's 12 orders of fries they made for her and her kids 
 i grab the tray and sit it down 
 she 's <unk> with her kids 
 without looking at the counter 
 she asks are they done 
 i 'm in a hurry 
 instincts kick in and i grab two of the <unk> of fries back then only the large came in the red boxes 
 she turned to me and i threw them at her 
 one box hit her right between the eyes 
 here 's your fucking fries you fat bitch '' 
 i yell and immediately storm out of the restaurant drowning out everything said to me 
 i never went back 
 i never returned the uniform 
 i never got my last paycheck 
 i was panicked for a bit that i could be taken to court as that could be seen as assault 
 but nothing came 
 but to be honest doing that was worth more than anything that job had 
 the only regret i had was that i did n't throw all 4 orders of fries at her 
 tl dr me a manic <unk> with anxiety gets picked on by a woman at mcdonalds 
 gets mad throws box of fries at her and <unk> i have an old iphone 5 with a broken mic and home button and i had the last week of <unk> service so i wanted to get it fixed before selling it on ebay 
 my mom really wanted to check out the new apple store that just opened in my town so i brought her with me 
 we went to the genius bar and i explained the problem 
 he was ready to replace it when my mom told the guy '' my son is obsessed with electronics he <unk> that iphone 's screen six months ago by himself '' 
 <unk> biggest <unk> ever <unk> not only he did n't replace my phone but now my warranty is long gone and i ca n't get it fixed by apple even by paying them 
 lesson learned : never bring your mom to the apple store because she 's gon na fuck you up.so for the past few years because of my job i 've maintained a beard and long hair so as to kind of not have people immediately peg me for a <unk> 
 well i took a promotion recently and it had been suggested that i lose the beard and start looking like someone important 
 well today before i left for work i called the girl at the <unk> i usually go to to see if she could do me a solid 
 i asked if there was any way she could meet me at the shop to cut my hair and beard 
 seeing as we have a pretty long solid relationship she agreed 
 i got to the shop and she had a glass of my preferred <unk> waiting for me and we went back for my cut and shave 
 we talked and she asked if my better half had asked me to do this and i told her i had n't talked to her about it yet 
 we 'll get back to that in a second 
 she cleaned up i paid her and gave her a 100 % tip as my way of saying thanks for coming in on short notice on a sunday when i know you 'd rather be home with your husband '' and then i was on my way 
 when i got home i jumped in the shower and threw on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt 
 apparently however while i was upstairs in the shower my better half had gotten home i was n't expecting her back from her most recent leg of flights until wednesday 
 when i came downstairs my dog diesel was laying across her lap on the couch with her back to me 
 i leaned over the back of the couch and kissed her neck 
 normally this would n't be a big deal but with the lack of beard hair she was n't used to feeling my actual face 
 i 'm sure y'all can guess what happened next more or less 
 if not i 'll sum it up 
 she screamed tried to jump up which prompted diesel all 120 pounds of him to go into defense mode because now mommy is upset 
 being the good boy he is and knowing full well i 'm the alpha in the house he became confused and stood there as she was trying to get off the couch 
 she tripped over him fell on her back in the middle of the living room as i was moving around the couch to try and calm her down 
 babe 
 it 's me 
 it 's ok 
 it 's <unk> '' 
 it was at that point that i regretted taking her to my mma gym 
 i took a snap kick right in my bean bag 
 i went down like a cheap hooker in <unk> and it was only when diesel did n't <unk> to rip out my throat that she realized the junk she just assaulted <unk> to her boyfriend 
 now instead of showing genuine concern she started laughing hysterically saying how i look so young and calling me <unk> as i limped to the kitchen to grab an <unk> for my balls 
 tl dr - i did n't warn my girlfriend that i was shaving my beard and cutting my hair and she did n't recognize me since she 'd only known me with long hair and a beard 
 as a result i got kicked right in the mommy daddy button 
 super tl dr - took away the tickle so i took a <unk> right in the <unk> this happened about 8 or 9 days ago and this has really fucked up my head 
 i go on <unk> and <unk> and shit so i thought i was pretty <unk> but my buddy let 's call him ... brock 
 yeah brock proved that was a load of bull right there 
 any who he called me up asking me to look at his <unk> right 
 so i take it home and do 
 lots of porn <unk> and the usual shit so i clear it and clean it 
 then like any good person i started looking through his history his files music all of that 
 then i find this series of folders in folders neat something really embarrassing '' so i venture forth to stare into the abyss 
 oh god it stared back and i blinked hard inside this folder is a collection of really <unk> videos 
 i watched a few and found out my buddy 's a pedophile who downloads ... .. i had a nervous breakdown a few days ago when a neighbors kid started crying on the sidewalk outside my house reminded me of one of the videos audio 
 i have n't eaten in days and sleep is little and far between 
 i needed to say this somewhere before i go fucking mad edit : i have reported him he 's been hauled off but ... .i ca n't <unk> that shit additionally turns out it was over 14 <unk> in his collection '' on seperate thumb drives and this guy was in my home the detective offered to let be <unk> by the department psychologist on the <unk> order for this story to make sense you must know that i am a slightly awkward caucasian male and my girlfriend is african american 
 my girlfriend and i are starting to get pretty serious so she invited me to meet her parents and stay at their family home for part of the holidays 
 i was a bit nervous and reluctant at first but ultimately accepted the invitation 
 what she failed to mention was that not only would her parents be there but also her <unk> cousins and grandparents 
 in all there were about 15 people or so 
 i arrived and immediately felt a bit out of place 
 however i managed to feign confidence and <unk> and everything went smoothly for the first few hours 
 things then seemed to take an step in the right direction when i was invited to partake in the annual tradition the men of the family had of playing a game of poker 
 we decided to play for some money in order to keep things interesting 
 but instead of putting in actual cash we gave each color chip a designated dollar value 
 after the chips had been passed out and the first hand was dealt the first round of <unk> occurred 
 my girlfriend 's father bid 2 black chips $ 1 total and in my turn i raised one white chip $ <unk> total 
 my girlfriend who was looking on asked the group how much is a black one worth versus a white '' 
 without thinking i responded with history would say <unk> '' 
 the <unk> seconds were the longest of my life 
 i could feel my face turning bright red as i realized what i had just said 
 i looked to my girlfriend who had turned away struggling to contain her laughter at my situation 
 the silence was finally broken when i then heard a raspy chuckle to my right 
 it was grandpa willy who had n't said a word to me all day 
 he quickly <unk> to a <unk> <unk> laugh and soon enough everyone at the table started laughing along as i sat there uncomfortably faking a smile and wishing i had n't opened my stupid mouth 
 tl dr thank god for grandpa <unk> occurred a few months ago but i just discovered this subreddit so i figured it would still be relevant 
 for my english class we were assigned one of ten projects about the book to kill a <unk> 
 we were allowed to pick a partner and without question locked eyes with the girl who was at the time my best friend 
 we decided to make the project entitled make a board game '' 
 needless to say we were going to make a board game 
 i who had never had an interaction with a girl outside of school we wondering how to <unk> myself should i just be myself 
 sure what could go wrong 
 we met at the library and got working on our project making <unk> progress and having fun all the while 
 she slides her chair close to me 
 really close to me 
 she starts resting her arm on mine and being a little <unk> <unk> 
 eventually she wraps her arms around me and gives me a hug squeezing me quite a lot 
 i decide to do what she 's doing and hug her squeezing just as hard 
 little did i know i can squeeze a lot harder than a girl who 's <unk> '' and 110 lbs 
 <unk> she jumps as if someone scared her 
 she complains that her side hurt and she is convinced she broke her rib however she shakes it off and keeps working 
 we finish i go home and she texts me later saying so you actually broke my rib '' 
 and later showed me the x-ray 
 she did n't hold it against me and actually we ended up dating and still are to this day 
 and do n't worry neither if us have broken anything else 
 tl dr i was too awkward to know how to hug so i broke my friends rib 
 now we 're dating 
 love hurts 
 this happened just like 10 minutes ago i 'm still shaking and terrified to go downstairs 
 okay so in the <unk> it 's mother 's day on sunday 
 earlier i went to get my mum a few <unk> etc 
 to go with her presents and as she was at work i have n't wrapped them or anything they were just on the side in my room 
 my mum gets home like half an hour ago and there 's a knock on my bedroom door 
 <unk> i come in '' 
 i look at the presents in clear view to anyone who walks through the door and need to think of a reason to tell my mum to not come in without sounding suspicious ... so what do i shout back 
 <unk> do n't come in mum ... i 'm having a wank '' 
 & amp nbsp i 'll now never be able to look my mum in the eyes again 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- edit : to everyone saying <unk> not just say that your presents are in plain sight '' obviously that would have been better than what i did say but when i decided to come up with an excuse i thought it would have been better than ''i 'm having a wank '' 
 also thanks for the gold so right now i 'm a junior in high school but last friday i asked a girl classmate who i 've crushed on since freshman year to be my girlfriend 
 she said yes shoo be doo be doo to me 
 now every day at lunch ever since last year we 've just sat in the library and worked or talked or anything 
 so today was no different and we 're just talking about our plans tonight or something 
 all of a sudden the talk <unk> to something very interesting she says 
 <unk> how long have you liked me '' 
 i was taken aback because i 've liked this girl since day one for her beautiful looks <unk> attitude etc 
 well i 've been crushing mad on you since day one '' i said or something 
 but she was n't satisfied and told me to tell her more like my inner thoughts and whatnot 
 naturally i say well tbh after i followed you on <unk> i used to jack off to your bikini pics that 's how much i crushed on you '' 
 to <unk> her even more 
 for some reason she turned red and looked at me in shock then told me that we 're no longer together and she just walked out of the library and to the cafeteria i guess 
 ... bad mistake 
 *edit* thanks for the comments 
 i 'd go for a beer at the bar right now but clearly i 'm underage 
 anyways on tuesday at school monday is columbus day i 'll try to salvage this 
 i 'll update <unk> was watching movies with my boyfriend after he had gotten off of a long day at work 
 he fell asleep while watching the movie 
 i decided that i would take this opportunity to be spontaneous and sexy for him 
 i started undoing his belt and he did not stir at all 
 i kept going undoing his button and zipper 
 he was out cold 
 i decided that this seemed way more rapey that i was comfortable with 
 after i undid his pants i just left them 
 in the middle of the movie i decided to go get a glass of water and disappeared for a little bit 
 my boyfriend happened to wake up in the two minutes i was gone 
 he freaked out 
 he thought he had proceeded to undo his pants in his sleep which led to even more questions of why and what happened 
 i came back to him wide awake looking like he had committed a murder 
 tl dr boyfriend thought he scared me away by furiously jacking off in his sleep 
 edit : well shit 
 everyone is saying that it 's not rape 
 i know 
 he was just really tired and i thought i 'd let him sleep because clearly he was old cold 
 dude woke up to some hot pizza instead 
 this morning at the gas station a cute guy got out the car in front of us and i said <unk> my daughter looked up from her book and had the same reaction 
 i asked her if she could tell that he is gay and my son said that it was obvious 
 jokingly i <unk> that it would have been funny if my son had said ohhh as well 
 my son is 14 years old and at his age <unk> that he might be gay is a big deal to him 
 his friend was in the car as well and i could see that my son was embarrassed by my comment so i tried to <unk> it 
 it just went downhill from there 
 without thinking i said 'i 'm kidding i know you 're not gay because i 've seen your porn search history his eyes widened and i should have stopped there but i just kept digging myself into a bigger hole 
 ‘i saw that you like big breasts so you are clearly not <unk> my son cringed so once again trying to fix it ... <unk> ok sweetie you don’t have to be embarrassed everyone watches porn even mommy has a porn <unk> 
 by this point he was visibly upset and my last attempt to rescue the situation was <unk> it’s fine i will show you my <unk> by this point i realized that it would be better if i just kept quiet 
 we drove the rest of the way in silence 
 edit : thank you kind <unk> for the reddit gold 
 you 're awesome 
 so i 'm a 17 year old male and i decided to visit a couple of colleges for my spring break 
 my grandparents both are really supportive of me and they asked if they could take me 
 i do n't get to spend much time with them as they live out of town so i figured it would be a good idea 
 i brought my stuff over friday and have just been chilling and playing xbox all weekend 
 they have a fairly nice computer and i had been wanting to see some <unk> of the new <unk> so i hopped on the computer while they were in the den this morning 
 i launched chrome and began to type in the url bar which neither of my grandparents know how to use they just search things on google when some pornhub links popped up as suggested web addresses 
 not expecting pornhub to come up i was shocked at first 
 i ran the past couple of days through my head making sure i had n't been the <unk> person to not clear their history after letting loose some knuckle children 
 after confirming in my mind that it was n't me i decided to be a bro and clear my <unk> 's history for him 
 would n't want my grandma finding it that 's for sure 
 so i clicked on history and quickly found the source of the problem 
 i figured since i was already there i might as well glance through it all to see what my grandpa was into 
 needless to say he was into some kinky shit 
 and i mean wayyyyyy out there even for me 
 not wanting to scar my mind anymore than i already had i just went ahead cleared everything and went about my business 
 flash forward to about 15 minutes ago and my grandma calls me into the room they keep their computer in 
 she was trying to log onto facebook and asked me why she was n't logged in like she normally was 
 i completely not thinking about the reasoning behind my actions told her that it was probably because of me clearing the history 
 as soon as the words left my mouth i wished i could have reached out and grabbed them back <unk> of the shitstorm i might have just started with my grandmother 
 she as quick as a cobra striking it 's <unk> asked why in the world i would need to clear the history 
 at this point i panicked not wanting my grandfather 's secret to be found out 
 i told her very <unk> that it was <unk> down their computer 
 for whatever reason up to this point i never thought of the possibility of this being perceived as me covering my own ass 
 sure as shit she decided to put this on me and tried to call me out looking at those dirty dirty videos '' and gave me a speech about how god was watching '' and that pornography is a one-way ticket to hell 
 this all went in one ear and out the other but it was still super awkward to hear from my <unk> year old grandmother 
 after her talk i left the room and ran into my grandpa in the kitchen 
 he simply looked me in the eye and nodded having overheard the whole thing 
 i <unk> said nod and went about my <unk> now living with the fact that my grandpa is a porn fiend and my grandma thinks i 'm one 
 tl dr - took the blame for my grandpa 's porn habit by my grandma edit - to all of you asking what the search history was i 'll just say <unk> matter was involved 
 edit # <unk> obligatory thanks for the gold 
 now to figure out what to do with <unk> 'm an 18 year old guy and big surprise i watch porn 
 however today when i opened a downloaded video on my laptop whilst in my room the screen was black with a <unk> tv icon on the middle 
 so i skipped to about halfway through the clip to see if this would make it work but then i heard fucking noises literally coming from the living room where my family including my 10 year old brother were previously watching <unk> hears a who fantastic family movie i know 
 unfortunately however this dr <unk> flick was interrupted by a hardcore threesome porn clip which my laptop was playing via the apple tv ... safe to say my brother has been scarred for life and my mum had a fantastic mother 's day : **update** : for those of you curious of the outcome my <unk> has been banned my parents think i 'm a sex fiend and my little brother is far more curious than scarred which makes me equally proud and concerned 
 oh and a shout out to the squad '' who 's going to be <unk> me their internet for the foreseeable future so earlier tonight i ran out of my dorm to greet and pay the cab driver who was dropping my girlfriend off from the airport 
 the driver was this big russian guy with a heavy accent so it was pretty difficult to understand him at times 
 so after <unk> pleasantries i asked him how much the cab fare was and he responded with something that i could n't quite make out but i saw $ <unk> '' on the little dashboard counter thing so i figured that 's what he was telling me to pay 
 i pulled out two $ 20 's and in an effort to be nice and tip a little extra told him just give me $ 10 in change '' 
 he looked at me incredulously and said really '' 
 followed by something that was swallowed into the depths of his thick russian accent 
 so my dumb ass thinking i 'd <unk> surprised him and brightened his day a bit just decided to give him a great big smile and said yeah 
 merry christmas '' 
 he just handed me the change and drove off 
 i was feeling damn good about myself until my girlfriend was like um <unk> i think he was asking you why you were n't giving him any tip '' 
 of course still feeling like a good person i told her proudly that i 'd tipped him above the standard 15 % and he seemed pretty happy about it 
 but nope 
 turns out when i was looking at the price he had n't added in some final costs yet and the actual total of the taxi was a little above $ 29 
 he had actually been saying really 
 no tip '' 
 and i had responded yep 
 merry christmas '' 
 with a big <unk> grin on my face 
 <unk> 
 tl dr : tried to be a generous person ended up being the biggest douche this cab driver 's ever met in his life 
 this fu happened this afternoon when i was in a meeting with my boss and the ceo 
 this is my first job and i have been doing it only for 6 months 
 i talked to the ceo about work sometimes but this was the first time i had to sit in a meeting with him 
 when the meeting was going to end he asked me if i got what i had to do and i responded him : yes <unk> '' my ceo is <unk> update : since some of you asked this is what happened after ceo : did you just address me as my lord '' 
 me : no ... yes.. it was unintentional sir ceo : you do n't have to call me lord or sir instead i will make the guys in the office call you my lady '' if you can reach this number double the target for the project we gon na do '' he left after that not sure if he felt it offended or funny but my boss burst out laughing 
 i mentioned he is british since he is not local and i thought he might feel offended thinking i was <unk> : dr i was scammed into drive to a car dealership 40 miles away 
 this happened about three hours ago 
 i am still very ashamed of myself 
 i got what looked like a scratch off game card in my mailbox that was from a car dealership a couple towns over 
 it looked like a standard <unk> mail and i would normally throw this stuff away but this card had <unk> amounts that could be won simply by scratching off the various boxes on the card 
 well would n't you know it i had a combination of <unk> that on the key on the right side of the card said i had won $ 5,000 
 i then read the fine print on the back of the card and it seemed legit 
 no red flags to speak of 
 i am normally extremely skeptical on these types of things 
 you ca n't just win free money right 
 so i called the number of the dealership and was transferred to a man who acted very excited that i had won this promotion 
 i asked him point blank is there anything else that i need to know 
 did i really just win $ 5,000 on a free mailer that everyone gets '' 
 he said all i have to do is come down to the dealership and match the code on the back of the card 
 if it matches and i can prove that i live at the address on the mailer he would cut me a check for the amount that i won 
 keep in mind he did n't say $ 5,000 '' he said amount that i won '' 
 i 'll be honest and i was still skeptical but i could really use that kind of money right now i mean who could n't right 
 i basically laid it on the line and said listen your dealership is at least 45 minutes away 
 i am not buying a car today 
 this is n't like cash back on a new car or anything is it 
 please tell me this is for real 
 i cant afford to drive that far both ways if this is n't what you are telling me it is '' 
 without <unk> the man on the phone said this is for real 
 if we verify it and you really did win we will cut you a check today '' 
 so i hopped in my car and drove the 45 minutes to the dealership 
 when i walked in i saw a few people holding the same mailer 
 i was suspicious but at the same time there were several levels of money all the way down to like $ 25 that could be won according to the game card so i figured these people had some amount of money as well 
 i walked up to the sales counter and told them who i was 
 i said hey i 'm the guy that called about an hour ago 
 i won $ 5,000 on your mailer game '' 
 the three guys at the counter cheered and congratulated me 
 one of them ushered me into an office and asked me for my id and proof that i lived at the address listed 
 once i gave him that he asked me for the game card 
 he then gave me a form to fill out to claim my winnings 
 he punched in the code into his computer and said alright man lets find out if you won '' 
 what do you mean if i won '' 
 i said back 
 one of you told me on the phone that i already had won '' 
 i began to shake because i knew i had been tricked no straight lied to earlier 
 this man looks me in the face and says you did win 
 you won a spot in our contest to see if you won $ 5,000 '' 
 i was speechless 
 he said do n't you want to find out if you won the money '' 
 i realized then that i had been scammed into driving to this dealership 
 i said nothing 
 i looked this man in the eyes for at least thirty straight seconds in dead silence 
 i was so angry i could barely get words out 
 i am normally a very calm easy going person and i hate <unk> but i was so ashamed that i fell for this 
 i finally said you mother fuckers lied to me 
 you lied and told me i had won this money 
 i just drove all the way from my town to this town because one of you assured me this was n't a scam to get me here 
 i asked you if there was anything else i needed to know if this was for real and you said it was '' 
 he responded by saying it was n't him that it must have been one of the other employees 
 he then told me that my drive was n't really that far '' 
 i lowered my head got back into my car and drove home 
 and that is how i fucked up today 
 i really hope that the <unk> that put this together wins a bunch of money in the <unk> and then dies of a heart attack before he can collect his winnings 
 thanks for reading 
 edit : i did take a picture of this to send to my wife before i left 
 i will try to post it if it can 
 here is the game card and the amounts you can win '' <unk> was my parents 30 year wedding anniversary and some of their friends were having a party to celebrate them 
 my mom was floating in the pool with a cookie in her hand and she looked so pretty i just had to take a picture 
 right as i snap the pic she puts the cookie in her mouth and i end up with the <unk> photo you 've ever seen 
 i 'm dying laughing showing the picture to her friends and she yells from the pool that she wants to see it 
 i 'm drunk so i hand her the phone she 's drunk so she fumbles it and it goes right to the bottom of the pool 
 it 's in the water for a good <unk> seconds before we fish it out 
 i 'm upset but somehow laughing and my mom says it 's karma for the bad picture 
 it 's an <unk> with no case on it and somehow miraculously i dry it off and it 's working just fine 
 in a state of sobriety i might have thought to look for advice online but instead i just go on using as normal 
 so here 's the bigger fuck up 
 earlier in the day i had taken a sexy picture for my boyfriend 
 instead of sending it all at once i decided to crop it and send increasingly larger <unk> throughout the day until the whole thing was revealed 
 the most recent is a <unk> which contains nothing but my boobs nipples covered by only a thin piece of black fabric 
 after dropping my phone in the pool a male coworker who i am decent friends with texts me a link to something on reddit 
 i open it and try to respond to him 
 now having been out of the water for <unk> minutes or so my phone starts getting locked up and acting all kinds of sketchy 
 i 'm trying to answer the text pressing everything on the screen but nothing is really responding 
 i manage to type out a sentence and send 
 all of a sudden my phone starts freaking out and executing random commands 
 close text messaging open vine close vine open another random app 
 it 's totally got a life of its own 
 if you 've ever had a water logged iphone you might recognize this behavior 
 i manage to get the text messaging app back on the screen but in its erratic behavior my phone opens the camera roll and inserts a picture 
 the one in the middle of the screen 
 the one of my boobs 
 i 'm desperately trying to <unk> and close but my broken phone takes this to mean send '' and all i can do is watch in slow motion horror as i get the confirmation that my boobs have successfully been delivered to my coworker 
 mortified i try to explain but of course i ca n't type anything 
 i finally manage please ignore '' 
 his response hahaha this is awesome '' 
 i 'm not looking forward to work tomorrow 
 i have a feeling i wo n't live this down for a while 
 and of course my phone does n't work at all today 
 tl dr - dropped phone in pool 
 water logged phone freaked out and inserted pic of my boobs into text conversation with coworker 
 update : whoa 
 never <unk> reddit 's love of boobs 
 i did n't expect this to be so popular 
 to clarify i did send a sentence explaining the pool mishap to my coworker but i have n't talked to him since 
 i do know his username to all of you claiming to be him 
 i do not have any photos as they are on my broken phone 
 i did not add the nsfw tag it was automatic but i think the bodily discharge '' is pretty funny 
 no i am not cheating on my boyfriend 
 just period 
 also thanks for the hilarious comments and tips ... silver lining i guess 
 so this happened just today 
 i work at a dominos pizza and right across the street is this dairy queen and i 've been trading pizza for dairy queen stuff with this really cute black haired girl for a bit 
 i built up the courage and asked for her number and we 've been texting and talking to each other for about a week 
 today she asked if i could bring her pizza to her new place so i jumped to the conclusion that that was her saying hey come over '' 
 later after i clocked out bought a pizza and got one of my delivery drivers to drive me to her place i do n't drive and her place was on his way 
 she took the pizza saying thanks '' i stood there thinking she was going to let me in we talked a bit and i immediately knew she was n't down 
 she asked how did you get here '' 
 i said one of my drivers drove me '' she said oh did he leave '' 
 yea ... '' oh really 
 oops can you call him back '' 
 so i called my driver back after he was done delivery and went into the front foyer of the house and waited and seen this dude up stairs i knew what was up and i just waited like 1 minute and left when my driver got outside 
 he said what happened '' 
 i guess she wanted the p instead of the <unk> '' i got a ride home afterwards 
 edit : wtf front page and gold.this happened about an <unk> ago : i was bored in class so i opened binding of <unk> on my laptop 
 i have been <unk> to complete all of the <unk> and the last one i have n't beaten yet is called the suicide king 
 in that challenge you shoot explosive tears that come back to you if they miss and enemy and i find it bloody difficult 
 after getting frustrated after dying for the tenth time i open google and type in how to beat suicide ... '' and google already filled in the rest for me 
 but when i tried to click on the <unk> <unk> i <unk> and actually searched for what i wrote in 
 i <unk> what i meant and did n't think much of it 
 until after my classroom got an internal call and they demanded that i go to the principals office 
 apparently the school proxy filter had picked up my <unk> searches and the it had notified the administration and when i arrived to the principals office the principal and the school nurse were waiting for me 
 i quickly explained what had happened and they understood the misunderstanding but now i am sure i am under some kind of surveillance list from now on <unk> edit : if someone knows a solution on how to bypass the school proxy filter any <unk> would be appreciated as the blocking really makes research hard 
 i have tried tor <unk> and <unk> and all of those get stuck in connecting phase i guess the traffic is blocked 
 i use my own laptop so i can install whatever would be needed and i am ready to pay & lt 10 dollars per month if it allows me to watch youtube 
 i wake up look around and think fuck yeah labor day '' 
 it 's maybe 8am 
 my gf had already left for work 
 alarm goes off 
 swipe 
 bitch it 's labor day 
 second alarm goes off 
 swipe 
 uhh still labor day shitty phone alarm 
 gtfo third alarm goes off 
 slept through it like a boss 
 no more alarms 
 wake up at <unk> check phone 
 3 missed calls and 7 texts 
 uhh 
 reading a few ... then my shitty brain puts 1 and 0 together 
 dicks 
 it am not be labor day 
 <unk> now 
 be rolling in to work 
 will update 
 update : nobody even noticed 
 <unk> nephew daniel is 3 years old diagnosed with down syndrome and had n't said a word before last week 
 my brother and his wife have been taking him to speech therapy but to no avail 
 well the stars aligned such that they were both working and after going through all the in-laws and siblings they chose me to take the little <unk> to his appointment 
 on the way to the therapist 's office i notice a car pulling up to the street from a parking lot and think nothing of it 
 lots of folks try to pull out onto the road at the first opportunity 
 no big deal ... until the guy decides there 's enough of an opening in front of me for him to get in 
 shit 
 shit 
 shit '' 
 i yelled as i slammed on the brakes and <unk> 
 somehow we do n't hit the guy nor does the woman in the other lane hit me 
 so heart 's beating a little fast and i 'm nervous that i 've scared daniel 
 how ya doing big fella '' 
 and that 's when daniel decided to talk 
 his first words 
 it was actually a little song 
 *ooooh shit shit shit shit* *oooooh shit shit shit shit* *oh shit shit shit shit* *oooh shit shit shit shit* *oooh shit shit shit shit* *ooooh shit shit shit shit 
 * i 'm frantic 
 how do i keep the fact that his first word is a song of shit from both the therapist and his parents 
 i mean i 'm proud of the little guy for talking but <unk> they 're going to have my head 
 well we get to the office my heart 's racing and the therapist is a pro 
 she comes out of her office <unk> down to his level and asks hi daniel how do you feel today '' 
 and my heart sank as daniel performed an <unk> of his hit single oh shit '' 
 *ooooh shit shit shit shit* *oooooh shit shit shit shit* *oh shit shit shit shit* *oooh shit shit shit shit* *oooh shit shit shit shit* *ooooh shit shit shit shit 
 * i have no idea where he got this tune but the lyrics clearly came from me 
 i 'm <unk> 
 dumbfounded 
 thoroughly embarrassed 
 the therapist 
 she never <unk> a beat 
 i see that you 're talking now 
 that 's great daniel '' 
 and she took his hand and they walked back into the <unk> playroom 
 what a pro 
 my sister-in-law still is n't speaking to me 
 edit : i have sent /u/thepeoplesbard the <unk> of the tune 
 hopefully he 'll come through a recording of his version soon 
 i 'll edit the op with a link when he does 
 edit 2 : /u/thepeoplesbard <unk> 
 thanks friend 
 edit 3 : and now my gold is ended 
 what a wild wild ride guys 
 thanks for the party that is reddit gold.this is without a doubt the dumbest thing i have ever done and the most ridiculous thing that has ever happened to me so i hope you enjoy because i certainly did n't ... i 'd been <unk> in a bit of dry spell and i decided that i was going to make something happen for myself 
 i plugged my nose and actually hit up craigslist i know and all manner of other places just looking for something to get me out of this <unk> 
 i actually end up making a connection with this pretty cute girl we chatted for a bit to make sure we 're both not <unk> killers and she agrees to come over to my apartment and we 're going to perform oral on each other 
 it 'll be fun 
 no strings attached 
 she comes over and i do my thing first 
 she 's very grateful and now it 's my turn to get <unk> 
 i 'm sitting up on my bed and she 's sitting next to me 
 i have a full on diamond cutter and i 'm ready to go 
 she starts using her hand and spitting on me for lubrication hot 
 i took my time with her was slow and thorough and did and excellent job 
 it 's apparent she 's going to return the favor 
 great 
 she then says i have a nice body thanks and says that i must take care of myself i do and then asks if i 'm a vegan a little weird 
 i say that i 'm not a vegan but i try to eat a clean and balanced diet 
 she then says that she 's a vegan and literally starts talking about how great it is and that i should become one because it 's healthier now this shit is getting officially weird 
 i start thinking that maybe we 've got a hostage situation on our hands and this is this girl 's thing 
 she takes her pleasure gets you by the shaft and then starts trying to convert you to veganism while she has you trapped in the most compromising of circumstances 
 keep in mind while she keeps talking she 's still giving me a handjob and occasionally <unk> <unk> drip down onto my member 
 it was like i was trapped in some <unk> fever dream 
 so then things take a turn for the worse and she starts saying some ridiculously and truly stupid shit about how we 'd all live to be 100 if everyone would stop eating meat and meat is far worse for you than smoking and humans did n't really evolve to eat meat and other nonsense 
 the entire time i 'm just trying to relax zone out and ignore it or wondering if i should make some witty joke about my meat '' or something 
 then she finally goes down on me 
 now any normal human being would just be like ah finally '' 
 any normal human being would just shut up and enjoy the magnificent bit of <unk> being performed upon them 
 not me 
 the stupid shit that she said starts floating through my head and it <unk> at me 
 i know i should n't say anything but i ca n't help myself so i open up my big stupid <unk> and say i do n't think some of the things she says were <unk> accurate 
 we then proceed to have at least a 15-20 minute debate about the <unk> of eating meat whether or not humans are designed to eat meat veganism 's effects on athlete performance as well as an assortment of other related topics 
 the entire time we were both still naked i was still erect and she still had me gripped firmly in her hand 
 it was a level of <unk> i hope to never come close to again 
 i wish i had it on film so i could sell it as the <unk> achievement in a video series titled how not to get laid '' 
 finally we agreed to disagree seeing as neither of us were going to budge from our positions and she commented that it was getting late got dressed and left 
 i jerked off alone in the dark 
 **tl dr - tried to get blown ended up arguing about veganism <unk> 
 ended up not getting blown 
 jerked off alone in the dark 
 ** so basically a long time ago i lost my glasses 
 i never bothered to get them replaced and i just lived with the fact that everything was <unk> out of focus 
 it turns out that 's not such a good thing if you want to process information well 
 because i could n't see i felt stupid 
 my brain was no longer working to process all of this visual information 
 or it could mean my brain was <unk> itself way to hard 
 anyway i just received my new eye glasses and absolutely everything is in stunning clarity 
 as soon as i put them on i could feel my brain snap back into attention 
 this story is n't meant to be funny 
 seriously if you cant see go to an <unk> you could be <unk> your brain 
 edit 1 : so last night as i was walking home i saw the stars for the first time clearly and it was amazing 
 my friend pulled up and gave me a ride back to my house as we were coming over the hill i was amazed at the <unk> cascade of city lights before me 
 it was so beautiful 
 edit 2 : in the last 24 hrs ive discovered that vision not only affects the obvious but also sound and generally <unk> 
 we gather so much visually from our environment 
 i think being in that space between seeing and not seeing is worse than being blind because the brain can not make sense out of the blurry shapes 
 its in a state of <unk> whereas being completely blind fully allows it to <unk> to the lack of visual input 
 i literally feel like i have super vision now 
 how come people who need perfect vision for a living like a pilot or an archer dont just get glasses 
 is perfect vision truly perfect with out glasses or contacts 
 are we even meant to see with such clarity or is the fact that so many people have eye problems an indication of something much bigger happening in humanity 
 edit 3 : i used to be a <unk> but i stopped right around the time i lost my glasses 
 i hope that now with my new found sight i can appreciate my gift again 
 sight involves so many things beyond seeing dont let not seeing take away your gifts or <unk> 'm partially <unk> in both ears and have been since birth 
 the technology i use to get through school life consists of a <unk> that connects to my hearing aid and a microphone that teachers have to wear so i can hear them in class it acts as a kind of <unk> <unk> type of thing 
 it has made things much easier and has helped me on many occasions 
 but not this one 
 so after the teacher leaves the room to go somewhere i think nothing of it and everything continues as usual 
 couple moments later i hear the some cracks in my ear 
 whatever it 's probably nothing just my hearing aid playing up 
 then i remember the teacher still has the microphone thing around her neck 
 so the next few moments were a blur of hilarity and horror as i heard a sequence of rock hard lumps of shit hitting the bottom of the toilet 
 she was taking a shit and i heard every second of it 
 i started laughing in the middle of the lesson but nobody knew why 
 the teaching assistant tried to calm me down and asked me what i was laughing at but i refused to tell her 
 when the teacher came back into the classroom i could not look her in the eyes as i had a vision of her sat on the toilet taking a shit 
 <unk> would n't want to experience that again.okay this happened couple of sundays ago at my <unk> birthday party 
 there were about 15 kids there age raging from 2-6. i was inside trying to entertain my nephew and his friends 
 so i got some ketchup packets and twisted one end to make it into a ball with all the ketchup built up on one end 
 i had my nephew stand at the end of living room next to the patio door 
 i went hadouken 
 and threw one at him 
 the kids loved it maybe it was just the sound i was making 
 every time he would say faster faster 
 so about my tenth one i did full baseball <unk> and went hadouken 
 i <unk> it like a damn <unk> 
 at the same time some random kid decided to run into the house from the patio 
 boom 
 direct <unk> 
 the kids head goes back but the ketchup packet exploded on contact and it sprayed ketchup on the back wall and the same time there was a mom standing behind me she started screaming bloody murder 
 full chaos breaks out then people realize it was ketchup 
 still no one laughed but me and i was the <unk> the rest of the party 
 tl dr : <unk> a ketchup packet hits random kid explodes and parents thought i murdered a child 
 edit : wow this really took off and thank you to the one who gave me <unk> the fuck up really started a few days ago but finally came to a head <unk> within the last 16 hours 
 so i work for a retail company 
 i used to work in the stores but i got a promotion last year in april yay 
 to work in the corporate office for the east coast 
 i have been having a lot of fun at my job but i was used to being on my feet for my entire work day and now i sit at a desk all day long 
 not complaining just very different from what i am used to 
 anyways this has all been well and fine until the division came out now when i leave work from sitting on my ass all day i sit on a train for an hour sit in my car for another 30 minutes driving home and sit on my couch and play division on my ps4 
 normally would n't be a big deal but on my weekend i started to notice a little <unk> in my crack 
 seemed fine so i went to bed thinking it would go down while i was sleeping 
 wrong 
 i woke up in a ton of <unk> 
 i wanted to call out of work so badly but literally every <unk> of the company from all the head offices is coming out to my office to work on all their holiday plans/tastings and i really need to be there to support everyone 
 i work through the day barely being able to sit and even walking is really tough 
 i google it during my day and it looks like pilonidil cyst basically an infected hair under the skin that <unk> and is extremely painful and usually happens in the <unk> cleft sometimes caused by <unk> sitting 
 i leave work and take the train to my car the worst ride on the train ever and go to the nearest urgent care 
 i get in and they take me in right away and send the doctor in after taking my <unk> 
 it 's either going to be <unk> or <unk> 
 i 'm a single dude so having a nice lady looking at my inflamed <unk> today was not tops on my list 
 while i am sitting there waiting for the inevitable pain i can hear her talking in the next room sounds kind of younger 
 when she comes in i am floored she is beautiful 
 also this is her last week working here and i am her last patient of the day 
 i am the asshole that walks into a restaurant 5 minutes before they close and orders a steak except she gets to lance an inflamed cyst an inch from my b-hole 
 anyways she 's a total professional the entire way and takes excellent care of me while i swear and <unk> and laugh through the pain 
 she has an assistant with her also a lady who is kind of like that awesome tough loving <unk> kind of mom 
 both are really awesome and do a great job and after the blinding pain i am already starting to feel better 
 the only saving grace i had was when i said usually i would be really happy to have cute ladies checking out my ass '' 
 they had a good laugh at that 
 they finish and use some surgical glue to close my butt cleft <unk> and <unk> me some antibiotics 
 i feel much better today and sitting does n't make me want to cry 
 maybe i should send them a fruit <unk> to say thanks 
 tl dr sat on my ass for days on end working and playing division got an infected cyst that i had <unk> by a beautiful young woman 
 edit : thank you all for your <unk> i am surprised how common this seems to be 
 good to know i am in good company and get a little karma from the deal you all rock 
 trying to respond to as many comments as i can and i looked and it was # <unk> on front page 2 
 we did it reddit 
 edit 2 : tifu again people i <unk> with are starting to call and congratulate <unk> the train a girl about 2 feet from me has her fly open 
 i tell her about it and then she says why are you looking there '' 
 she closes it thereafter 
 everyone on the train gives me a mild death stare 
 disappointing when i was only trying to help 
 i guess people were angry at me for telling her as now they would n't be able to look there <unk> 4 months ago i put in for <unk> time so i could take my wife and son on vacation 
 after making all my arrangements my boss came up and asked if i could reschedule my vacation because there was a very important meeting the week i scheduled my vacation 
 i told him i could n't really reschedule anything and finally we settled with me being on a <unk> call type deal for the meeting 
 i agreed and went on vacation well come time for the meeting i set up my laptop in the hotel room 
 the meeting was fairly early in the morning so i woke up and i dropped my wife off at some tourist trap she wanted to see 
 the place she was going was n't for kids so my son stayed and slept 
 i came back to the hotel and the meeting started 
 the meeting went well for the most part 
 1 hour into the meeting my wife called and needed picked up 
 i told my boss i had to go get my wife id be back in 20 minutes 
 so i left to go get my wife i left my son in the hotel and told him id be back in 20 minutes 
 i screen locked the laptop i did n't know they could still see and hear everything with the laptop locked but they could 
 long story short after i left my 13 year old son decided it would be a good time to jerk off so he did 
 in front of my boss and about 20+ other employees on the conference call 
 they seemed to be ok about the whole situation and i was n't fired 
 still however the most embarrassing thing ever 
 tl dr my kid masturbated in front of my bosses and some other employees 
 update : few questions i 'll answer 
 my wife can not drive because she has epilepsy she used to drive but stopped after she started having frequent seizures 
 also they did end the call after somebody pointed it out from what my friend told me he noticed about 6 minutes after i left when some lady pointed it out and after that it was cut within a minute 
 i recently started indoor rock climbing as a way to stay in shape and finally got my friend to go with me as well 
 he started to get the hang of things and we were having an awesome time 
 a really <unk> climber went in front of us about 10 ft. away and he had a smallish tattoo on his shoulder 
 it looked like this really shredded guy really struggling to get to the top of a climb which i thought was a pretty badass tattoo for a climber 
 <unk> that 's a <unk> tattoo maybe i can get one down the road if i get better at climbing 
 do you think the guy in the tattoo makes it 
 i do n't think he 's going to make it '' 
 my friend looked at the guys shoulder looked back at me turned red called me an asshole and stormed out of the climbing gym 
 that 's when i saw that the tattoo was n't of a climber making a climb but rather jesus struggling to survive on the cross 
 i have never felt so embarrassed in my entire life 
 he has n't talked to me since 
 bonus fuck-up : my friend is a very religious christian and i am jewish 
 so this just happened a few minutes ago and i 'm typing this out as my roommate is still laughing at me 
 a little background before we get into the juicy details : i tend to get very vocal when i 'm alone which can be expressed in various ways 
 singing talking to myself yelling at random things and making <unk> noises are the usual things i do maybe to fill the space or just because i 'm weird when alone i 'm not sure go ask science 
 anywho i happened to be alone on this particular day and decided to take a long hot shower 
 standing in the shower i begin to sing the song of my people while dancing like an idiot 
 recently i 've managed to pick my lazy <unk> crusted butt off the couch to hit the gym and today i 'm quite sore 
 stretching the muscles with hot water running down them was amazing and so i began to make noises that only the most sexually thirsty person would make 
 phrases like oh baby yes '' and fuck <unk> oh yeah '' and the classic do me dirty '' were all spilling out of my mouth with the passion of a thousand burning suns 
 finishing my shower i towel off and open the door but horror strikes me as i round that opening 
 i was too excited to be alone for a weekend afternoon that i did n't think why i was alone and as it turns out my roommate 's family was out to lunch with him 
 so there i am towel around my waist staring at his mom dad and even 12 year old sister all of us mouth <unk> clearly heard more than enough of my mating calls and all i 'm capable of doing is muttering uhh '' and <unk> to my room a red faced embarrassed mess 
 as my roommate tells me his entire family laughed as soon as i left not because of the noises they heard but because i was alone in the shower and there were noises enough for two 
 tl : dr sang the song of my people the song should have been on mute edit : tastefully narrated by <unk> this was a tifu eight years in the making 
 i vaguely remember creating this account and forgetting the password i made ... until only minutes ago 
 after giving up attempting to log in about two years ago i stumbled upon a torn up piece of paper in my closet 
 and there it was my long lost password and username 
 i may have created my account eight years ago but this is my first <unk> this morning i was having my usual shower to begin my day 
 feeling a bit <unk> i started masturbating 
 as i was about to climax i lent too hard against the glass shower door 
 door comes off its hinges and the door and i fall out of the shower i on top of the glass which smashes everywhere 
 my mom hearing the crashing noise and i hate how fast her response time was runs into the bathroom just in time to witness a bathroom full of broken glass and water me lying naked on the bathroom floor with a cut up back from all the glass and with an erection still ejaculating over myself 
 <unk> unlike most tifus this actually happened today though i wish it had n't 
 things were getting pretty hot and heavy in the bedroom when i decided it was his turn to be taken care of 
 i started giving him a blowjob that 's when he decided he wanted things to be <unk> tonight 
 he shoved my head down forcefully onto his dick once gag reflex <unk> so i pulled my head away 
 gave it a second and started going at it again and he does the same thing 
 now i do n't mind if that 's what he wants i 'm all about <unk> him in the bedroom but we had just eaten not long before that and something about a dick being jammed down my throat does n't make my stomach sit well 
 and <unk> my stomach did 
 i threw up 
 right out of my nose not a whole lot but enough 
 i look up to see he noticed anything nothing just slack <unk> <unk> my dick sucked '' bliss on his face 
 i decide i ca n't ruin this and more than anything i ca n't tell him ... how exactly do i fix this 
 my mind is racing when i come up with an idea 
 a terrible terrible idea 
 i ate it reddit 
 i ate my puke off of his stomach to avoid having to tell him i threw up on him 
 i fucking ate it 
 i will never have any self respect <unk> i was riding around in a wheelchair that happened to be at my fraternity house and rolled into the parking lot as another kid in a wheel chair rolled by 
 he stopped and talked with me a little bit legitimately great guy and invited me to some sort of wheelchair basketball league 
 i did n't know how to tell him that i am not actually crippled so now i am signed up for practice in a few hours 
 edit : apparently my school has won the most national wheelchair <unk> in the <unk> and is a big deal 
 considering going to practice and trying to start 
 can i <unk> still 
 edit # 2 : okay i did some research and they have really expensive custom wheelchairs specifically for basketball and i have a generic hospital one 
 i roll in there they know i 'm a fake 
 practice is in two hours 
 thank god i always miss leg day 
 final edit : okay 
 i went to practice 
 i fucked up 
 i never implied i was crippled but when i rolled in with my wheel chair it was sort of implied 
 it went down hill immediately when they asked me to switch to another chair i could borrow 
 i brought it to the hallway told them i needed to grab my inhaler from my bag and i actually have asthma so fuck you and did the best <unk> transition between wheelchairs i could manage 
 why did i even go to begin with 
 one being sweet sweet karma and the other would be i wanted to try it out 
 anyways it was going decent except it was completely obvious i never <unk> in a sports wheel chair let alone played basketball before 
 it was embarrassing as fuck and at one point the ball landed on my nuts and i audibly cursed 
 it was all going decent it was a very informal thing kind of like a pick up game but organized by some group 
 long story short it just kept going worse and worse for me until i tipped over but held myself up like a tri-pod and realized i 've never gotten up from this before without my legs 
 a few people started watching me and were going to help a crippled kid up me 
 i decided then and there i could n't do this any longer and just stood up and actually did a sort of limp to my chair and went to the hallway 
 fuck you reddit for encouraging my bad decisions 
 my mother always has these <unk> bottle of shampoo she uses 
 there was one that caught my eye with those floral designs and <unk> font based texts 
 so last night i came home feeling really awesome with myself i was looking around for this floral shampoo of her 's 
 and it just was n't there 
 and i realised mid crotch washing the shampoo was under the sink yes i bend over to wash what 's down under and in my head was oh so this shampoo is so <unk> that you would hide it from son huh 
 i am so gon na squeeze the shit out of you '' it 's texture was really really viscous 
 but it had a baby blue colour which i could n't remember i had a vague memory that it was a clear brown colour i shook it off as a different <unk> of <unk> 
 especially since this bottle is new and filled to the brim 
 10 mins after trying to wash the shampoo off my head it was still so god damn bloody soapy 
 my hands were getting tired maybe from agressive washing down under it felt as if someone was secretly pouring more of the shampoo on me 
 and the bubbles that formed it felt like a bubble party 
 30 mins has elapsed and i was clearly pissed 
 i opened the door and screamed for mom 
 what shampoo is this 
 <unk> does it not wash away '' 
 mom comes and asks which shampoo am i using 
 your precious one under the sink '' i am so pissed she was laughing so hard and all i could do was continue scrubbing my damn foam filled hair 
 it was a good five mins which felt like eternity to me before she got her <unk> back and said that 's not shampoo my dear i filled it up with <unk> it 's a super laundry detergent designed to get the thoughest of thoughest stains off clothes that 's why i put it under the sink love 
 i need to tell your dad 
 oh god why would you put detergent in a shampoo bottle for f sake '' 
 never judge a shampoo by it 's bloody bottle 
 *edit* what 
 thank you guys 
 let me try to answer a few questions 
 here is a link to the shampoo i you can find my first post here as to what happened and all it 's updates 
 latest update : now to what happened on thanksgiving 
 so my gf 's sister showed up wednesday afternoon and everything was going perfectly fine throughout the day 
 i left around 4 ish to grab some beer and wine before thanksgiving 
 when i came home i could hear yelling from the front door and when i walked in it only intensified 
 my gf and her sister were in full <unk> fuck you mode 
 once i walked through the door they both stopped yelling and the sister went upstairs 
 i asked what it was about and it was about the sexting incident again 
 i got them both together and asked them to just play it off until thanksgiving was over and we could talk the day after 
 thanksgiving happens there was a lot of tension in the air but my gf and her sister played it off pretty well nothing too suspicious 
 her parents do n't expect anything and they left all good 
 literally 5 minutes after they left the house exploded 
 my girlfriend was yelling at her sister for <unk> '' me all evening 
 i genuinely did n't notice but i am somewhat flattered 
 i told them to calm down and they both told me to fuck off basically and i ended up sleeping on the coach last night 
 now here i am about 20 hours after being <unk> to the coach 
 my girlfriends sister left in the morning did n't say good bye just left a note saying she would n't be talking to us anymore and to enjoy christmas without her 
 my gf proceeded to break down into tears and blame me for all this 
 we talked about an hour ago and it 's better now between us 
 but i 'm pretty sure i broke two sisters apart 
 <unk> dr : make sure you read the name of the person you 're sexting before you do it redditors 
 otherwise you 'll find yourself feeling guilty and pretty <unk> this was two days ago but whatever 
 so me and a buddy had been drinking in manchester uk watching some rugby you know <unk> stuff 
 after a long afternoon session of beer and large men hurting each other we headed off into the night to catch the last train home to our town about 40 mins away 
 we board the train and it 's pretty quiet few other <unk> but that was about it 
 we where oblivious to the brunette sat on the other side of the train and like drunken <unk> we decide that it would be great to have a sing along and see if we can get the other drinkers involved 
 so we started out with a rendition of do n't wan na miss a thing '' that probably sounded like we where slaying multiple cats 
 after the first <unk> and <unk> this brunette must 've decided enough was enough and shouted at us to shut up 
 no drama in my eyes as it could n't have been pleasant 
 but not to my buddy 
 no no this devious little bastard did n't wan na give up and <unk> told the woman to show us your dick '' do n't blame him he was drunk 
 much to my surprise this woman <unk> a bright blue dildo out of a bag and throws it at him 
 shes not a great shot as i got a forehead full of rubber dick 
 this is then followed up packets of lube and a secondary dildo 
 turns out we pissed of a sexual education teacher she gathered her dicks and lube and sat quietly to wait for her stop 
 tl dr : sang <unk> got hit in the face with a dildo 
 edit : this has been narrated by /u/cyae1 
 thanks take a minute to scroll through the front page of /r/tifu 
 sex sex sex 
 being fingered or having someone pee in your mouth is not a fuckup 
 some of these posts are just <unk> can we stop with it 
 there is room for nsfw posts to be interesting but sex alone no matter how awkward is not worthy of /r/tifu 
 to the mods might i humbly suggest separating these somehow 
 thoughts welcome thanks in advance and sorry if i am being annoying as fuck **clarification : ** <unk> tifu and nsfw tifu can be hilarious when the ** '' fu '' itself is n't sexual ** 
 when you have sex however <unk> and consider it to be a <unk> it makes me feel like this sub is inhabited by immature teens and i know this is not the case 
 getting <unk> on your dick during anal is called life its not special 
 * * * edit : thank you <unk> for recommending the fantastic <unk> as a related sub for anyone who needs to share his <unk> sexual <unk> 
 great idea 
 edit 2 : thanks <unk> mobile so excuse formatting 
 so about a month ago i taught a ja junior achievement class at a local elementary school 
 i 'm an education major so i figured this would be good experience 
 i taught the same lesson to 5 different 5th grade classes throughout the day and it was about creating a new product and giving a sales pitch 
 towards the end of the day i had a class that was rather rowdy so i made sure to really watch over them and get involved in their projects 
 i stopped by one group of boys and was intrigued by their drawing 
 i asked what they were making and one boy said it 's a giant roller coaster '' 
 awesome 
 creativity 
 as i was about to give them a compliment on their project one of the other boys looks at me and says yeah 
 giant just like ryan 's mom '' 
 he pointed at ryan and ryan looked at me with the saddest of eyes hoping that the boy would be <unk> 
 instead of being an adult i fucking lost it 
 i laughed so hard right in front of ryan 
 ryan proceeded to <unk> his eyes out and start hitting his head off of his desk 
 i just walked away and told the actual teacher that he was having some sort of meltdown and stayed away from that group for the rest of their class 
 tl dr : laughed at a 5th grade your mom '' joke made kid cry instead of being an adult avoided kid rest of the day 
 edit : everyone needs to chill 
 i felt like shit after i did it that 's why it 's on tifu ... because i fucked up 
 the only teaching experience i had up to that point was with high school students where this scenario would have played out a lot <unk> 
 i guess it was just a natural reaction and i guess that 's why i 'm getting my degree in secondary ed 
 edit # 2 : before i walked away i looked at the other kids and asked them to focus on the project but i will admit i did n't do anything to help ryan because what the hell do i do with a kid that is repeatedly smashing his head off his desk 
 also the joke was n't funny 
 i guess i laughed because i totally did n't expect that kid to say it 
 kind of like one of those oh my god '' laughs 
 edit # 3 : this is my final edit 
 you better believe i would apologize to the kid now but i wo n't see him ever again unless i coincidentally teach another ja class with him in it 
 i 'm looking at it a little more <unk> because he was all buddy buddy with his group until i showed up and the other kid said it 
 probably still should have talked to him but we all make mistakes 
 definitely taking this as a learning experience 
 thanks for all the comments and upvotes 
 this is my first post to really take off 
 so this happened a little under two months ago but i felt as if this had to be shared because it was extremely traumatizing 
 so my girlfriend and i were getting it on for the first time and it involved really good foreplay and cuddling and whatnot 
 with me when it comes to a new person for the first time my nerves can get the best of me and sometimes i suffer from performance anxiety when it comes to first times with others so during sex i had a hard time keeping it up my penis that is simply because of the nerves i was <unk> 
 my girlfriend understood completely and we decided to take a break and try again in maybe 30 minutes 
 so when we finally got into it again it was much better 
 we were really going at it missionary style when she says to me when you cum just pull out and do it on my stomach '' 
 that was fine with me so i kept going until 15 seconds later she said yeah 
 better out than in i always say '' 
 at that moment i exploded 
 i laughed so fucking hard and my erection disappeared faster than most things possibly can 
 i was on her bed with my limp dick in her and i was losing it 
 needless to say sexy time went unfinished that night and that was that 
 thankfully she found it really funny too and takes some of the blame for it 
 shrek is love shrek is life 
 tl dr - having sex with girlfriend for first time she makes shrek joke i laugh so hard i lose my erection sex over 
 i feel like a fucking idiot 
 something something did n't happen today 
 me and my girlfriend browse reddit all the time 
 we read the r/tifu front page almost every night before we doze off 
 thank for giving us hours of entertainment r/tifu 
 anyway a couple of nights ago i cooked a fucking amazing dinner for my girlfriend 
 you should 've seen this shit 
 fried shrimp that i spiced myself with all of her favorite ingredients 
 garlic pepper lemon and i even <unk> a couple of jalapenos and threw the fresh seeds in to make them extra spicy just like we both love 
 throw in some homemade sweet potato fries and a <unk> salad and i 've made the most delicious and <unk> dinner ever 
 if i was a white girl i would 've <unk> that shit 
 we ate together and she 's telling me how much she loved the food 
 she kept commenting during the meal that it was amazing 
 i was fucking proud of myself 
 i 've made some pretty decent meals in the past but this one was fucking epic 
 fast forward a couple hours and me and my girlfriend climb into bed 
 once there sexy times commence 
 we 're both really into it 
 after some rough and <unk> i finish and it 's my turn to pleasure her 
 so without hesitation i start fingering her 
 she 's moaning and enjoying it for a few moments ... until she <unk> the words i never thought i 'd ever be scared to hear : * '' do you still have jalapeno juice on your fingers 
 * ten seconds later she 's running out of bed and jumping into a cold bath 
 i hung my head in shame and embarrassment 
 i read a story exactly like this among the top of all time on this page ... i should 've known 
 i know it 's a story you all have probably read before but in the moment i felt like i fucked up royally and ironically enough to <unk> a post 
 not to mention my girlfriend said when she climbed out of the tub * '' have n't you read enough tifu to know better 
 * tl dr : made an awesome dinner for the gf fingered her with spicy hands and might as well have shoved a jalapeno in her clam 
 ** -- -- -** edit : thanks for all the help <unk> advice guys 
 now i have plenty have things to put in my girlfriend 's vagina when this happens again 
 i 'm getting a lot of questions and confusion so here 's a little faq ... & gt 1 why didnt you wash your hands you sick fuck 
 a : i did 
 once after eating the meal but not very well 
 although some people have commented that washing your hands does n't help in the first place 
 go figure 
 & gt 2 sexy times '' 
 do you really say that shit to your girlfriend you <unk> 
 a : yeah i do 
 & gt 3 you finished first 
 ugh you 're an asshole 
 a : yeah she was on top and i finished before she did 
 not like i was n't planning on helping her finish ... hence the touching 
 & gt 4 did she really say that when she came out of the bathroom 
 did this really happen 
 a : yep 
 & gt 5 what 's the recipe 
 a : 1 lemon 's worth of juice ... 4 cloves of garlic ... 1 tbsp of black pepper ... 1/2 tbsp of <unk> ... 1/2 tbsp of <unk> ... 2 jalapeno 's worth of seeds ... salt to taste 
 <unk> shrimp in a pan with butter and olive oil 
 ** -- -- -** edit 2 : * well now my top post ever is this fu 
 looks like we 'll never really forget this happened 
 thanks everyone 
 * til no one reads the entire post 
 i still have people saying the same shit over and over when i included extra details in the first edit 
 sigh 
 * also <unk> account for shame ... let me preface this story with the fact that we are currently potty training my preschool daughter 
 she almost has it down but usually requires either my husband or myself to stand by the door to watch 
 this week we have been working so hard to break her of the habit and for the past few days has been going by herself 
 my periods are usually pretty heavy 
 i realized i had waited too long to take out a tampon when i went to pee and it slid out in all of its bloody glory straight into the toilet 
 my dad constantly lectured me growing up about making sure i never flush any feminine hygiene products into the toilet so naturally i panicked and decided to reach in to get it 
 my hand clenched down on the bloody tampon and i quickly pulled it out of the murky water 
 only it was n't a tampon 
 it was a big ol <unk> <unk> turd log 
 in my haste to grab the tampon i had put a master grip on that turd and it was <unk> through my fingers 
 super grossed out i quickly chucked what i could of the turd back into the toilet only to realize i still had n't retrieved the tampon 
 in what had to be the least fun game of fishing i <unk> my hand back into the toilet and splashed around haphazardly looking for the hidden string 
 after an eternity i triumphantly grabbed the tampon string only to realize that i was triumphantly grabbing a tampon string 
 tldr : my hands will never be clean again edit : front page 
 holy crap ... i was struggling with a hard case of morning wood which my wife and i refer to as the <unk> <unk> she wasn’t particularly engaged by the sight of my swollen penis and told me to “do what i <unk> never one to resist the urge to fire my main weapon i <unk> the <unk> of my extra little men on her stomach 
 record time too – 3 minutes good stuff 
 feeling pride in my work i hopped from our bed and turned on the shower ready to <unk> 
 returning to the bedroom while the water warmed to a toasty temp my wife lie napping peacefully 
 why would i not interrupt that 
 without a thought i bounded over to partake in my most favorite of <unk> <unk> the belly <unk> 
 i planted my head in her stomach and proceeded to blast a raspberry with deserved force 
 it was very wet and rather salty down there 
 tl dr : don’t jizz on you wife then rub your face in it unless you’re into the sort of thing 
 edit : fixed a <unk> actually happened yesterday so yifu 
 so i 'm at the <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 two nights ago saturday my girlfriend and i are stumbling home after a night of lone stars and music 
 we get to our hotel and the lobby bar is still rocking at 2:30am 
 as we walk past the <unk> still partying <unk> route to the elevator bank a friend spots me and yells hey <unk> 
 we go over to the bar catch up for a sec and i notice his crew is leaning on the bar next to sorta with mark cuban 
 my jaw drops this is the moment i 've been waiting for for a long time 
 now i 'm not a fan of the dallas <unk> but i do appreciate mark cuban 's success and his <unk> 
 but that 's not what i want to tell him 
 what i want to go up to and tell him is that a few years ago i had a dream about him where i gave him a sandwich and we became friends 
 i even tweeted that brief amazing story to him to following morning which he obviously never wrote back to : & gt just remembered that last night i <unk> i was friends with @ <unk> and we were eating sandwiches 
 now i 'm sad it 'll never be ... i chickened out 
 i have no problem with talking to celebrities - in my line of work we come across them all the time at parties events shoots etc - so it was not me being star struck in any way 
 even though he was openly talking to whoever was near him i could n't be the weirdo that goes up to mark cuban and tells him about a dream that he was in 
 i regretted missing out on the moment over and over 
 my girlfriend was getting tired of me <unk> about it 
 i literally could n't stop thinking about it 
 i hate missed opportunities - because they equal regrets 
 and then yesterday monday afternoon we 're walking through our hotel lobby and guess who walks by ... mark cuban is hurriedly going the opposite direction 
 this is my shot 
 hey mark '' 
 he <unk> down 
 hey dude '' mark says with a warm friendly smile coming to a full stop 
 now is my chance to tell the story the one i 've been waiting for years to tell him 
 i see he 's in a rush so i quickly thrust my hand out for a hand shake and begin speed talking ... hey mark i do n't want to tell you about being a fan or whatever but i want to tell you about my dream 
 you were in my dream 
 this was a couple years ago 
 and we were good friends because i gave you a sandwich 
 but then i woke up and was sad 
 and i wanted to tell you this the other night but i chickened out 
 but i figured you 'd appreciate it 
 and now we 're actually seeing each other but i do n't have a sandwich for you 
 and you never tweeted back at me by the way 
 so i just thought i 'd tell you that to finally get it off my chest 
 so i guess we 're friends now 
 ha '' 
 i was talking so fast that i could n't process the degree that i creeped this man out 
 halfway through my 30 second <unk> he began slowly walking away with his mouth in a frown and his eyes darting everywhere except towards me 
 his only response was a forced smile and k '' 
 i 've been cringing for the last 24 hours 
 tl dr - i had a dream about mark cuban 3 years ago and then threw <unk> at him yesterday and he probably thinks i 'm a <unk> 
 **update <unk> : ** i got back to the office this morning 
 my whole company has had a good laugh about it and decided to <unk> my desk 
 edit real quick : can i just say how awesome you guys all are 
 because you are 
 i noticed i 'm getting a lot of praise for my support and i just want to say that you all deserve the same love and happiness that we have 
 we are n't perfect by any means 
 i just called him an hour ago to complain at him because he finished the milk and did n't add it to the list 
 my cereal was already poured 
 thanks again for everyone 's kind words 
 i hope you all find the love we share 
 it is work and some days we both say things we do n't mean but i know i would n't trade my worst day with him for my best day with anyone else and i hope he feels the same 
 link to original : tl dr : my hubby found my letter and responded with his own letter 
 we did n't get to talk and i have a bunch of questions but will give him the space that he is telling me he needs to grow and figure out this part of him 
 also weed 
 hey guys 
 i 'm not 100 % sure where to put this update so hopefully it does n't get deleted 
 i 'll start with saying that after a bunch of awesome advice and encouragement i bought a <unk> gift card and loaded it with $ 150 of the money i was saving to visit my sister and mom this summer 
 it was important to me that i spend my money and not my husband 's 
 i stopped doing nails professionally when i had my first daughter 
 it just seemed easier and we did n't have the money to pay for childcare so now i babysit sometimes and do nails for people at my house occasionally 
 definitely not steady income 
 i also included a letter i wrote to him written on the <unk> we made together on our honeymoon 
 i told him how much he means to me and that he is my best friend 
 i also added that i would like to talk but understand if he is n't ready 
 i thanked him for our beautiful daughters and for being the best person i 've ever known 
 and i left it at that 
 he went to work around <unk> am and was home about 3 pm which was awesome 
 we dropped the girls off at my mother in laws house to be baby sat by my sister in law until my best friend got off work 
 we went to the store and bought a bunch of the food we do n't allow our toddler to have 
 i had an 1/8th of mr. nice guy a strain a good friend of ours grows and sells to <unk> around here 
 basically the night was <unk> we had a great time laughing and just spending time together 
 we actually took a shower together for the first time since we were dating 
 it was very sweet and intimate 
 my husband was the one who suggested the shower 
 we probably spent 30 minutes just laughing and goofing off under hot water 
 i 'm sorry if that is n't as romantic as some people <unk> but for us that is romance 
 i knew by the way he was acting that he had found the letter 
 he was being very <unk> and kissy 
 i could see how vulnerable he was but i let him take the <unk> on the night 
 after our shower we dried off and drove to an old smoking spot of ours 
 he smoked a few <unk> and we spent an hour on the tailgate of our truck listening to the wind and crickets and laughing about how different our lives were from when we met 
 we <unk> about a lot and he held me when i got cold 
 at this point i did n't think my husband would initiate any conversation about the makeup 
 we were literally <unk> our seat <unk> to head home when he stopped and looked me in the eyes and said thank you '' 
 and he kissed me like it was our wedding night 
 and then he drove home 
 i cleaned up the kitchen and he disappeared into the garage 
 at this point it was about 10 and i was getting sleepy 
 remember i have a two month old so i have n't slept through the night in quite some time 
 i had to pump like there was no tomorrow so i settled down on the couch and turned on community 
 i find funny stuff is the easiest at distracting me from the pain of my cracked nips 
 while i was pumping my husband must have come in and gone to bed 
 i went into the garage to find it empty 
 i was actually hurt because i was n't sure why he went to bed without saying goodnight 
 i climbed into bed and put my back to him haha 
 he moved across the bed and spooned me 
 i fell asleep <unk> but confused 
 he sneaked out this morning without waking me 
 my alarm went off at 7 to go pick up the girls 
 i wandered into the bathroom and found a letter sitting on the toilet 
 my husband had written me i 'm assuming either at work or while he was in the garage or both 
 the garage at our house is basically a room where my husband and i play our video games and hang when the girls are sleeping 
 there is a couch and a table and tv 
 all its missing is heat 
 in the letter my husband was very sweet 
 he explained that he just likes to feel pretty sometimes and that he did n't start this until we met and he would watch me put on my makeup and see how much prettier i felt 
 he thanked me for the gift card and laughed at it 
 he told me he loves me and is happy i picked him to spend my life with 
 then he told me right now he just ca n't talk about this with me face to face 
 one day he assured me he will be ready even though he does n't know when that will be 
 i have a few questions for him but i understand and i will wait 
 i 'm sorry if i do n't have any more to update or that this did n't turn into a giant <unk> springer episode where it turns out my husband was blowing dudes in the back of our <unk> or wanting to leave me because we all know that would make for a more interesting story 
 thanks again for all of your support guys 
 so this just happened a short while ago and i 'm <unk> as fuck 
 i matched with a cute girl on tinder 
 kind of a weird nose but otherwise pretty cool 
 self described <unk> <unk> and asking for hookups only '' 
 i was n't really on tinder for the sex i 'm sure the internet will believe that but seriously i 'm new in town and am meeting people any way i can but i 'm always down to get a blowjob because who is n't 
 i messaged her asking what the scope of a hookup is and if she <unk> safe sex seemed like a good idea to ask we had a very frank and enjoyable conversation about sexual <unk> and she seemed to match pretty well with me 
 she gave me her snapchat we exchanged some pics with less than socially <unk> amounts of clothing 
 i had plans tonight but told her i was free afterwards 
 she replied <unk> 
 i asked her if she wanted me to come over later 
 she said she wanted me to fuck her later 
 later comes around she gives me her address 
 i went over jokingly texting a friend if i die tell them i died trying '' 
 i got a little lost arriving at her house a little after midnight 
 i text her she comes out and tells me to park in the driveway 
 i enter the house her roommate is sitting on the couch 
 they offer me a <unk> drink 
 i think very little of it but remember that my mama always taught me not to take drinks from strangers 
 i jokingly refuse 
 they insist 
 i pull out the apple juice i brought in case i did n't like whatever they were mixing i know apple juice + vodka is icky but all they had was cranberry ... ew 
 the kitchen is just around the corner 
 i head to the kitchen assuming the <unk> will be sitting out 
 the vodka is nowhere to be seen 
 i enter the living room to ask where the vodka was 
 the girl says i need to leave 
 i ask why 
 she says i do n't really owe you an explanation '' 
 i leave confused 
 on the way home i think it over 
 the only thing i had done before getting kicked out was refusing the drink 
 i text her telling her that i think the only reason she would have acted in the way she acted was if the drink was drugged 
 she tells me i did n't look as attractive in person as i did on snapchat 
 best case scenario : girl thought i was ugly as fuck in person 
 worst case scenario : girl tried to drug my drink with ill intentions 
 tl : dr i went on a tinder date and may have nearly gotten drugged + <unk> 
 edit : since so many people are commenting on the apple juice drinks had been discussed and she said that she had cranberry juice and vodka 
 i think cranberry juice is kind of icky so i brought a clearly labeled bottle of apple juice 
 probably should have texted her telling her i was bringing it but it did n't even occur to me that it was weird to bring my own <unk> 
 *update : all jokes aside i genuinely appreciate all the replies on here 
 this situation fucking sucked and not knowing anyone on campus sucks to 
 i always believed all comedy comes form a dark place and helps deal with shit and you guys just proved my point 
 thank <unk> this happened about a month ago 
 i just read another recent post about inscest on here so i thought i 'd post this 
 backstory : - i was *finally* starting to break some ground in my freshmen year by breaking out of my shell 
 for me even saying hi or smiling at a classmate was a big step 
 - i 've been dating the same girl for over three years now and we 've known each other since middle school 
 when we were kids her mom would refer to me as her son and my mom would refer to her as her daughter 
 we would occasionally joke about the whole inscest aspect of our relationship when we started dating 
 - since ios 8 came out we 've been sending each other lots of voice <unk> instead of texts 
 the story : the university i 'm attending is in a city that is <unk> for being hard to make friends in 
 it 's a completely new area for me and i know absolutely no one 
 the fact that i was starting to at least talk to classmates was a huge positive step for me 
 we get our usual break in class and i stay at the spot and check my texts 
 i see that my gf sent me a voice memo it 's usually <unk> silly things and i raise the phone up to my ear to listen to it 
 the voice memo is her saying in a very <unk> voice do you miss your sister 's mouth '' 
 the volume was loud enough that everyone two rows in front of me and behind me could hear me 
 not positive if the prof heard 
 i start sweating bullets and just turn red 
 word quickly spread through campus and now i just go to the library during my breaks and study 
 i figure i 'll make friends when i get a <unk> : ... and scene 
 she found it 
 <unk> <unk> 
 5 hours 
 good work guys 
 i have been dating '' again and like many <unk> in <unk> i have been doing with the aid of the internet 
 after browsing the dating pool on the popular dating site okcupid '' i found myself texting this girl a couple times 
 i suggest we meet in prospect park and walk around 
 for those of you who have never been prospect park is a bit bigger than your standard park '' 
 designed <unk> law <unk> in <unk> this thing is almost 600 <unk> with tons of small <unk> and <unk> and small corners 
 when she suggested we bring a couple canned beers along for the walk i was into it 
 i figure keep them in bags spend some time on the <unk> traveled bits and have a nice date walking and talking and sipping 
 around 2 hours into our date we find a nice little bench by the water to hang out 
 after about 20 minutes of chilling a giant police <unk> pulls up 
 anyone who is relatively irresponsible in new york knows what happens next : they take your id run it to look for warrants and after they determine you are not wanted for anything more serious they write you a $ 25 ticket and leave you alone 
 we sit on the bench for what seems like a while patiently waiting for them to do their thing making short jokes about our records and how this is going to make a great story 
 i noticed there was an issue when i saw the first office get out of the car with only one <unk> 
 the other guy got out and started unloading the stuff from his back seat to the <unk> 
 i <unk> remember getting an open container offense a couple years ago different park but i only vaguely remember paying my $ 25 
 turns out i didnt 
 2 hours into a first date i am in handcuffs asking her to look after the other 2 beers i brought 
 there is a small crowd and right before they cart me off i blurt our soo i guess i will call you '' 
 wink 
 edit : my roommate sitting across from me just told me that her friend sent her this link not knowing it was me 
 i feel like its going to get back to the okc date 
 reddit always finds a way ... there was a <unk> in my area last night 
 for those of you not from new england that means high winds and lots of <unk> 
 usually these storms come with snow but this time it 's rain 
 because of the time of year there were lots of clogged drains and <unk> because of all the leaves 
 because of the wind electricity was out in some areas and very few of the traffic lights were fully <unk> the were mostly blinking yellow or red 
 my gps app waze told me to take some back roads since the highway i usually go on was backed up most likely due to flooding 
 lots of roads are blocked off with police <unk> or just jammed because of the traffic lights not working 
 i get <unk> to a road with a big puddle 
 i did n't know how big it was but some cars were driving through it so i thought i could too 
 half way down the street the water is getting deeper i 'm committed now 
 i do n't stop i pictured myself a <unk> on the oregon trail attempting to ford the river 
 much like the <unk> trail game something goes wrong 
 the car stalls water starts seeping in through the floor and doors 
 luckily i waved down a truck behind me and got him to push me out into a parking lot 
 the tow truck came and the driver confirmed the car <unk> 
 the car will probably be <unk> when the insurance <unk> comes to see it next monday 
 i got to walk in the rain to the train station to get to work 
 i 'm cold and soaking wet and probably need a new car 
 not a great start to my birthday but i get to post on /r/tifu so i got that going for <unk> girlfriend 's phone stopped working and the replacement turned out to be a piece of crap 
 her brother offered to send his old phone as a replacement 
 we live away from home because of university 
 delivering things to my parents house feels safer 
 we already did that a few times 
 so we decided to let them know something was coming with the mail 
 i decided to give my mother a heads up with a text 
 so i texted : girlfriend is expecting a package '' 
 not thinking anything of it 
 my mother did n't respond and again i thought nothing of it 
 she does that often 
 however when i came home 2 weeks later i learned that she had been panicking the whole time 
 she thought i knocked up my girlfriend 
 she <unk> an explanation 
 i gave one and laughing ensued 
 so as a bonus i learned that my mother thinks i 'm capable of getting my girlfriend pregnant and announcing it through text with a shitty pun 
 **tl dr** : i texted my mother and she thought i knocked up my girlfriend 
 edit : according to my girlfriend i 'm wrong because it was 2 days and not 2 weeks 
 edit 2 : thanks to /u/isthisnew for narrating my story 
 i should start this off by saying i work at a school for children with special needs developmental <unk> and autism 
 one of our student 's biggest <unk> things she works for or can trade in for is a burger king crown 
 she gets to wear the crown and for five minutes she is the princess and gets to do whatever she wants within reason 
 unfortunately her crown broke so i made it a point to get one for her as soon as i could 
 so the other day i was at a job interview for a new position within my company 
 i dressed up all fancy like in a nice black suit and tie 
 i made sure to stop at burger king to get a crown then i get on my way home and jump on the highway 
 at this point i see out my rear view mirror a pull up next to the car behind me and this kid sticks his head out the window with a burger king crown on 
 he then gives the metal <unk> on sign to the car next to him 
 the car drove by me and i look inside to see only what can be described as a car full of stoned 19 year olds 
 they all had long hair looked <unk> they were laughing and listening to <unk> 
 they ignored me probably because i was dressed all <unk> and again pulled up next to the car in front of me and the kid stuck his head out the window with a <unk> crown on yelling / <unk> to the car in front of me 
 it is then that i realize i still have my burger king crown in my car for one of the students i work with 
 perfect 
 i 've had my stoned shenanigans in the past so i thought these kids would get a kick out of it if a guy in a suit does the same exact thing to them 
 i put on my burger king crown and maneuver right up next to their car and roll my window down 
 holding the crown on with my hand i stick my head out the window and give them a metal rock on sign with my other hand with a nod 
 they freak 
 the fuck 
 out 
 the whole car is laughing and can not believe their eyes 
 i think i saw an actual mind blown '' moment there 
 the guy in their car with the burger king crown happened to be in the passenger seat and in a moment of <unk> throws his body back into the driver in laughter 
 this caused the driver to swerve into the guard rail next to him fucking up the side of his car 
 <unk> 
 my apologies <unk> dudes 
 i hope the story of the guy in a suit with a burger king crown was worth it 
 luckily no other cars were involved and nobody was hurt 
 this happened minutes ago : my wife is a graduate assistant at a major university in our state 
 this semester is her first teaching two sections of 20 students 
 while fixing her wifi connection i saw that she had an assignment open in another window 
 i added the line i like dicks 
 dicks dicks dicks 
 and vaginas '' 
 turns out this assignment was about to be posted to her teaching <unk> and she saved my changes 
 i forgot about it until one of her students emailed her about it 
 on a side note what are the options for a homeless male in a non <unk> area 
 *update* the file was only downloaded once by the student that emailed my wife 
 she <unk> it before anyone else saw it 
 yes i know it was a stupid thing to do hence the tifu post 
 it was n't emailed directly so no <unk> files are sitting in any inboxes so hopefully no more damage will come from this 
 my wife of course is angry but she is forgiving some may consider to a fault in this case 
 *update 2* i went to my wife 's boss and explained the situation 
 he was unaware that anything had happened but assured me that my wife will not be held accountable in any way 
 only one student saw the line the rest did not download until it was <unk> my girlfriend and i were talking about her upcoming holiday to japan when she mentions that she 's lost a lot of weight from walking a lot at her new job 
 gf : i 'm going to be so thin for my trip '' 
 and now i knowing she loves japanese food decide to take a jab at that and go to say and when you get back you 're gon na be so fat from all the food you 've eaten '' 
 but instead what comes out of my mouth is when you get back you 'll be fat again '' 
 it took her a second to process what i just said as did i and we just fell silent from shock 
 she then says you always thought i was fat '' 
 no i never did <unk> brain 
 edit : of course my highest <unk> post ever is about me accidentally calling my gf fat 
 good work <unk> christmas i bought myself a dildo for educational purposes only 
 this dildo has a suction cup for sticking on walls and such 
 i stuck this dildo to my <unk> plaster wall about 15 minutes ago and tried pulling it off 
 there was quite a lot of resistance from the dildo and then the dildo finally came off taking some of the wall with it 
 i need to get plaster before anyone in my family find out about my wall and the dildo 
 image for proof edit : i am a guy edit 2 : i tried my best guys edit 3 : <unk> 
 i never thought this would get to the <unk> 
 glad you all enjoyed my little educational adventure so i was back in my home town and my wife and i went to a nice <unk> restaurant with some old friends of mine from high school and some of their parents 
 on the way out of the place we were all headed through the lobby which <unk> to a hall that was only wide enough for two people to walk shoulder to shoulder at best 
 an older couple was coming in so we stepped out of the way to let them pass 
 as we were standing there i gave my wife a loving pat on the ass 
 i immediately heard wrong ass '' 
 one of the girls that came with us an old girlfriend from school had somehow switched places with my wife 
 what made it worse was it was her husband and her parents were all there 
 they had quite a good laugh at my <unk> while i turned as red as the lobster i had for dinner 
 fuck 
 i 'll never hear the end of <unk> at work i had this stapler that made funny squeaking noises when the top lid/part was pressed 
 my colleague bob really hated the <unk> sound of that squeaking 
 to annoy bob i placed the top lid/part between my teeth and was making engine noises 
 suddenly i sneezed and tried to pull the stapler out of my mouth but teeth clenched it hard in place and stapled the roof of my mouth 
 i screamed bob screamed sharp pain blood dripping and bob totally freaked out 
 everyone around me came running and i was taken to hospital 
 emergency room doctor looked at me sitting there with my mouth open like a <unk> asked bob what was wrong 
 bob explained 
 doc shook his head and then proceeded to gently use some blunt <unk> type <unk> to pry the staple loose and pull it out 
 <unk> 
 was given two shots and sent home with some painkillers 
 was also told not to put anything in my mouth that didn’t belong there 
 i went home had nothing but juice for two days because i couldn’t even feel my upper jaw and mouth hurt like hell 
 my conversation with hr after i returned to work days later 
 **hr : ** please tell us again how did you manage to staple the roof of your mouth '' 
 **me : ** is this not covered in my medical 
 **hr : ** all your hospital bills have been cleared 
 we 're just concerned about how you got injured and should we be worried about any future incidents 
 **me : ** ... **hr : ** ... **me : ** sorry wo n't happen again 
 i 'm never going to annoy bob again i think ... note : shared the story in another thread was asked to post this here 
 warning : please do not try this at home or your place of <unk> happened about 20 minutes ago my girlfriend and i had just finished in town so i walked her home on the way home we were both being a little flirty 
 after reaching her house long story short i had her over the kitchen counter very quickly 
 about 20 seconds into it we hear rustling coming from the closet instinctively i pulled out <unk> up 
 she opens the closet and out falls her dad straight away my stomach drops because he was one of those guys who made it clear i was n't to touch his daughter anymore than a peck on the cheek but then in the back of the closet was a woman id never seen before i knew both parents and it was pretty obvious that <unk> had been doing the naughty naughty with another woman 
 the dad scrambled to his feet <unk> the fact that i and his daughter just caught him cheating and came straight at me without a second thought i was out the door and down the road i have no idea what 's happened since ive left im waiting for a reply from my girlfriend ill keep you all posted 
 tl/dr : got intimate with gf shortly interrupted by gf 's cheating dad i didnt get to finish 
 update 1 : nothing yet it 's pretty late though if she has n't replied by the morning i may go over make sure she 's ok update 2 : first things first apologies for the shitty grammar and punctuation ive always been bad at that 
 girlfriends mom knows and apparently shits going down at their house im getting ready to leave my house now and head over for a <unk> + boyfriend discussion i do n't think i 'll get hurt 
 extra info for clarity : - girlfriend and i are 18 we both live with our parents until uni starts next <unk> - her dad is a lot bigger than me i was n't gon na stay around and get my head kicked in i knew he would n't hurt his daughter he may be a scumbag but he 's one of those dad 's who loves his daughter to much to hurt them 
 <unk> her <unk> was n't my first thought when he ran at me - mystery woman was in fact a coworker of the dad 
 - i didnt get bummed by her dad - i 'm not one for <unk> i would 've had to come clean no matter what even if gf had n't said anything 
 update 3 : i just left her house basically her moms furious at her dad obviously but she 's 'not surprised at mine and her daughters actions not sure what she 's tryna say about me 
 the dad did n't speak to me the entire time awkward <unk> between us 
 girlfriend is also furious at her dad but <unk> me nothing will change between me and her 
 for the best i think the parents are going to decide what happens between them over the next few days 
 the mom is currently trying to get in touch with the other woman i wish i could be there for that call but gf will keep me posted on how that goes 
 note : the story takes place several years ago at that time i was living in a pretty nice apartment in a decent part of my hometown 
 only problem was that my flatmate decided to leave me since she moved back to her town to live with her bf and i was in desperate search of new flatmate 
 the apartment was rather expensive and sometimes it was hard on me to pay the bills myself 
 so on the night of the fuck-up i was with my aunt who was working at a restaurant at that time 
 her shift has ended and we were talking behind the restaurant 
 she asked me how i was and if i had found a new flatmate 
 i said no and explained that things are hard for now but i was a firm <unk> that everything would turn out good for me 
 she asked me if i had everything i need she used to help me out with some small <unk> from the restaurant kitchen you know salt sugar some eggs stuff like that 
 i told her that i had everything but salt since i forgot to buy some 
 she offered to help me out and went back into the kitchen 
 she returned shortly thereafter and handed me a ziploc baggie with some salt in it about half way full 
 i placed it my pocket and after we parted ways i came back to my apartment 
 i threw my jacket on the couch and decided to lay down a bit on my bed 
 shortly after that i received a phone call from a friend of mine who said that he had organized a small gathering for a few of our mutual friends in a local nightclub and asked if i wanted to join them 
 i thought for a few seconds and decided to go out and have some fun 
 so i agreed to go and went to take a shower and get myself dressed 
 after a few hours he was at my place and in my hurry to go out i grabbed my jacket from the couch with the salt inside and went out 
 we were at the club not long after that 
 we paid for the admission and got some fancy looking stamps on our wrists 
 it was then time to get checked by security for weapons you know the usual 
 the security guard who was about to check me was rather <unk> the usual <unk> looking guy but he was kinda friendly 
 he started doing his routine tapping my pockets going behind my back etc 
 at this very moment my mind registered the fact that i was wearing the jacket with the salt in it ... you know the suspicious looking white stuff in a ziploc baggie 
 my eyes quickly widened when the guy tapped the pocket with the salt in it 
 he gave me a look and demanded i empty my pocket 
 <unk> i pulled out the contents of it including the bag with the salt 
 the guy immediately grabbed it and started questioning me what was that 
 of course i tried to explain that it was salt but he was having none of it 
 he quickly got other people from the security involved and called the cops for a possible <unk> '' 
 my friend was terrified trying to <unk> with the security but they quickly started searching him too 
 we tried to explain that it was a misunderstanding and that it 's in fact just salt but they said that they should leave it to the cops to figure it out 
 i was led outside the club and shortly after that the cops showed up 
 the security dude explained to them and they called for me to go with them to the police station for further questioning '' 
 i was n't handcuffed but people outside were looking at me like i was the biggest crook they ever saw 
 i was put in the back seat of the cop car and we drove to the station 
 the entire road i tried to explain the same to them but they only said that we shall soon see '' and they asked me how come a young girl like me could get involved in stuff like that '' i was brought to the station and i was left on the police bench to sit and wait while they went inside a room to talk to their chief 
 after a few minutes a guy came out from the room whom i immediately recognized 
 it was my uncle he is the guy who is married to my aunt but i do n't know the english term for that kind of person so i am calling him uncle who was the chief of the local police station fact which escaped my mind at those minutes 
 he sat down next to me and asked if i was ok. i said i was and tried to explain to him what was the situation 
 he shook his head and said he believed me 
 why you might ask 
 well he did what the others could n't figure out to do the entire evening .. he opened the bag and tasted the contents of it 
 he hugged me and asked if i wanted a ride home 
 i said yes and he drove me to my place 
 he of course asked me if his officers or the security guards were rough on me but i said that they were n't and that i am just disappointed that this happened 
 my whole evening was ruined and i did not want to show my face around town for a while 
 tl dr brought a bag of salt with me in a club 
 bouncer thought its drugs 
 i almost spent the night in jail for it 
 edit : let me sit on my laptop again and i 'll answer your questions 
 also i 'll change my goddamned tl dr edit 2 : <unk> ... i had no idea that this would blow up this much 
 i 've read over 200 comments in the past 2 hours and i got ta say i agree with you <unk> 
 cops should definitely know the difference between fucking salt and actual drugs 
 but as some of you pointed out there are a lot of drugs who have <unk> structure and could easily look like well salt for example so i see why the bouncer took this as an issue 
 also a lot of you wondered why my uncle tasted the substance 
 well for starters they did told him who they brought in for questioning 
 of course he recognized who i was and they also told him why i am there 
 they told him that i tried to counter this whole thing by claiming its salt and not drugs and my uncle who has worked for a <unk> amount of time with drugs in the respective department could pretty easily differentiate between table salt and ... well drugs 
 and he knew me pretty well to know that i am not the one to deal or use drugs 
 so he took it upon himself to prove that its a fucking <unk> and not cocaine or meth or crack and whatever else kids are taking these days 
 of course he took a big risk with this but he was so certain of me not fucking up like that that he was ready to try <unk> substance just upon my word 
 i do owe him a lot 
 edit 3 : jesus guys for people who are frequent on sub that requires reading you really are n't paying enough attention 
 it was never said that the <unk> officers mistook the salt for cocaine 
 just a suspicious white powder in a ziploc bag 
 a variety of drugs look like that 
 i had to set up helium balloons today at work for a small event we had planned 
 simple right 
 nope i filled up a balloon tied it and then i realized that i needed <unk> to tie it to 
 so i set the balloon down on the <unk> boss asked me to send him a clients skype handle on g chat as soon as possible 
 i quickly copied it and pressed <unk> and sent it without thinking twice 
 instead of the skype name i sent the following two messages got it sending now '' mia <unk> flexible blowjob '' : edit : top post in my reddit career 
 glad you guys enjoyed my fuck up 
 edit 2 : he 's cool he thought it was funny 
 edit 3 : i know you can delete skype messages this was a g <unk> was visiting so 
 cal with my girlfriend of two years and we decided to make a trip to disneyland for the day 
 that morning she had packed us a nice lunch with lots of veggies and healthy shit 
 i had no <unk> to eating healthy for once as the majority of my meals in la consisted of taco bell and <unk> i 'm canadian so i have to take advantage of this whenever possible throughout this vacation her and i constantly made <unk> jokes about our shitty eating habits and how we had left our healthy lifestyles back at home 
 well that morning she packs a big bag of spinach for us to munch on 
 spinach is my favorite healthy snack 
 however she did not take into account the fact that it would be sitting in the bottom of her backpack <unk> by the weight of other various <unk> for several hours in the anaheim heat 
 so i 'm standing in line for the indiana jones ride it 's about 5 o'clock and i 'm starting to feel <unk> 
 so i reach into her backpack and pull out this <unk> looking bag of spinach 
 most of the leaves had already turned into that flaccid combination of very dark <unk> pulp not <unk> at all 
 feeling disappointed i turn to my girlfriend and say jokingly everyone here should just leave their vegetables at home 
 they have no reason to be at a place like this '' 
 she laughed and my heart melted a little bit 
 excuse me '' 
 i turn around and a mother with her severely disabled daughter is standing right behind me in line 
 both are wearing bright orange shirts with some charity 's logo on it and disneyland 2014 '' in <unk> across the chest 
 then i look behind them 
 there is a large group of people wearing the same shirts 
 and they all have the same expression of disgust on their faces 
 my daughter is not a vegetable 
 she is the <unk> kindest thing ever 
 yatta yatta yatta 
 how dare you tell me where i can and ca n't take my own child '' 
 realizing what she thought i meant i quickly tried to cover up my ass 
 oh no 
 no 
 no 
 no 
 i did n't mean it that way 
 i was just referring to this rotten bag of spinach '' 
 what did you just call her '' 
 i pull out the bag of spinach from the backpack 
 one of the guys from the group walks up to me and says you think you 're funny 
 try taking care of a child with <unk> <unk> let alone suffer from it 
 i 'm sure you would n't be fucking laughing '' 
 before giving me another chance to explain myself he walks between my girlfriend and i as to cut off our spot in line 
 then he signals for the rest of the group to walk right by us 
 i had already waited in line for approximately 40 minutes and now a group of 20+ people felt they had the right to budge us in line because of a simple misunderstanding 
 what do you think you 're doing '' 
 i ask him we 're going on this ride before you '' 
 what gives you the right to do that '' 
 you fucking insulted my niece that 's what '' 
 my girlfriend is telling me to let it go but i 'm not letting this douchebag get away with this 
 so i walk ahead to the front of the group to <unk> our position in line 
 the mother says no you 're gon na have to wait in line like everybody else '' 
 wtf 
 i suddenly felt a hand on my shoulder 
 people from the group were forcefully pushing me to the back of the line 
 my brain was about to explode from the <unk> of the situation 
 without thinking i immediately turned around and swung at the douchebag who cut us off hitting him square in the jaw 
 by this time the rest of the people in line were watching us 
 my girlfriend rushed over and pulled me out of there before i heard one of the ladies from the group scream i need a cast member '' 
 two park employees came running up to us asking what all the commotion was 
 the mother of the handicapped girl told them how we had personally insulted her child as well as other disabled children in general 
 then they said that i had tried taking their place in line because i thought their group was too large 
 then the one <unk> showed the staff his swollen cheek saying how i turned violent when i would n't return to my place in line 
 that part was true but the way he explained it to them made it seem like i went <unk> <unk> on his ass 
 then i told them my side of the story 
 they did n't believe it 
 a nice cast member by the name of <unk> escorted us out of the park 
 i am now banned from all disney parks for life 
 we went to <unk> 's the next day without any incident or vegetables 
 tldr my spinach went bad some crazy woman assumed i was insulting her disabled daughter and i am now no longer allowed to visit the <unk> place on earth 
 edit 1 : the staff at disney showed us the footage of the incident before we were escorted out 
 i did punch another man in the face and that 's probably the main reason why i am banned 
 i fucked up there but i choose not to <unk> on it 
 edit 2 : thank you for the gold random stranger 
 this did n't happen today but i did n't have internet or reddit when this happened 
 i feel like sharing it with you 
 when i was really young i used to think that there were 2 types of diseases : the ones that can kill me and the ones that wo n't kill me 
 the ones that could kill me were the ones that i saw my mom being seriously worried about 
 between them cancer and pneumonia 
 eventually when i was around 7 or 8 i became sick 
 i had bacterial pneumonia 
 my mom got worried 
 as a <unk> i automatically thought i had a killing-tier disease 
 the next day at school i could only think about the possibility i could die at any moment 
 i felt obliged to tell my friends i was sick but i could n't remember the word pneumonia '' 
 as it was a killing-tier disease i thought that calling it cancer '' would have the same impact 
 as you can imagine it did n't 
 all my friends told their parents i had cancer 
 a shitstorm proceeded to happen 
 during the following days my mom received several calls from parents trying to share some hope and strength with her 
 when she went to school to pick me up people would stop her to talk about my condition 
 my mom had to spend several hours of shame explaining to people how stupid her son was 
 one week later i was healthy again and glad i was n't dead 
 edit & gt wow 
 thanks for the gold stranger this happened a few years ago but i still have n't really forgiven myself 
 i 'm an identical twin 
 my brother and i look very alike and all my life we 've both struggled with people always mixing us up 
 at a party one night i got drunk 
 very drunk 
 late in the night someone found me a comfortable spot on the floor and let me pass out 
 the next morning i woke up feeling quite <unk> 
 i saw my brother lying next to me 
 he was also awake 
 hey 
 where are we '' 
 i said 
 i quickly realised i was talking to my reflection and i 'd passed out next to a mirror 
 my housemate and i have been friends for <unk> years and constantly prank each other 
 early this morning i quietly came home from my overnight shift and heard him in his bedroom 
 knowing he was home without him knowing i was home was the perfect opportunity to do something funny 
 so i took my glasses off that 's important pulled my shirt up over my head like a mask and jumped into his open bedroom door with a running start 
 he was in his bed 
 time to die bitch '' 
 i yelled 
 no response 
 i used my best 90 's action movie villain voice 
 what 's wrong sweetheart ... <unk> got your tongue 
 <unk> '' 
 still no response 
 how about a kiss for daddy '' 
 the toilet flushed in his bathroom behind me 
 if this was a movie there would have been a <unk> <unk> on my face 
 i pulled my t-shirt down and put my glasses back on to find my housemate 's girlfriend who just spent her first night over sitting on his bed with the blankets pulled up to her neck 
 she was absolutely terrified 
 i slowly backed out while muttering <unk> went into my bedroom and laid down on the ground face first to hide my embarrassment from the world 
 i am truly a fuck up 
 edit : never seen my housemate so <unk> 
 all he had to do was take a dump and i did all the work in making an ass out of myself infront of company 
 the <unk> is fine and commented that my karate game was a bit weak i threw a few shadow <unk> when i first ran in edit : yes i realize he could have <unk> me with a <unk> ... <unk> happened tonight while i was out having a beer with a friend from work 
 i live on <unk> and we get a ton of japanese tourists through here 
 it 's like japan 's mexico 
 today was especially hot about <unk> so i was wearing a tank top shirt that <unk> a tattoo on my left arm 
 in walks a japanese couple obviously on vacation 
 the man spoke pretty good english and decided the bar was a perfect place to practice his english so he asks me what tattoo on yo <unk> mean '' 
 i told him oh this 
 my grandpa worked on the flight crew for a <unk> bomber in ww2 
 this is the <unk> from his bomber jacket '' 
 after it came out of my mouth and the look on the guys face ... i do n't know the word for the emotion his face showed ... i realized what i had said 
 he just exchanged a few words with his female friend and they both <unk> walked out of the bar into the night 
 guys i have never felt so bad for something i 've said in my <unk> 'll tell you right off the bat : if you do n't know <unk> <unk> how babies enter the world consider this your <unk> alert 
 ** when i was ten years old daddy knocked mommy up for the 5th time 
 another brother 
 yes please 
 about 8 months into the pregnancy my mom approaches me and asks if i 'd like to be present for the birth 
 hell yes i respond i 'm all about science 
 up to this point in my life i was under the distinct impression that all babies were birthed via <unk> so i 'm pumped 
 for the next few weeks i am a damn angel i knew i had been chosen because my parents deemed me mature enough '' to handle a surgery and i did not want that free pass to <unk> <unk> 
 fast forward to new year 's eve <unk> mom is in the hospital and we are waiting 
 no biggie i got my i can draw <unk> '' book a fat stack of blank printer paper and a handful of power <unk> <unk> 
 i 'm on my second <unk> when things start to heat up 
 a nurse hands me a little <unk> and some <unk> gloves 
 i snap them on and throw her a wink that would make <unk> <unk> weak in the knees 
 i 'm all business now 
 i move up to stand beside my mother but another nurse pulls me back and tells me to stand closer to her feet behind the ... doctor ... her legs are spreading ... this ca n't ... <unk> ... <unk> 
 abort 
 ** within thirty seconds i 'm fumbling for the <unk> button but it 's too late 
 before i can pray for <unk> goggles i 'm staring straight down the barrel of mom 's baby cannon 
 push '' 
 they urge 
 eat shit and die '' 
 mom screams 
 now they 're going full ham sandwich 
 the doctor is reaching into her cheese factory and i view hell in all its terrible glory <unk> in <unk> and the blood of <unk> 
 within five minutes it was all over 
 the nurses let me poke the <unk> with my <unk> fingers but not even that could console me 
 i was dead inside 
 tldr : got punk 'd by mommy 
 edit : fixed a word 
 edit 2 : thanks for the gold and the <unk> tip you glorious bastards 
 edit 3 : i 'm trying to convince my mom to come and add her version of the story but she 's not feeling it 
 i 'll keep working on her though 
 edit 4 : i got an audio clip of me and her talking about the experience on my phone 
 headed home now to upload 
 edit 5 : <unk> <unk> 
 here 's a short audio clip where i ask my mom a few questions about the <unk> cat was sitting in front of me

 cats like string 
 tl dr : my pussy attacked my pussy 
 first off to the best of my knowledge i am not mentally or physically disabled 
 ok this story came up during an askreddit feed last night and enough people asked for the <unk> i was a <unk> if i stole a medal from a mentally handicapped person that i decided to post the full story here 
 before reading please note that this is a fuck up 
 i see it as a fuck up 
 it’s a funny story and honestly if i could go back i’m not sure i would change anything but it’s still a fuck up and i mean no disrespect to the special olympics or anyone who <unk> in them 
 unless you’re an asshole like me and <unk> be in them 
 like most fuck ups on here this didn’t happen today 
 it was a few years ago in fact 
 to graduate from my school students needed to do a year long project that had a community service <unk> 
 one of my best friends-we’ll call him <unk> decided to do his project on the special olympics and got his volunteer hours by training with my school’s special olympics team that would be competing in bocce backyard bowling in the spring 
 after a few weeks ronnie talked me in to volunteering with the team as well 
 it was fun <unk> and i had some <unk> community service hours due to a water balloon incident 
 after months of training with them every week ronnie and i went to the actual special olympics event with the team to cheer them on 
 this is where it all went south 
 while our school’s team was warming up the coach came up to ronnie and i on the <unk> 
 i kid you not this is what she said 
 <unk> we only have 6 members and there needs to be 4 on a team to compete 
 i need you two to play on one of our teams or two kids aren’t going to get to play 
 yup 
 we were just as surprised 
 apparently when the coach signed up our school she said there were 8 players knowing that there were 6. so i guess she planned on ronnie and i taking one for the team the whole time 
 so that was that 
 ronnie and i pretty much had no choice because there were two special needs kids that weren’t going to get to compete if we didn’t play on their team 
 so ronnie and i put on sunglasses and walked onto the field with them 
 in our first match i don’t think ronnie and i have ever been so uncomfortable 
 and we’re pretty <unk> 
 for any who don’t know the rules of bocce the goal is to roll balls as close as possible to a point on the field knocking out the other <unk> balls if you can to get as many points each round 
 first to 12 points wins 
 ronnie and i just sort of lazily rolled the balls because what the fuck else were we supposed to do 
 however the two special needs kids on our team had been training for months and managed to win the game despite ronnie and i not really being 100 % invested in the win 
 right after that win we moved on and that’s when the tv cameras started trying to interview us 
 ronnie and i avoided those like the plague 
 sure we were willing to compete in the special olympics 
 but we weren’t about to act mentally disabled for the media 
 we had morals 
 unfortunately the morals weren’t really that strong 
 as we kept advancing ronnie and i sort of got more and more pumped up fueled by the cheering crowd and the excitement of the two other kids on our team 
 long story short by the time we got to the finals our group of 4 was so pumped full of competitive spirit that we won 12-0. i don’t think what we had done really hit us until we were on a podium receiving a medal 
 the fun didn’t stop there 
 at the end of the year my school had an <unk> ceremony in which people who won <unk> <unk> and whatnot were recognized in front of the whole school 
 ronnie and i had to stand up in front of our whole school <unk> shining on our <unk> as the phrase <unk> give a round of <unk> to our special olympics gold <unk> ” was announced on the <unk> loudspeaker 
 our friends won’t ever let us forget that one 
 so that’s it really 
 we both kinda felt rough about it and we have been <unk> money for the special olympics ever since 
 i don’t even like to say the word <unk> 
 so hopefully we don’t go right to hell despite the fact that our record is now similar to that of eric <unk> 
 tl/dr : i tried to volunteer at the special olympics ended up competing and winning edit : wowzers did not expect this much attention for this 
 as long as this many people are seeing this check out this link which will tell you how to volunteer near you 
 it 's an amazing <unk> though i wo n't promise that volunteering will get you a medal 
 by the way thank you to the kind <unk> who gilded this <unk> was at the park with my daughters 6 & amp 7. i assumed my usual position at a bench in the middle of the park that give me a view of the whole park 
 i usually sit there until i 'm called to push help or just watch 
 i pull out my phone and start playing mortal combat x. my 7 year old comes over about 10 minutes in and says the boys are saying bad words 
 i told her to take her sister and go to the other jungle gym 
 a few minutes pass and the boys head over to where my girls and a few others are playing 
 the boys are probably <unk> years old 
 now i hear them cursing and its echoing throughout the park because they are in a plastic slide 
 i walk over and say you guys need to watch your language '' loud enough for them and any parents to hear 
 had they been teenagers i would have said a lot worse and probably told them to leave but they were just young kids 
 a few seconds later and young lady who i am assuming was one of their mothers comes over and goes apeshit on her kid 
 she is yelling and cursing and threatening the kid and his <unk> 
 the language she was using was 20 times worse than the kids 
 this caused another mother to come over and yell at the yelling mother 
 the yelling mother did n't appreciate it and starts going apeshit on the mother too 
 now the father of one lady comes over and starts trying to break it up and the yelling mom goes apeshit on him too 
 now all of the kids have stopped playing and are watching and all the grown ups are screaming cursing threatening each other and threatening to call child services and to call the cops 
 then i got a text that dinner was ready 
 i grabbed my girls and walked to the car and they were all still going apeshit 
 it was <unk> the <unk> boom was <unk> and i was 23 and eager to make an impression at my new software startup job 
 i had arrived at work on monday morning to find a full-blown customer crisis that i worked straight through the night into tuesday afternoon to solve 
 just as i was about to leave on tuesday <unk> customer crisis erupted and i settled in for the <unk> <unk> pleased to have the opportunity to show my dedication 
 so here comes the f-up 
 it is now wednesday at noon crisis # 2 is finally solved and i am <unk> from 2 days of sleep deprivation 
 i am also faint from hunger having not eaten since dinner the night before 
 my needs are clear : wendy 's drive-through and get home to sleep 
 i pull into the wendy 's lot and my heart sinks : huge lunchtime line 
 too groggy to come up with an alternative i get in line and try <unk> to stay awake 
 twice my <unk> is interrupted by the couple in the <unk> behind me honking to move forward 
 that 's not the f-up though not yet ... finally my turn at the window 
 the cashier tells me $ <unk> which i know is n't right -- my usual grilled chicken <unk> # 4 costs $ <unk> -- but i 'm too tired to argue 
 i take the bag of food and two 2 
 wtf 
 drinks she hands me and drive off 
 i rip into the bag -- why are there two <unk> in here 
 too tired to care i eat and drive focused on getting home safely and into my bed 
 blood sugar rising my <unk> haze lifts enough to realize what i have done 
 i forgot to order at the drive-through microphone -- i just drove right by 
 that 's right i am eating not my own meal but the meal ordered by the honking couple behind me 
 i guess it 's not technically stealing since i paid for it 
 tl dr : drunk with sleep deprivation i skipped ordering and instead took some random couple 's order at the drive-through 
 when i was 15 not today but <unk> whilst i was home alone i discovered masturbating 
 for a <unk> shy teenage girl i was totally addicted but unfortunately lived in a house with 4 siblings and paper thin walls 
 online it recommended using the bath tap or shower head 
 so i ran a bath added a few <unk> of olive oil bc soft skin or whatever and lowered myself in 
 now i have advice for anybody masturbating with a bath tap for the first time 
 1. do n't fucking put the tap on full blast 
 i swear to god i came straight away to the extent where my stomach was <unk> and i could n't see 
 i hit my leg off the tap where it was burning hot i do n't know even what kind of noises i was making 
 thought it was a fit <unk> 2. do n't put oil in the fucking bath 
 after i was done i stood up and had no idea about the jelly legs 
 this combined with the already slippery bath meant i fell hit my stomach off the bath winded myself and my head on the ground 
 i remember lying there for a couple of minutes just looking at the floor 
 i genuinely thought my family was going to find me dead naked and oily 
 3. make sure your parents are n't in the bedroom beside the bathroom 
 to this day i have no idea if they heard me i ca n't remember if i made any noises although i 'm pretty certain i did 
 all i know is i left the bathroom <unk> and winded 
 tl dr : masturbated with the water jet for the first time was punished by jesus for <unk> 
 edit : holy shit so many creeps 
 yes i put olive oil in the bath makes u so silky smooth try it 
 thank u this is my first post n shit blew up 
 in my <unk> class we had just finished reading the scarlet letter '' 
 tldr the book 
 a woman is caught <unk> <unk> and has to wear a scarlet <unk> patch of cloth in the shape of an <unk> at all times 
 a major theme of the book is that the main character is being punished for her sin and secrecy 
 ah secrecy -- that sounds like a good <unk> to bullshit my entire paper around 
 how about i take it one step <unk> and term the theme of this paper ... <unk> 
 i think you know where this is going 
 i got my paper back about a week later to find that i was given a c. my teacher left a note at the top saying that word does not mean what you think it means '' and had <unk> every time i used any form of secretion '' or <unk> '' throughout the paper 
 apparently hester prynne the main character did not secrete her identity from anyone 
 secretion was not the most potent theme of the novel 
 <unk> hester prynne did not feel <unk> by society to secrete anything 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> so a little backstory : i live in a nice neighborhood where all of the families are fucked up husbands drink and cheat on wives wives pop xanax and cheat on husbands children become entitled and everybody pretty much hates eachother.. typical suburban neighborhood 
 so every summer one weekend i throw a <unk> party where half of the neighborhood drinks all the booze i buy and eat all of the food i cook then get drunk pass out on the floor then i cook them breakfast in the morning and then they leave 
 well the life of the party was always my neighbor let 's call him b 
 b worked in <unk> and was loaded 
 about a year ago b 's wife informed me that b beat her and their son alot 
 oh by the way their son is 24 still living at home never had a job entitled 
 so i gave her and her son a copy of the key to my house so if b was being abusive to either of them they would have a safe haven 
 fast forward to now : b 's wife divorced him and basically bled his bank account and <unk> dry and now b 's wife lets call her a is a single mom with more money than she can spend living with her son let 's call him wtf 
 last week i had to go out of town for business and since i am single with no kids and i have 4 cats i needed someone to house sit for me 
 so i hired wtf to feed my cats for the 3 days i would be gone 
 the day i returned i caught an earlier flight and arrived home around 2pm whereas i was supposed to arrive at 10pm 
 i enter my home and my garage is filled with cigarette smoke my counter had prescription drugs sitting on it right next to lines of cocaine and music was blaring out of my entertainment system 
 i walk upstairs to my room and the <unk> is all <unk> 
 i change my clothes and decide to look to see if wtf was even in the house 
 i walk downstairs to the theater room and i see the back of his head as if he was simply watching a movie 
 except he was n't 
 i walk over to chew him out and possibly <unk> him and he is and this is the wtf wtf part dressed in women 's clothes masturbating whilst he has a dildo the size of texas inside of him 
 i walk away 
 i walk back 5 minutes later and rip the dr <unk> <unk> off of his fucking skull and tell him to get the fuck out of my house and take his drugs with him 
 he left 
 i clean my house air out my garage <unk> the fuck out of every god damn room 
 the next day i receive a text from a 
 hey 
 wtf told me that you were mean to him when you got back 
 why 
 i explain in great detail what happened 
 she does n't reply 
 i have n't heard from either of them 
 tl dr paid some man-child to house sit for me arrived at my house to the place <unk> and him <unk> on my leather couches 
 update : the cats were doing coke with anna <unk> 
 first off this happened 15 years ago 
 i was 14 years old at the time and after a long day at school being surrounded by the opposite sex and festering in a pool of my own raging hormones i rushed home to release some <unk> 
 i remember vaguely after walking in the house my mother saying something about having an early dinner 
 i acknowledged her planted my backpack at the edge of the stairs ran up to my room and locked the door 
 now mind you i had a strange door knob 
 instead of your standard push button door knob lock '' mine had to have the whole door knob pushed in and than cocked to the right to be locked 
 it was a poor design i do n't think they even make them anymore and very difficult to lock 
 anyways on with my humiliation 
 i was fortunate enough to have my own computer in my room 
 my parents did n't know the dangers of the internet back then and i was n't inclined to be the one to tell them 
 as far as my parents knew i was playing video games and messing around with aol 
 this being the days of dial up internet porn was n't anything like the way it is today 
 there were n't very many videos and if there were they 'd take forever to load there was mostly pics and even those took some time to load back then 
 so there i am in the dark i had the blinds closed and a blanket covering my window shirt off and pants around my ankles sitting in my computer chair choking my bishop 
 i find a pic that i like click on it and let the loading commence 
 with every <unk> that slowly loads i can feel myself growing closer to finishing 
 when the picture finally fully loads i sit back and gaze with <unk> eyes 
 i can feel myself about to finish when my father whips open the door and says : son dinner 's <unk> '' 
 i literally came at the same time he opened the door as he was saying son dinner 's ready '' my <unk> was shooting into the air and down onto my chest and stomach 
 the worse part was for a brief moment my father and i locked eyes 
 for what seemed like an eternity for which in reality was only half a second the door quickly slammed closed 
 there i sat covered in my own shame 
 i quickly cleaned myself up and reluctantly headed down stairs 
 i was relived to find my father at the head of the table acting as if nothing happened 
 my mother was bringing things out from the kitchen and from what i could tell had no idea what had just transpired up stairs 
 i sat myself at the opposite end of the table and my father looked up at me 
 he had asked my this same question since i was a child almost every time before we ate a family dinner 
 except this time it had a little more sarcasm behind it 
 he said : son did you wash your hands '' 
 tl dr : i was teenager did n't lock the door right and came in front of my <unk> just happened 2 minutes ago 
 i was trying out anal for the first time on my own on the basis that my straight male friend said it was amazing 
 i had a dildo from a joke birthday gift <unk> jelly dong 
 so i 'm putting it in and i push it past the second sphincter which did n't really hurt much and suddenly i lose grip on it 
 i try to push and reach it to get it out but it 's stuck past the sphincter 
 at this point i start to panic mostly because i 'm leaving for an 8 hour flight in roughly 5 hours and message my homosexual internet friend for advice while making posts on two internet forums and <unk> 
 he <unk> me the <unk> potty google it which after a minute of relaxing and then decently hard pushing <unk> the <unk> dildo 
 so yeah tldr lost a dildo past second sphincter gay friend gave shitting advice and i got it <unk> am the pastor of a <unk> church in a small town around <unk> people in the american <unk> 
 in america yesterday was daylight savings time when we move the clock back by one hour 
 our church has one of those <unk> bell systems that <unk> the hour plays music etc 
 our is relatively <unk> though as it only plays twice a day : noon and six p.m. yesterday morning i was in the middle of my <unk> when the bell begins to <unk> an hour early 
 crap 
 forgot to set that clock back 
 oh well finish preaching walk up to the balcony and change the 12 back to 11. good right 
 i go about the rest of my day doing <unk> and having meetings not thinking anything else about it ... <unk> i 'm woken up at midnight by the <unk> of the bells 
 the first ten seconds i 'm trying to figure out if it 's our church or the catholic church across town 
 nope way too loud to be them 
 why are our bells going off now 
 oh no 
 when i changed the 12 to 11 i did n't change it from pm to am 
 they 're off by twelve hours 
 for the second ten seconds i 'm thinking ok fine 
 just twelve <unk> and then it 's done '' 
 until my wife asks does this mean it 's going to play the ten minutes of music it does at noon '' 
 shit '' 
 at this point i 'm up and running 
 throw on pants dive in the car and drive the two block to church 
 run into the building through the <unk> up the stairs to the balcony tripping in my <unk> the entire way and confront the bell system ... <unk> to find it 's apparently in lockdown mode while playing 
 this is one of those cold nights where sound carries forever 
 the church sits on a hill at the very center of town so everyone in our city is hearing this 
 dogs are starting to bark 
 however i stare <unk> at the <unk> for the next 60 seconds or so 
 these systems are very expensive 
 the only way to stop this one playing now is to unplug it <unk> and i have no idea what this is going to do to this system 
 finally as it begins to play stand up stand up for jesus '' merrily to a small waking town i pull the plug 
 i plugged it back in waited for it to boot then fixed the time 
 went back to my car and drove home looking for people glaring out their windows at me 
 the next morning i 'm now waiting for two things : complaints to be made and for noon to arrive to see if i broke the bells 
 edit : sorry walked away from this not realizing anyone would actually care 
 the bells played as normal at noon 
 no one has called to complain yet 
 as to the omg that 's annoying at noon '' complaints 
 the church sits dead center of the town at the main intersection 
 the fire department and police stations are across the street 
 <unk> are constantly clanking through the intersection 
 the grade school is down the street 
 we 're even on a river so there 's a fair amount of noise from boat traffic 
 those bells are by far not the loudest thing going in town during the day 
 besides i 'm a relatively young pastor in my 30 's 
 these things were installed around the year i was born 
 it 's not like i ring the damn things myself 
 edit # 2 : thanks for the gold 
 i only have a vague idea of what it is but it 's appreciated anyway on new year 's eve <unk> my girlfriend of six months and i were about to leave her parents house to go to boston 
 her parents were about to go cape cod 
 it 's important to note that her dad did n't like me yet for no reason other than i was banging his daughter 
 i take a quick poop upstairs before we all leave 
 clogged it 
 i re-flushed in hopes it would work the second time 
 the water <unk> all over the wooden floor 
 i frantically start cleaning it up with a couple towels when i hear my girlfriend scream from the kitchen directly under me mom 
 water is coming through the light <unk> '' 
 they all rush upstairs and gf 's mom asks to be let in to help me 
 i open the door to the scene of a flooded floor and one pathetic nugget <unk> around in the top of the bowl 
 the worst part was her sweetheart mother who is a nurse insisted on cleaning it up 
 her dad escaped to the car without saying a word to anyone 
 we 're still together 
 her dad likes me now 
 edit : i know i should have turned the water valve off but i panicked 
 if i was on home <unk> i would have <unk> this crisis 
 only my luck would let this happen a day before mother 's day 
 i was in <unk> 's shopping for a mother 's day gift for my mom and while i was in a text conversation with her regarding stuff she 'd always wanted '' yeah there are no surprise gifts in my family my girlfriend molly started sexting me 
 it was really weird being in a serious conversation with my mom and at the same time responding to my very <unk> timed horny girlfriend 
 i responded to molly a few times as i tried to gather myself and focus on choosing a gift for my mom 
 unfortunately both my mom and molly were texting me at the same time 
 i do n't know how i lost focus of which text conversation i pressed on but i was <unk> that i chose molly 's conversation 
 i was wrong 
 i sent that fateful text as i checked out at the register and was paying for my purchase 
 immediately after i sent it i saw that i had one <unk> message from molly at <unk> it was <unk> pm 
 i yelled out a huge oh shit '' 
 right in the store 
 the entire area by the checkout <unk> became dead silent for about four seconds 
 everyone just stared at me for those four fucking long seconds 
 i immediately jolted out the store 
 my mom is a really religious christian and she does n't even know i have a girlfriend it 's <unk> frowned upon in my family unless it 's for marriage so it 's not like she could even have guessed who that text was meant for 
 it 's been one hour 
 i have n't heard back from my mom yet 
 i am scared to go home 
 fml 
 ** update <unk> pm : ** after wandering <unk> for four hours holding that <unk> <unk> set of <unk> my arms are freakin killing me 
 my dad sends me a text come home please 
 your mother and i need to discuss college options with you '' 
 <unk> options my ass 
 that topic 's never been brought up yet *ever* 
 my bones are shaking from just the thought of the awkwardness that is about to ensue ... ... <unk> ... ** update <unk> pm sunday : ** okay so i finally gathered the courage to go home after like 6 hours of freaking out 
 i got home at around 11 or so last night and sitting right in the living room were both my parents and the <unk> from my church 
 they started preaching to me and quoting <unk> from the <unk> 
 omg 
 my head was spinning 
 it was pure torture 
 fucking nightmare 
 they even said that they reached a <unk> decision that i should see a psychologist 
 and that there is always hope for cases like mine '' ... .. what the motherfucking fuck 
 i could n't gather the strength to <unk> <unk> let alone execute any of the <unk> described below 
 long story short i got grounded and my cellphone was <unk> until further notice '' 
 i was n't even allowed to go to church with them today *finally* because until i get my head straight i should not be in a holy place of <unk> '' ... currently my phone is taken away 
 i have no idea where it is 
 maybe i 'll go look for it 
 my parents are at church anyways right now ... they wo n't be home for another 2 hours at least 
 ** update <unk> pm : ** i went looking for my phone in my dad 's closet while my parents are at church 
 i found my phone in this box he apparently keeps random stuff in 
 you will never believe what else i found in there 
 okay so that may not be so crazy to the rest of you but to *my* family that is a huge <unk> 
 my parents are so unbelievably against birth control of any form and consider others who use it to be <unk> 
 omg omg omg 
 the tables have turned like crazy right now ... .. i 'm wondering if i should use this leverage now or wait until a different situation occurs because this one is pretty much over 
 this is insane leverage i have on my parents 
 did n't actually happen today but rather a few weeks ago 
 i had been growing ghost peppers in my garden all summer to use in salsa and stuff like that and when fall came around i had a lot left over 
 one night when i had some friends over they saw the peppers and begged me to give them some so they could see how spicy they were 
 i initially refused but a few days later decided to bring a few in to lunch because i thought it would be funny 
 so first i give a pepper to friend # 1 telling him to start slow with a little piece and he proceeds to eat almost the entire pepper 
 within a few minutes he 's running around the lunchroom with a completely red face saying he feels it in his ears 
 funniest shit ever 
 then a different friend who is indian and eats spicy food all the time asks for one and i 'm like hell yeah that was funny 
 so he eats the entire thing and basically has the same reaction 
 at this point the teachers are noticing two kids running around and acting like crazy people so i get the hell out of there and go to my next class 
 i later found out that after i left a different classmate who 's a huge idiot took the peppers and tried to lace other people 's drinks by rubbing the seeds in there 
 karma got the best of him as he accidentally got the residue in his eyes and spent the rest of the day in the nurses office and ended up with detention while nobody else got in trouble 
 so now i 'm know around campus as the stupid guy who brought in ghost peppers 
 edit : a lot of people are arguing that this was a win for me 
 in some ways it was but it also created some <unk> for me my school is pretty strict and it took some <unk> to not get in trouble 
 some <unk> do n't respect me as much and i had to deal with the <unk> of my parents who were furious not fun 
 i was n't quite sure where to post this but this subreddit seemed like a decent place to share the <unk> i work in a kitchen 
 people move fast and very often have sharp or searing hot things in their hands 
 as a safety measure we say behind you '' 
 as we pass by to cut down on accidents 
 i was walking home from work at around 4 am 
 i see a woman walking the same direction as i am i appear to be moving a fair amount faster 
 i 've been told i make little to no noise as i walk so i suppose she did n't hear me but as i went to pass her i nonchalantly said behind you '' on reflex 
 she must have jumped a foot in the air screamed at the top of her lungs and sprinted off 
 i hope she 's not scarred for life o.ofirst off i am happily married with a kid and i 'm completely naive 
 i have back problems 
 once and a while it gets really bad and sometimes the only way to relieve my pain is by using a jacuzzi 
 i do n't own one 
 it was really killing me today 
 so i looked around for a spa with a jacuzzi 
 i find one 
 it 's in the middle of the korean section of town 
 i think great 
 it 's like the public bath houses in korea '' 
 go in pay the money 
 everything seems cool 
 take off my clothes put a towel around my waist wash and get in the jacuzzi 
 a few people say hi '' 
 i notice some of the guys are middle eastern but most are asian 
 it is clear that the asian people are the regulars 
 i 'm feeling relaxed and back is feeling much better 
 i decide to have a look around 
 there 's a sauna room 
 it 's completely dark but i think hey 
 i hate bright lights when i 'm trying to relax '' 
 i look around some more and find a lounge room 
 two guys are sitting in there 
 i sit a little ways away 
 i 'm watching the tv but notice one puts his arm around the other guy 
 i do n't think much of it 
 i tell my self eh they 're probably a couple '' 
 i leave because i do n't like <unk> 
 so i go into the sauna because i love the heat 
 big mistake 
 it was dark for a reason 
 some dude is giving another dude a blowjob while another guy was watching 
 i 'm not a <unk> 
 if this was a <unk> sex club i would have noped the fuck out of there just as fast 
 i skip the shower you should have before you leave a spa 
 and i walk to go change into my clothes 
 as i change my clothes an asian guy is changing next to me 
 he says kind of a disappointment today 
 see all the dark young guys but they do n't want anything '' 
 i nervously laugh and say yeah 
 right '' 
 wtf 
 i 'm worried this guy is going to think i 'm not into dudes 
 like if he figures out i 'm not <unk> he 's going to screech like in invasion of the body <unk> 
 i take my key to the front desk do n't say bye to the attendant and speed all the way home to take a shower 
 ~~i 'm all freaked out now 
 my family would probably disown me if there was even a rumor that i went into a gay bath house while being married 
 my face is on all the cameras outside the building 
 i do n't think i 'll ever tell my wife 
 <unk> i 'm worried one day that a picture will show up somewhere of me going into a gay bath house 
 tl dr : google led me to a gay bath house 
 update : will probably tell my wife 
 thank you internet for making me less stressed 
 you are my <unk> club spa 
 update 2 : talked with the wife over breakfast 
 she went from confused to wtf why did you say 'yeah 
 <unk> '' 
 to ok '' 
 thought she was a little pissed 
 waited in <unk> silence for a about 30 sec 
 then she asked did anyone have a better looking butt than me '' 
 i knew we were all right 
 clarification : my wife was not angry 
 her wtf was more bewilderment at the fact that i said yeah 
 right '' 
 and that the fact that sex clubs exist 
 she 's from the middle east 
 further clarification : nobody has a natural booty as good as my wife does 
 <unk> couple months ago there was this askreddit post about products you use that are intended for the opposite gender 
 i read something about these <unk> <unk> strips and how satisfying it is to see what they remove from your skin 
 having never have heard of these strips i continued reading <unk> 
 it was mentioned that these strips are very expensive but that you can put glue on your nose let it dry and peel it off for the same effect 
 not really sure why but i gave it a go 
 once it dried i peeled it off and examined the glue 
 it appeared as though nothing came out of my <unk> 
 i was n't really disappointed i just did n't care 
 the next morning i woke up with a <unk> on my nose where the glue had been 
 i looked like <unk> 
 it was the kind of <unk> that causes a <unk> distracting pain 
 with each <unk> i cursed at that damn <unk> under my breath 
 the next day i woke up and noticed it was even bigger redder and more painful 
 fed up i tried to pop it but to no avail 
 the following day the redness had spread up my face into my eyes 
 one was completely swollen shut 
 so i went to the doctor and they gave me some antibiotics 
 after a couple days of the medication i was not getting any better so i went to urgent care 
 i was diagnosed with mrsa in the face and admitted for a week stay at the hospital for constant iv antibiotics and 4 <unk> in my nose 
 i was told that if i had come a day later it would have likely spread to my brain and i would have either died or suffered brain damage 
 i now have a scar on my nose 
 fuck you redditor 
 tldr followed redditor 's advice got mrsa in the face almost <unk> back read and enjoy my misfortune 
 today was my <unk> birthday my friends invited me over to hang out 
 i get all dressed up to head over to my friends place 
 as i get there i need to pee 
 i had n't been feeling well for the last couple of days so as i am peeing i need to fart ... so i do ... but its not 
 liquid poop my jeans immediately are soaked and i reach back to check and raise my wet poopy hand to my face to smell ... yes it is in fact poop ... like a small part of me had hoped it would be water off a bush or something else 
 i panic 25 years old and up until today could say i have never actually shit myself '' 
 well not anymore 
 i do what anyone would do and drive home in shame well little did i know that all my friends were inside ready to surprise me as i came inside the door at their house 
 i literally drove away from my surprise party 
 for some reason i had a <unk> in my car so i wrapped myself in that my jeans were drenched and climbed into my car 
 as i am driving home next thing i see red and blue lights ... are you fucking kidding me ... '' i pull over 
 cop approaches window leans in and immediately <unk> back 
 what the fuck is that smell '' 
 now i 'll be honest ... as a 25 year old man i started crying 
 me i 'm ... sob ... i 'm ... sob ... so sorry but ... officer i uh ... sob shit myself '' 
 cop you <unk> '' 
 me i pooped myself man ... '' cop you are serious '' 
 me yes sir '' 
 cop how old are you sir '' 
 me i 'm 25 ... its my birthday and i pooped myself '' 
 cop um ... hold on a minute here i 'll try get you on your way '' 
 cop <unk> for a few minutes i assume getting the last laugh out as he tells his buddies then comes back cop alright sir you have a good night '' 
 me uh ... sob i 'll try sir '' 
 cop well shit son not like it can get any worse ... sometimes shit happens '' 
 tldr - went to pee before a surprise party tried to fart and shit my pants 
 drove home and got pulled over by a cop made fun of my shitty situation 
 <unk> would not recommend edit - holy fuck did not expect this to blow up 
 few things 
 1. went to friends house where surprise party was 2. went to pee in bushes near house before going inside 3. went to fart shit myself 4. left house where they were waiting and drove home 
 5. got pulled over made fun of by cop 6. got home found out next day i missed my party 
 sad 
 and to whoever gave me gold what the fuck 
 donate to some charity or something next time not some dude with too much trust in his butthole 
 also 7. i had <unk> '' in the car as well forgot to mention 
 contributed to my oh fuck i 'm going to jail covered in shit '' 
 crying 
 8. i apologize for the layout and writing of the story i am bad and should feel <unk> actually happened two weeks ago and before you start thinking i made this up let me just say that i did n't just go up to the ceo and say this out of nowhere 
 it was completely accidental and just the worst luck imaginable ... ... ... i 've worked at this place for a little over 2 years 
 i do n't want to mention the name of the company but it is a major probably the largest <unk> store company in the country 
 they have stores everywhere 
 i was a cashier and on this particular day i was working the afternoon shift 
 it was around 5:30 in the afternoon and pretty slow in the store 
 so i was in the middle of <unk> the shelves for anybody that 's never worked a retail job that 's what you do when you 're the cashier and there are no customers to ring up 
 i was stocking the shelves in the alcohol aisle when i saw a customer walk into the aisle and start browsing our alcohol selection 
 it 's worth noting that i noticed this customer was wearing a nice suit and tie and seemed to be some sort of businessman but did n't think anything of it at the time 
 as i was trained to do i walked up to him and politely said anything i can help you with today sir '' 
 and he responded nope '' which i think was a little rude but i did n't care so i told him just to let me know if he needed me for anything and just went back to stocking shelves 
 now here 's where it starts to get a little messed up 
 i noticed he was heading towards the register so i of course started walking to the register to ring him up 
 he saw me walking towards the register and when i was seriously no more than a few feet from the register he said come on let 's go 
 is this how you are trained to treat you 're customers 
 just keep them waiting all day '' 
 now this struck a cord with me because of how close i was to the register and because of how fucking rude of a thing it was to say 
 but since the customer is always right '' i just said i was really sorry and did n't meant to waste any of his time and began quickly ringing up his items 
 but once i got to his liquor and <unk> it he said so you are n't going to ask for my i.d 
 are all the employees here this lazy or are you the only one 
 get you manager out here '' 
 now i was mad and offended 
 i had no idea who this fucking guy thought he was and why he was acting like he is somehow better than me 
 in all honesty after he said that i was livid inside and remembered back to my manager telling me that if we think it is necessary we can refuse business to a customer if they are <unk> us or being threatening ... <unk> so this is where i fucked up by saying you know what man 
 we do n't want your business 
 you can fuck off and get the fuck out of here right now '' 
 i realized a lot of things right after i said this 
 i realized that i was yelling that i over reacted that i was probably going to get fired that my manager was watching me from the back of the store and that the customers shirt under his suit jacket had the company name stitched into it 
 the customer then <unk> himself as the ceo who was in town attending a conference i live in a big city and that i was <unk> 
 my manager agreed of course she had to agree no matter what and so i had to grab my stuff from the back and leave 
 my manager later got in touch with me and apologized for having to agree or she would lose her job and also apologized for the ceo being such a huge dick 
 thought i would share just how badly i fucked up 
 now i 've got to get back to looking for another job <unk> happened saturday morning 
 i was trying to block it out of my mind but to no avail here i am 
 some background : i 'm 23 a female and i recently got into strength training 
 i do n't want to be <unk> bulky but i want to be fit 
 saturday morning my brother texted me 
 he had come over to eat breakfast i still live with my parents and he visits on the weekend 
 so i dragged myself out of bed 
 we decide we want waffles 
 my mom makes them 
 nothing unusual has happened at all 
 as my mom is cleaning up we are all in the kitchen just chatting 
 i walk up to my brother 
 i 'm impressed with how my <unk> are coming along so i say hey dude 
 feel my muscle '' 
 being the older brother he is he gives me a good punch 
 he then tells me to feel his so i punch him back 
 then he tells me to punch his abs 
 then comes the most terrible moment ever 
 my brother says to my mom hey mom do you have muscles '' 
 some background on my mom : she 's 57 years old stands a mere <unk> '' tall 
 she 's been working out with me 
 she is one of those moms that acts like shes 25 but that 's ok because she pulls it off 
 she 's full of energy and spunk 
 so after my brother seals our fate with his damn question we both look at my mom 
 i 'm expecting a <unk> yeah yeah check out the gun show '' 
 <unk> oh how i wish it had played out like that 
 dear lord 
 nothing and i mean nothing could have prepared us for what happened next 
 my dear sweet 57 year old mother turns around 
 she begins to say heck yes i have a sick pack '' all the while pulling up her shirt to show off said six pack 
 reddit this is where it went downhill so fast 
 as my mom pulls up her shirt to show off her abs she forgets that gravity is a bitch and she is n't wearing proper undergarments -- well any undergarments to be correct 
 so there we stand my brother and i getting flashed by my 57 year old mother 
 being a female idgaf 
 i instantly bust out laughing 
 i turn around to face my brother 
 bless his dear soul 
 his eyes are filled with such regret for asking the question that got us in this position 
 as i am crying from laughing so hard my mom is apologizing up and down while laughing her ass off as well 
 my poor brother had no choice but to join in -- what was seen could n't be unseen 
 after we laughed for a solid 5 minutes because it was so damn awkward my brother <unk> the fuck out 
 i simply texted him saying tifu by asking my brother to feel my <unk> '' and it was spoken of no more 
 <unk> edit : thank you for gold extremely generous redditor 
 you made my day 
 : - also thanks for all the upvotes everyone 
 getting on the front page is crossed off the bucket list 
 getting gilded with gold is too 
 you all <unk> 
 this was about ten years ago first proper job out of college working for a 60 person company that fixed and resold servers 
 i had just got my own <unk> alongside the guy who trained me in 
 he was a nice and super strait laced old dude the <unk> thing he did was eat a chocolate bar around 3pm every day 
 knocking off time for him was 4:30 and i 'd finish around 5. one day around <unk> i look over and he 's <unk> off at his desk 
 personally i have no issue with a quick nap at work so i keep an eye out for the boss and let him at it 
 by 4:30 he 's fast asleep but it 's his home time so i go to wake him up and he 's mad groggy looking at me almost like he 's drunk saying what 's the problem 
 i decide to let him sleep it off for another little while 
 about twenty minutes later when i 'm not looking the boss comes over and tries to wake him up 
 then he goes and gets the first aid guy 
 they half walk half carry him to the <unk> and get him to eat his chocolate bar apparently he was busy and missed his 3pm sugar fix for his <unk> while they call his wife to come pick him up 
 so yeah that was the day i covered for someone as they started to fall into a diabetic coma at their desk 
 edit : added a link for anyone complaining about the fuck up being ten years ago read rule 1 .i am an old hand at masturbation 
 like a <unk> and salty sea dog that has seen too many years on the bow of a battered tug boat i think i’ve seen it all through a haze of white pipe smoke 
 <unk> <unk> 
 only a few haggard <unk> from lands still inhabited by dragons remain 
 i’m no longer the <unk> of my teens or even my twenties 
 i have learnt and grown along this epic voyage into the masturbator i am today 
 and just like any long voyage games pass the time 
 except instead of “i spy” i have become exceedingly good at the game of things not to put your penis into 
 actually there are surprisingly few rules for this game 
 they say to someone with a hammer everything is a nail and i’ve nailed most things even the things that are nailed down 
 a <unk> 
 sure put some <unk> <unk> around the <unk> and wear a condom and let it <unk> under the head 
 various fruits bottles back <unk> 
 <unk> child’s play 
 these weren’t the new-fangled internet days of a million voices coming together as one to solve the problem of <unk> up masturbation they were the cold dark <unk> learn by trial and error of the before times 
 like <unk> we tested our creations on ourselves alone and hobbled by our experiments like <unk> children we were forced to rail against the wild and become <unk> 
 what i’m trying to say is i have this shit on lock down 
 i’m at the stage of life when i should be collecting my notes in a <unk> leather bound <unk> to pass onto my children and my <unk> children please no to guide them forward should the combined <unk> intelligence of the internet be lacking what with your electric toothbrushes vibrating phones and <unk> <unk> ass cheeks these days <unk> all our <unk> intelligence down 
 what will you bunch of pillow fuckers do if you’re stranded on a desert island i’ll cry shaking my fists at the sky - what will you do then 
 no bear grylls <unk> fuck <unk> for you <unk> y <unk> no <unk> rubber band and a piece of string lady parts for you 
 anyway 
 as they say pride <unk> before the fall 
 as most of these stories start i was alone 
 i was painting our new house before we moved in and sold our old one 
 i was on a deadline 
 i’d spend hours after work doing the <unk> job of piling more and more paint on top of other slightly less strongly coloured paint 
 i was stressed and so hadn’t really gotten around to relieving things for a while 
 days probably 
 anyways i quickly realised the <unk> freedom i was painting away with 
 after having new babies not only is sex a fairly distant memory for a lot of people but even jerking off is only snuck in in fits and starts 
 <unk> asleep 
 jerk off 
 if i’ve actually had enough sleep and am horny in the morning shower 
 jerk off 
 but not the <unk> no headphones <unk> or <unk> headphones with no fear of <unk> approaching sounds jizzing not the <unk> for hours just because you’re bored and you <unk> not the jesus masturbating christ i hope i don’t have a heart attack while wearing my wife’s clothes with a hairbrush handle up my ass while looking at a photoshopped picture of her <unk> head on sasha <unk> body on the laptop kind of jerking off 
 <unk> the good stuff 
 suddenly all of the work objects in my house go through the things not to put my penis in game 
 the drill 
 can i put a paint roller over a thick bit and get it spinning <unk> against the head of my cock 
 <unk> keep that one for later.. i don’t have a condom or anything to put over it and make it <unk> the gatorade bottle 
 <unk> i’d have to fill it with plastic <unk> and oil to get sensation <unk> everything around me is the kind of thing that takes off thumbs in shop <unk> and i have no lube and no plastic <unk> why lord why have you <unk> me so 
 <unk> 
 ok fine let’s try this 
 i have rubber washing up gloves and i have soap 
 i’ve used gloves before.. those clear plastic <unk> ones.. soap has been bff’s with my cock since before i <unk> it’s so simple this just might work 
 i don’t really have anywhere to jam it into though.. it’s a completely empty house 
 normally the easiest thing to make is to <unk> and wipe the lube off the outside of a condom and put a lot of lube inside it then place it in a towel with the base edge poking out and roll up the towel around the length of it and stretch the base ring of rubber around the outside end of the rolled up towel <unk> a tight sleeve 
 you then <unk> this sleeve in between <unk> couch <unk> whatever and pretend it’s the <unk> olympics and that girl you never fucked in highschool is your reluctant fellow country representative 
 it’s my lightbulb my <unk> sleeve of trial and error to get things just right my <unk> great work 
 you probably found it on the internet when you were 13 and paid no mind to the fallen <unk> that brought it to you 
 here though i only have washing up gloves and soap 
 i don’t really know why i thought this would be so innocuous 
 maybe it’s because it’s been well over a decade since i’ve made any kind of real mistake - i’ve been shooting nothing but net for so long i feel <unk> 
 i’m <unk> and i don’t have plot armour 
 i put a little water inside the glove and stick a bar of soap in and really give it a rub about inside the glove to <unk> things up and i’m ready to go 
 i get things going the normal way 
 <unk> my glove vagina like some reserve whore unit in a horrible war against the forces of <unk> 
 once i am nice and erect i slip it in 
 yes yes my precious 
 i am <unk> 
 my penis has a new happy place 
 strike this down as another win in the win <unk> of life 
 now do not think i am unaware of <unk> drying effect 
 i’m not 13 and struggling to remain lubed outside of the bathroom like it’s the first time i’ve tried it 
 i don’t expect it to be a magical <unk> that <unk> all lack of lubrication it’s just as long as there is plenty of water in the glove there should remain some <unk> and frankly i must again state the house is empty 
 there are no oils butters <unk> hair conditioners 
 there isn’t even anything i can boil to extract <unk> from 
 there is only soap 
 <unk> only.. my wife calls 
 shit 
 fine 
 stop 
 phone talk 
 yeah yeah working real hard here <unk> better get back to it jolly good <unk> ho tea and <unk> 
 ok now i kinda have to get started again.. only.. there is a sensation starting out this time that i was a little blind to before… it’s not <unk> there is plenty of water in there and it’s still <unk> but there is a little <unk> i’ve obviously gone on too long and this set back has prolonged this whole endeavour even <unk> i’d better get back to it quick smart and finish this thing off 
 now i’m not sure if you’re aware but being near orgasm is one of the <unk> natural pain relievers there is 
 it’s why using a headache as an excuse to get out of sex is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> way out 
 so i’m definitely <unk> there is <unk> in the universe but it’s also pleasant 
 i guess this is why people mix pleasure and pain and whips and <unk> are sometimes used in the <unk> it’s like a bad itch that i’m scratching.. and like every time your penis goes into a vagina it’s not supposed to i’m just not thinking straight 
 i’m completely focussed on the end goal 
 i’m riding my <unk> down a fluffy rainbow 
 its happening 
 it can’t come soon enough as at least one part of my <unk> brain knows that this whole <unk> needs to stop <unk> 
 it’s not as if it would be the first time i’ve given myself a friction blister on the side of my <unk> or something 
 salty sea dog master masturbator and all that 
 <unk> like all sexual mistakes they appear <unk> and with almost immediate regret 
 the constant of regret is <unk> the speed at which ejaculate travels and much like the speed of light invites immediate <unk> about the possibility of time travel backwards to undo mistakes of the immediately recent past 
 so as the <unk> leak out of various membranes it’s <unk> apparent i’ve done damage 
 i’ve managed to mask the true <unk> of the situation 
 it hurts 
 fuck 
 no really this is bad 
 i 'm every fallen soldier in a movie with that look in his eyes after he 's been <unk> or had all the skin of his lower body melted off 
 that pleading look into his buddy 's eyes that everything is going to be ok because he ca n't see the wound 
 i 'm my baby girl who thinks she 's invisible when she puts her hands over her eyes and i ask where she 's gone 
 it 's <unk> 's cock it could still be ok right right 
 i waddle into the bathroom where the light is on and risk a <unk> glance down to let the <unk> collapse 
 blood 
 why is there blood 
 on 
 the 
 head 
 my <unk> bit 
 it’s bright red and fresh 
 it looks like every gravel rash i had as a kid when i came off my bike only on the head of my penis - it’s some horrible <unk> death ritual for when the blood eagle is considered soft on crime 
 what horrible <unk> is this 
 how could my body work against me like this 
 isn’t there an emergency <unk> 
 some kind of do not want alarm 
 no <unk> <unk> to save the baby making parts 
 then i realise if you’re about to come it doesn’t matter whether your cock is mangled and bloody - you finish jizzing now and pass your genes on then you can bleed out from your cock like a golf course <unk> system because your job is done 
 the praying <unk> she-bitch can bite your head off you can die <unk> on the ground 
 there is no great <unk> left in you 
 you have <unk> your one true purpose and it wasn’t writing that book you always thought you had in you 
 things to do with a bleeding glans * fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck * think of all the good times <unk> had and salute a fallen soldier * fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck * wash some blood off and survey damage 
 i pinch the base of the head to <unk> or distract nerve signals 
 i rinse it in the sink and <unk> 
 oh the humanity 
 oh mistakes i have made 
 why does it hates us 
 washing up gloves are n't like surgical gloves at all 
 they have fine texture on the inside like <unk> <unk> and the soap made the rubber gloves the opposite of slippery 
 the rubber texture became very very <unk> with the soap <unk> any natural oils off my cock leaving it super <unk> and proceeded to <unk> many many layers of <unk> skin off while i <unk> off like a <unk> like some penis shaving savant creating his bloody masterpiece 
 i have nothing 
 no first aid kit nothing 
 it’s an empty house 
 i do however have a foreskin 
 oh thank you baby <unk> soft soothing <unk> how glad i am right now to have a turtle neck 
 sweet holy steve job 's taint how i love you right now 
 but like pulling a <unk> over a bullet wound the <unk> they do nothing 
 it hurts like fuck just trying to pull it back <unk> and yes even though it’s undoubtedly better than rubbing against fabric there are sharp sharp <unk> bolts of pain from the raw exposed nerves whenever there is a bump that magically travels through the foreskin which each movement seems to cause 
 it’s like putting a pillow over <unk> head to <unk> a <unk> - it’s mostly so you don’t have to witness what <unk> done 
 the only thing i have at hand is painkillers 
 good stuff too 
 <unk> of codeine and <unk> of <unk> 
 they’re like tylenol <unk> 
 i used to get <unk> as a kid so i don’t fuck around when it comes to pain 
 i don’t tough it out and man up.. i just take pills the stronger the better and get on with life 
 anyways 
 i have a vague plan 
 take several pills and maybe by the time i take a shower they’ll have kicked in and i can survey the damage again 
 at this point my painting is at an end 
 i’m calling it a night 
 fuck this 
 i’m not <unk> my bloody stump around the <unk> <unk> of the house 
 i’m going home and hoping by the time i have a shower i’d move into the next phase of putting a lot of life and distance over this mishap 
 the knowledge that in a few weeks things that seem bad now will be better has gotten me through a lot in life 
 there is a road to recovery a path i can take that will lead me through this 
 i do n't have to run back and forth squealing incredulously 
 it mostly involves not playing any kind of penis games for a while but we <unk> right 
 **the <unk> so i’m on my way home ruing my existence 
 my penis is crying red tears of blood 
 i’m having my moon time 
 my <unk> 
 and like a bolt out of the dark it hits me 
 my baby is teething 
 teeth ripping through gums hurts 
 when it hurts we put on bonjela baby teething gel 
 it’s like an <unk> <unk> local anaesthetic 
 in the <unk> they probably just rubbed cocaine on their gums but frankly that’s just too expensive for us and likely to keep her up and crying for longer so bonjela it is 
 i <unk> on this miracle cure to my <unk> 
 i have a local <unk> meant for mucus membranes 
 <unk> 
 having a baby was totally worth it just for this moment 
 all the actions of my life have lead to this final <unk> crescendo 
 i high five the universe and drive on 
 fuck i’m rad 
 all i have to do is ensure i have access to this stuff without the wife being suspicious 
 i <unk> a plan 
 i map out our house 
 i’ve played enough <unk> i know how to get in and out without being seen 
 i’ll grab some sudocream too we put that on the <unk> ass to prevent <unk> rash 
 i have penile glove <unk> perfect 
 i’m starting to pile up the wins like so many <unk> eggs 
 i get home and sneak the items i need into the bathroom 
 i’m still getting <unk> of pain from the nerves and although the painkillers have kicked in to say i’m approaching peeling back my foreskin under running water with some <unk> is a massive understatement 
 i pinch below the base of the head again to help with the nerves providing another sensation or however it works 
 i pull back 
 yep still bad 
 i 'm not sleeping this one off fuck i 'm lucky if i’m going to be sleeping at all 
 i just have to make it through the next few <unk> i just have to make it so i can sleep <unk> with the water running i squeeze a liberal blob of bonjela out 
 sweet mercy here you come 
 holy <unk> batman the blood is on fire 
 my penis is burning with the intensity of a thousand suns filled with meth crazed fire ants 
 who could have <unk> this 
 why is an anaesthetic not anaesthetizing 
 am i in opposite land 
 soap isn’t slippery <unk> <unk> rounds all your nerve <unk> up and takes a molotov filled cheese grater to the ends 
 what 
 the 
 fuck 
 abort mission 
 i no longer fear the running <unk> the pain level of merely gravel <unk> bleeding penis head is a welcome relief as the bonjela washes off 
 <unk> sweet sweet relief of merely flayed glans under running water where have you been for the last 60 seconds 
 why the fuck did n't that work 
 why did it do the opposite of numbing like it was fucking <unk> <unk> 's flayed man <unk> of <unk> time cock healing 
 not at all put off by <unk> <unk> i grab a <unk> of sudocream and cake it on.. finally something that isn’t making my situation actively worse 
 it seems to at least be neutral in this war 
 it may <unk> my gold <unk> but <unk> it’s not michael j fox holding a burning cheese grater against my cock 
 i think that holds up as a good guy in any court of law 
 i am <unk> and covered in a thick <unk> of sudocream 
 the bleeding seems to have stopped or has dialed down to just <unk> <unk> 
 i should be able to sleep tonight and begin my long road to recovery 
 i finish my shower and calculate the odds my wife will want sexy times any time soon 
 i smile in <unk> for the first time in an hour for i am in opposite land the fact we have a new baby and i’m not going to get laid before my cock heals is a silver lining this scary shitty <unk> place and i’ll take it and hold it close like a <unk> safety blanket 
 **tl : dr i used a soap filled rubber washing up glove as a fuck sleeve and flayed the glans of my penis like i was fucking a rusty cheese grater until it bled from the head 
 i proceeded to then make it worse by applying anaesthetic gel for teething babies on it and it turned the blood into <unk> of burning fire 
 i am forever changed and the gods have <unk> <unk> on me for my <unk> and <unk> this is a weekend repost after it was <unk> for <unk> people 's weekdays with black dread when only work should have performed that function 
 **update** holy fuck front page and gold 
 my thank you 's are not obligatory they are for realsies 
 i am at once saddened that the most popular thing i 'll ever do is about a dumb thing i did to my cock on a throwaway account but also happy i managed to spin something good out of the situation and make a few people with <unk> attention spans giggle and spread a bit of goodness in the universe by touching each and every one of you with my bloody cock 
 you are a funny bunch of fuckers 
 i <unk> laughing at the replies 
 somehow they 're even funnier than normal when they 're directed at you and your misfortune 
 so the salty tug boat captain thanks his two <unk> benefactors and everyone else for putting some spring in my <unk> haggard <unk> 
 because people are asking <unk> the blunt force trauma of having a baby <unk> a <unk> <unk> through her vagina made my wife allergic to peen for some time 
 because of that she discovered nothing and has no <unk> of my plight 
 it took about two weeks and much sudocream to heal 
 i did however tell my brother the very next morning to his great <unk> <unk> as it is a war story that needed sharing 
 no i am not a writer thanks to anyone who asked though as that 's a very kind <unk> 
 i do n't have a blog i do n't have a twitter 
 i barely rise to making myself post sarcastic comments on my friends fb updates 
 i have n't written a story since highschool english 
 i doubt i 'll do much writing in the future as i 've kind of spent my load here and that was only done because i was <unk> 
 i 'm pretty sure nothing else i do will ever live up to a story about <unk> my cock so i 'm not exactly encouraged to try and then fail to clear that <unk> for the rest of my life only to be slapped in the face each and every time with a bloody member 
 additionally i 'm going to be doing my very best not to create the material for another story like this again.. thank you to the couple of kind <unk> who compared it to chuck <unk> that gave me an involuntary brain boner 
 i have lullaby and <unk> but i 'll have to check out guts 
 yeah it could have been edited and snappier but it 's a story about something that happened to my dick not a meditation on the human condition <unk> for the man <unk> prize 
 it was treated with all the time and care a silly true story on the internet about wanking deserved which is to say not much 
 so no i did n't run it past an editor but i did make sure i enjoyed writing it instead of doing real work which means yeah it was a bit stream of consciousness and done to ensure i had no time left at the end to get around to doing the thing i was supposed to be doing 
 that run on sentence was done just for you guys 
 also i 'm assuming about 7 people not old enough to have a credit card and safely get a fleshlight delivered without their parents finding the package have used my condom in a wrapped towel trick 
 i salute you comrades <unk> forth with a mighty <unk> 
 to be honest tonight would have been incredibly uneventful if it were n't for things unfolding the way they did 
 i wish it turned out a little better but i digress 
 i 'm a construction worker as well as a college student i do a lot of heavy lifting and i do n't really have much time for dating 
 i do not live on campus 
 i live in a small apartment and the college is only a 15 minute drive away 
 last week i was in a relatively minor accident and with my luck i hurt my back 
 bad 
 i was on a ladder holding up some very light <unk> 
 next thing i knew the ladder was falling and so was i. out of reflex i turned to catch myself but in turning so fast i actually strained one of the major <unk> in my back and tore some muscle 
 went to the er had some x-rays done etc 
 all they said was i had a minor tear in the muscle and some strain in my <unk> i learned the hard way that we as human beings are not cats and thus our backs do not work in such a fashion of turning in mid-air and catching themselves and that i should not do anything vigorous for <unk> weeks 
 fast forward to tonight 
 my professor is young about 6 years older than me 
 she graduated high school and college at a very young age smart and absolutely adorable and sexy to boot 
 well we are both fairly stupid since we both let sexual tension grow between us 
 i often wondered if other students noticed any sexual tension but we did not flirt with each other on campus or anything like that 
 though i did stay over after class to <unk> or if she needed help with something 
 i even stopped by during the next semester when we did n't even have class together anymore 
 we live fairly close to each other and sometimes we run into each other at the stores and at starbucks and such 
 we both knew that dating between us is very <unk> even though she is technically not my professor anymore so dating did n't come up 
 until today that is 
 i finally asked her for coffee or a day at the public library something that was fairly benign or mundane 
 she suggested going to one another 's house and watching a movie would be fine with her 
 i said that my place was fine i have a big tv netflix and a huge collection of <unk> 
 we make it a date and she shows up to my apartment at 8:00 at night 
 we watch the dark knight and eat pizza and after the movie ends we talk about where we stand ... or should be standing 
 we tried to talk each other out of doing anything too physical and to wait the 6 months until i 'm graduated 
 we started <unk> the <unk> and <unk> of going further than just the occasional <unk> 
 but we ended up fucking despite how we knew we should n't 
 and it was fucking fantastic 
 while it lasted anyway 
 i 'm going at her hard and heavy she 's scratching up my back and that just <unk> my fire to go even harder 
 i 'm all caught up in the heat of everything just slamming into her without a care in the world 
 and then it happens 
 in mid <unk> we both hear this loud pop from my back 
 it sounded like a <unk> nail gun punched the wall 
 i was in so much pain that my ears started to ring 
 i immediately stopped and she just laid there eyes and mouth wide open as i nearly buckle on top of her 
 i 'm just growling in absolute pain wanting to scream and cry like a baby as the burning ache in my back that had been with me all week turned into a stabbing pain that was even worse than kidney <unk> 
 and because i lost my shit she loses her shit too 
 i 'm stuck on top of her and she 's hyperventilating are you okay 
 oh my god are you okay 
 what the hell was that 
 name talk to me do n't freak me out '' 
 i manage to collect myself enough to say through <unk> teeth i hurt my back at work 
 it 's just my back 
 it 's okay 
 it 's okay '' 
 i bet the both of us were thinking oh man people are going to find out 
 we 're absolutely fucked 
 i can just hear the talking heads on the news 
 local construction worker sex <unk> with his professor 
 oh boy '' 
 no it 's not okay '' 
 she lectured me on how i should have just told her before we started and that we could have done a lot of different but still fun things 
 but i did n't think of it i did n't even <unk> the pain 
 the power of boner is strong and overcomes everything 
 i just stay on top of her careful not to press my weight on her even though i wanted to lay flat 
 but at the same time i did n't even want to move just trying to move my lower half hurt 
 minutes passed and she said you have to go to the hospital '' 
 and i argued with her i did n't want to go back to the hospital because it was just going to be the same thing i went through last time 
 get an x-ray be told that it 's nothing major and get sent home with muscle <unk> and pain pills 
 eventually she won the argument and reached for my landline on the nightstand she called 911 and told them that we 're going to need an ambulance 
 as the ambulance made their way i was trying to get off of her i was trying to move so we could at least put some clothes on but my back was so tense and in so much pain that i could not move 
 soon the emts were knocking on the door just come in 
 we 're both stuck '' 
 i finally had a burst of dedication and i tried to roll off of her groaning out pathetically as i moved to no avail 
 the emts let themselves into the apartment and into my room 
 ... 
 dude '' 
 i heard one of them say i turned my head to look at them and realized that one of the emts was my friend who had graduated before i did 
 he was holding back his laughter dude way to fuckin go '' 
 i had no idea if he was genuinely impressed or if he was sarcastic but i did n't care 
 they all helped me off of her and put me on the stretcher 
 they covered me up and took me to the hospital as naked as the day i was born 
 my friend gathered clothes for me and told me that my little secret '' was safe with him and he was n't about to go tell everyone that i fucked my teacher 
 to sum up the hospital visit : i managed to slip a disk in my lower back since shit was so fucked up that i did n't have much support to begin with i just made it worse by having sex 
 i have a feeling things are going to be incredibly awkward 
 or something 
 i do n't know i 'm just nervous to talk to her again because well ... this is pretty fucking embarrassing 
 tl dr : hurt my back at work 
 was told not to do vigorous activity 
 ended up having sex with my professor 
 slipped a disk as a result 
 i have absolutely no idea how our exchanges professional or otherwise are going to be like now 
 update : she went to the hospital with me and helped me put on my pants once i came off of the morphine high 
 she also drove me home and helped me in bed 
 i was going to add something else to the update but i totally forgot because my pain medication is kicking in 
 update 2 : holy shit i was not expecting this to blow up the way it did 
 i was expecting this to be <unk> as bullshit by the reddit masses and it would n't get much attention but damn 
 there has been some <unk> for updates and as of now i do n't have very much to update 
 i wrote this when i got home after the hospital it was very <unk> because there was n't much they can do for me other than give me meds to help the spasms pain and swelling and schedule physical therapy for the next six weeks starting next week 
 i 'm going to try and get up and maybe do some light housework and see what it 's like for the past couple days i 've been doing homework and cooking which was more than enough for me 
 probably going to be doing light housework and very minimal bending all this week at the very least anyway 
 i 'm going to stick to whatever the doctor tells me to avoid the surgery 
 about the professor and i : she 's been calling and asking if i needed help with anything and if i needed any company 
 we 're going to watch some tv series something that she likes that i 've never heard of and cook something 
 i 'm very excited to have her over 
 for those wondering : yes i live in a small town and it 's not very far from the college and the college town '' 
 and yes this is a repost that was what the first update was going to be about 
 lol 
 now i remember 
 i posted this on tuesday i guess i did n't read the rules 
 also i have a landline for when my cellphone is mia and if people need to get in hold of me because of an emergency and i just happen to be at home or they can leave a voice mail when i 'm <unk> reddit and i dont think i will ever forget this 
 quick preface : i am a 20 m in college at a state university 
 i usually dont post so if this post probably sucks but whatever i needed to get this off my chest 
 so this fu actually occurred today ... while at the local <unk> preparing for april 20 there was a really attractive red haired girl with quite possibly one of the most <unk> attractive smiles i have ever seen in my life standing in line waiting to be helped 
 as she was waiting her phone went off and her <unk> was <unk> 
 me wanting to strike up conversation told her that was an awesome ringtone to which she replied that she is a huge star wars fan which is awesome because i am too 
 we make small talk definitely mentioning the new trailer that just was released and whatnot 
 we were hitting it off well and we turned out to have so many things in common : we are both huge fans of <unk> super into gaming specifically old nintendo console gaming and pc gaming and obviously smoking we were at a head shop so that is obvious 
 then the absolute kicker of the whole situation was that she browses reddit 
 everything about this girl is 10/10 and when she walked out the door i thought my friend i was with was gon na kill me for not asking for her number 
 i 've fucked up a lot in my life theres no doubt about that but i think this might be one of those fuck ups that haunt me forever 
 tl dr : saw pretty girl who is also fellow redditor hit it off super well didnt ask for phone number 
 edit : did n't expect this to blow up at all ... for those wondering i 'm from southern <unk> i 'm not gon na go any more specific than that location 
 i 'm pretty sure that if she reads this she would know who i am 
 even the guy working in the store was telling me how i fucked up not getting your number ... also for those taking me so literally on calling her perfect yes i know i only met her for 5 min i did n't mean that 's she 's literally perfect she just seems like a cool person and i 'd like to get to know her better if the opportunity were to <unk> 
 also thanks for the gold strangers 
 edit 2 : so to clear some things up yes i go to lsu 
 no i actually was not at the ra shop surprisingly enough my buddy and i were at a 24 hour smoke shop just off campus those of you familiar with lsu should know what im talking about 
 edit 3 : just logged back on after spending the day celebrating 
 there really is n't anything to update no hits yet 
 celebrated a lot before writing this so ... more updates later edit 4 : so after celebrating for a full 24 hours ... people have sent me pictures of random <unk> apparently who go to lsu so far no matches 
 that being said ... i didnt make this post to find her i made this post because i was at a solid 6 and just felt like putting it somewhere 
 also to the people saying we were gon na <unk> no i just wanted her number to see where things would have gone had i not been a little bitch about it 
 and if she <unk> have a boyfriend who cares she could have been a great friend who <unk> when i awoke to my new puppy barking like a <unk> at the bottom of the staircase and ran down to stop her howling 
 here 's the little one in question : of course she was already in a <unk> rage by the time i got to her and she would n't let <unk> and i had no idea what the barking was about besides that she hates being down there alone and my gf had just left for work 
 as i tried to calm her she went for any sort of bite she could which led to me trying to throw up a flat palm and push her nose away whenever she attacked 
 <unk> idea : ** she got the perfect nip on my right index <unk> to which i <unk> an actual ow '' 
 although the full yelp did n't come out ... nope instead in the middle of my pain the spot she bit me was so perfectly placed that i <unk> a full on <unk> spasm of some sort 
 it was no ordinary spasm though as i suddenly and uncontrollably found my opposite hand and arm deciding that it would jolt upward and punch myself in the teeth and nose 
 with my right index finger bleeding my left thumb <unk> by my own <unk> and my nose now dripping blood and feeling numb from a solid <unk> to the face 
 i lay down in fetal position wondering what had even just happened 
 then she <unk> one last time and <unk> my <unk> which began to bleed and drain warm blood into my ear canal 
 that 's when she ran to the hanging leash and finally decided to tell me it was just that she had to go pee really bad the whole time 
 **tl dr** tried to stop my new pup from <unk> ended up punching myself in the face and bleeding from 4 separate spots finger thumb nose ear 
 **edit : ** glad we can all share in my blood 
 i feel like christ that 's a highly inappropriate joke feel free to down <unk> over it : p for the record though - she 's such a good dog 
 10 weeks and is so so smart and obedient 
 she only <unk> or nips when she wants to potty or needs serious 1 on 1 play time 
 most the time she 's cuddled up under my feet or being a <unk> elsewhere 
 here have a few more pics : *update* : a few <unk> demanded wound pics - as i told them these are just puppy wounds in the end 
 it was a strange experience but certainly not near death 
 pic 1 is of the cut in my <unk> from what i could get pic 2 is the index finger she initially sliced and pic 3 is the gash on my thumb from my tooth 
 the <unk> was from blunt force not a cut so no evidence really 
 all of them sealed up a nice bit over the day after proper care 
 also the responses have been generally <unk> let me just say <unk> no puppy has ever had zero accidents and although i 'd like to react to every situation by the <unk> or how <unk> would suggest life is random and there are other people and factors involved 
 she 's already signed up for training and honestly only needs it to <unk> her <unk> not to become obedient 
 that <unk> i appreciate the feedback both positive and negative this happened less than an hour ago ... let 's preface this by saying that tonight my wife and i have been best friends for 10 years but have only been married for 3 months 
 we recently moved to new zealand where i started a new job 
 needless to say we have n't been getting a lot of <unk> time 
 so my wife and i are in the bath together enjoying some naked time and all of a sudden my stomach starts churning a little 
 i just tried to not think about it even though the <unk> was becoming more insistent 
 all of a sudden i feel it 
 a fart moving so quickly towards my ass that i could n't hold it in and it fired out of me the noise <unk> from the depths of my bowels until it met the surface of the water 
 needless to say it turned our bath into a temporarily steamy jacuzzi 
 my wife stares at me for a silent second and says great now i 'm just sitting in your beef stew '' before getting out of the bath 
 i do n't think she was all that impressed when i clearly thinking straight replied with <unk> we still have firsts 
 tl dr : ruined romantic bath with bubbles <unk> de <unk> fu happened last night but i 'm still <unk> from it right now 
 i work at a youth detention center which if you are n't familiar with can be very <unk> work 
 being a recent college graduate i still live at home with my mom and two younger brothers 
 my younger brothers are very grab happy and tend to help themselves to whatever they want in my room 
 so i get home around 1130 last night exhausted and <unk> 
 i settle for a quick dinner of microwaved <unk> and head straight to bed as i have to be back into work by 6am the next day 
 upon my arrival to my room i realize that my pillow is <unk> absent from my bed 
 after a quick search around my room i realize that one of my brothers must have taken it 
 being as exhausted as i was i was in no mood to travel through the house in search of my pillow 
 i decided to improvise a substitute i have a pillow top mattress so i basically just spoon with the pillow <unk> 
 while <unk> my search i stumble upon a long forgotten cotton comfort underneath my bed still tucked away inside a pillow case and everything 
 perfect '' i think to myself as i tuck it between my legs and drift off into the kind of sleep that only a 15 hour shift can provide 
 i have the most wonderful dream about myself filling with energy floating peacefully through the ambient abyss 
 <unk> vibrations melt over my body as i drift through a sea of <unk> 
 wait ... these vibrations are actually pretty intense 
 cue spiders 
 everywhere 
 on my legs 
 crawling up my back 
 in my hair 
 on my nose 
 on my cock 'n balls 
 my cock 'n balls guys 
 did i mention i 'm <unk> 
 hundreds 
 you <unk> 
 thousands 
 quite possibly 
 millions 
 no reddit not millions 
 i mean honestly ... the sheer logistics alone of fitting a million spiders into one room ... just stop it 
 anyway turns out the abandoned pillow i spooned with had become a nesting ground for one huge slut of a spider and i burst all of the egg sacs with one fell squeeze of my sleepy thighs 
 after what felt like several minutes of my best robert plant impression via the immigrant song '' <unk> i bolted to the shower and scrubbed myself raw 
 i have n't been back into my room since 
 i called an <unk> which is scheduled for monday but <unk> good chance i 'll set fire to my room before he gets here 
 tl dr spiders edit : <unk> edit 2 : a thousand thank yous to the user who popped my gold cherry 
 not a million though a million thank yous is just <unk> impossible 
 much too many for any one person to give to any other person 
 i was on my way to my <unk> house and he had mentioned that i should bring along some of our toys so i chucked my vibrator into a bag along with clothes and stuff ready to spend the night there 
 my dad had offered to give me a lift on his way to work as my car is in the garage i happily agreed and we set off on the half hour car drive to my boyfriend 's house 
 now i should probably mention that my dad is the kind of dad who refuses to accept that i did n't just stop getting older at the age of 7 it took him about a week to get over the fact that i had a boyfriend and even now he refuses to accept that we would dare go past hand holding ... so anyway about five minutes into the car journey i heard a weird kind of buzzing noise it took me a few seconds to realise what it was and i had that ohhh <unk> '' realisation when my bag started vibrating 
 it did n't help that the vibrator was pressed up against a can of <unk> <unk> the sound painfully 
 my dad looked over at me he said what 's that sound is it the car 
 that sort of <unk> ... .. '' his face then dropped as he saw the kill me now look in my eyes and realised it was coming from my bag ... <unk> immediately turned back to the road and we sat in almost silence i could n't exactly pull out my vibrator and turn it off at this point for what was the longest most painfully awkward half hour of my life 
 consider our innocent father daughter relationship official over 
 edit : to answer some questions i am 19 and awkward as shit ... my current boyfriend is the first guy i have <unk> done stuff '' <unk> he brought me the vibrator along with some other things for my birthday and i am not any kind of all knowing vibe <unk> but i know that the constant <unk> of a <unk> sounds very different to a phone but that 's irrelevant i am not a smart girl 
 : this wasn’t today 
 i’m male in my 30s now this happened when i was around 16. i’ve been told by several friends i need to post this partly for entertainment and partly because i might find her 
 i apologize is advance 
 i know it’s long but i wanted to have some fun writing this so i wrote it to her in hopes that she finds this 
 i’m over this now but this was a brutal <unk> then 
 you were a short sexy and nerdy mn target employee around <unk> you are one of the most beautiful women i’ve ever seen and i had the biggest crush on you 
 we were both in high school but at different schools 
 i was a nerd and not <unk> with women then 
 it took me a while to start talking to you 
 even then my attempts to talk you were awkward because i was <unk> first 
 you seemed to understand and just went along with it 
 we got to know each other and flirt but before it could go anywhere you had put in your 2 <unk> notice 
 i finally worked up the courage to ask for your number which you happily gave 
 <unk> with you gone from target i had to work up the courage to call only to find that i never added your number to my list 
 i didn’t have a cell phone then so i kept a list of phone numbers in a notebook 
 i turned the house upside down twice trying to find the little slip of paper with your number on it with no luck 
 since i knew only your first name and the <unk> of your last name which was spelled weird i couldn’t find you by name 
 i was disappointed but not through someone had work probably knew 
 i didn’t have better luck at work 
 no one knew your number and those that could have looked up your last name wouldn’t tell me for privacy <unk> 
 they were right to do that but that didn’t help me 
 i felt like a detective working on his most important case of my life and failing horribly at it 
 before you left target i needed a ride home one day 
 since your mom picked you up we were 16 she drove us to my place while we talked 
 it felt like a date and even though it was a short trip to my place and in front of your mom 
 it was october so we talked about halloween plans 
 we had arranged a sort of date on halloween 
 where you were going to meet me at my place so we could go trick or treating together 
 our quick <unk> home came to a short end at my house 
 we hugged and agreed to meet on halloween if not sooner 
 since you never took down any of my information the only way for you to come to meet me was by memory from going to my house once while we were talking 
 i wasn’t really expecting you to show but i really really hoped you would 
 i did wait outside all night for you in case you did show 
 after you didn’t show i thought that was it 
 i thought you were lost to me forever 
 out of pure luck and <unk> or maybe just the universe being a teasing bitch i ran into you on my way out of perkins in the waiting area 
 i think you were on a date with some dude who wasn’t happy but didn’t do anything to stop us from talking 
 there was a moment when our eyes met that i was overcome by something and it just felt like we connected instantly 
 all the nervousness i normally felt when trying to approach women and even you previously i was a nerd after all was gone 
 you must have felt it too as you had this star struck look in your eyes 
 we shared a moment on your date with another dude 
 i quickly told you how i lost your number and how i waited for you on halloween hoping you would show 
 i asked for your number again but this time asked you to put it in my phone 
 you eagerly entered your number in my phone and i had you write it down on a piece of newspaper i tore off as a backup 
 i wanted to kiss you before i left and i think you wanted me to but i already felt like dick because your date was right there watching this unfold 
 so i left on cloud 9 so happy and convinced i’d have a date with the girl i’d been crushing on for months 
 the next day i woke up late 
 so i was extra groggy and rushing to school 
 my <unk> <unk> pos had this kind of shelf on the dashboard that’s great for holding stuff 
 it also has a great <unk> where if the passenger window is open and i make a fast left turn everything on that shelf goes right out the window 
 i thought i had the window closed enough that it wouldn’t be an issue 
 it was open just enough for my cell phone to go through 
 bear in mind i’ve dropped this phone many times including on concrete and on metal stairs 
 though dented and scratched it kept on going 
 here’s what i think happened to my phone 
 my phone flew out my window and into the side of an invisible alien space craft where it shattered and fell to ground 
 then the ship took off scared by my cell phone attack 
 the shitty flip phone was closed when it flew out my window and there was nothing but tall weeds in the ditch that should have broken the fall 
 how it broke in half and shattered is beyond my understanding 
 i managed to recover the bottom half of the phone in several pieces but couldn’t find the top 
 i tried not to panic about losing your number in the phone because you wrote it down and i had that slip of paper at home 
 when i got home after school i couldn’t find the slip of paper 
 i never added it to my notebook because i had my phone now 
 i turned the house my car and the alien ditch upside down looking but found nothing 
 i was more panicked now but there was a chance they could recover if from the pieces of my phone 
 i brought the pieces of my phone to the verizon store 
 i told <unk> the story thus far 
 after some laughs the guy at the store pulled out an <unk> model of my phone to see if we could follow along with the key presses without the screen and a couple other things he could think of 
 no success and i could see that he really didn’t like giving me that news 
 he sympathized and gave me a new phone when the warranty i had called for a <unk> 
 that was already awesome of him but he had more 
 i knew the school she went to so i could check a yearbook 
 thanks verizon guy you are a gentlemen and a <unk> 
 if i could find her in a yearbook i could get the spelling of her name which i could look up in the phone book to hopefully find her number 
 i still feel creepy about that but you would have done it too 
 i tried checking out a <unk> yearbook from her school but there was a possibility that your photo wasn’t there 
 i also realized i might not recognize you 
 i’d only ever seen you at work and at perkins once but i only recall what you looked like at work 
 at work you always looked a bit stressed tired and never dressed up 
 it didn’t look like you put any effort into your looks but somehow you looked absolutely <unk> beautiful 
 if you were taking yearbook photos you would probably put in the effort to look good and therefore i might not recognize you 
 whether that was the case or your photo wasn’t there i’m not sure but that was my last lead 
 i had nothing else to go on and that’s where the anti-climactic story ends 
 that’s what made this so much more frustrating 
 this whole ordeal felt like it was building up to an awesome climax where the <unk> overcomes <unk> gets the girl and they live <unk> ever after 
 it was the making of every romantic comedy movie but with a shitty albeit real ending 
 this was the first <unk> situation i’d ever been in 
 cheers to you sexy target nerd where ever you are 
 **tl dr** – i finally worked up the nerve to ask out my work crush she gave me her number and i lost it 
 ran into her randomly and got her number again only to have it taken from me by aliens 
 **edit 1** this blew up 
 i have more comments than time right now 
 i 'll respond to comments as soon as i can but it might not be till tomorrow 
 my 7 yr old and 10 yr old were more excited than i expected for <unk> patrick 's day 
 they made leprechaun <unk> '' and went to bed hoping for some leprechaun magic to occur 
 among a few other things i dyed the toilet water and the milk for cereal in the morning green 
 my 10 year old was sitting at the table this morning and says mom - you know what i 'm thinking 
 if the toilet water is green and the milk is green ... .. '' oh well looks like i 'll be finishing off a half gallon of green milk 
 edit : oh man i posted this using an app on my phone and i was told the post was removed for breaking rules 
 i just realized that it had ever actually posted 
 also - the nsfw tag was added automatically and i 'm not sure why 
 anyway - i made little green footprints leading up to the toilet and on the toilet seat - so it looked like a leprechaun had a pee there 
 my son then assumed that the milk was green because the <unk> had pissed in it as well 
 this happened last week 
 i 'm starting a new job soon so i had to do a pre-employment physical which includes a drug test 
 in case you did n't know these drug tests are <unk> 
 i do n't do drugs and never have so i was n't worried about it 
 what i did n't know is that apparently this medical office also tests for glucose in the urine since the test strips are really cheap or something 
 well mine came up positive 
 the nurse said there was only a little bit '' of urine but that it was definitely above the threshold for a positive test 
 urine contains glucose when your blood glucose is <unk> which is most commonly caused by diabetes 
 well lo and behold this poor nurse spent the next half hour trying to figure out what was going on given that i have no diabetic history and my blood sugar level a much more reliable <unk> of diabetes was normal 
 eventually she decided to just pass me for the pre-employment physical and make me see another doctor to treat my possible <unk> 
 this entire time i was completely mortified 
 i think the nurse thought i was <unk> the ramifications of a possible diabetes <unk> but i was actually quite embarrassed because i knew exactly how the sugar got into my pee 
 in case you have n't figured it out yet i do n't have diabetes 
 the night before i had some intimate '' time with a girl 
 we rather enjoyed whipped cream as a <unk> ... and i fell asleep right afterwards without any kind of clean up 
 definitely the last time i do this right before a urine test 
 i thought i was going to die of embarrassment in that damn clinic 
 tl dr - getting a whipped cream blow job and then taking a drug test may trick people into thinking you have diabetes 
 this morning i get up for work jump in the car and start the ignition 
 my engine immediately starts <unk> 
 do you remember the messages in your facebook feed about how cats take a nap in your engine block to hide from the cold or even heat 
 i found out the hard way they 're true 
 a little black cat less than a year old jumped out from under my car 
 she had a loosely dangling rear leg and several skin injuries 
 needless to say the poor thing was scared out of her wits not to mention in terrible pain 
 thankfully an old lady in the street saw me comforting that cat while i was trying to reach several <unk> none of whom were in office at that time 
 she pointed me to where the owners lived 
 so i rang them out of bed and passed on a couple of the phone numbers i dialed 
 i 'll go check in a few days to see if she 's doing fine 
 accidents like this may be <unk> but i still felt guilt and responsibility 
 **tl dr : ** tap your hood 
 cats can get hurt if you do n't 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- **update : ** kitty cat did n't make it 
 : i went by that house again last night to see what was up but there was no good news to be told 
 apparently she had gotten a belly wound too 
 it was n't immediately visible because it had been immediately <unk> shut and she had black fur too 
 damn shame 
 i was driving home while on the phone it 's legal here with death <unk> phone company 
 i had been on hold with them for 30 minutes so the thought was to get home and not have to speak with them in the car 
 i pull up behind another car at a red light and start reading out loud their bumper stickers while the hold music continues 
 i like my husband but i love my horse '' 
 i & lt 3 <unk> '' 
 if you do n't love my horse then you do n't love me '' 
 <unk> 
 i then follow with the next logical statement not on her stickers but in my mind and proudly <unk> i fucked my horse 
 i then register that the hold music stopped at the beginning of that sentence 
 from the line a soft feminine voice uh ... '' uh '' 
 um sir '' 
 uh '' 
 sir '' <unk> how can i help you today '' 
 uh '' 
 i look over at my wife in the passenger seat and see her with hand over mouth face screwed up in a <unk> of shaking pain from not laughing audibly 
 i 'll call you back '' 
 i hang up and my wife starts laughing at me as i search my steering wheel for meaning 
 i still need to call back 
 wife is still calling me horse <unk> happened like 5 minutes ago 
 i male work with cousin female at a family business 
 we have a water cooler in the office that had just run out 
 as i got up to leave the office she shouted remember you need to fill the water butt up 
 i immediately responded with i 'll fill your butt up '' 
 i 'm hiding in the kitchen and i might have to quit work from embarrassment 
 oh god 
 edit : morning 
 just a few things for the sake of clarity 1 at the risk of losing all this precious precious karma i do n't want to do butt stuff with my cousin it was just me being funny '' and <unk> back a reply that i would normally reserve for a friend 
 2 by water butt '' i mean the water bottle '' it just sometimes gets called that around the office because it is similar to an actual water butt 
 3 no pictures of my cousin ya damn dirty apes 
 anyways she 'll be in work in like 2 hours so we 'll see how it goes 
 edit number 2 : it has n't been mentioned all day 
 sweeping it under the rug like nothing ever happened 
 dealing with it in the correct british way.tifu by going to a thrift store but this is by no means something that happened today it was actually about a year ago but i 'm loving this subreddit so i thought i would share ... anyway ... normal saturday afternoon brought the hubby some lunch at work ... driving around town ... i 'm pretty new in town so im still learning my way around 
 i remembered passing a thrift store sign when i drive to and from <unk> work so i thought i would go check it out 
 note : many businesses in the area are <unk> homes 
 it 's a bit odd to see so many businesses that look like houses but i kinda live on the <unk> of town 
 i find the place and walk up to the front door and try the handle 
 locked 
 i then notice a post it note taped to the door that says thrift shop around back '' 
 <unk> okay 
 so i walk around the house and all i see is a clearly man made staircase leading to the second floor 
 okay ... makes sense i guess they live below the store is up top 
 i walk up the stairs and the door is wide open just the screen door in place 
 it 's unlocked 
 i walk in to what looks like a normal kitchen 
 my dumbass thought they may have just laid their store out like a <unk> i 'm checking out the toaster for a good minute before deciding i dont really need a toaster and i walk into the next <unk> to see an entire <unk> mom dad sister brother grandma <unk> eating dinner and watching tv 
 i was so shocked all i could muster was a <unk> is this your house '' 
 then walked out terribly embarrassed 
 almost fell down their man made staircase too ... tl dr - i accidentally walked into someones house thinking it was a business 
 so glad i didnt get <unk> edit : it was narrated 
 edit edit : i mean man made '' as in they clearly built it themselves edit edit edit : wow front page guys 
 thank you 
 edit edit edit edit : caption caption caption so this fuck up actually did happen today about five hours ago 
 my girlfriend had just gone downstairs and i was finishing a conversation with her parents upstairs 
 after finishing the conversation i headed downstairs i notice she 's in the bathroom 
 being the <unk> guy i am i silently run across the room and hide in the corner to wait for her to come out of the bathroom 
 this way when the door opened it would be blocking her view from me 
 for the record the room is pitch black - i was gon na scare her so well 
 fast forward 15 seconds of waiting the door opens and i prepare to strike 
 once she walks out i leave my spot from against the wall and go to grab her waist from behind 
 the next thing i realize is feeling a quick strike of pain to my face seeing stars and laying on the floor 
 by this point she is screaming i 'm cursing her parents are probably thinking we 're having sex in their house 
 i 'm no small guy either at 6'2 <unk> lbs not saying i 'm big but i 've started <unk> at offensive line for a few years now and just finished my senior year of football but she took me down in one hit 
 apparently i was a <unk> for a <unk> of a second in the pitch black and paid the ultimate price 
 i 'm proud of her for being able to throw out a good punch if she had to : tl dr : girlfriend is <unk> <unk> and i saw stars will have black eye tomorrow 
 edit : turns out she is actually <unk> <unk> much more accurate 
 thank you all for responding 
 glad i could make someone laugh i ca n't wait to have to explain this eye to anyone who asks 
 edit 2 : grammar edit 3 : huge thanks to the people who are n't trying to give me relationship advice 
 while i appreciate all <unk> i assure you i am not <unk> or malicious to my girlfriend 
 we 've dated for a few years now and have laughed about this incident more than i think the average couple would 
 keep the comments coming we 're laughing pretty hard at some of them 
 thank you for the gold 
 you the bomb oh reddit 
 i <unk> up 
 throwaway for obvious reasons 
 this actually happened about an hour ago 
 hooray 
 so a little background 
 my local <unk> are <unk> for being real douche <unk> 
 i send the check for my water bill via mail but apparently this month they did n't get it 
 i did n't realize until they shut my water off on friday 
 i hopped online paid the bill and called hoping they would just head over and turn it back on 
 nope 
 i get to wait until monday 
 hooray 
 so naturally i ca n't take a shit in my house for the next few days 
 i long ago used the last remaining flush in the tank 
 i 'm an amateur <unk> and i eat a lot of damn food 
 today just happened to be my monthly break day where i <unk> myself on anything and everything i <unk> <unk> for the king 
 today it was some chipotle four <unk> and a bbq chicken pizza 
 now i had all ready taken a glorious shit at the mall 
 i thought i was good for a while and would just head to the gas station when i need to drop another <unk> 
 fast forward to around four hours ago 
 i 'm a bit sleepy and my crush is going to be meeting up with me later in the evening for dinner 
 i decide to take a couple hour nap 
 i lay down and all is well 
 a few times i groggily recognize i 'm going to need to poo soon but i 'm in the midst of sleeping and fall back into my slumber 
 suddenly i 'm shocked awake by some <unk> in my stomach and bowels that can only mean one thing 
 the devil shits 
 there is no time to get to a gas station 
 like a prom night mishap this thing is coming whether i like it or not 
 i start to panic 
 i 'm <unk> where i can <unk> pinch off a <unk> without ruining something 
 i 'm pacing around my kitchen i fell asleep on the couch my living room and kitchen are joined and i see my cat 's litterbox 
 no 
 no 
 yes.. no 
 yes 
 it has to be done 
 there is no other way 
 i rip a roll of paper towels off of my counter 
 just as i 'm beginning to assume the position over the poor litterbox my phone rings 
 it 's on the counter and i can see it 's my crush 
 <unk> i 'm in a real bad place right now and i 'm sorry but i ca n't answer the phone 
 so here 's where the real fuckup comes into play 
 all of my friends relatives and my crush know where i stash my house key outside so they can just let themselves in and hang out 
 i have a pretty relaxed relationship with the people i 'm close too and they kind of just come and go as they please which i 'm fine with 
 i love company 
 turns out my crush has decided to stop by with her mom to see whats up 
 i tear my shorts off and just let it fucking rip 
 if i had been on a <unk> seat i would have achieved lift off 
 i 'm spraying cat litter everywhere with a viscous cheesy <unk> mix of <unk> stew 
 i 'm in the zone and i do n't hear the door <unk> 
 my crush rounds the corner as i 'm letting out the final <unk> of victory 
 i see her and just <unk> 'fuck 
 i proceed to lose my balance and fall in my shit stew 
 the house <unk> 
 her mother screams and they both run back downstairs 
 radio silence <unk> <unk> i fucked up 
 tl dr : do n't make poo in your litterbox no matter how <unk> the circumstances kids 
 edit : thanks to cyae1 for the narration 
 awesome 
 narrated edit 2 : gilded 
 damn 
 looks like this is going to graduate from throwaway to main account 
 thanks stranger 
 update : all right guys 
 i read through the comments and here 's what 's happened thus far 
 i got <unk> of my crush no i 'm not twelve it was just the best way i could think to put it 
 sigh 
 she texted me with a do i even want to know '' 
 and i just sent her a link to this thread rather than trying to explain it 
 i figured that would work better honestly 
 she lol 'd '' and said it was fine although that i 'm a fucking weirdo and i should just let her know if i need to take a poop at her house 
 10/10 would crush again 
 she did n't mention her mom 's reaction at all.. i know her whole family pretty well though and she 's kind of a bro 
 so hopefully this conveniently goes away 
 or knowing my luck i 'll end up marrying this girl and we 'll keep a litterbox for all of our children 
 i do n't know 
 for all of you lovely people who question me just making this shit up that 's honestly fine 
 pretty normal for any tifu i guess 
 please keep pointing out plot holes and maybe i can convince myself this did n't happen 
 i also am aware you can flush a toilet by pouring water into the bowl quickly but i only had two <unk> of water on hand 
 it honestly did n't occur to me to put it in the <unk> i also have an english mastiff and he was n't about to let me use his <unk> water to poo with 
 i was sleepy and panicked and i had to shit okay 
 it was n't my <unk> moment 
 i 'll check back in in a few days and see what is going on and update if needed 
 good night sweet reddit 
 edit 3 : front page what is <unk> girlfriend was over for a few days and unfortunately i live with my parents while i attend university 
 we have a goofy <unk> more often than not i am doing something awkward or crazy to get a laugh out of her 
 she left the room without saying much and i assumed she walked into the bathroom next to my bedroom as shortly after she left i hear the door close 
 i pulled off my pants and slowly unlocked to door to avoid making a sound ... got my dick in a full helicopter then burst into the room 
 my mom is sitting there screaming at the horror at the tornado of cock headed towards her 
 <unk> i am so <unk> we have n't made eye contact yet 
 will keep you up to date when the awkward silence ends edit : mom : do n't worry about it 
 your dad does that all the time ... me : to battle 
 <unk> -she just started laughing while making the salad for dinner and said what the fuck michael '' edit : turned out ok. we had a good chuckle at dinner and she knows i was trying to bug my gf but now she thinks i am a weirdo haha 
 you know when you look back at something you have done and just cringe 
 yeah well this is mine 
 me and a few mates are pretty drunk standing in line to a club we wanted to check out 
 we arrive right on peak <unk> time so the line was huge like <unk> <unk> so naturally when in a group with your drunk mates you tend to start playing pranks on each other and my mate ben did exactly that 
 ben suggests we play a game where we hum the tune to a song and the others have to guess what the song is called '' ... never mind that the game sounded like the most ridiculous lame and just <unk> shitty game in the world i was pretty drunk and duly accepted my friend 's challenge 
 anyway ben starts to hum the tune to the <unk> loompa song in willy <unk> - you know the oompa loompa doopedy <unk> 
 i 've got another <unk> for you 
 oompa loompa doopedy <unk> 
 you get the <unk> drunk me immediately <unk> the song and in a blaze of triumphantly drunken glory i jump out of the line into an empty space to capture the attention of all to see 
 i knew the fucking song 
 i had to share it with the world 
 everybody sort of <unk> as i jump out of the line and turns 
 wtf is this guy <unk> i begin to sing in a sweet sweet <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> doo '' 
 <unk> horror.. girls whispering in loud bitching voices what a dickhead '' to their friends 
 my mates are losing it 
 literally crying on the floor laughing 
 i of course have no idea what is going on.. that was until i saw the midget standing in line hands on hips staring at me like i invented <unk> 
 i do n't quite remember what happened next 
 whether it be the alcohol or the indescribable feelings of guilt and apology i 'll never <unk> i did not get in the club 
 i had multiple <unk> dudes requesting to fight me on behalf of aforementioned midget 
 there was zero chance of me getting laid 
 i <unk> became the did you hear about the guy that sang the oompa loompa song to a midget '' guy 
 i woke up the next morning thinking what happened last night '' 
 and then ahh yes the whole singing the oompa loompa song to a midget <unk> '' fuck 
 it actually happened 
 to my dear <unk> wherever you are i. did n't 
 mean 
 to 
 do 
 it 
 so much shame <unk> please accept my apology 
 may the cringe i now will have for the rest of my life make up for the wrongs i did to you.. to ben i salute you 
 good job mate 
 but i do n't forgive 
 i do n't forget 
 and i owe it to my little midget friend to get you back when you least expect it 
 tl dr unintentionally called a midget an oompa loompa 
 edit : to all of those offended by the word <unk> it was not my intention to offend 
 in hindsight i should have used a more appropriate word 
 i asked my mates what they thought on the matter and using them as a sample population i do agree it may have come across offensive 
 again it was not my intention to offend 
 to all of those butthurt out there for me being irresponsible and drunk <unk> i am <unk> ashamed of what i did and would not have done it if i knew there was a little person '' there 
 i am writing in a tifu after all.. i fully acknowledge that i fucked up 
 <unk> <unk> 
 youtube link to narration at the bottom that may auto play for some people 
 <unk> <unk> advised 
 so unusually for me this did n't happen today 
 it was a couple of weeks ago 
 i 've been dating my gf now for about a month and a half and everything is going great we 'll call her jamie since that 's my generic online name for her 
 she 's my first girlfriend and she 's absolutely amazing 
 she puts up with me being a short sort of awkward <unk> theater geek like no one i could even imagine 
 she 's a real heart stopper 
 that 's a big part of why i feel so bad about this 
 she was at my house and dad thought it would be a great idea to go out to dinner 
 sweet 
 he mentioned that he heard about this nice place at work that we should try 
 well we get there and it turns out to be a <unk> place 
 <unk> none of us are vegetarian 
 but the line is short and we 're already here so we decide to stay 
 good choice 
 i had a great plate of pasta and jamie had some kind of asian salad 
 everyone had a great time and it went better than expected 
 yay 
 we go home and hang out for a while waiting for her dad to come pick her up 
 he shows up outside and she gives me a hell of a kiss 
 she 's such an awesome <unk> 
 i get all silly every time she does 
 = then she leaves 
 = anyway i hop on my computer to hang out on irc for a while maybe browse reddit 
 after a while my mouth gets a little itchy 
 whatever just take a couple <unk> and move on 
 wait this does n't feel right 
 is this what i think it is 
 it is 
 where did this come from 
 oh right jamie has an asian salad 
 with a peanut dressing 
 i 'm allergic to peanuts 
 <unk> shout for mom check 
 epipen <unk> 
 lights sirens hospital vomit pass out 
 i 'm okay now but jamie felt horrible for half a week since she almost killed me 
 luckily we 're over it and still dumb teenagers in love 
 but we need to remember she needs to brush her teeth next time 
 tl dr : girlfriend kissed me and took my breath away 
 edit : wow this has been amazing 
 thanks to everyone for the supportive words and comments 
 i 'm working right now to upvote all of you 
 also someone needs to record that song 
 xd edit 2 : <unk> 
 i 've been narrated by /u/cyae1 
 edit 3 : major feels to all of those who 've shared stories about those less fortunate than i am 
 that 's a horrible thing to have happen and my thoughts and feeling got out to all of you 
 i would n't wish this on my worst enemy 
 edit 4 : ~~going to sleep will keep responding tomorrow 
 thanks everyone again <unk> i 'm a lying bundle of sticks 
 someone just bought me gold and i 'm not sleeping now 
 thanks and indeed it was not herpes this happened like an hour ago and i do n't know if i made the weekend deadline but anyway ... for my 19th birthday my sister decided to get me a bullet vibrator 
 so i was having a <unk> looking at /r/gonewild today when i decided to get a little frisky 
 cut to 10 minutes later and i 'm watching porn when i get the brilliant idea to use previously mentioned vibrator 
 feels pretty good 
 feeling a lil bit kinky now i decide to lube up my little bullet and put it in my ass 
 things get hotter and the bullet slips out of my grasp and gets sucked into my butt 
 no big deal right 
 i 'll just finish myself off real quick and do the ol squat and cough and it 'll come right out 
 wrong 
 i 'm freaking out by this point so i make a dash to the downstairs bathroom clearing my throat as i walk past my moms room to cover the slight buzzing 
 squatting over the loo i 'm <unk> to get it out using one hand to steady myself and the other to try and grab the damn thing 
 cue to getting my hand covered in shit as the fucker finally comes out along with some <unk> 
 bonus ew 
 i keep washing my hands and the smell just will not go 
 **tl dr butt sucks in vibrator 
 vibrator comes back out bringing gifts 
 <unk> this in a comment on askreddit but i think it <unk> <unk> this happened many years ago at a crucial point in childhood when a kid 's life begins to be set out in front of him 
 so i 'm sure like many of us here i was awkward as all fuck when puberty hit 
 puberty itself was the spark on top of many years of shit from growing up with a violent sister with <unk> personality disorder to physical attacks from complete strangers due to my skin color throughout a chunk of my childhood 
 probably one of the biggest things that kept me out of touch from my peers was the fact that they were from rich families and i was not 
 my grandparents were wealthy and provided us a great education through private schools in a very <unk> <unk> community but my mom had been <unk> all her life to not <unk> on them for anything else except for her vehicles apartments houses starbucks addiction and other things while keeping up the <unk> of being a make it all on my own '' type of woman so i went to school with kids who had parents that were doctors <unk> <unk> of all kinds and their lifestyles <unk> it 
 they always had the hottest clothes the <unk> tech and could watch the popular shows on cable and <unk> while i had <unk> clothes no tech and our tv only received fox 
 my friends loved the new show spongebob and would laugh about certain scenes while i had no clue what the hell they were talking about 
 i had one best friend though 
 he was fun nice frequently up to sleep over watch movies etc ... it 's somewhere around <unk> and my mom had a laptop for her writing that she would let me use at times 
 the wonders of aol instant messaging anime chatrooms and gaia online is where i found <unk> individuals that i could relate to and i felt like things were okay 
 i started spending less time outside and more time on a computer but even so i felt good about myself 
 so from gaining confidence after a few months of making online friends i ask my best friend the aol screen name of my long-time crush 
 this girl was that one '' that i had been crushing on for years 
 from 1st grade to the at the time present grade of 7th 
 so i gathered my <unk> balls and sent her a message 
 i do n't recall the exact words but the interaction went something like this ** i 've included my screen name at the time for added cringe ** : **cuddlesthekitten : ** hi 
 **her : ** hi 
 **her : ** <unk> this 
 **cuddlesthekitten : ** <unk> from school 
 * i used to <unk> on forums and <unk> so i was all about capitalization and punctuation * **her : ** oh hey whats up 
 **cuddlesthekitten : ** not much but there 's something i have to tell you that i 'm having a hard time trying to tell you ... **her : ** ok * after a couple minutes of staring at my screen trying to feel <unk> again * **cuddlesthekitten : ** i like you 
 i 've had a crush on you since 1st grade 
 * another couple minutes of silence but this time i 'm in shock over what i just actually did * **her : ** i 'm sorry 
 i dont feel the same 
 we can still be friends tho **cuddlesthekitten : ** oh 
 after that my amazing internet social skills kicked in 
 anyone who spent plenty of time on gaia <unk> and various other sites knows that there were ways of talking and terms used that do n't translate well to people who do n't frequently browse those places 
 there was one term in particular that outside of those awkwardly social <unk> was normally a pretty bad one 
 scary to some even 
 on those sites though it was playful common and relatively normal '' 
 **cuddlesthekitten : ** that 's okay 
 <unk> i 'll <unk> you 
 <unk> that 's it 
 that 's the sentence that ruined my life 
 **her : ** omg what 
 not 10 seconds later messages poured in ... **her bf '' ** : what the fuck did u just say to her **her best friend** : omg u creep wtf is rong with u 
 **her other best friend** : y the <unk> would u say <unk> 
 a couple other people messaged saying the same sort of thing 
 i tried to message everyone back and explain just that i liked her and i did n't mean anything by it 
 i started feeling cold and shaky and had no idea what the hell to do so i closed the computer curled up on my bed just relived it all over and over and until i fell asleep 
 i faked sick the next day 
 i knew everyone at school knew what happened so i did n't want to face it 
 there were only 3 <unk> with each split into two separate classes about 15 kids each 
 it was a small school everyone was friends with everyone and most of us had been friends going through the private school chain since preschool 
 none of them remained my friends though 
 i went back the day after and no one spoke to me 
 just to each other and then whispers when i was near 
 i felt more out of place than ever before and not even my best friend would talk to me 
 he told me himself those words * '' i do n't want to talk to you 
 * followed by * '' we ca n't be friends anymore 
 * that was the last day i went to school 
 i faked sick every day after which resulted in numerous doctors visits with no one able to figure out what the hell was wrong with me 
 i became a master of it managed to get a hold of an identical <unk> that i 'd heat up to swap out with the one my mom gave me every morning and even scalded my mouth by holding hot water in it at the doc 's office swallowed right before my temp was taken and fooling the quickie digital <unk> they had 
 it must 've become clear that the problem was n't physical because i ended up talking to a therapist every two weeks 
 the guy was an asshole though even my folks agree to this day that he was n't much of any good 
 my days were spent asleep while my nights were spent online 
 i made more online friends to fill the hole caused by my fuck up and ended up feeling like they were enough 
 it eventually got to the point where my mom stopped trying to get me to go to school and then after a year or so i moved in with my dad 
 i became even more <unk> despite efforts from my dad and the local public school system to try to get me out in school and around people 
 this continued until i was 15 until there was a knock on the front door at 4:30 in the morning 
 two large men were there to take me away to a <unk> wilderness program several states away 
 i spent nearly 2 years away from home in wilderness and boarding schools which provided many crazy stories of their own with the last facility losing all records of my credit history so all the hard work i put in with the <unk> '' system they had was lost 
 i was just credits away from graduating 
 came home at 17 just a couple months before becoming 18 no credits no friends no nothing 
 and that 's how one sentence ruined my life 
 **edit** : since people are asking i am doing great these days 
 what i went through made me a better person in the end so i have no problems with what happened 
 even though i have no desire to try to talk to anyone from middle school i do n't hold any negative feelings towards them 
 the reality is that it was just the straw that broke the <unk> 's back 
 it was really one of the least damaging incidents in my life but it caused what remained of my <unk> mental state to collapse 
 still i caused it to happen by being socially inept which is why it 's my fuck up 
 i 'm in a very happy place in life with people i love even if i 'm not a success in any financial or social sense 
 my home is lacking some walls and <unk> and my kitchen <unk> is made of dollar tree paper table paper and i will likely not be able to do anything about these problems any time soon but i am happy 
 this was just a cringe-worthy depressing moment in my history and it is far in the past 
 i hope all who read this are happy as well and if some of you are not i hope you get there 
 i 'm open to be talked to if anyone is struggling 
 i 'm no professional but i have an ear ready to listen 
 *edit # 2 : no more gold 
 thank you peeps but i 've now gotten one on this one privately and one for the image of my arm on fire in the original askreddit i posted this in 
 i need no more 
 <unk> did n't happen today '' this was a few weeks ago 
 i was playing with my dog when he rolled over so i could scratch his belly 
 as a good <unk> i <unk> obliged until i saw something that concerned me.. what appeared to be a possible infection in his doggy <unk> 
 i immediately got up and went to my husband in the other room and told him the dog has what kind of looks like <unk> coming from his pens 
 is it infected 
 should we take him to the vet '' 
 cue my husband looking at me like i 'm an idiot until i finally realized what the <unk> coming from my dog 's dick was and promptly did the <unk> dance 
 things between the dog and i have n't been the same since 
 edit : holy shit front page 
 glad you guys could find joy in my disgusting discovery 
 also i 've learned way more about dog dicks today than i ever cared to 
 ok apparently i have to put this at the front of the post cause no one reads edits 
 buttplay is not entirely just for gay people 
 i get it 
 pls do n't comment that let me keep this short 
 fml 
 so you know how when you search amazon for let 's say electronic parts it will recommend other electronics for you 
 so rewind a couple days i searched amazon for huge dildos as a joke to a friend 
 then today my dad asked if he could use my amazon account because i have prime 
 i give him my account details 
 he then logs in and comes into my room and begins talking to me about how it 's ok to be gay 
 i asked why he was telling me this and he told me how amazon had recommended me a <unk> <unk> dildo or some shit 
 rip my <unk> tl dr : searching dildos one day makes your dad think gay 
 edit 1 : so first off 
 rip inbox 
 second off the joke was he said something that made him seem gay so i searched amazon for some dildos and sent the link to him 
 also no i 'm not homosexual or a <unk> edit 2 : are you triggered yet edit <unk> : i understand that buttplay is not gay all the time 
 pls stop telling me edit <unk> : k this blew up 
 quick update my dad knows the situation hopefully and he understands 
 also <unk> me those <unk> i mean cats of course no pussy please cause i 'm gay triggered now 
 proof : original post here 
 tl dr : i cycled to school forgot my trousers and took an exam half dressed in a suit and half dressed in bike shorts 
 i told you there was a photo 
 i have managed to get my hands on it 
 here it is 
 i look a lot worse than i remember feeling that day even <unk> my <unk> coffee of the day 
 extra photo for <unk> and a final thanks to all of you for making my stressful week a great deal more fun : <unk> travel quite a bit am always moving from hotel to hotel and am at some point of recovery from <unk> 
 flying into the states i checked into my hotel and crashed out almost straight away 
 waking during the night for a bathroom visit i had an adrenaline explosion as i realised there was a fat naked guy in the room with me and he was moving my way 
 in my sleep <unk> state i reacted by instinct more than thought and threw a huge <unk> punch at him 
 result : a $ <unk> bill for a shattered hotel mirror and a badly cut hand 
 <unk> : this was 7th grade i 'm now a junior in high <unk> so there was this one kid in my class that <unk> hated 
 he was the biggest arse to anyone he met and i think at one point he was even caught wanking in the ladies room 
 let 's call him derp 
 derp was a guy who thought he was super smart and he and i were kinda mutual friends 
 like not the kind of friends who ever text or talk about anything cool more just like the friends who exchange homework answers 
 now me : i 'm a programmer 
 i 've been a computer geek for the longest time and ive been a badass with all kinds of <unk> 
 this was kinda common knowledge 
 there was also a rumor that i could hack anything though that was quite false 
 anyway one day i decided to prank this derp 
 i managed to convince him that i could code him a program that could hack *any* website and access any account ever created anywhere 
 i told him i had used it to break into the <unk> and learn government secrets and hack apple and screw up the creation of the new ipad 
 of course he believed me and agreed to try it 
 i go home and crack my knuckles then bring up all kinds of programs 
 after 2 hours of work i come up with the master program : it was an install wizard 
 it looked very professional and rapidly installed <unk> '' to your system 
 in reality it installed a video of various <unk> of dicks popping up all over the screen as well as running a shutdown script in the background 
 as soon as the video finished the computer turns off 
 and this pops up every time you log in 
 <unk> <unk> here comes the fuckup 
 i give it to him the next day all prepared and awesome 
 as i hand him the flash drive i repeat do not install this on school computers 
 the blocking software they have can track you me and it can even screw up the computers 
 do **not** install it on any school pc '' 
 two days later i get called to the office 
 he installed it on <unk> one not two <unk> <unk> fucking school computers 
 ** once he was caught he was quick to <unk> me out as to <unk> the blame 
 i explained myself in saying it was a harmless prank and could easily be <unk> with the proper knowledge which was literally <unk> and delete it out of the startup folder 
 miraculously i got off with a warning and he was suspended for a week 
 i also was tasked with removing it from all the computers which was quite embarrassing 
 but hell it was funny 
 and it got me this story 
 tl : dr : <unk> the <unk> by making dicks appear on his pc whenever he turns it on the idiot <unk> it on 22 fuckin school computers did n't get brutally murdered by school <unk> 
 **edit : ** alot are asking about the program itself 
 it was **not** any sort of virus and was as simple as an easy shutdown batch file and a video put together into an install wizard and installed into a startup folder 
 **edit 2 : ** holy hell i 've never been on the front page before 
 i have <unk> 
 **edit 3 : ** alot of people are calling me a bully 
 this kid was hated for a reason and that 's because *he* was a huge bully and asshat to everyone in the school 
 he did n't have any sort of disorder he was just a <unk> today in class we were writing an essay on the computers and as any <unk> student would do i brought a usb with so i could work at home 
 fast forward to the middle of the lesson i was bored as fuck and looking for anything to entertain me so i just started to roll the lid of my usb around my mouth and then it just slipped down my throat ... you know that feeling when you swallow a whole ice <unk> or something where you can feel it still going down your throat but you know its too late to try and <unk> it out yeah that was me 
 so then i just continue with my essay without making a sound to anyone around me 
 came up with the new safety warning : contains small parts <unk> to babies under 3 and that one 15 year old idiot '' update : holy shit guys i did n't expect this much of a response 
 <unk> wants to read my post so i 'll post the link when he finishes doing his thing 
 thanks : d update 2 : heres the link to the /u/markreadsreddit vid 
 thanks again <unk> reddit 
 okay so my fuck up was around an hour ago 
 so i was attending a dinner with a lot of my parents friends 
 although i recognized a lot of them there were also a few people i did not recognize 
 i was sat next to an obviously pregnant woman 
 however despite being pregnant i realised that she was also drinking quite a bit 
 and me being the nosy person i am was getting quite annoyed by how <unk> she was being 
 so as she was finishing her second glass and refilling it i turned to her and said do n't you think you 're being a little unacceptable '' 
 to which she replied with a confused <unk> '' 
 and then i started going on this <unk> lecture that went something like listen i 'm sorry if this comes off as rude or all of a sudden but do n't you think you should be a bit more responsible 
 i mean there 's a <unk> growing inside of you should n't you care more about its <unk> and not be drinking '' 
 so this woman who looked to be in her late 20s or so stared at me for a few seconds then puts down her glass 
 i thought she was going to apologise or something and admit that i was right when she goes i 'm not pregnant '' 
 okay so by now practically all the blood ran to my cheeks 
 i realised that i made the mistake that even many great ones made and <unk> called a woman fat by assuming she was pregnant 
 and honestly i wish it ended here but <unk> apparently god hates me or something because in my utter embarrassment i convinced myself that she was definitely playing some type of practical joke on me like i heard many pregnant women like to do 
 because seriously there was **no <unk> this lady could <unk> be pregnant 
 she was so skinny everywhere else there was no way she would only be fat on her stomach 
 so what do i do 
 i decided i had to call her <unk> so i said a small yeah right '' 
 and then i shit you not proceeded to place my hand on her stomach and felt around for at least a good second or two 
 i do n't know what i expected 
 for the baby to suddenly kick as soon as i touched her stomach to assert dominance 
 for there to be a truth button on her stomach or something that forced her to tell me that she 's pregnant 
 nope 
 turns out she was n't pregnant and her stomach was n't even fat 
 so basically she was wearing like this kinda black cocktail really puffy dress with multiple layers that started right beneath her boobs 
 so when she sat down it like <unk> all that puff to the front and it created like this optical <unk> and made it genuinely look like she was pregnant 
 so when i decide to touch her stomach all of that collapsed and i was just kinda <unk> her 
 i did n't know what to say 
 at this point i knew i fucked up for good 
 i just squeaked out a tiny oh right 
 so you 're not '' 
 i was staring at my own hand this entire time 
 i did n't want to look up and face her 
 but get this i was so embarrassed and frozen that i did n't even move my hand for another good second or two until *she <unk> had to move so my hand was no longer laying on my stomach 
 the rest of the dinner was the most awkward one i had to sit through 
 tl dr - women 's fashion designs made me accidentally <unk> a woman for a few seconds 
 optical <unk> are a bitch 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <unk> frequently posted comments and how i responded to them in the comments below 
 if you ca n't find it sort by new 
 thank you for taking the time to <unk> today i fucked up by getting kidnapped here 's the tl : dr - this is a humorous <unk> about the time an awful woman kidnapped me from a bar took me 2 hours away and i was <unk> by loyal friends 
 it 's probably worth your time okay so like many this was not today it was a few years ago now but i was encouraged to share this as part of my healing process 
 by encouraged i mean harassed and by healing i mean harassed 
 settle in it 's a long story but it 's my story 
 so here we go ... sophomore year of college last night of the fall semester i have one final left at <unk> the next morning 
 my roommate is packing up to head home for the break and i convince him to stick around and have dinner 
 he agreed on the condition that he would leave from the restaurant i then revealed i was already drunk so he would have to drive there and take me back to school 
 we get to the bar and i promptly order a martini which i sipped once and pronounced it to be gross and ordered a drink called a slippery banana '' which included a straw orange slice and an announcement to the rest of the bar with a party horn and humiliation 
 my roommate calls our buddy who agrees to come down and join us 
 then suddenly a group of women in their <unk> walk in and take seats at the bar 
 we exchange glances and the most awful one who we shall now refer to as slagathor '' calls me over 
 i walk to her seat at the bar and she looks me in the eye and says are you gay 
 i said no and she said well you look like a fucking <unk> '' 
 i said thanks and returned to the booth 
 somewhere around this time our buddy shows up and we 're drunk enough to wander back to the ladies 
 flirting begins drinks are exchanged someone orders flaming dr. pepper 's i spill one on the bar creating a small fire that needed the attention of a wet bar rag and somehow i convince these women to flash us 
 now let me point out that when i said restaurant earlier i met like an <unk> 's so as boobs are flying a family of four is trying to enjoy their <unk> <unk> and <unk> behind us 
 the bartender gets pissed and we wander out of the bar 
 now that we 're outside slagathor begins to insist on seeing my penis i oblige because i 'm a gentleman she <unk> 
 at some point she says something about taking me back to her house because i got a 3 month old kid and my husband just got outta jail and i <unk> had sex in a year '' 
 red flag 
 i 'm at that stage of blackout drunk where literally anything anyone says is the best idea and according to my roommate i was very insistent on assisting slaggy with her situation 
 we get in a truck with slagathor on my lap and her <unk> friend slaggy sr. driving 
 this is the part where i start to see flashes of events that transpired 
 i remember her rolling a blunt on my lap i remember a gas station i remember her kissing me i remember a parking lot and then getting in a new car 
 this is where the actual <unk> '' kicks in because i say i want to go home and slagathor says and i quote no '' 
 we drive off into the night and i pass out 
 the car slams into park i roll out the passenger door and start puking on the side walk of a very sketchy looking neighborhood 
 i look up and see slagathor squatting in the middle of the fucking road taking a piss 
 my instincts kick in and i bolt i 'm running through yards jumping <unk> lose a <unk> <unk> warm evening and see the beautiful glow of a 7/11 sign 
 i run to the doors think about it step to the alley and throw up <unk> <unk> then crash through the doors and yell where the fuck am i '' 
 the line of patrons and the cashiers look at me like a time traveler just asked them what year it is 
 the cashier timidly says ... 7/11 '' 
 i said no like what fucking city is this '' 
 she tells me i ask how far that is from my college she says 2 hours 
 i call my roommate in a panic he says he 's too drunk to drive so is the rest of the school because it 's the last fucking night of finals 
 he calls a friend who lives a half hour away and tells her i 'm in trouble and they need to come get me he then tells her i 'm about 15 minutes from campus 
 she is a wonderful person for her actions and if this were a military operation i would submit her for a <unk> 
 i begin to explain to the cashiers what had happened to me when i feel a hand on my shoulder and the screeching wail of slagathor there you are 
 we 've been looking for you '' 
 slaggy sr. is there too and she takes my other arm 
 they walk me back to slaggy <unk> 's house where they sit me down on a bench 
 some guy walks over and yells at me slaggy starts yelling at me about getting her pills 
 where the fuck am i going to get pills 
 i do n't know any drug dealers two <unk> from where i live 
 i did n't really know any drug dealers where i lived 
 for some reason i remember a fucking cat coming over i just sat there and pet the cat because it brought me comfort to see some kind of innocence again 
 after awhile i yelled to the next room that i wanted to leave and slagathor says not until we have sex i said i do n't want to have sex she says she 'll take me home when she 's done smoking her blunt i said i was leaving she said go fuck yourself '' 
 i leave and begin to look for the 7/11 again which is somehow now very hard to find 
 then i see it i march through the doors past the cashiers into the stock room and sit down on a case of pepsi and refuse to leave 
 they said they would help me but they needed me to come out of the stock room 
 much to my dismay they call their cop buddy '' to come i explain the story to him and he shows little sympathy and asks what i want from him 
 i asked him if he could take me home he says he can take me to jail 
 i said i 'll just wait for my friends 
 after 2 1/2 hours of insisting to our sober friend that it was only like 15 more minutes '' they finally arrive and according to them i was pressed against the glass like a puppy at a pet store crying hysterically at the sight of her car 
 my ordeal was over i took my shirt off for some reason 
 crawled into the back seat and cried on my friends lap the whole way home 
 i have been sober for 17 months i know that <unk> does n't match up but i 'm a slow <unk> 
 p.s 
 i was late for my final 
 for once in my life i am actually successfully talking to a girl 
 things are going alright and she sends me some pics so i attempt to return the favor 
 i take some dick pics with my new iphone 6. it 's important to note i 'm taking and sending the dick pics while i 'm pretending to shower 
 i watch youtube videos on my apple tv while i 'm working out so my phone was still set to airplay 
 my sister and mother are watching some shitty show on netflix while i am showering '' 
 if you 've ever used an apple tv you know that if someone from an iphone sends their signal to the tv it will <unk> whatever 's currently happening 
 so their netflix show must have been replaced by my dick pic once i opened it in the photos app to determine if it was worthy 
 while i am touching up my dick pic picture i hear screaming coming from downstairs 
 i frantically remember oh fuck my airplay is on '' 
 that was a bad feeling 
 they run upstairs and yell what am i doing i pretend i ca n't hear even though my shower is certainly not <unk> loud 
 we have n't spoken yet 
 tonight has been <unk> this actually happened yesterday however i 'm sure most of everyone 's posts are 
 i should add context before i start 
 most of my life i have been a hermit or a <unk> if you will 
 mostly just sitting in my room playing video games and not really interacting with anyone 
 somehow i ended up with a so shocked me too 
 and at this point we have been together for 4 years 
 i recently started working at a security company first job <unk> 
 in a big fancy condo building as night guard 
 yesterday was like any other day since i started working there however when i got relieved in the morning i followed my routine 
 walk to the outside of the nearby mall with the subway in it 
 have a smoke and go home 
 yesterday however took a creepy turn 
 while i was standing outside the mall this old man came up to me and started talking to me 
 i am used to random people talking to me when i choose to go outside so this did n't seem odd to me 
 the conversation ended with him asking if i wanted to get a coffee with him 
 i said sure why not 
 so we go to the nearest tim <unk> like any good canadian seeking coffee would and i bought my coffee 
 he turns to me and tells me he wanted to buy me the coffee 
 again i thought nothing of it 
 we sit down and start talking and he tells me how he has a wife and kid and i talk about my girlfriend 
 then i get a red flag from him 
 he starts talking about this bath house he goes to 
 i start to feel a little uncomfortable but whatever i thought must be a nice old man that likes to get clean in places other than his home 
 so we finish talking and i say i should be getting home because i have work that night 
 he decides to walk with me to the subway 
 this is where it gets creepy 
 as we are waking through the mall he starts to grab and squeeze my arm 
 there are no words to describe how uncomfortable i was 
 when we get to the subway he decided he was going to take the subway with me 
 at this point i was n't sure what was going on but i was sure it was n't good 
 when my stop came around he went for the kicker 
 do you mind if i touch you 
 do you want to come to the bath house with me <unk> '' 
 i said no '' but did n't <unk> what i was saying no to which i think gave him the indication that i didnt mind being touched so he goes to grab my lovely man bits ... the subway stops and i run out of there so fast that even <unk> bolt was like damn dude 
 slow that shit down '' 
 as soon as i got on my bus that takes me home i called my so ... she ca n't stop laughing and explains that the coffee was supposed to be some informal date ... i dont know what i 'm going to do if i see him again 
 **tl dr was approached by a seemingly nice old guy mistakenly had informal date was <unk> by old man 
 ** **update : ** thanks for all the support honestly i find the situation to be pretty humorous mainly because that was the least expected thing to happen to me 
 i thought it was more likely someone would spontaneously <unk> in front of me than have some old guy touch my no no zone 
 my so saw my post was pretty angry that i did n't mention that when i told her i was being lighthearted about it 
 anyway i will update again if anything significant happens 
 literally happened today and i <unk> up pretty awkwardly reddit 
 technically it starts a week or so ago when i was moving shelves around at work 
 my colleague j '' suggested moving an item a little bit more to the left to which i explained that then it would n't line up with the items above and below it <unk> with i guess i 'm just being a bit anal '' 
 apparently anal is n't a term that is used internationally j is german if that helps so she was very taken aback by my slightly <unk> <unk> slang 
 i quickly explained that anal '' short for <unk> <unk> is used to describe people who pay annoying detail to small things basically 
 she accepted the term and we moved on 
 today a customer was at the counter talking to their sales rep with whom they have a close relationship more like friends 
 they were joking and laughing around about how picky the customer was being and she said i know i know ... i 'm just being anal '' 
 j immediately lit up recognising the new term she 'd just learnt and i quickly explained to the confused faces of our sales rep and the customer ** '' oh i literally just taught j anal 
 ** & gt oh i mean ... i explained the word ... i did n't ... uhh no i did n't mean that ... anal <unk> you know 
 <unk> ... i <unk> like a fish out of water to take back my words but the damage had been done 
 everyone was in hysterics and news of my fuck up had traveled around the office in minutes 
 now i 'm known as the girl who teaches anal '' 
 reddit i fucked up 
 edit : wow 
 this did quite well over night 
 1. no op does not teach *actual* anal 
 sorry : c 2. yes the term anal '' is probably used internationally <unk> german j had never heard it used in that situation before though : **edit # 2 most of the responses i 've got on here have been quite humorous so i thank all of you who have had something nice or <unk> to say 
 ** **to those of who posting comments <unk> & gt **yawn** 
 <unk> ** & gt **i 've basically seen this post before 
 ** **i would like to ask you to please consider the following : ** * **are you paying to read this story 
 ** * <unk> i being paid for the service of providing you with something to read 
 ** **i believe you will find the answer in both cases is no '' 
 so unless you 're going to give me some gold for this <unk> please get over it and move on 
 i wrote this to share the hilarity of an awkward situation not to make <unk> <unk> redditors pleased 
 ** **to conclude thank you to all the people supporting my anal '' lessons and potential career choices you 're all wonderful 
 ** i 'm a graduate student in <unk> and i work in a <unk> 
 one day while chasing a <unk> around the bay where my experiment is kept i stumbled across a black widow female 
 i trapped her in a water bottle brought her home and put her in a cage with crickets 
 she ate quite a few crickets and doubled in size while laying two egg sacs 
 i had smeared vaseline around the top of the cage to prevent her from escaping but the thought of having hundreds of baby black widow spiders in a tank just feet from my couch gave me the <unk> <unk> 
 today i decided that i would remove the egg sacs from the tank 
 however one egg <unk> had already <unk> and there were hundreds of small brown spiders crawling on the web 
 i was <unk> by the sight of so many spiders so i picked up the tank with the intention to move it outside 
 that lasted for about 2 seconds 
 the lid came off the tank as i held it away from my body and the tank crashed down against the sofa and carpet 
 spiders crickets and web flew out on impact before i could even realize what had happened 
 so now i 'm going to have to bug bomb the entire house but not before having to spend one very <unk> wracking night in the bedroom 12 feet from where i dropped hundreds of <unk> nearly invisible black <unk> in another thread said you can stop a mosquito bite from itching by putting boiling water on it since it <unk> <unk> or something so i tried it on a mosquito bite on my knuckle 
 now my knuckle has a burn on it and still itches but also hurts when i scratch it 
 thanks reddit 
 **edit : ** okay now to make up for being such jerks go post something nice everyone can do over on <unk> to balance it <unk> happened today 
 <unk> acct for <unk> reasons 
 starters : i 'm married to my wife henceforth referred to as wife 
 we have kids 
 we have the <unk> of marriages 
 we have a friend 
 let 's call her kim 
 kim is one of the cutest humans on the planet and is genuinely a beautiful individual inside and out 
 also is married and has kids 
 i 've harbored a crush on this human pretty much since we met 2 years ago 
 i 'm not an asshole and would n't cheat on the mother of my children i just have the occasional <unk> where our significant others <unk> die in a plane crash and we find comfort in each others arms and genitals 
 you know 
 also part of this is my sister henceforth known as maggie 
 maggie is bisexual and on several occasions i 've found out that in general maggie and i often will have the <unk> for the same celebrities 
 we both watched the crap out of <unk> girls because of alexis <unk> do n't judge 
 <unk> i 've gotten the suspicion that maggie also has a crush on kim based on things she 's said to her in past events their interactions on social media and the kinds of comments my sister leaves on kim 's photos 
 it 's all little things that add up compliments that she does n't normally give other people a certain amount of shyness and a general gut feeling 
 now.. the fuckup : so after dinner i am informed that kim 's birthday party is the end of the month and it 's a surprise party 
 my wife asks me if i think maggie would want to go 
 i say offhandedly oh i 'm sure maggie would n't mind hanging out with kim '' 
 wife asks me for clarification as i had n't mentioned my above theory to her 
 i clarified stating that i think my sister has a little crush on kim 
 my wife asked for further clarification asking why i think that 
 now at this point i could and should have stated any of the things i said above about the social media interactions the shyness the gut feeling <unk> however what i said was just the way i 've seen her act around kim 
 i know maggie and i have a similar taste in girls '' .. as i say the last part i realize the implication as soon as it leaves my mouth 
 i hope in the back of my brain that my wife did n't catch said implication and just proceeded to stare down the plate i was washing like i was about to duel it at high noon 
 <unk> do you mean by share 'the same taste in girls '' 
 ..oh <unk> so i start immediately trying to back pedal and just try to throw it off like oh well i 'm just saying maggie acts as certain way around kim is all i know my sister well enough to see the signs '' etc 
 however my wife repeats so you 're saying kim is your type '' 
 i 'm sweating bullets and wishing to dear heaven i could pause time and read different conversation choices <unk> fallout style and determine the best one 
 i go with just saying that i think my sister likes her 
 i mean she is cute but i do n't know if i 'd go as far as to say 'my type 
 this led to several more long conversations about our marriage if i find her attractive still i do if i 'd cheat on her i would n't and so on and so on till she went to bed 
 not exactly how i envisioned spending my friday <unk> i think we 're in a good place now having talked through everything but i would have saved myself a lot of <unk> if i had just said cuz i have a gut feeling '' 
 i can also tell the wind is a little out of her <unk> about going to the birthday party and i hope it does n't get all awkward and shit lets be honest though my life is a sack of awkward so it was probably going to happen one way or another 
 tl dr : i 'm married and i have a crush on my friend kim i think my bisexual sister does too 
 mentioned to my wife that i think my sister maggie crushes on kim because we sometimes crush on the same girls 
 i am dumb 
 edit : so i just wanted to clarify that if my wife were to somehow actually die in a tragic <unk> that my actual reaction would be pure devastation 
 a few readers caught the himym reference here 
 sooo ... roughly a year ago i was about to take a shower when i decided i wanted to listen to some music to make the mundane process more pleasant 
 i had already disrobed so i walked my naked self into the living room to retrieve the computer 
 my wife was lying between the computer and me on the floor <unk> playing with our dog <unk> 
 so i stepped around her got the computer then turned to head back to the bathroom 
 only this time instead of stepping around her i thought it would be a lark if i pretended to <unk> her as i walked by ... you know stand over her and squat a few inches then stop 
 we 'd both share a good laugh at the thought of me tapping her chin with my <unk> 
 you know something all good husbands do 
 so i walk back over stand over her face bend a few inches at the knee -- -- and i tear my <unk> <unk> 
 edit : thanks for the first gold ever guys 
 and for taking my dumb ass to the front page : d hi reddit first time poster here 
 i have a very fun and quite unbelievable story to tell you guys 
 this happened back in <unk> i was 18 slightly nerdy and i was not a drinker by any means 
 let’s get the funniest part of this entire story out of the way right now 
 i’ll admit it i had bowl cut 
 you’ll see 
 i was best buds with two guys i had known for years : ryan and dave 
 ryan’s dad was an airline pilot and had some free tickets to hawaii so he offered to take us all for a long weekend 
 needless to say we were stoked 
 i had never been to hawaii before and i was looking forward to the experience very much 
 i am 35 years old now and my <unk> are <unk> but i will describe things as best i can 
 the flight was long but soon enough we arrived in the <unk> 
 it seemed as if that was the only car available to rent on the island 
 ryan dave i chris were lucky enough to have our own room which meant trouble at that age 
 we did some bar hopping and found it quite difficult to get alcohol from the <unk> since we all looked pretty damn young 
 desperate times require desperate measures so we found a guy in the stairwell of our hotel named cal and asked him to buy us some booze 
 he <unk> and the debauchery ensued 
 dave and i did a bit of drinking in the hotel room and ryan did quite a bit more 
 he was in pretty bad shape and the place was a disaster 
 beer cans were <unk> about and everything was in complete <unk> 
 ryan was sitting on the toilet in the bathroom puking into the shower when his dad called 
 he didn’t like what he heard and said that he was coming up to check on us 
 he was in the same hotel only a few floors away so we freaked the hell out 
 it was a mad scramble to clean the room and put all the beer cans into a trash bag and dispose of it in the stairwell before his dad got up there 
 we kept ryan in the bathroom and somehow convinced his dad that everything was <unk> and he just had a stomach bug 
 in hindsight his dad almost surely knew exactly what was going on as he kept a much closer eye on us from there on out 
 on one of our adventures outside of the hotel that night we saw an <unk> in a bar for a booze cruise 
 the <unk> made it sound like a ton of fun complete with hot chicks music dancing alcohol and a massive floating trampoline 
 what more could an 18 year old ask for 
 absolutely <unk> so we decided to see if ryan’s dad would allow us to go 
 i believe we told him that we wanted to go on a cruise while conveniently leaving out the part about the booze so he didn’t seem to have much of a problem with us going 
 there was one catch though : the booze cruise was on a sunday and ryan 's family was quite religious 
 dave and i were given the option to go to sunday mass while ryan was not 
 we all went back to the hotel room for the night to ponder the situation 
 the next day we all met up with ryan’s dad early in the morning and <unk> our <unk> 
 in true top gear spirit when one of our comrades was in need and the open road was ahead of us dave and i did what we had to do : we left ryan to go to church with his dad and we got the hell on that ship 
 and damn was that a good decision 
 sort of 
 i went to a small high school with a graduating class of less than 60 kids and i definitely wasn’t a big partier 
 this cruise was absolutely nuts especially for me 
 loud music was blasting tons of meat heads were screaming and being obnoxious beautiful women in <unk> <unk> were on their backs with cheering crowds around them as whipped cream was sprayed onto their <unk> 
 guys were doing body shots off of <unk> girls making <unk> you name it 
 it was <unk> for dave and me but we needed some alcohol to really let loose 
 now that i think about it i’m not quite sure how we managed to get on this booze cruise in the first place since the minimum age for the cruise was <unk> lol 
 regardless we decided to chance it and go ask the bartender for a drink hoping he wouldn’t ask us for any id 
 dave looked older than i did so he was <unk> to do the deed 
 if he was successful our drink of choice was going to be a long island iced tea 
 he made it up to the bar and wasn’t looking too confident in himself and i was getting worried that we were going to be busted for being on a booze cruise <unk> 
 no good 
 dave eventually went for it hands shaking… and he got lucky 
 the bartender didn’t id him and he came back with the massive drink 
 we were stoked to say the least 
 again keep in mind the neither of us were big drinkers 
 also keep in mind that the bartender made this long island iced tea extremely strong 
 well let me tell you <unk> this long island iced tea absolutely <unk> me 
 i became a flaming idiot and lost every single bit of the little common sense i had 
 i guess that was the goal but this was a bit more than i had planned for 
 by this point everyone else was extremely intoxicated as well as the escapades were only getting more <unk> 
 at the peak of my <unk> the boat came to a stop and <unk> in the middle of the pacific ocean 
 everyone started jumping off the back of the boat and getting onto the massive floating trampoline that was being dragged behind it 
 this was so amazing for dave and me 
 boobs were bouncing everywhere and we were drunk out of our minds 
 every once in a while we would mention poor ryan who was probably sitting in the <unk> beside his father singing <unk> at sunday mass 
 oh well the show must go <unk> 
 i then decided to join in the <unk> 
 when i do things i normally go all out 
 it’s all or nothing for me and that would prove to be a bit problematic in this case 
 all of the other drunk people were jumping off the back of the boat which was the proper place to jump off the boat as it was lower and intended for such a purpose 
 that didn’t seem to be cool enough for me however as i climbed up on the side of the boat and let out a <unk> then jumped into the ocean 
 fully clothed 
 with my wallet in my pocket 
 my wallet was forced out of my pocket by the sudden impact from the 20+ foot jump into the water and unbeknownst to me promptly sank to the bottom of the ocean floor 
 dave and i continued to have a great time on the booze cruise and our lives were perfect 
 i didn’t realize that i had lost my wallet until we <unk> the ship and got back onto <unk> <unk> 
 this was not a good situation at all but fortunately it was pre 9/11 and ryan’s dad could pull some strings since he was a pilot 
 i eventually made it back to the <unk> united states and got a new license from the <unk> 
 all was back to normal for a couple <unk> if you are still with me then you are about to be <unk> just like i was 
 over two years later my mom received a <unk> envelope in the mail sent from colorado and addressed to me 
 i opened up the envelope and inside i found my worn wallet filled with sand with my faded id card and the <unk> remains of a twenty dollar bill inside 
 also in the envelope was a hand written letter that read : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - my husband <unk> found your wallet in 90 ft. of water 
 he was doing his 2 weeks with navy <unk> 
 he teaches scuba and is a master instructor 
 that day he had a group of 8 people out in the ocean when he found your wallet 
 i hope you receive this and haven’t moved 
 i wondered how long it has been in the ocean hawaii 
 sincerely <unk> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - i was floored 
 i could not believe that this wallet made it back to me years after my stupid ass had lost it in the middle of the pacific ocean 
 we were miles from <unk> when i jumped off the side of that boat and as the letter said the diver found my wallet in <unk> meters of water 
 absolutely <unk> if you ask me 
 my mom saved it for all these years and i just got around to taking some pics earlier tonight 
 anyways i hope you enjoyed the story guys 
 i have attached pictures to this post as proof that this was not a fictional tale 
 click here for pics 
 hey 
 you 
 == & gt tl dr went on booze cruise in hawaii got way too drunk jumped off side of boat fully clothed lost wallet in the pacific ocean scuba diver found it two years later and sent it back to me with a letter from his wife who has amazing <unk> <unk> and i had a super awesome bowl cut of which everyone is <unk> i work for <unk> the equivalent of irs in the united states and i have 30 sick days a year 
 i have n't taken any sick days in the past 2 years of me working there 
 i thought hey why not '' 
 so i decided to have a day off 
 i had a great sleep in and i thought it would be a nice idea to smoke some pot 
 i smoked multiple <unk> and got a strange call from my fucking boss 
 she asked my why i was n't at work and out of quick & amp stoned thinking 
 i came up with the conclusion that i should say i have bronchitis 
 but instead the words that came out of my mouth were i 'm in bed i have <unk> '' 
 i now have to attend a disciplinary meeting this wednesday 
 tldr : i took a day off and now i 'm in a disciplinary <unk> this actually happened today 
 a little backstory i been working for a electronics store and i recently switched positions for a pay raise 
 after switching i found i was actually getting paid less than what they said 
 after i reported they said they 'd get back with me 
 so eventually they told me they sent a email '' its been over a month and i texted my boss fuming about my pay and he 's like oh op i was going to tell you you were being bumped up but with a attitude like that wait 90 <unk> 
 edit : so i went in to work apologized to my other manager and he told me the higher up still has n't replied to the email

 i waited the sweet moment for my brother to leave to work so i can proceed with my dirty secret 
 but today my hand would not do that job 
 i was too horny for that 
 i decided to look up some homemade sex toys for males '' on youtube and found one that seemed relatively easy to make 
 so i grab a ziplock bag fill it with conditioner slide it under the couch cushion and begin my wonderful couch fucking 
 this is where i fuck up 
 it started burning but i ignored it for a few minutes before it became unbearable and decided to just jerk off and slide it in right before i cum 
 so i 'm so close and decide to put it in 
 now i 'm a virgin so i 've never felt anything this good in my life before 
 <unk> i did n't realize my grandpa had come upstairs everyone else was downstairs 
 so here i am pants down at my ankles fucking my couch when i hear the door to downstairs fly open 
 as i previously stated i 've never felt it this good so i could n't stop 
 i came right as he turned the corner frozen like a deer in headlights 
 he quickly turned the corner and proceeded to tell everyone 
 my life is over i 'm so embarrassed 
 and to top it off my dick is on fire 
 tl dr my grandpa watched me fuck the couch <unk> for the shitty grammar 
 <unk> front page 
 about 2 months ago i starting having what i described as heart <unk> '' 
 i saw a doctor and he said it was probably an arrhythmia and probably nothing to be concerned about 
 i 'm 34 fit eat healthy and this just happens occasionally 
 he said that he had had them himself recently from drinking too much according to him : anyway today i 'm in bali 
 i wake up this morning go to yoga eat breakfast and then start cycling to ubud 
 as i normally do when cycling in an unknown place i put my phone on voice guided directions and stick it in my shirt pocket upside-down so that i can actually hear the directions 
 very quickly i notice that there 's this new feature '' or perhaps i accidentally turned it on somehow but i ca n't find a setting for it now -- whenever you 're supposed to turn it <unk> at the same time : turn left & lt bzzzz bzzzz & gt '' 
 i immediately thought it was annoying primarily because of how i was holding the phone 
 so i 'm cycling it 's fairly hot out <unk> i 'm in direct <unk> going up somewhat steep hills and have a maybe <unk> backpack on that 's also strapped fairly tight across my chest 
 i approach an intersection and my phone gets confused as it sometimes does : turn left 
 turn right 
 turn left 
 turn right '' 
 with each of these instructions now comes a bzzzz bzzzz '' 
 my phone starts vibrating for at least 5 seconds non-stop right above my heart 
 i feel my heart <unk> and then nothing 
 and that 's how i died today in the middle of the road in bali 
 # # # # # <unk> i 'm obviously not dead 
 i got insanely lucky -- just behind me on a <unk> was an australian doctor 
 she performed cpr and later told me what happened 
 she said she thought my heart stopped for about a minute 
 she helped me to the side of the road and i had about 10 locals around me giving me water and candy 
 one of them was a taxi driver who very kindly drove me the rest of the way to ubud for free 
 i think i 'm okay now though i 'm going to a clinic shortly i 've just been sitting in a starbucks for the last hour because they have <unk> unlike everywhere else 
 and i have a date tomorrow night with a really cute doctor : <unk> dr__ -- heat + cycling + hills + backpack + arrhythmia + phone vibrating like crazy just above my heart = me dead <unk> : ^^i 'm <unk> ^^a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ^^if ^^my ^^phone <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ^^i <unk> ^^it <unk> <unk> ^^if ^^it <unk> <unk> ^^a <unk> out my sim card because my phone was having problems with some updates so i figured i 'd take it out and put it back in and maybe then the updates would start 
 well i did all of this in the kitchen and in between taking it out and putting it back in i spotted some larry the cable guy chips 
 now if you 've ever had them you know those shits are delicious and very bad for you i needed some right then 
 sim card is in one hand reach in for the chips with the other my mind is no longer on the sim and i then transfer the chips to my <unk> hand without thinking about it toss them into my mouth and eat them 
 soon after when getting back to my update the sim card was <unk> did n't <unk> just ate my fucking sim card 
 goddamn you larry 
 goddamn you 
 i do n't know what to do now 
 i had phone numbers on there 
 *edit 
 found most of my numbers backed up in my google contacts so i 've got that going for me which is nice hello 
 yes this is liver 
 i have your sim hostage 
 <unk> i 'm an idiot i meant intestines edit 3* it was a <unk> sim not the bigger one 
 edit <unk> thanks for the gold kind stranger my wife and i had a minor argument last night so i figured i 'd start the day on a positive note 
 get some cleaning done <unk> up around the house make everything extra nice while she <unk> 
 among other things that needed cleaning we had several sex toys silicone dildos that we 'd neglected to attend to 
 wanting to be thorough i brought these downstairs set them in a small pot of water to boil element on max setting and headed upstairs for a moment to call my dad and wish him well 
 quick convo with my dad turns into an involved talk with mom and dad and about 15-20 minutes later suddenly my smoke alarm is loudly going off 
 having completely forgotten about the dildo boil i casually get up and prepare to disarm the false alarm '' taking place in my house ... until a huge <unk> of black <unk> smoke winds its way around the bedroom door 
 i immediately think what in the ever living hell is burning '' and at the same time hear my wife scream & amp lt my name & gt what the fuck 
 i rush downstairs into a kitchen billowing disgusting black smoke and see a massive <unk> of flame exploding upwards out of the tiny pot which by now has been boiling dry for probably a few minutes 
 wife is panicky trying to activate the luckily right at hand fire extinguisher failing with it hands it to me and i finally manage to blast the <unk> dildo blaze with the entire contents of the extinguisher 
 set the scene for you ... entire house is <unk> in a disgusting probably highly toxic smog of burnt silicone with tiny pieces of chemical <unk> over everything in the kitchen ... i put on two surgical masks and run upstairs to open the windows -- dumb move in retrospect could 've passed out up there and totally died -- but at least this <unk> everything in our upstairs being ruined by dildo smog 
 tl dr : tried to helpfully clean '' by <unk> some sex toys turned them into a roaring <unk> blaze spewing chemical toxins 
 update 1 : placed on my back porch the charred remains of the two dildos and partially melted <unk> which by the way appears to have thrown <unk> <unk> metal over various parts of the kitchen when i <unk> it 
 probably a squirrel picked one of these barely recognizable sex toys and moved it a few feet at which point it discarded it 
 not the <unk> thing they 've ever tasted i 'm sure ... update 2 : wowzers 
 2500+ upvotes 
 thanks redditors 
 glad something positive came out of the <unk> of smog 
 update 3 : unreal 
 story <unk> via the men 's room '' at 5pm on <unk> 6th <unk> <unk> <unk> seattle 
 update 4 : <unk> ... apparently a lot of people enjoyed this story because it 's since been <unk> on vice <unk> and <unk> among others as well as various radio stations across the us and <unk> this just happened and my face is still red 
 mcdonalds as some of you may know is doing this pay it with love '' promotion 
 my girlfriend and her son came to have lunch with me and the only real kid friendly place near work is mcdonalds while ordering the cashier says you can pay this with love you can give a hug or high five blow a kiss '' 
 so i turn to my right with the intent to hug my girlfriend as i do i reach one hand to give her butt a playful grab while my left hand goes out to a guy standing there to give him a high-five 
 it 's then i realized my girlfriend was standing on my left and i was just hugging and placing my hand on a strange woman 's backside all while trying to get a slap hand from her husband 
 the couple looked to be in their 50 's or 60 's 
 what made it worse was not only did the husband start to go for the high-five and stop but when i realized my mistake and tried to correct to hug my girlfriend she <unk> too out of pure awkwardness making me out to look like some weird fast food <unk> ... i will be paying with cash '' from now on 
 *edit 
 holy cow gold 
 thanks 
 and i though the only thing i was gaining from this was free artery <unk> food and the memory of <unk> that round <unk> was cycling home from work a couple of years back was wearing lycra <unk> length bib shorts and it was raining + bloody cold around a mile from home i was <unk> for a piss so decided as i was soaking wet it would n't matter if i pissed myself as i was going to wash the kit anyway in my mind i though that it would just soak into the material could n't fucking believe it when it just started <unk> out of me straight through the lycra absolutely no resistance at all sadly i was cycling past a full bus stop i can still see the look of <unk> on people 's faces as i <unk> '' by 
 happened some years ago 
 posted this comment in askreddit and people seemed to enjoy my shame so i thought i would share here 
 tl dr. pissed my self while cycling produced a golden arc instead of it soaking into my clothes like my mind told me would happen 
 update : considering the content of my tifu i thought it would be fitting for me to shower you with gold night all glad you enjoyed my shame : update : /u/thegreaterof2evils comment has made my face hurt pure genius ... : d update : 7 hours later and i am still bursting into <unk> fits of laughter /u/thegreaterof2evils has officially broken <unk> is one of the seven deadly <unk> 
 i run a fashion blog which in itself should let you know just how vain i am 
 today i thought i looked pretty cute in my tastefully <unk> <unk> patterns and leather boots 
 i thought <unk> i should take some photos after work for my <unk> i’d started my period this morning with some light <unk> so i just decided a regular tampon would do the trick with a panty <unk> for good measure 
 cut to just around lunchtime when i’m thinking of the delicious salad waiting for me in the break room fridge 
 that’s when i start to feel <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 just when i was about to get up to go change my tampon i felt a gigantic rush flow out of me 
 a crimson tide if you will 
 blood covered the insides of my thighs soaking through my leggings 
 i leapt out of my seat and walked through the office convinced i was covered in blood 
 through some sheer miracle i hadn’t bled through the back of my skirt and because my leggings are black no one saw the blood seeping down my legs 
 i tore down my leggings managing to get blood all over the toilet seat in the process and splattering blood spots along the stall wall 
 it was like a fucking <unk> episode 
 i packed my <unk> <unk> with toilet paper the best i could sprayed down the toilet seat with <unk> and wiped off the blood and charged out of the bathroom and to my car 
 i keep trash bags in my glove compartment just in case so i used those as a barrier for my butt and drove my red ass to walmart for some giant <unk> new underwear and a change of leggings 
 luckily i didn’t leave a blood trail all over walmart but really would that have been so out of place 
 and managed to get everything i needed then changed in the bathroom 
 it was all over 
 so i took some deep breaths and a <unk> and went back to work 
 just as i was about to enjoy my salad i knocked the damn thing over and spilled <unk> dressing all over the front of my skirt 
 **tl dr : <unk> god with my vanity paid for it in blood and salad dressing 
 ** **edit** : holy shit front page 
 amazing 
 thanks for making this crappy day a bit better reddit 
 i love seeing how weirded out and confused all the dudes are 
 for everyone asking to see my blog no way you loonies 
 this is a throwaway for a reason 
 **edit 2 : ** sorry for calling you loonies 
 <unk> goes against the <unk> of <unk> technically happened yesterday ... but you know i am calling close enough 
 also to elaborate on the title i am female 
 i woke up at what i thought was just ten at night 
 feeling anxious i took an ambien 
 what i did not know was that it was in fact five in the morning 
 this was due to lag on a seven year-old phone i had to <unk> after my brand new iphone fell in the toilet 
 i always go for a quick morning run at six 
 which i got up and did as per my routine 
 as i was running i realized that something about my <unk> was not quite right 
 i turned around on a street i do not normally run on to return to my apartment 
 at which point i hit a patch of <unk> <unk> due to construction and completely eat shit 
 i thought that i was fine just a couple scrapes 
 i run to the closest place open at that time of day to clean up 
 i realize that i am covered in <unk> of blood my shoulder and knee are torn up ... and my chin is literally split open 
 when i run home to my girlfriend i wake her up to check out the wound 
 she becomes alarmed and sends a picture of the gash to her mother who works in the medical field 
 i ended up at the er for stitches 
 tl dr - went for a run on ambien 
 got 7 stitches 
 yes i fucked up.so i am a type 1 diabetic 
 i take insulin before eating meals since it take 15 minutes to start working 
 earlier i took insulin and placed some leftovers in the microwave for 2 minutes 
 i then proceeded to start a game of league thinking i could eat while i played 
 30 minutes into the game i start feeling light headed 
 but since we were about to win i ignored the feeling and kept playing 
 as the game was coming to a close i could barely keep my eyes open which is when it dawns on me that i am about to pass out due to low blood sugar 
 with no one else home and too tired to walk i got on my hands and knees and started to crawl towards the kitchen 
 i get to the kitchen and since i do n't have enough energy to reach the microwave i open the fridge and on bottom shelf grab an old container of orange juice 
 despite the orange juice being old i started chugging until my sugar level came up enough for me to stand again 
 i almost died but at least my team won i meant to post this yesterday 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- i am a high schooler and we have a weekly test in <unk> 
 the person with the highest score on this test gets to bring in a board game of <unk> choice to play with whomever they like during class on a day chosen by the teacher 
 anyways it was my day 
 i have always been a huge fan of the game 'jenga 
 the game of falling towers 
 so i chose to bring this game to school on my designated day 
 <unk> my teacher tells me my day will be tomorrow due to her being absent wednesday 
 i thank her and finish my work 
 <unk> without thinking i walk into the classroom with 'jenga 
 on 9/11 ... i 'm <unk> 
 so i 'm 16 living in new zealand ready to do my level 1 history exam 
 i 'm not too great at it so i decide to study 
 i want to get a <unk> & gt 80 % so i actually put a decent amount of time into it at least 12 hours over the course of the week 
 finally it 's the day of the exam 
 tension is high i 'm nervous but i 'm prepared 
 miss long - 50 something year old asian woman who aged worse than john <unk> kinda looks like a japanese <unk> - starts calling the student codes 
 for some reason i do n't hear my code get called so i quickly ask the teacher if they accidentally missed me out 
 somehow my code was n't on the sheet so i run to the office at this point the exam has <unk> minutes until it begins to see if anyone there knows what happened 
 <unk> - office lady weird obsession with orange objects - tells me that they do n't have any record of me being <unk> in level 1 history 
 that 's when it hits me 
 i did n't take history this year i took it last year 
 i have an accounting exam 
 in a different building 
 which i have n't studied for 
 throughout the entire accounting exam i 'm wondering whether i have early <unk> dementia or have a second personality that 's a history <unk> 
 tl dr - i studied for an exam in a subject that i did n't take this year and probably failed my accounting exam because of <unk> : for those interested i got 44 pms in the past 24 hours 
 a lot were really weird and rude but most were pretty nice people who just want to see me naked 
 we shall see 
 i am a freshman at big state university and decided that since this is the first time i 'm going to live on my own i should buy a celebratory dildo 
 i 've wanted a dildo for a few years but my parents are uber religious and conservative and with my mom <unk> through my stuff at home there was no way i could have hidden it when i was in high school 
 i moved into the <unk> a few days ago and ordered this last night 
 i have an amazon account and my dad has an amazon account 
 unfortunately because i set both of them up my dad is pretty computer illiterate they both say hello katie '' at the top of the page when you log in 
 when buying the dildo i did n't bother to check that it was my account before i made the purchase 
 i guess my dad was using my laptop before i left for school 
 after dinner yesterday i got a call from my parents 
 let me set the scene 
 i 'm on my futon when i get the call 
 hey mom and dad whats up '' 
 my extremely conservative three times a week church going parents are on their speaker phone 
 katie we just got an email from amazon confirming your hundred dollar sex toy '' 
 my stomach dropped right out through my asshole 
 this was <unk> 
 there was this horrible silence on the line as i was trying to process what was happening 
 i kinda rationalized that i was going to get yelled so i squeaked out i 'm sorry '' 
 what followed was not a yelling or shouting 
 i wish my parents had been mad at me 
 instead of being yelled at i experienced a half hour of my parents talking about the benefits of masturbation and why it is healthy and how they started masturbating and how they like to do it now 
 since i 'm interested in exploring my body they said i can come to them any time for help or advice 
 i do n't want to sound ungrateful 
 i 'm glad my parents were cool with the dildo 
 the fuck up was when i got to find out in explicit detail how my parents masturbate 
 final update : i bought a dildo my parents found out because it was on their account and they called me about it 
 we had a really awkward conversation where they said it was ok to masturbate and some people like to watch porn when they do it but you need to be safe with which sites you visit or you 'll get a computer virus 
 i was flooded with pms stating that my parents wanted to have sex with me they must be in a <unk> relationship etc 
 it was fucked up 
 i was a little mad but i remember that this is the internet 
 people are weird on the internet so i played along 
 i 'm not going to have sex with my parents my dad does n't want me to have random sex with black dudes 
 the edit and updates were generally invented as a screw you to the weirdos who pmed me 
 the comments have been spectacularly hilarious 
 the second part of the fuck up did actually happen today and i still have that sick feeling of embarrassment in the pit of my stomach 
 little background on the situation im a first year in university and last year when i was applying and getting interviews for various uni 's 
 i went for an interview at st andrews university and met this really nice girl on it 
 she was also hot as hell like at least a <unk> on a bad day 
 as per usual on these interview days you find a group and stick with it for the day this girl and i made the same friends and so we spent the day together talking about nerves etc we just generally really hit it off 
 important to note at this point i had an unconditional for another university but wanted the interview experience anyway hence my attendance at st andrews 
 cue the end of the day and me and this girl walk to our cars hug and say goodbye just as i turn around and go to walk away she says : wait do you want my number you know so we can like study or whatever if we end up on this course '' me : nah im not gon na be on this course anyway i already got my unconditional '' her oh ok ... bye then '' and thats it i head on my way thinking nothing of it get in my car and drive home 
 its only later when i am talking to a friend about the events of the day it hits me 
 fuck 
 i cant believe how <unk> retarded i was i had a shot she was amazing and i blew it 
 summer comes and goes and i forget about the whole ordeal until this semester 
 i show up for my history <unk> in a uni at the other side of the country and who is sitting there but the stunning blonde who i shot down without a second thought 
 commence the search on facebook to determine her relationship status 
 helpfully or not she doesnt have facebook so i 'm shooting in the dark here 
 long story short it takes a while for me to work out the courage to ask her out and on the last day with little chance of seeing her again as i will not be continuing with history i finally do so 
 me yo so do you like want to go for drinks sometime or something '' 
 her just me and you '' 
 me yeah '' her oh i have a boy friend now '' me : system error ah fuck i mean shit i mean oh sorry i did n't realize i 'll see you later then ... wait no i mean i wont but i 'll talk to you late ... wait no 
 yeah ok im going to leave now goodbye '' 
 and thats when i walk away face getting redder by the second 
 tl dr i 'm oblivious as fuck the universe throws me a second chance but im to late and then insert <unk> <unk> levels of english from there on in 
 me fail english that <unk> '' edit : still cant english specifically with the words shot '' and short '' this fuck up happened last night and in hindsight it is the dumbest string of events i have ever done 
 i was at a friends house let 's call him steve-o to celebrate the bank holiday we have here in the uk when we all decide there 's five of us in total to go out into the garden to smoke some weed 
 we all smoke and drink until we 're all nicely stoned us being seventeen we all live with our parents so it really should n't have come as a surprise to us when steve-o 's dad comes out into the garden to see what were up to 
 once he figures out what were doing he goes into a fit of rage screaming at the lot of us about how this shit is illegal i 'm phoning your parents <unk> '' 
 and how he 'll make sure were 're all arrested for our behavior '' 
 after about ten to fifteen minutes of steve-o 's dad screaming in our faces i do the absolute dumbest thing i have ever done to life 
 i take another drag of the joint offer it to steve-o 's dad and <unk> toke '' 
 i 've become a legend according to my friends but i 'm now grounded from now to end of the summer holiday and knowing my mum she is probably going to send me to <unk> 
 tl dr offered my friends dad a joint and now i 'm probably going to prison 
 edit : this is my first post on reddit and i 'm really glad to see people either calling me a <unk> or a legend 
 thanks guys you 've made my bank holiday weekend : edit 2 : reddit gold 
 now you are the true legend kind <unk> this throwaway to tell this for obvious reasons 
 yesterday i decided to spice things up with my wife so i went to the kitchen got cream and back to the dark room i started to pour it on her breasts and lick it off 
 i thought it tasted a bit weird but i was horny i did n't care 
 when we turned the lights on we saw the cream was all <unk> of <unk> 
 i 've been shitting since i woke up 
 literally happened 10 minutes ago 
 i was watching the video that 's currently at the top of <unk> entitled a black man 's view that goes against the grain of pop culture 
 logic versus racism '' 
 i was also texting my brother 
 my <unk> sometimes get sweaty will become relevant 
 the guy in the video was making some amazing points a wonderful reprieve from the <unk> of ignorance on facebook 
 at certain points in the video i would say yes 
 good point '' 
 my excitement built up into a crescendo when i finally gestured with both hands towards the screen and said thank you for- '' and then my phone slipped from my hands hit the screen of my laptop and busted it 
 i sat in awe of my own idiocy and then made this post 
 photo for proof : edit : i am not a smart man but y'all are some equally hilarious motherfuckers 
 thanks so much to all who have been giving me info on how to replace my screen 
 not using a throwaway because fuck it ... pics i 've lived in europe for the last three years and have n't been to one of my favorite stores ever since i moved 
 well one week into being in the states i 'm walking through target holding a basket by the holes on the side rather than the handle 
 imagine the basket as a comically oversized set of <unk> brass <unk> 
 i try to slip my fingers out of the holes to grab something off a shelf and they wont come out 
 eventually i get my pointer and ring finger out but my middle finger is still stuck 
 so my wife goes and gets a cart not really believing me that my hand is stuck and i walk around trying to nonchalantly get my finger out of the basket which is now sitting in the cart 
 my wife gets me some <unk> lotion from the makeup section and puts it on my finger 
 still wo n't budge 
 i get another idea and we go over to the <unk> <unk> section and we pop open a small pack of baby oil 
 my finger is good and <unk> by it still will not come out 
 at this point my finger is starting to turn blue and fat from constantly struggling to get out 
 at this point i 'm starting to give up on the idea of escaping this finger trap silently and i get the attention of a passing loss prevention officer 
 i go over all the things i tried and he <unk> using some vaseline 
 so he 's over here being a real bro and <unk> my finger with vaseline 
 if i did n't need his help so badly i would have closed my eyes and licked my lips while he was rubbing vaseline up and down my finger to be funny ... anyway my finger still will not come loose 
 so he tries to get a manager on the radio and it takes a long time for him to get to us 
 in the meantime people are starting to notice what 's going on with me and yeah people are openly laughing 
 the manager finally shows up and suggests we call the fire department i was really hoping it would n't come to this but it did 
 i ask if there 's somewhere i can sit where i wont be such a spectacle and i get seated between the starbucks area and <unk> and sit on a bench trying my best to pretend i 'm just holding the basket when people walk by 
 eventually the fire department arrives and they have to use medical scissors to cut all the rings around my finger to get me loose 
 they then cut one line through the ring my finger is in and i 'm able to pull the whole thing apart with my hand 
 my finger hurts and i love target so i 'm going to have to face these people who know what a stupid man-child i am constantly 
 tl dr local 27 year old man gets finger stuck in target basket has to be cut out by fire dept 
 someone stole my <unk> poptart when i went to the bathroom 
 what kind of asshole <unk> another mans poptart 
 edit : i just noticed that cool gold thing 
 thanks kind stranger there 's a girl from my high school who i am very good friends with and was pretty cute in my opinion 
 we both had a passion for soccer and also had a few classes together 
 naturally as we began to hang out more and more throughout the year i began to like her very much 
 fast forward to the end of the year 
 our school had a last chance dance and we both went 
 we danced together for the night and overall had a great time 
 when it finally ended unfortunately we began talking outside near her car in the parking lot 
 it was just small talk mainly unconscious yelling due to the extremely loud music and eventually we began to talk about how great the last chance dance was 
 i told her that she was n't too bad at dancing and then she replied with oh you do n't even know '' 
 obviously i asked her what she meant and she said do n't worry about it '' 
 changing the subject she then proceeded to tell me about how she got new seats in her car and was wondering if i wanted to help break them in '' 
 not sure what i was thinking for this next part 
 this hint went completely over my head and i gave her a high five 
 what 
 the 
 fuck 
 a high five 
 she then smiled a little <unk> another detail i failed to notice gave me a hug said our goodbyes and then got in her car and left 
 as her car disappeared it hit me 
 i just cockblocked myself 
 tl dr my crush asked to have fun in her back seat after a school dance and i gave her a high five 
 update : i called her up and asked her to get coffee and maybe go to a local scenic spot in my area 
 keep in mind this spot is <unk> for hooking up and such because of its emptiness and scenic views 
 so i picked her up and we soon hit it off just like before 
 it got pretty late and we were just chilling at the parking lot and the topic came toward the last time we saw each other the time where i cockblocked myself like a handicapped retard 
 <unk> a technique i picked up from r/seduction i cut her off during her sentence by saying wait '' 
 and then i kissed her 
 things began to escalate and i 'll keep the details to myself 
 afterwards she told me with a smile that i was an asshole for not fixing the problem earlier 
 thanks guys and r/seduction coming in clutch 
 never again i promise 
 just kidding knowing me it 'll probably happen next time 
 due to some <unk> genetics from my dads side i have quite a hairy ass and lately its been getting on my nerves so i decided to take action 
 after having some less than <unk> experiences with waxing and not wanting to put up with scratchy stubble between my cheeks i decided to burn it off 
 so with lighter in hand i went into my room and sat down infront of the mirror and looked for a spot to start 
 not wanting to go too fast i began with a couple of spots on my cheeks so far so good everything looks pretty smooth i 'm feeling confident so i go for a patch on my taint big mistake 
 the fire <unk> up my crack and set <unk> to a patch of hair under my balls and stayed there i jumped backwards and frantically tried to pat the fire out and managed to escape with only scotch marks to my balls 
 it 's been 5 hours and my ass has only just <unk> hurting but the smell of burnt hair is still strong in my <unk> to give some backstory before my big fuck up.. i had organized my first date with this girl i had been talking to for quite some time 
 the plan was to cook and invite her for dinner and afterwards take her to see one of our mutual favorite <unk> 
 but before the date after checking my genital area i decided it 'd be smart to make sure they 'd be <unk> in case anything were to happen afterwards 
 so i sat over the toilet grabbed some trimmers and went off on my bush like i was <unk> <unk> or some shit 
 at the end of the cut there was a mound of pubes sitting neatly in the toilet 
 i pulled on the flusher closed the toilet lid and jumped in the shower to clean myself off and get ready for her to come over 
 half an hour later she enters we exchange greetings and the dates off 
 date goes <unk> and we click <unk> 
 midway through the dinner she asks if she could use the bathroom and i kindly point it out to her 
 down the hall on the left '' 
 however once she stepped out of the bathroom something changed 
 it suddenly became harder to keep a conversation she seemed increasingly uncomfortable and a sense of awkwardness hung over the rest of the meal 
 confused at what happened i excuse myself from the table and head to use the bathroom 
 when i lift the toilet seat lo and behold sitting right dab in the middle of the toilet bowl i 'm greeted by that neat pile of pubes i had cut earlier 
 of all the nights my toilet decided it 'd be best to break on the night of my date with a girl i had been pursuing for weeks 
 i head back to the table get on with the rest of the date and never bring up a word of that clump 
 fml 
 tldr trimmed my pubes over the toilet toilet broke date was met with a pleasant surprise 
 edit : ca n't believe this blew up overnight and i 'm glad you guys are enjoying this tifu 
 this is my first reddit post so i 've been leaving replies to the comments to give an update on the rest of the night but it seems like it just gets lost so i 'll leave it here 
 rest of the night went a lot better than i had expected 
 we had a couple drinks over the course of the night which <unk> out the mood 
 on her way out we kissed and she was off 
 we 're still talking today so if any of you guys are having trouble keeping a girl interested the secret might be to just leave some pubes in the toilet 
 edit : <unk> to the kind stranger who sent a gold my way thank you 
 may toilet pubes always be absent or present depending on your preference in your life 
 i 'll make this short and to the point : <unk> gave me a gaming chair with speakers on the <unk> and bluetooth <unk> -i invited family over to finish christmas leftovers <unk> showing off my new gaming chair by playing music off my phone <unk> goes by <unk> last minute christmas gifts are exchanged -i put on a family friendly movie for the kids and parents to watch and tell my wife i 'm gon na take a quick shower - ... - ... - ... -my natural urges take over and i decide to relieve some stress '' so i throw on one of my favorite compilation videos to make it quick 
 i had the water running and i could n't hear the porn i figured it was shitty sound quality of the video so i turned it up to full volume ... nothing 
 so whatever i release the dragon and continue my shower and decide to put some <unk> on just found this awesome band called rings of <unk> '' 
 now i know something is wrong because the music is fairly loud ... that 's when it hit me like a <unk> train ... i 'm still connected to the chair 
 i went to the settings please have bluetooth off on 
 and <unk> 
 -i begged for the sweet release of death to take me ... oh but he never answered ... i felt heavy pressure on my chest and stayed in the shower for much longer than i needed to ... eventually i said fuck it '' just go out as if nothing happened they do n't know that you know that they just heard you 're spanking the monkey '' and that 's exactly what i did ... as is tradition this fuck up did n't happen today it happened almost 4 years ago to the date 
 i was reminded it of it after reading a few other military related posts and got the same feeling in my stomach just thinking about it as i did when it actually occurred 
 sorry for the length 
 a little back story : i was deployed to <unk> in 2010 to 2011 with the army and as the new guy in the unit i was always stuck in the gunners seat of our platoon sergeant 's truck because it was off track and would n't stay facing a certain direction unless i held it there 
 i ended up being a good gunner so even after it was finally fixed i was allowed to stay on the gun 
 fast forward to may of 2011 and we are pushing out on a very important mission of extending the green zone of our area of operations <unk> 
 so important that the commander and sergeant major of our task force showed up at our joint security station jss to <unk> the 2 day mission 
 for this mission we switched the .50 cal on our truck with a mark 19 which is fires a 40mm grenade automatically 
 pretty sure the first time i fired it in combat i <unk> all over myself as i watched grenade after grenade shoot out of the weapon and blow up on all over a mountain side we were taking fire from 
 it was glorious 
 now to load a mark 19 is a little tricky 
 it fires from the open bolt position which you pull back using two handles located on the side of the launcher itself and it actually grabs a grenade and holds it in the open position until you push the trigger down throwing the grenade forward dropping the shell <unk> out the bottom grabbing another grenade 
 the feeder paws on top of the launcher feed grenade after grenade onto the bolt face <unk> the process over and over 
 to load it you put the grenades on the feed tray one away from where the bolt would catch the grenade pull the handles back until you hear a click sound which <unk> the bolt is locked in the open position pull the trigger which slams the bolt forward in a blank fire 
 we call that the ghost round '' 
 now you have a grenade on the bolt face 
 you charge the weapon one more time and you 're ready to rock and roll 
 as we were leaving the jss i began to load the mark 19. we were expecting heavy contact so instead of leaving the weapon with a ghost round loaded i was instructed to get a round in the chamber and put the weapon on safe 
 this is where the fuck up starts 
 i began putting the grenades on the feeder tray careful to ensure that the ghost round was in the chamber 
 i began trying to pull the bolt back but it would not lock in the open position 
 instead i would pull it back and it would n't click into place 
 i would literally pull the bolt back and it would just slam forward like a shitty game of tug of war 
 i continue to try and fuck with the bolt pulling it back over and over again to no avail 
 everybody in the truck is talking shit to me even the truck behind me gets on the radio and asks if i need a man up there to load the gun for me 
 i flip them off and continue to fuck with the gun 
 my psg platoon sergeant calls up to me and asks if i got the gun up yet 
 as soon as he starts talking i hear the bolt click into place 
 fucking about time '' 
 i thought 
 i told my psg that i had the ghost round <unk> and he yelled at me to get a round on the bolt face and to hurry the fuck up 
 without even thinking i aim in the general vicinity of the jss where my company <unk> company first sergeant task force commander and task force <unk> are all huddled in our <unk> over a map and push the trigger down 
 thump thump thump '' 
 fuck 
 i watched in complete and absolute horror as three 40mm grenades jump out of my weapons <unk> and spin their way directly towards the jss 
 <unk> '' 
 their <unk> echo throughout the entire <unk> and our radios fucking <unk> : where the fuck did that come from '' 
 were those <unk> '' 
 are you fucking kidding me we 're 2 minutes out the gate and we 're getting shot at '' 
 where the fuck did that land '' 
 my truck 
 complete fucking silence 
 you could have heard a mouse fart if it was n't for the sound of my butt hole <unk> up and my knees clanking together 
 my stomach had literally dropped to the floor my <unk> was <unk> my <unk> and i was just holding onto the mark so tight my knuckles were as white as michael jackson 
 my psg looks up at me and goes you 're so fucked '' 
 he gets over the radio and explains to everyone that i had <unk> 'd negligent discharged the mark 19 and then it was really fucking quiet over the radio 
 i 'm still shaking like i 'm fucking <unk> ali and then the radio <unk> with the voice of my 1st <unk> 
 we 're going to have a fucking talk about this when you fuckers return 
 those rounds landed 50 meters outside the j ... <unk> mike '' 
 we never got shot at that day either 
 i figured my only hope at not losing my rank gunner position or any <unk> gained would be to perform surgery on the taliban via the mark 19 but i never got that chance 
 it was n't until our <unk> did we take minimal contact and it was when i was n't even on the gun and my psg 's radio guy got the kill 
 we returned to base and i began doing the michael <unk> fox dance all over again 
 we ended up completely pulling apart that gun to find that two small somewhat important <unk> were bent just enough to cause the gun to not click back into place properly which saved me from any sort of trouble but for 2 weeks i walked around scared completely fucking shit less 
 tl dr : i tried loading my grenade launcher to kill taliban instead almost killed my chain of command 
 edit # 1 : had to fix a few lines and grammar 
 update # 1 : jesus i never thought this would blow up like it did 
 pun intended 
 thanks for all the comments and upvotes i 'll try and answer some today 
 anyways to answer some of the more frequent comments : yes i know about gun safety 
 i know that you should never point any weapon whether it 's a <unk> gun or a 40mm grenade launcher at anything you do n't intend on killing 
 believe me my internal chain of command made sure i knew of my fuck up 
 as far was what happened after we were stuck at the j on a <unk> of security and <unk> so we did n't get back to our larger base for another 2 weeks hence why i shat bricks for 2 weeks after the fact 
 by the time i got back to the j the bigger brass had left the j so i was left to my chain of command 
 again i could n't have asked for a better <unk> but they made sure that the burning of shit and obscure jobs landed on my shoulders 
 after the complete pmcs the weapon was sent to the <unk> where another pmcs was done 
 i did a few sworn statements and that was the last i heard of it 
 okay a lot of you are wondering about why i was <unk> at the jss 
 well as we left the j we took a <unk> road out of the j that led us to a heavily populated bazaar 
 i was the second truck so the first truck covered the 12 o'clock i was told to cover the 10 to 8 because after the bazaar was a lot of dead space meaning spots we ca n't see which the <unk> is best suited for since it <unk> grenades 
 plus to the right was a <unk> populated village and we felt better about pointing a .50 cal over there instead of a grenade launcher 
 the shit storm i would have been in would have been a million times worse if those grenades landed anywhere near <unk> 
 the outcome could have been the same but if any sort of news outlet back home caught wind of it i 'd be in jail 
 when there 's a long line of customers and it 's busy you look but do n't really take in faces as such 
 so when the group of 6 came in i handed out 5 adult <unk> and a child 's menu and a pack of <unk> to the little one and everything was great 
 until the little one was quite clearly a 45 year old lady who was not looking impressed and neither is the partner 
 the family on the whole was looking not impressed 
 i of course wanted to roll up into a little ball and die there on the spot immediately and thank fuck i did n't bring up the high chair edit : thanks for the gold 
 a couple nights ago i went to a party and since i do n't have my driver 's license yet my mom had to drive me there 
 the whole car ride to my friend 's house she lectured me about not drinking and not doing drugs and whatnot 
 i patiently waited silently through the whole speech and as soon as we pulled up i <unk> out of the car and ran inside 
 fast forward several hours later 
 the party is ending 
 i have not followed my mom 's instructions like a good little boy and i am really really drunk 
 i 'm leaving and walking down the driveway about to call my mom to pick me up when one of my friends calls out my name 
 he 's <unk> his car and several others are piling into the rear seats 
 all of them are drunk as balls and even though my cognitive abilities are not at full strength i have the brains to decline and continue walking 
 i 'm walking down the sidewalk waiting for my mom to pick up her phone i hear the start of an engine behind me 
 i ignore it and keep walking 
 several seconds later i hear tires screech and think <unk> i hope they do n't die on the way home '' 
 a second after that the car hits me 
 i wake up later in a hospital room and according to the doctor i 've broken my wrist hip both legs and a couple ribs 
 **tl dr** i choose not to get into a car driven by an intoxicated friend get run over by the same car moments later 
 **edit : ** to answer some of the questions people have uh here i go 
 my friend who was in that car did not crash 
 fml 
 he did get a dui though 
 apparently the cops pulled him over later 
 not sure about felony dui or whatever 
 i can type with one hand 
 my parents were n't too pissed they were just sort of disappointed but mostly glad i 'm okay 
 i 'm a forgiving type of guy but damn 
 i probably wo n't be seeing my uh friend for a while so i dunno whats going to happen with him 
 also i have no idea why i do n't have head injuries or <unk> cord injuries 
 i got lucky i guess 
 or not lucky but luckier than really not lucky 
 **edit 2 : ** formatting maybe i should have made the title tifu by making the <unk> right <unk> work from home and sometimes after long hours of sitting on a chair <unk> of my desktop i feel sore 
 one of the many ways i found to compensate from all the <unk> is to squat sit on my chair and continue working 
 when you squat sit you can support your elbows with your knees and i find it stretches my lower back too so i like it 
 also one of the things that happens when you squat sit is that your butt-hole is exposed to more free space around it as compared to when the chair 's cushion is holding it shut 
 see.. when you fart sitting on a chair it takes a while for the gas to travel up to your nose 
 but if you fart while sitting in a squatted position it takes less than a second sometimes for it to travel to your nose 
 about an hour ago i came back from a heavy sushi lunch 
 i came back and decided to sit in squatted position on my chair to start working because i was feeling heavy 
 i had to sneeze and so i did 
 the first sneeze was not a big sneeze 
 it was a tiny little quarter of a sneeze 
 much like the kicking sound of an old car when you try to start it before the actual <unk> '' after the first sneeze - the second one started gaining its momentum 
 the second one was about to be one of those <unk> <unk> where you take few seconds to slowly suck the air deep in and then sneeze with all the force available in the universe 
 right after the first tiny sneeze i might have farted 
 okay now i know for a fact that i did 
 but at the time i was n't sure 
 so when the second sneeze was in its initial phase of taking in a deep breath i felt the taste of the fart in the back of my throat and the bottom of my lungs 
 gag reflex kicked in and a <unk> <unk> started travelling up from my inside 
 by the time i was about to sneeze - the <unk> sushi mucous and rice was right in my throat 
 and i finally sneezed out a hand full of puke some of which got on my keyboard and the monitor 
 and some of it went in my <unk> and up in my head 
 tl dr - smelled my fart and sneezed out puke 
 i can taste the sushi in my skull <unk> actually happened a while ago but i fucked up bad ... and its still not funny to this day 
 my family has had good luck in the wisdom teeth dept 
 my mom never had hers grow in my sister never had hers grow <unk> up until a week prior to this mine never grew <unk> all the sudden it happened and i knew i was in for a fucking nightmare recovery for a week ive had oral surgery before and im a whiny bitch about it so i get there and im nervous and i <unk> say please ... whatever i say during this dont let it leave the room '' they agree and i go <unk> remember being told to please stop talking a few <unk> other than that..they kept their word and i had no idea what i said ... oh but that is not the same story for my gf ... .she picked me up out back after i got wheeled out and this is her story of how it happened in almost exactly her words you got in the car and i offered to drive you to get a <unk> for later at which point you grabbed my breasts and started whispering the wheels on the bus go round and round round and round round and round '' and then fell asleep on my shoulder for about 2 minutes ... we hit a small bump and you woke up you thought it would be a good idea to get a new headset for xbox because yours is getting old you then said that i looked like a <unk> from <unk> right now ... <unk> then as we pulled up to the drive way you asked me to have a threesome with my younger pregnant sister and pee in her belly button because pregnant girls turn you on ... they dont idek wtf and you said you would slap her stomach like a bongo and you were <unk> kong '' 
 at this point i start to remember what is going on ... i went inside and fell asleep on the couch ... my gf was apparently pissed and told her sister what i said 
 she figured drunk words are sober thoughts '' more or less 
 so now her sister thinks im a <unk> and my gf thinks i want to fuck her sister all the time ... reddit i have <unk> of these fetishes and i have never had the urge to play a pregnant woman 's stomach like a <unk> can see how <unk> be funny in a few <unk> <unk> isnt funny now <unk> sorry for <unk> on a <unk> phone : yesterday afternoon i was just finishing my homework and ready to unwind with some mario kart 
 last time i saw the game was in my sister 's room 
 i thought she was at a friend 's house so i <unk> right in to take it back 
 i opened the door and my heart stopped 
 my sister was home after all and she <unk> having a moment with herself 
 no covers shorts down everything on display 
 she screamed like something from a horror movie and i slammed the door 
 i stood there in shock for a moment 
 are you getting dressed '' 
 i asked hoping to convince her that i did n't realize what she was doing 
 no way she 'd fall for that though 
 i very clearly got the full show an image that i fear will be burned into my brain forever 
 fuck this is my little sister 
 i 'm not supposed to see her having a hand party 
 i 've been avoiding her <unk> vital background information this happened about a year ago now 
 i was 17 and my boyfriend was 18. he lived with his mom and at the time she was in the process of moving back in with her husband whom she had been separated from 
 most of the furniture was out of the old house and nobody had any real reason to go there anymore so it did n't take long for a couple of horny teenagers to realize this was a great spot to have sex and not get caught 
 my boyfriend we 'll call him dan and i had been on a road trip that day to the mountains of nc where we had gone <unk> and swimming 
 we headed home and a few minutes of <unk> later we decided we would stop by the empty house and have some fun '' time 
 we pulled into the garage and before the garage door had even shut we were both completely naked and making out in the front seat of his car 
 dan pulled on his boxers and we decided we 'd move our <unk> into the house 
 this is my real tifu moment i decided i would n't bring any clothes into the house with me 
 i was already naked and besides no one would be stopping by 
 at this point it 's vital to know a little bit about dan 's bedroom 
 it was built on to the side of the house a few years earlier and includes a side door that opens onto a little deck 
 the only furniture left in his room consisted of a bed frame and mattress no sheets covers or blankets of any kind and an entertainment center 
 so we continue our fun on the bed him finishing pretty quickly and as i 'm just reaching the <unk> we hear the most <unk> awful noise 
 the <unk> '' of the house 's alarm system that is warning us that someone has just walked in the front door 
 we both freeze not knowing what else to do 
 had there been blankets we would have quickly covered with them 
 had we had clothes we would have quickly dressed 
 but we had neither of these <unk> and in our realization of the audacity of the situation we could only lay there and think about how fucked we were 
 i 'm pretty sure at this point my life flashed before my eyes 
 there was a whole 15-20 seconds before the silence was broken by a shrill <unk> '' 
 and a set of angry footsteps <unk> to the door of his room 
 my coma was finally broken by the realization that if i did n't get off my ass and do something right this second dan 's mother was going to see a side of me she would probably rather not 
 i did the only thing i could do i ran out the side door and onto the deck completely naked 
 it was probably around 5 p.m. and i could hear the laughter of neighborhood children and the sound of a lawn mower in the distance as i crouched on the floor of the deck completely naked praying to whatever god there was that nobody would see me 
 it felt like an eternity but in reality about 2 minutes later i hear the door behind me <unk> open 
 i was too scared to move or talk or do anything at all 
 the sound of dan 's voice broke the silence with two words i will never forget 
 she knows '' 
 it turns out dan 's mom was so furious that the two of us were taking advantage '' of her and the empty house that she completely forgot that she had come to pick up some <unk> she had left in a drawer and stormed off to her car and drove away 
 dan and i walked to the car and dressed in uncomfortable silence 
 he took me home and stayed at his dad 's house that night 
 as luck would have it the very next evening was dan 's graduation dinner and i was seated directly across from dan 's mother 
 she did n't say a word about the incident and continued to laugh and talk with me like nothing ever happened 
 a year later dan and i are still together and that horrendous day still has n't been brought up 
 i 'm hoping it stays this <unk> least until our wedding if we ever make it that far 
 dan and i joke around about that <unk> never too much 
 that wound is still too fresh it 's still too soon 
 i think it always will be 
 edit- tl dr : my boyfriend and i decided to have some sexy time in his mom 's partially empty house left our clothes out in the car mom comes home i run outside <unk> naked 
 it has never been mentioned <unk> bathroom intermittently becomes <unk> with ants i live in australia if that <unk> anything 
 they eventually leave when the weather outside <unk> or perhaps when they realise that you ca n't eat bath products 
 i 'm a shower person but today i decided to have a bath 
 i began filling it but became impatient and hopped in when it was only half full 
 it is then that i remember that my bath has <unk> spa jets and i decide to try them out 
 i fail to notice that the jets are positioned above the <unk> of my bath 
 within three seconds my bathroom is covered in <unk> ants 
 the last ant invasion had apparently all died in the spa jet pipes 
 they were chopped and <unk> by the <unk> and were then <unk> covering my bathroom and me 
 edit : -compulsory : wow this blew up over two australian night s <unk> no pics it was n't exactly on my mind ... <unk> i am female i guess the unspoken rule of <unk> still holds true <unk> all commenting parties are male unless there is specific evidence to the contrary oops i guess it is no longer unspoken <unk> i did n't scream i just froze and whimpered for a few minutes 
 <unk> for all of your advice on <unk> the poor beasts 
 we have in the past made use of all of these <unk> and i can <unk> for their efficacy 
 since however the animals often insist on dying on our property which results in an <unk> cleanup it is often easier to let them go about their business until they choose to leave of their own <unk> 
 besides as <unk> mentioned : & gt the ants most likely stored the dead bodies in the jets opposed to <unk> dying there 
 i probably just <unk> their <unk> site and i would n't like to further offend them through mass murder.this happened saturday night 
 i was at a <unk> bar and had been going at it hard for about the last 8 hours or so 
 do n't judge 
 my girl and i went downstairs to find the bathrooms which were at the end of this long corridor 
 so i go stumbling down the corridor hang a right into what i thought was the mens room 
 down the hall a guy is approaching me and we 're doing that weird dance where you shuffle one way and the other person also shuffles that way you go back and forth etc 
 as i get closer i 'm laughing with the guy cuz the dance is ridiculous and i reach out to tap him on the shoulder and say excuse me buddy '' to him 
 my hand reaches out and hits a mirror 
 the guy i was doing the dance with was my reflection the whole time 
 worst is a staffer in the hallway saw the whole thing : staffer : uh the bathroom 's that way '' me : <unk> i 'm good '' <unk> away fml edit : after i ran from the staffer i found my gf and we promptly hopped in the photo booth at the bar : imgur edit 2 : /u/markreadsreddit did a hilarious read of this fu 
 check it out here : so today i decided to go to the casino and have a try at the <unk> <unk> <unk> pokie slot machine which has been progressively <unk> money during the past twelve months without it mega <unk> 
 it was n't until november of last year when the mega <unk> maxed out at aud $ 1m that everyone began <unk> the machines for their chance to win it 
 tonight like most other weeks on my night off i tried my hand at the machine and spent a good portion of my nights capital on it in the hopes of winning something 
 having made a small win of $ 250 and feeling kind of chuffed with myself i got up and stretched and looked out through the second story floor window at the gaming floor below 
 after a few minutes had passed a young gentleman took a seat at the machine i had just been using 
 he slipped some money in and started playing 
 a few minutes passed and i hear a loud gasp 
 i look over at him and he 's staring at me i think i got it '' 
 .. got what '' 
 i <unk> i 've just won the million dollars 
 it was at that moment i was overcome with an emotion which i had never experienced before as i went through the <unk> of what had just occurred moments before.. not knowing what else to do and seeing as nobody else had seen yet what had just transpired i took this photo 
 needless to say i am sincerely happy for this young man and i just hope he uses it <unk> 
 tl dr : was playing pokie machine got off the machine someone else sat down and won $ 1m 
 **edit** : <unk> i certainly was n't expecting so much of a response 
 if i had the ability to change the title i would because as many have been quick to point out you ca n't lose something you did n't have to begin with 
 *this happened a few years back as teenagers 
 so me and my friend agreed to help his dad at his <unk> a small patch of land where people like to grow fruit and <unk> and store porn in their <unk> it was a typical english <unk> day <unk> with light <unk> 
 after we were done pulling weeds and sweeping leaves and mud away i look over to see my friend holding on to an electricity pylon with both hands 
 on a second look i can see him shaking quite violently 
 panic and <unk> kick in 
 i am convinced i am watching my friend die in front of me from an electric shock 
 i scramble into the shed and find a thick broom 
 i sprint out with tears in my eyes coming to terms he is already dead 
 i sprint over with the broom over my head looking like <unk> at the end of <unk> and bring it crashing down on both his arms in an attempt to save him from a crispy death 
 the crack i hear is not from an electrical discharge but it 's both his arms <unk> as he <unk> to the floor calling me a cunt 
 tl dr my mate was shaking mud from his boots so i broke both his arms thinking he was receiving an electric shock from a pylon 
 edit - front page on my birthday 
 thanking you a few people calling me out on bs 
 this happened 14 years ago 
 i 'm sure i 'm not the first or last to make a similar mistake 
 i ca n't do much more to convince you this is genuine 2nd edit - sorry this did n't happen today 
 14 years ago i was still using <unk> messenger and <unk> 
 i 'm fairly new to the reddit party but i brought beer final edit : cheers for gold so this fuck up actually did happen just a few hours ago 
 it was the end of the work day 
 my work partner and i had <unk> a kitchen <unk> today 
 then between 4:30pm and 5pm as it was getting dark we had to load up <unk> of granite into the back of my bosses truck 
 they were granite counter tops that we had taken out 2 days ago and left them outside until today when we were taking them away 
 anywho we 're lifting the granite into the back of the truck 
 laying them flat 
 granite on top of granite 
 well i 'm in front my partner is in back pushing them in 
 last big piece of granite 
 we get about half of it laying down inside the truck bed 
 i still have my hand there on the front edge of the piece 
 before i could move my hand away for him to push the piece further into the truck he goes ahead and pushes it 
 queue my hand getting pushed forward with the granite 
 proceeds to slice off the tip of my finger as it catches the piece underneath the one we 're sliding 
 so <unk> is now gone to halfway down my <unk> 
 trip to the emergency room 
 <unk> up 
 given <unk> for <unk> 's and <unk> 
 now i 'm <unk> 
 ready for bed 
 <unk> ya 'll ... ... pics for evidence 
 warning : missing bloody finger tip 
 bloody missing tip wrapped up *edit* thanks for the replies guys 
 i did n't really think i would get half the comments you all have made 
 so it 's the morning after 
 i woke up around 2:30am from the pain from my finger but took a <unk> 
 was able to fall back asleep after 15 <unk> 
 the pieces of granite that did the slicing were actually two <unk> of a single counter top 
 with a cut out for the sink at the ends 
 the first half was in the truck with the sink cut out facing towards the back <unk> the truck bed gate 
 the one we were moving into the truck was going the opposite way 
 so when my buddy pushed my finger was in the sink <unk> area 
 it 's actually a pretty clean slice 
 they took x-rays and none of the bone tip is really damaged 
 but there is just a very slight fracture maybe just a couple <unk> but nothing to really worry about 
 i 'm not doing <unk> 's comp 
 i 'm technically self employed but my boss offered to take care of the hospital bill 
 but hey shit happens 
 just got ta suck it up and keep on working my fingers to the bone 
 anyone else got any tips 
 just a tip 
 you know just to see how it feels 
 *edit 2* tl dr because <unk> tells me to put this in my post 
 tifu by having sex with my wife 
 this morning i wake up and realize that the kids are sleeping in today 
 so i wake my wife up and we begin having morning sexy time out in the living room 
 as we are going at it like teenagers moaning loud <unk> of passion the not so quiet slaps of bodies <unk> the eldest child wakes up <unk> to the <unk> out in the living room and calls 911 telling the operator that daddy is hitting mommy '' 
 cue the two police cars screeching to a halt in front of our home 
 my wife and i being in the middle of great sex have no idea that the police are here until they begin beating on the front door screaming police open the door '' 
 so my wife and i hurriedly throw on whatever clothes are near us and open the door to four police officers asking me to step outside '' 
 i ask what is going on and they repeat the request while another officer walks into my house <unk> that he is performing a safety check '' 
 completely bewildered with all of this i demand to know what is going on 
 the officer finally tells me that they received a call from a child reporting a domestic abuse incident between my wife and i. as soon as he said that my wife and i turn several shades of red while we explain to the officers that the domestic abuse '' was my wife and i having <unk> relations 
 they immediately understand what happened and with huge grins suggest that we take the kids phone away if we are going to make a habit of this 
 so pretty much every post i submit here is related to my vagina 
 we fuck up a lot 
 my family owns a property in the city and i texted them all stating that i would be spending 2 days there alone just to relax do some reading walk around etc 
 the <unk> shower head at home has been broken for a few months so when i realized that the apartment had one i wept with joy 
 my dad works in the city and has a key to the apartment 
 i figured that since i told them all i was having a <unk> no one would come bother me 
 wrong 
 i 'm in the shower blasting ole reliable at the goods while letting out mini moans 
 i orgasm as i moan deeper 
 i wash up grab a towel thank god only to leave the bathroom to find my dad sitting on the couch with lunch for us as a surprise 
 i have a mild heart attack as my face burns red 
 he said nothing but his face said it all 
 there is no way he did n't hear me 
 damn you dad why do you have to be so goddamn considerate 
 so this happened wednesday night in <unk> i have been casually seeing a guy a few nights a week 
 he asked me the other day if i had any toys and if i did the next time i came to his place i should definitely bring one 
 i thought it would be fun and what could go wrong 
 as i 'm getting ready to leave for school i throw it into my purse first mistake 
 now keep in mind this is an older one from like 2002 ... you barely have to turn the end to get it to come on 
 i had every intention of leaving it in my car 
 but alas i did not 
 i get into class and throw my purse into my chair and exit back out to grab something to drink 
 get back into class and i hear a weird sound 
 my first thought was that it had to be all the routers and switches we 've set up recently 
 if you 're wondering i 'm in a computer class and we set up an internal network of 8 <unk> routers and switches 
 i do n't remember them sounding like this but maybe today i 'm just noticing it more 
 i grab my purse from my chair and then it hit me 
 my purse is the source of the sound 
 fuck fuck fuck 
 this vibrator is anything but quiet as is and <unk> it with $ 20 in change and car keys 
 i start digging through my purse in a <unk> panic trying to get it turned off before anyone noticed but it was too late for that 
 the guys in the class give me this look like they know what it is but they 're still curious if it is what they think it is 
 also i 'm sure me digging through my purse like a crazed lunatic only gave me away 
 tl dr - today i fucked up my bringing my old vibrator to class it turned on when i threw my purse into my chair 
 the sound was <unk> by change and i 'm sure everyone knew what it was.so last night i was incredibly tired but i had a dilemma 
 i was really craving some gummy bears 
 so i decided to go buy some 
 and i told myself that as soon as i got home i was going to eat my gummies in bed and go straight to sleep 
 before i go on i should say that i have this habit of whenever i get home in my room i always throw my wallet in the air and see if i can make it land directly this small tray on my dresser 
 and i 've gotten pretty accurate to 
 its not the most normal habit to have i know but it 's not dangerous 
 nothing 's close to my night stand that i could damage and my throw is always reasonably accurate 
 its just turned into a challenge for me 
 the higher i can throw it the better 
 anyway so i came home and tossed the bag of gummies and my phone onto my bed and tossed my wallet at the tray 
 only ... i did n't 
 *i tossed my wallet on bed and chucked my gummy bears and phone at my tray 
 * i was soooo tired that after seeing myself toss the wallet on the bed my body still proceeded to <unk> more throws for my gummy bears and phone across the room because the weight of the items is different they landed no where close to my tray 
 the bag of gummies just kinda glided and hit my girlfriend who was sitting at my desk on the head 
 the phone hit my tv square in the middle with a good amount of force and then bounced off the dresser and onto the hardwood face first 
 my tv <unk> after being hit so i recently moved and lost 3 of the 4 screws from the tv that held it to the base 
 so the tv was already <unk> and my phone hitting it was enough force to cause chaos and fell off the dresser onto the hardwood right on top of my phone 
 but it gets worse 
 as it was falling and the power cord yanked out of the wall it tripped u a bottle of lemonade that i had which immediately <unk> and soiled my ps4 
 my gf who had gotten up in fright from all the chaos just looked at me with big wide eyes 
 i stood their trying to process what happened 
 fortunately i had accidental insurance on my ps4 but my tv and phone are both ruined 
 i guess the moral of this story is never buy a bag of gummy bears at 1 in the morning come home and throw your wallet across your room onto a small tray 
 tl dr was super tired and accidentally thew my gummy bears and phone across my room which in turn destroyed phone ps4 and tv edit : okay so a couple of things i wanted to address 
 first off i think its really stupid how many people are <unk> calling me karma whore etc 
 check my post history 
 this is a throwaway 
 if i cared so much about internet points '' would n't i have posted this from a main account 
 it just does n't make sense to me that so many people are ready to call out me this sub etc just because the believe a post is fake 
 telling me that i must have a camera in this day and age just because everyone else does 
 i do n't frequent this sub but this is all just kinda of insane to me 
 anyway i was not gon na do anything but just to shut everyone up i will post pictures 
 my dad is coming over to take a look at my stuff and he has a camera 
 so when he comes i will take pics 
 i 'll describe physical state of things for now 
 phone is completely shattered 
 tv has what my gf calls spiders '' because that 's pretty much what they look like 
 they are large star looking cracks that cover the screen when it is turned on 
 my tv still turns on but you ca n't see anything out of it due to all the cracks 
 and lastly my ps4 does n't look to different but it now only turn on in safe mode which does n't allow you to do anything really 
 i will take a pic of everything 
 i also will take a pic of my teeth because everyone 's interested in me eating gummy bears and going right to sleep lol 
 i promise i was not high 
 lol i do n't even smoke 
 is it so weird that a grown man has a craving for gummy bears at in the middle of the night 
 and lastly the reason my ps4 is <unk> and not the rest of my devices is because i purchased the insurance on the <unk> store directly from sony because it was cheap and in my face 
 i think it was 2 years accidental protection for 60 $ or such i 'll make this short and sweet 
 i was in the kitchen not doing anything special when my girlfriend walks in and says she 's hungry 
 seeing this as an opportunity to drop my pants i quickly undo my belt and say something along the lines of well you 're in luck i have a sausage just for you '' 
 and begin waving it around like i just do n't care 
 from out of nowhere my dog <unk> up from behind and gives my penis a sniff and a lick 
 i got head from my dog 
 last night i was up until 4 am playing counter strike on my laptop eating doritos and drinking orange crush until i eventually fell asleep mid game 
 i wake up this morning to find a terrible smell of <unk> and my shirt stuck to the bed as well as sheets that were stained a lovely shade of piss yellow 
 apparently the cap on my crush was not on tightly so it leaked all over my laptop <unk> sheets shirt and soaked into my <unk> which will likely now become moldy 
 to add to that my doritos also spilled everywhere and now there are ants 
 **tl : dr sleeping with your crush is a bad <unk> this just happened and i thought you guys may enjoy this ... .i <unk> today to cleaning around the house and because of this decided to wear comfortable shorts which did not have pockets 
 throughout the course of the day i had to go in and out of the house so i needed my keys on me 
 having a lack of pockets complicated matters for me until i realized something ... on my keys i have a container of <unk> pepper spray so i have the wonderful idea to stick the thing down the backside of my shorts and let the keys just <unk> outside almost like a metallic tail 
 the weight of the can and retention from the <unk> band kept it in decently in place so i went about my business 
 eventually i decide to sit down on a rock pile outside my house and feel wetness followed by an intense burning sensation 
 after a few seconds i register what happened and rush inside 
 the little <unk> on it slid out of the safe position and when i sat down it engaged and a solid stream of the shit came out 
 it felt like <unk> had just raped me up the ass with his fiery cock 
 grabbing a half gallon of milk from the kitchen i run to the bathroom and immediately pour it on myself to get some relief getting it everywhere in the process 
 while frantically attempting to get the red liquid out of my ass crack my finger ended up inside my anus pushing the stuff further in 
 to make things worse my so was just arriving home when this happened and discovered me crying half naked in the bathroom covered in milk ... that was a difficult one to explain ... til : pepper spray is some nasty shit do n't be a moron with it 
 <unk> still a bit sore down there but most of the pain is gone 
 thanks for all the comments by the way i laughed my ass off or at least what is left of it 
 edit : just for clarity here i am a man 
 a little description about myself before i continue my story 
 * <unk> male * virginity is strong * american born chinese * visiting china vacation * not <unk> in chinese <unk> also to those reddit users that know me <unk> please **do <unk> <unk> me 
 i already have enough problems to deal with 
 this event did not occur today but two nights ago however it was n't until now that i mustered up the courage to post this because i need advice too 
 <unk> story : ** anyway at approximately 5:25 pm on a friday my cousin had voice called me on <unk> china 's version of skype recommending me to visit a legitimate massage parlor i have been incredibly sick throughout the entire week lung infection 
 apparently in chinese tradition a massage and drinking boiling water will cure all diseases sarcasm 
 fast forward <unk> i threw on a <unk> t-shirt skinny-fit jeans and a leather jacket then i headed outside 
 now the city that i am located in has two major streets packed with various chinese <unk> & amp pop restaurants and miscellaneous stores 
 already walked halfway down the dirt road on the first street i noticed a stained picture sign of a white lady rubbing a man 's back <unk> on the window <unk> of a <unk> <unk> building and a rusty metal fence that blocked the inside view 
 i walked into the massage parlor only to be greeted by a chinese lady 
 moments later a pot-bellied bald man had appeared from behind the curtains of a room 
 the sketchy man had requested my purpose 
 i responded in broken chinese <unk> the man that i sought after a massage 
 no fucking joke the <unk> guy stated in nearly perfect english happy ending '' 
 originally my only intention of visiting a massage parlor was to receive a legitimate massage 
 however since i was already here and i was prepared to lose my virginity i gave up my integrity and said fuck it 
 i smiled then gracefully nodded handing the sketchy man <unk> rmb equivalent to $ <unk> usd 
 the pot-bellied man informed me in chinese stating that he 'll <unk> his best employee 
 <unk> the greeting lady had led me into the 3rd room opposite direction of the receptionist table counter 
 the greeting lady had given me a pair of <unk> and a towel then informed me to undress only to leave me by myself 
 this was n't my first massage so i knew the basic procedure 
 after i undressed and wore the uncomfortable <unk> i laid <unk> on the <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> later i think only to be <unk> from waiting so long i hear the lady 's footsteps hand washing and the <unk> of burning <unk> do i finally feel the <unk> touch of her hands <unk> my back 
 moments later i felt an oily sensation and the towel wrapped around my waist being <unk> 
 now prior to my <unk> '' being <unk> i had already grew a <unk> in the nether region 
 as the lady pulled my <unk> penis between my legs i felt her fingertips massaging my foreskin 
 fast forward <unk> later when i had already <unk> and gradually moaning louder i asked in broken chinese how much for penetration '' 
 she stopped dead silence 
 momentarily i slowly raised my head and turned around only to be facing an elderly man 
 i jumped up and screamed what the fuck '' 
 later on i was informed by the bald man at the receptionist table that the elderly man with feminine hands was legally blind 
 how does that make my situation even better 
 anyway i received a <unk> for <unk> rmb because the man at the receptionist table had concluded that i was a homosexual judging from my skinny-fit jeans and double pierced <unk> 
 fuck my life 
 **tl dr : ** i visit a shady massage parlor to experience a happy ending '' only to unexpectedly receive a penis jerk session from a legally blind elderly man 
 **now this is the part where i ask reddit for advice 
 ** the old man had rubbed a green herbal essence on my genitals and i had formed a series of rashes only to remind me of my regrettable decision to visit a massage parlor in china 
 what are some home remedies to heal these rashes 
 i 'm too embarrassed to visit a hospital no matter how cheap it is 
 **edit : ** thank you to for the reddit gold star coin 
 i am not exactly certain on what it does but i am extremely flattered that you were willing to spend money to support my <unk> reddit 
 not really a tifu happened several months ago 
 i was in the hospital after rapid weight loss 
 doctors suspected crohn 's disease and had to check through colonoscopy 
 note : it was an university hospital full of student doctors who <unk> in a given field 
 in my case there was this beautiful young female doctor with warm attitude towards me and all the good stuff *you know what i mean <unk> 
 i was joking with my now-girlfriend on the phone about how to flirt with a medical worker my girlfriend is a nurse 
 never had any intentions to do so and was always respectful to the doctor in question 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- # # # until the day of the colonoscopy came 
 i was lying butt-naked on the operating table with a bunch of staff around me 
 the anesthesiologist injected me with something and then we talked for about 15 minutes after which they asked me if i felt dizzy already 
 well i did n't 
 they injected more of the same sedative and we talked for another 15 minutes 
 they asked the same question again and i was still as fresh as a <unk> on a warm april morning 
 by then everybody was kind of pissed off this takes too much time 
 the anesthesiologist said something in the <unk> of this dude requires a <unk> shot '' injected me a third time and asked me if i feel dizzy again 
 last thing i remember is that i answered no '' 
 fast forward several hours 
 nurses are trying to push me down my head <unk> and i still lie butt-naked on the table 
 after i calm down and wake up completely they tell me the whole story 
 the last thing i remember was n't the last thing i did 
 apparently the sedative had some side-effects namely turned me into some <unk> half-bane <unk> 
 i started <unk> around yelling and even detached myself from the tubes on both of my hands 
 then i stood up still ass-naked in a middle of a room full of medical professionals 
 and i slapped the buttocks of that <unk> student 
 when i say slapped '' i do mean it & amp mdash apparently my <unk> was so violent the poor girl had to sit down and later leave the colonoscopy room 
 i stayed for another two weeks in the hospital but i never saw her again 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- **tl dr : ** sedative in hospital had some side-effects & amp mdash after i was injected with a horse dose of the sedative i started acting violently slapped a quite <unk> medical student 's ass all while being butt-naked inside a room with ~10 medical professionals 
 at least that story made my <unk> laugh and we got together almost right after i left the hospital 
 **edit : ** grammar 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- # # update man 
 i never imagined such a response 
 some questions have been raised by fellow redditors which i 'll answer below 
 i 'll also elaborate further on the story 
 apparently this is called <unk> reaction and is a real thing albeit rare one 
 mine turned out to be quite violent but judging by some of the comments here i was held down by 5 men '' not the most violent one 
 i 'd say it was violent enough for me to slap the poor doctor but not violent enough for a more <unk> ending 
 i lost 16 kilos in 2 months time 
 it turned out i did n't have crohn 's disease 
 thankfully cause it is an awful disease and i wish good luck '' to anyone who suffers from it 
 i was diagnosed with <unk> <unk> syndrome without diarrhea i know right 
 doctors told me to stop eating <unk> salads and it did work 
 i <unk> 12 of my 16 kilos lost 
 it is likely related to some stress i 've been under 
 my reaction to the sedative might be related to stress as well 
 i never got the chance to apologise to the doctor 
 i saw her several times outside of the hospital but never got a <unk> '' reaction 
 mind we live in a relatively small town i 'm not some <unk> dude who 's following her around 
 no they can not <unk> me for sexual assault 
 i was clearly sedated and out of my mind 
 i wish y'all good luck 
 be careful with any anesthetics especially if a tube is to be inserted in your anal tract in the presence of an attractive young <unk> for a nice day out me and my girlfriend decided to go <unk> 
 we get there buy our <unk> and other extras ready for a day of ultimate <unk> 
 well it 's the first round and i get clocked in the shoulder in the first 10 seconds 
 damn 
 i 'm out 
 so when we switch sides i decide to carefully consider my route to the objective 
 should i go left long or right short 
 i chose left because i thought i 'd be clever and go a longer route in order to be sneaky <unk> like 
 i eye up a set of barrels as my first bit of cover 
 the <unk> shouts 3 2 1 game on '' 
 and i rush to my barrels for cover like i 'm fucking james <unk> or some shit 
 unfortunately i slip before i get there fall on my own leg and snap it in half at the ankle 
 so now i 'm in a hospital bed bored out of my mind with a fucked up leg 
 the worst part 
 they 've got britain 's got talent on the ward tv and i ca n't change it 
 gg <unk> edit : proof with girlfriend showing thumbs up : i 'm the fat guy on the floor obviously 
 for anyone complaining that this is n't a true tifu i will <unk> state that my footwear was n't appropriate 
 so tifu by running around a forest playing <unk> wearing totally the wrong kind of footwear 
 gg no <unk> 've just arrived at work and am pretty sure i 've been bright red for a good 2 hours 
 so this morning i jumped on the train plugged in my headphones and prepared myself for the <unk> of an hour long train ride 
 as my headphones are blasting whatever music <unk> threw my way being a <unk> i 'm tapping my phone like michael j fox playing candy crush 
 about halfway through my train ride the carriage is pretty much full and an elderly woman comes and sits next to me so i move over to give her room for her bags and get back to my music session 
 as i 'm <unk> out still tapping away i feel someone grab my shoulder 
 the train i catch goes through a pretty shitty part of australia so naturally i jump up and prepare to put up a valiant fight as i get the living shit kicked out of me 
 to my surprise the person grabbing my shoulder is a pretty attractive girl who i see on the train quite a bit 
 i <unk> i 'd startled the crap out of her so i pulled out my headphones to apologise 
 as soon as i start i 'm so ... '' she just sighs hey do you always look at porn on the train 
 as i 'm trying to work out if she 's insane or just crazy i look to my phone in horror 
 while i 've been <unk> on my phone i 've managed to tap on the reddit icon which has brought me back to where i had left off the night before the deepest and darkest corners of /r/gonewild 
 i turn bright red and sit back down in my chair knowing that i 've got at least another 20 minutes of my train ride left 
 as i 'm sitting there in silence too afraid to put my headphones in the elderly lady beside me squeezes the top of my hand and whispers do n't worry love it 's perfectly natural '' 
 kill me 
 **edit : ** so a lot of people seem to think that by tapping on my phone '' i mean slapping it like a bongo 
 i do n't know if people have the <unk> of a <unk> but using your fingertips to tap on a phone makes close to no noise and definitely ca n't be heard over the sound of the <unk> i was taking a leisurely dip in the water it was quite calm not much of a swell 
 things were great the sun was shining and not too many people in the water 
 after a while i needed to go to the toilet i 'm not sure really what i was thinking it probably was the combination between i 've peed in the water heaps '' and it 's nearly a 10min walk to the restrooms '' when i decided that i would snap a log in the water 
 i mean what could go wrong 
 it would sink no one would be any the <unk> 
 i <unk> away from everyone and did my business 
 to my surprise however the <unk> bitch floated 
 shits do n't float do they 
 i 'm pretty sure whenever i 've looked in the bowl after laying a turd it has n't floated 
 well i am not sure exactly what was happening but i had just given birth to two floating torpedo 's hastily making their way straight for the nearest beach patrons 
 immediately i <unk> after them i 'm no michael <unk> but i quickly caught up with them 
 i grabbed one in each hand 
 now i do n't know if any of you have held your shit before but let me assure you is n't not pleasant 
 at that moment i was struck with fear i was within 5 meters of people and had two slippery brown <unk> to dispose of 
 simple decision i 'll bury them under the sand 
 so i dove down and quickly pushed them deep into the sand pushing more sand over them 
 i <unk> just in time to see my gf swimming up to me 
 no quicker had i buried them then they had escaped their salty grave and popped to the surface once more 
 my gf looked at them looked at me looked at them and screamed 
 for the past 5 hours i have been <unk> the <unk> 
 so here is the story in question 
 this morning i saw jill for he first time since pancake gate 
 she came in a little earlier than usual and as guessed by herself 
 luckily there was n't anyone else in line so we had a few minutes to chat 
 as soon as she walked up she started crying 
 so i of course walked from behind the counter and gave her a hug 
 crying women at my counter happens more frequently than you would expect 
 7 times now to be exact 
 anyway after the hug and me telling her that i 'm sorry about everything she tells me the basics and we decide to have lunch together so we can talk some more 
 during lunch i find out what really happened 
 turns out that jill has had one other person tell her that frank was cheating 
 she did n't <unk> that person fully but was of course on guard 
 jill went to frank 's office early that day to try to <unk> the marriage if that was the issue 
 lunch conversation and all that without the kids around to <unk> them 
 here are some talking points 
 * jill apologized for yelling at me 
 she said her emotions were all jacked up which i of course told her that it was n't a big deal 
 * jill already filed for divorce and kicked frank out of the house 
 * before filing jill went out and bought a new car with frank 's money 
 apparently the joint account money was mostly his as she paid the majority of the bills 
 his money was mainly savings and spending money 
 * i asked about the anal sex thing 
 she got super red in the face and said that she would never do it even though he asked constantly 
 her reasoning was that sex is supposed to be pleasurable not painful '' 
 i left it there as my views on sex <unk> 
 that and it 's kind of a sore subject 
 * apparently frank wants to already move out of the city and start his own practice 
 * jill wants the kids and frank is n't going to fight her on it 
 so all in all it sounds pretty amicable besides the super public blow out 
 i wished her good luck and she said she will still be getting coffee with me every morning 
 as i 'm sure people will ask yes she is now single 
 yes she is attractive for a late 30 's woman and she will not take it in the ass 
 no clue if the <unk> is single 
 tl dr jill is now single and happy but still wo n't do anal 
 edit /s edit : under no circumstances should you ever perform any sexual act under <unk> 
 if you do not want to do something tell your partner plainly and clearly 
 if they insist then leave their asses 
 communication is key y'all 
 edit 2 : the promised story has been posted 
 ask and op shall deliver so this happened like half an hour ago ... my husband and i have been having some problems with our marriage recently and so we have both been eager to find new ways to spice up our love life 
 to give a little context i have an extreme anal fetish and i 've always fantasized about someone pooping in my mouth ... gross i know but essential to the story 
 we start talking about ways we can make this happen 
 we figure if we use an <unk> to clean him out we could melt down a candy bar shape it like a turd <unk> ... <unk> insert it inside of him and then proceed with the fantasy 
 everything was going fine ... until he could n't get it out 
 no matter how much he tried the candy bar turd '' was n't moving 
 i started getting worried that i was going to have to take my husband to the emergency room with a candy bar shoved up his ass 
 could you imagine explaining that to people 
 as i 'm contemplating what i 'm going to say to the emts liquid chocolate mixed with the lube we used <unk> out of his ass 
 he was squatting over me at the time and so the liquid goes into my eye and starts to sting 
 i 'm pinned underneath him trying to push him off screaming for him to stop while he 's bent over the towels we layed down chocolate ass juice gushing out from him 
 finally the candy bar turd '' fired out of his ass like a torpedo and landed with a disappointing <unk> on the floor 
 we stared at it for a moment contemplating our failure 
 contemplating what lengths the human species will go to when they are horny 
 then we both ran into the bathroom 
 i showered while he sat on the toilet trying to get the rest of it out 
 he 's in there now as i write this ... <unk> both feel weird but the whole thing was hilarious in hindsight and oddly enough it brought us closer so mission accomplished 
 tl dr shoved a candy bar up my husband 's ass 
 neither of us were ready for the results 
 edit : omg our first reddit gold 
 thank you so much i 'm glad we could brighten people 's day a little with our horrible fuck up haha 
 husband : thanks so much 
 to answer a few questions : yes its real 
 all too regrettably real ... it hurt no my poop this morning did not smell like caramel and no i would not like a baby <unk> right now 
 my only regret is that i ca n't ever tell anyone that my wife and i hit the front page ... so not today but today is my first post on reddit 
 so hello 
 anyways i was just in the dominican republic wife could n't come cause of work and i had a voucher that was about to <unk> 
 so i went by myself 
 i 've <unk> all over the world and have always stayed in the cheap areas 
 so i was in <unk> found a hostel and <unk> had a swim then like all of us do i went to a beach bar at about 10pm 
 i sat down ordered a martini or some <unk> thing and then a few min 's later a very attractive black girl came and sat down beside me she started chatting all sexy like and offered me a beer 
 i declined because i already had a drink but she continued to insist and eventually ordered one for me and one for her 
 i thought ok whatever i will drink a beer 
 so reddit you know those knapkins they put on the top of the beer 
 ya well she reached over and said let me get that for you '' and started <unk> the top of my beer 
 instantly i was like oh shit she is somehow putting drugs in my drink is n't she ... after she did that we cheers and i bring the beer to my lips it 's way <unk> than normal so in the same motion i spit it back in the bottle 
 she kept on looking over her shoulder and i realized she was making eye contact with about 5 big <unk> looking guys i put everything together and realized she and her friends were going to rob kidnap or worse kill me 
 i got nervous ... like my whole body was vibrating ... -she looked at them <unk> i realized i had about 2 seconds to do something while she was looking over at them so i reached for her beer and switched mine with hers 
 we continue talking my voice is shaky she and i drink 
 she gets about 4 sips in before she looks at me with emptiness in her eyes she is wasted and was slurring her words ... it was drugs 
 she kept trying to pull me to the back where the bathroom was where they were prob going to get me she promised blow jobs and sex 
 i kept saying no i have to go i pulled away from her and i noticed the guys were no longer there and a cop had pulled up 
 i speed walked back to my hostel and my heart felt like it was going to burst like a fruit <unk> 
 i got to my hostel and flew out on the next <unk> do n't accept a drink from a hot chick on the <unk> of the dominican 
 before i start this story i should mention that a both of us have a solid sense of humor and b i had my revenge in 24 hours 
 i work in a very large building with a lot of different companies and a small restaurant area on the top two floors 
 my girlfriend stopped by to visit me on my lunch break and while we 're eating lunch on the top floor she tells me that her brother 's girlfriend convinced her brother to do something by crying in front of him 
 i made an <unk> comment about how i didn’t see how that would make much of a difference and said in a very superior tone it definitely wouldn’t work on me 
 my girlfriend <unk> that she could totally convince me to do something by crying 
 i <unk> saying that because my girlfriend is definitely not the kind of person who cries very often any attempt to manipulate me through tears would be very obvious and therefore <unk> 
 i also told her that she probably could n't pull it off anyway since she was such an <unk> <unk> 
 you can probably figure out the rest of the story 
 the conversation moved on to other topics and i had already forgotten about our discussion by the time we go to get in the elevator 
 we get in the elevator with three older <unk> and an older grandma-ish woman 
 just as the doors close she starts sobbing out of the fucking blue 
 i announce loudly that the fake tears aren’t going to work on me 
 it turns out this is a really great way to draw attention to the crying girl in the elevator and make me look like a massive asshole 
 the grandma-ish woman asks if she 's alright and she goes i 'm fine i just had a fight with my boyfriend '' 
 and then my gf turns to me and say you did n't mean it did you 
 i promise i 'll ask your permission first next time '' 
 i’m trying to make her break character so i go “i’m sorry do i know you ” i swear to god i almost screwed her up she <unk> but turned it into a weird sobbing noise and goes “do you see how he treats me ” i swear to god if looks could kill 
 the three guys were getting off at the 10th floor so the doors open on 10 and one of them gives me a last look like he 'd like to take me behind the building and beat me to a pulp before leaving the elevator 
 grandma-ish woman is still watching us suspiciously 
 i finally lean over and tell her she won and to cut it out 
 my girlfriend makes a <unk> recovery and a few other people enter and exit the elevator without incident 
 <unk> woman tells her to take care of herself '' before leaving 
 tl dr : <unk> my girlfriend into making me look like an abusive asshole to prove a point 
 hi there this did n't technically happen today but i thought i 'd share it anyway 
 backstory : when i was in high school all of 17 years old i had a part time job at the <unk> nearby 
 i pushed carts every shift and honestly was damn good at it too 
 now there was a boy my age named kevin that also went to the school who was mentally challenged i do n't know what he had but basically he could n't talk mouth always open wrists bent and he <unk> them on his chest you get the picture 
 now the way you had to bring the carts in was through a smaller doggy door type opening in the front glass it made visibility quite low upon entering the door especially as you had to duck down to get through 
 so there i am one day kicking ass at my job like usual 
 i have about 16 carts in a line that i 'm <unk> from the back 
 approaching the doggy door i look and see that i have a clear path inside 
 i mean who walks behind the cart area anyways right 
 as i reach the inside of the building coming through i see it.. kevin is just sprinting out of nowhere across my path 
 i ca n't stop the momentum of the moving carts from the back not for lack of trying though 
 that 's when wham i <unk> his ass and he just goes flying onto the ground 
 screaming and <unk> like a dying animal 
 i run to him to see if he 's okay and he just stumbles off and runs to his parents 
 frozen i stand there for about 25 seconds 
 no one saw it <unk> and i mean he could n't tell anybody 
 his parents were on the other side of the store for god 's sake who let 's a kid like that just run around unsupervised 
 all i know is every time kevin saw me at school from that point on he would scream and run away nobody but me ever knew why 
 tl dr <unk> a mentally challenged kid with shopping carts scarred him for life 
 poor kevin 
 edit : wow front page 
 you guys rock 
 especially you <unk> off let me begin that auntie angel on the youtube video is a god damn liar 
 she makes it seem so easy and <unk> but it 's not 
 oh ... it 's not 
 about a week ago i ran into an article online about a <unk> who caught wind of the original video on youtube and decided to try it on her boyfriend for science 
 her boyfriend loved it so i figured why not 
 what is the grapefruit blowjob you ask 
 you cut the ends off and a hole in the middle and proceed to use it to jack the guy off while sucking the head 
 i sent the link to both article and video to my boyfriend which he proceeded to get as much of a kick out of it as i did 
 i figured it would be something <unk> '' and kinky '' to try on vday as a special occasion 
 mind you he told his coworkers about it and showed them the video plus he told them i was going to try this on him so the bar was set pretty high 
 come yesterday we had dinner and on the way home we stopped at a grocery store to buy our new toy 
 there we were in the produce section feeling and sizing up grapefruits 
 thick or think skin 
 big enough 
 <unk> or hard 
 i felt extremely paranoid and kept thinking we had to buy something else because who the fuck goes to walmart at 10 pm just to buy a single grapefruit with their boyfriend 
 totally suspicious and deviant 
 so we bought a case of <unk> water and i see this guy walking out of the store who glances over at our <unk> on the belt and he kinda smirks at me 
 i 'm thinking - he knows 
 when we were feeling up the grapefruits he was standing next to us buying <unk> ... asshole 
 we make it to the bedroom and considering how easy auntie angel made it seem in the video i figured all we would need is a towel 
 so i have him cut the grapefruit ends off and a hole in the middle - easy peasy right 
 slip into my nightie and <unk> tell him to lay on the bed while i get to work 
 okay ... this is <unk> than i thought it would be so i put my hair in a <unk> 
 i slide the grapefruit down his shaft while i begin to jerk him off with it twisting back and forth while sucking on the head 
 do you know what it was like 
 a god damned porno <unk> that 's what 
 all i could think of is that lying bitch 
 this is nothing like the video '' 
 do n't get me wrong it made the blowjob taste great but the juice began to leak and squirt everywhere 
 it was running down my chin soaked my nightie all over my chest running down to the floor soaking through the towel onto his bed and as i later discovered through the sheets and into the mattress 
 mind you i 'm on my knees trying my best because damn it were going to be kinky on vday and i 'm twisting this damn grapefruit back and forth on his dick trying to make the best of it 
 everything is covered it grapefruit by now the more i twist and pump the more it goes everywhere everything 's sticky and <unk> and i have no idea what i 'm doing anymore 
 i awkwardly asked if he was enjoying it to which he said he was and that it felt good but nothing earth shattering as auntie angel promised 
 the noise it makes is obscenely loud which mind you his apartment walls are paper thin so i 'm sure his neighbors heard as i could hear noises coming from the other side of the wall 
 all i could do at that point was count my blessings his roommate was n't home 
 i gave up and took off the <unk> as it was soaked by that point 
 the more i twisted on the grapefruit the more juice went every which way 
 by then i was cackling like a mad woman because i looked like i was trying to squeeze out lemonade by hand except naked and on my knees 
 the grapefruit kept getting thinner and thinner after like 15 minutes it was pretty much all gone 
 my hands were starting to sting a little and i did n't want to throw in the <unk> like a <unk> as he had n't cum yet 
 while we had bought two grapefruits at that point i was like forget this '' 
 the mexican food and salsa i had earlier was not sitting well with all the grapefruit and it was starting to come back up 
 it was in my hair and slowly starting to creep into both all of our <unk> and <unk> 
 i asked him to wash off and he looks at me incredulously 
 all i 'm thinking of is that penis is not going into me like that because it 's going to burn or i 'm going to end up with a yeast infection 
 nope 
 mind you it took me a while to realize the juice was probably seeping into his piss slit the entire time so i felt a <unk> of guilt 
 so while he jumped in the shower i made the discovery on the mattress 
 it soaked through everything 
 the grapefruit left a weird sour smell on the mattress and i began to panic thinking he was going to be upset so i poured some water on the mattress without realizing i was making the wet spot bigger 
 i grabbed the first thing on the floor i could find to scrub the spot dry turns out it was the shorts he was wearing prior to the deed 
 oops 
 found a towel and managed to scrub it as best as possible hoping he did n't realize how bad and smelly it was 
 out of the shower he comes slips back on his grapefruit shorts and i say nothing 
 found grapefruit on the cross i wear on my <unk> - sorry jesus 
 at that point it was near 1 am we were both exhausted from the long day neither of us got off and we kind of just shuffled into bed awkwardly hoping neither of us would speak of this again 
 mind you i can imagine the <unk> conversation he 's going to have with his coworkers 
 i 'm <unk> just thinking about it 
 poor guy - he 's a <unk> for letting me experiment on him 
 from here on out when i feel the need to try something out there i 'm <unk> anything from the produce section 
 from a few months ago - i figured i '' d submit a post that was n't sex related 
 so i was managing a restaurant a few months ago 
 for those of you who have never worked in a restaurant the majority of them are spanish speaking in the kitchen 
 my other managers all speak spanish <unk> but since i '' m a stupid <unk> who studied french in high school i usually have to communicate with my expo 
 his job is to make sure that your burger your gf 's salad and your <unk> 's steak all arrive at the table at the same time 
 here 's the problem 
 my chef 's name is <unk> - but his nickname is <unk> my expo 's name is juan - but he <unk> to be called frank my <unk> 's name is luis but i have 5 other luis 's in my place so we call him colombia cause you know he 's from colombia i have a new server tonight 
 his name is raphael 
 i '' m noticing a lot of items sent back to the kitchen tonight 
 burger 's not cooked correctly or without cheese salads that had n't been fired as <unk> cocktails not ordered correctly etc etc 
 so i go up to my expo frank <unk> 
 juan and ask him what 's going on 
 it 's pendejo 's fault '' 
 pendejo '' 
 i respond 
 what the fuck are you talking about '' 
 him '' 
 he points to raphael you know pendejo '' 
 at this point i assume that raphael 's <unk> is pendejo 
 since i 'm not an asshole i approach pendejo and let him know that he 's been sending a lot of mistakes to the kitchen 
 it 's okay but we need to fix the things he 's doing wrong 
 so i begin to shadow him at his tables 
 pendejo please make sure they get a <unk> '' or pendejo please make sure we refill their water '' or pendejo plug their order in so i can check it '' 
 anyway three days later he <unk> for his shift 
 i call up my other manager who does scheduling and he says yeah man raphael said you were an asshole and that he did n't wan na work with you '' 
 so i go to my bar - i sit down and talk to my bartender who 's <unk> about what does pendejo mean '' <unk> pendejo translates as pubic hair '' but really means dumbass '' or idiot '' or retard '' ** so the next day i come up to my expo and ask him why he let me call this poor bastard pendejo for three days without correcting me 
 i 'm sorry man it was just too funny '' 
 in retrospect i probably would 've done the same <unk> have the <unk> as a neighbor 
 she has called child services on this perfectly nice family multiple times 
 she complains to my cousin about letting his mentally handicapped child play outside 
 any toy that the neighborhood kids loose in her yard is gone forever and no she does n't have a fence 
 she gets off of her porch and comes down into her yard and takes the toys and breaks them 
 she truly <unk> our entire neighborhood 
 a few weeks ago some of the teenagers in our suburb blew up her mailbox with what i assume was a <unk> <unk> 
 they did a damn good job of it because there was nothing left of it the next day and nobody really heard a loud bang 
 the mailbox was just scattered in every direction and partially melted 
 after this happened she freaked out more than usual 
 she decided that she needed better visibility in her yard to see the evil ones '' so she cut down every tree in her yard 
 she calls everyone in a fairly large neighborhood every day to ask if they <unk> her yard 
 she 's flipped so much that most parents wo n't even let their kids outside of their house let alone walk to their friends houses 
 one of her recent decisions was to put custom no parking '' signs in front of her house 
 she claims it 's illegal to park in front of <unk> and threatens to call her son who is a dick of a cop and will try to find some sort of violation on your part 
 this would have been no big deal except for the fact that i live in an apartment across the street and i literally have no driveway and it 's only legal to park on her side of the street 
 the other night it was really late and since all other spots were taken i parked with my bumper in her no parking zone 
 i woke up the next morning to a call from my cousin and he said that i was getting a ticket 
 i rush outside to see her son walking away from my car with a ticket on the windshield 
 i was 2 inches farther out than i was supposed to be 
 2 freaking inches 
 instead of fighting the ticket it was only 20 bucks i decided that two could play at her game 
 someone not saying it was me bought around 40 <unk> cars 
 one day after she left to go to her weekly exorcism er church service someone again not <unk> me glued all of these toy cars in front of her house in her no parking zone 
 whoever it was used the good glue too not some cheap <unk> that would come up easily 
 she came home and thought these were some happy little 10 year old 's toy cars so she went outside with a garbage bag to throw them all out 
 watching her try and try to pick them up was one of the most satisfying things i have ever seen even if it did only last 5 minutes 
 she called her son who took a shovel to them and did a number to the road getting them up 
 the big homeschooled family in our neighborhood all went outside to watch from the safety of their porch 
 one of the kids actually taped her screaming at her son to get them up 
 i hope to get that video soon 
 they went inside after she started screaming at them 
 after the damage had been done to her road she tried to <unk> who would do such a thing to her 
 eventually she decided that i did it since she had been <unk> to me lately 
 she began by posting police notices '' on my door that said we know you did it '' and you are guilty '' 
 she went as far as to make a fake court notice 
 and yes it was fake i checked 
 my boss gave us today off because we reached our monthly quota really early and she 's awesome like that so i planned on spending the day relaxing catching up on some grand theft auto 
 crazy lady saw my car in my cousin 's driveway i 've been parking their for safety and decide that today was the day she was going to act 
 she walked over to my apartment 's door with a lawn chair and sat down in front of it 
 she called me multiple times to explain that she knew it was me and that i was n't allowed to leave my house until i confessed 
 normally this would n't phase me but despite her age satan <unk> though this woman and she is very capable of <unk> harm upon me 
 i would call the police but i 'm worried her son would respond and not do a thing about it 
 my floor is the second floor so jumping out would be a <unk> option but i 'm in a <unk> right now because of a <unk> accident 
 so i 'm stuck in my apartment with no escape being <unk> with phone calls by my <unk> neighbor who will not let me out 
 i can not call the police and i am out of milk 
 any way i try to get this woman away from my door will result in her either suing me or pressing charges against me 
 i 'm a prisoner in my own man cave 
 and that is how i fucked up 
 update : as of <unk> pm she has <unk> back to her <unk> 
 i 'm going to make sure she does n't see me slip out then spend the night at my cousins a few doors down 
 i 'm then going to set up a video camera at his house and i 'm recording all of my phone calls 
 hopefully she repeats this behavior tomorrow 
 update : as of <unk> pm i am safely at my cousins house 
 i left the lights on so she 'll think i 'm home and i 'll use my phone to turn on some music in the house tomorrow 
 my boss gave me another day off so i 'm going to watch all day 
 update : who took the lids off of her garbage cans 
 it certainly was n't me 
 oh well at least our local <unk> population will eat well tonight 
 <unk> : she appears to have gone to bed so she can be up early to make sure the neighborhood kids do n't step in her yard while walking to school 
 i also believe that the amount of <unk> activity on our street is slowly increasing 
 i know a lot of you have said to call the police and i know i should 
 however after discussing it with my cousin and phoning a couple more neighbors we decided it 's best just to let her go 
 if we call the police they are n't really going to do anything other than tell her to stop 
 i 'm too poor to be able to afford a lawyer or to go to court and she 's not worth that amount of effort or money 
 while she has cost the neighbors lots of toys and outdoor time and me my destiny fund i 'd rather make her life as close to hell as i can imagine as opposed to taking legal action 
 no punishment from our legal system would do this woman justice 
 update : landlord returned my call around <unk> he says he 's had a past of dealing with her 
 he 's a strict catholic and she 's some sort of <unk> and evidently she came over and broke his statue of the virgin mary and his one of <unk> <unk> 
 he says she 's been told not to set foot on his property again and will deal with her when he gets home from vacation 
 i told him to not worry about i hope i did n't ruin his vacation 
 anyways he 'll be gone for the 5 more days so until then i 'm going to keep pranking this lady in any fun and safe way i can 
 update : as of <unk> she has <unk> from depths of her house and is <unk> at the street 
 today i watch for her to retaliate 
 upon her retaliation will my iron fist come down with old testament fury 
 update : as of <unk> the kids are safely on the bus 
 no problems this morning 
 she has returned to her home where i believe she is watching the mean streets of my suburb from her bedroom window 
 i have a camera ready in case she emerges from the depths 
 update : <unk> my cousin leaves for work around 9 so i 'm leaving to go get breakfast for him and his wife for letting me crash at their place 
 upon my return i will take some pictures of her latest no parking '' sign create an imgur account and post them 
 just as a pre warning i will be taking these photos from some distance 
 i will snap until i get one that can be read 
 i apologize now for the potato quality to come 
 edits from reading the comments : thanks for the tips guys 
 i read the local parking laws and checked to make sure what she did was illegal with the parking signs 
 needless to say many of you have great ideas for harmless comedic revenge 
 i promise to keep posting with photos the next time she does something to me my neighbors or my house 
 in the meantime i will ponder on more harmless revenge tactics 
 mobile update : as of <unk> am i received a text from my cousins wife 
 apparently shes out in her yard mowing so i wont be able to return for another hour 
 update : i 'm home as of <unk> 
 nothing crazy has happened yet 
 she sits ever vigilant upon her wicker throne 
 only two missed calls from her today 
 once again she <unk> all of our near neighbors about the mailbox 
 i have a picture of her no parking sign and i will post it as soon as i am finished editing all location information out of it 
 <unk> with another neighbor he had a <unk> fish on his car when he first moved here now it 's gone 
 he suspects it was her that removed it 
 i have to go back to my house to get my stuff for work at some point 
 while there is n't much my movement is <unk> by my cast 
 i 'm going to try to get my stuff at the same time the school kids come by and there 's more people outside 
 wish me luck 
 edit : for those saying that she has a legitimate medical problem i assure you she does not 
 she has been nasty her entire life from what i 've been told 
 other neighbors have tried being nice to her the homeschooled family even invited her to dinner which she promptly refused because they were mary <unk> demons '' 
 this family is one of the nicest i have ever met 
 they <unk> give me food and invite me over to do stuff at their house even when they did n't know me that well when i first moved in 
 this family is n't even catholic either i 'm pretty sure they 're part of a <unk> mormon group but i could be mistaken 
 regardless their kindness did not work on satan and she called child <unk> one time claiming that the parents were giving their kids alcohol 
 child services showed up the family let them search and surprise surprise they did n't find a drop of liquor in a mormon family 's house 
 if i so much as thought for a moment that this woman was mentally disabled in any way shape or form i would n't do anything to her but she is simply <unk> evil 
 update : as of 8:15pm all that was lost today was my time 
 i think she knows she screwed up and wo n't retaliate today 
 i 've decided to go back to my apartment 
 i will post the imgur album from there 
 thanks for bearing with me everyone 
 oh and for those that said i should write a script for a show revolving around this lady i have 
 i <unk> 2 full episodes of it for a writing class but did n't submit them because i thought they were n't very good 
 they 're written in the exact style this entire post was so apparently someone in this world will like them 
 if i get the nerve i 'll upload one of them and post a link to it here 
 update : as of <unk> she has called me twice 
 she held a cross up at the door when i drove past and she yelled at some kids for cutting through the corner of her yard 
 just a normal day for the time being 
 update : i 'm very sorry for being so late with this i know i 've gained a lot of skepticism because of it 
 here is the photo of her sign 
 once again i apologize for my <unk> and the <unk> of the image 
 i 'm in a cast give me a break 
 imgur edit : there are three more of these signs just like that one 
 this one is on a telephone pole about 6 feet from her new mailbox 
 edit : i 'm sorry i 've been away for a while 
 life <unk> between me and reddit 
 as a neighborhood we decided to have an independent <unk> <unk> her for a day to record her various actions against all of us 
 we all also recorded her phone calls and recorded anything we saw to compare with the <unk> 
 in total the entire neighborhood of about 40 houses received a total of <unk> calls from her in a day 
 she was taped taking a football from a group of kids she was taped posting fake notices on my door again and her son the cop was taped sleeping in front of his mother 's house while on the job 
 we are trying to use all of this as evidence to get her with harassment charges and forced to move from our neighborhood 
 the dad of the <unk> brother is a lawyer and is taking care of all of the legal matters 
 i 'm out of my cast and i just bought destiny 
 i will post the videos if i 'm ever legally allowed to 
 thanks for the gold and thank you guys for reading 
 update : we lost our case 
 there is a for sale sign in my yard 
 the landlord is selling the place 
 i 'm moving to a nicer apartment 
 the neighborhood kids stole her new mailbox 
 numerous mystery pizzas have been delivered to her house 
 i may have my buddy come over with his old monk costume and act like he 's performing an exorcism on her house 
 i 'll post a video if he does 
 before i begin it was about 12 years ago and <unk> % an accident 
 i was a <unk> teenager 6 tall and <unk> 
 size 12 shoe 
 i had just gotten a new puppy - a miniature <unk> 
 well my dad did 
 i was bringing my laundry from the basement and had the basket in front of me 
 the dog all <unk> of him apparently followed me down the stairs or at least 2 of them 
 i did n't see him 
 my <unk> right foot stepped on that poor puppy 
 i crushed him 
 i was distraught 
 i actually called 911. i did n't know what to do 
 the cops came 
 the paramedics came 
 the fire dept came 
 after about an hour they calmed me down 
 there were grown men crying because the scene was so fucking tragic 
 they tried cpr on the dog for 10 minutes but i crushed this dog so it did n't work 
 the first <unk> took up a collection and 2 weeks later went back to the same breeder to get the puppies sister - the last of the litter 
 when the breeder found out she drove over to my dad 's house and dropped the new puppy off 
 free of charge 
 horrible experience 
 edit : just remembered that when my dad came home the firemen had already gone into the garage gotten a shovel and were in the process of digging the hole to bury the dog 
 above and beyond there 
 second edit : a narration from /u/cyae1 third edit : a lot of people have had this happen to them 
 that makes this even worse ... today i had to make my way to my company 's main office 
 as i got there for an unrelated matter the hr lady hands me my paycheck and says : we made sure to include your bonus here '' 
 what bonus '' 
 the extra $ <unk> addition to your <unk> '' 
 i 'm not too sure what you 're talking about but okay '' 
 hang on '' she goes to speak with her boss and comes back and said she made a mistake and needs to change it 
 and that 's how i gave up the biggest raise i 've ever gotten so my teacher usually leaves the room for like <unk> minutes at a time every day because he also is the <unk> suspension person and he 's a hard ass that breaks up fights and whatnot 
 i was there for study hall not for anything trouble related 
 anyway he got called out to deal with some bullshit today and of course left a classroom of like <unk> people alone as usual 
 and awhile ago i found this on imgur and never found the right chance to try it but i finally did a few days ago when i did it 
 so i type it all in as fast as i can and i change the <unk> number to either 80,000 or another number i just hit a random number with 4 zeros after because i was rushing 
 as i 'm doing it people in the room are just staring at me and asking dude what are you doing '' 
 and i just told them to chill and wait 
 he comes back in maybe <unk> minutes go by after i finish and sits at his desk and continues on with his usual thing just watching youtube videos and going on facebook 
 he 's got that <unk> look on his face that he usually gets when people talk back to him or something 
 like 5 minutes go by and people keep looking at me and shit and i just told them to wait 
 then all of the sudden <unk> and his cd tray pops out 
 he pushes it back in 
 pops back out in seconds 
 he just looks at it like the fuck 
 pushes it back in pops back out and it keeps going in this <unk> 
 and he starts getting fucking red faced and start slamming it in 
 pops out again and he shouts what the hell is going on '' and starts just slamming it every time it comes out and i 'm dying from laughter at this point 
 and he shouts who did this 
 why is this happening this was n't happening before '' and calls the it guy who never shows up 
 next day i get taken out of first period and taken into the office with police and the teacher just staring at me <unk> 
 they all talk to me and say we know what you did <unk> with communication lines is a felony offense son '' and the entire time they were treating it like i hacked into the schools system and did it from my house 
 now i 'm suspended for a week and <unk> investigation tl dr played a funny prank on my teacher who make it out to be a serious <unk> of me hacking into the schools system 
 this happened a while ago but i just found this sub 
 i was home visiting my parents for the weekend 
 my parents went to bed early that night but i decided to stay up for a bit longer to finish up some reports 
 at some point i got thirsty and <unk> downstairs to the kitchen to get some raspberry lemonade 
 now i prefer to work on my laptop in the dark 
 i do n't know why but it makes me feel more productive 
 upon returning to my room i took a couple drinks of the lemonade set it on my nightstand turned off the lights and crawled into my old bed 
 the lemonade had only been sitting out for 10 or so minutes untouched when i took another drink of it and noticed it tasted kind of ... <unk> 
 weird did my parents switch <unk> 
 thinking nothing of it i returned to my work and repeated this a few times 
 until i took a drink and felt a few very solid <unk> go pop 
 in my mouth followed by an explosion of very disgusting grape flavor 
 something was moving in my mouth 
 i turned the lights back on to witness <unk> of sugar ants in and around my cup all of them on a one way path to salvation via throwing themselves in and drowning in sugary lemonade <unk> 
 i reacted appropriately and projectile vomited onto the floor and onto my bed all the while screaming what the fuck ants what the fuck ants what the fuck ants what the fuck ants 
 this is why i do n't visit my parents very often 
 tl dr : grape drink this happened about 2 hours ago 
 the prank was entirely <unk> 
 i felt like getting something to snack on from the service station being that most places are closed on good friday 
 so i put my shoes on put a jacket on brush my teeth use mouthwash <unk> and get in my car 
 within 30 seconds of driving i encounter a random breath test and me and the car behind me are ushered in to be tested 
 i am fumbling with my wallet to get my license and the cop says it is n't necessary and all he needs is my <unk> 
 i jokingly respond something like oh i guess i could give you that '' implying i 'm doing him a <unk> and he <unk> thanks me in good humour 
 so i blow into the breathalyzer for about 5 seconds and he checks the reading 
 he is silent for a bit and i assume he 's waiting for the reading to come up 
 he then asks when the last time i had a drink and i responded with ugh like 2 years ago haha '' and as i finished it clicks that somehow it 's a positive reading 
 so i ask and he confirms and it 's clear he is confused because the reading is ridiculously high 
 i realize that it might be the mouthwash i used a couple of minutes go given i can still taste it in my mouth 
 i tell him this and he seems immediately convinced that i 'm telling the truth and asks if i have a drink in my car to rinse my mouth out with 
 i find a nearly full bottle of mountain <unk> i discarded and <unk> with it 
 i get tested again and the reading is 0 and he laughs and sends me on my way 
 the funniest part was it was clear that i had n't had any alcohol based on how <unk> and <unk> i was about being tested then realizing the culprit was something as simple as mouthwash 
 edit : this happened in australia 
 /u/cyae1 narrated my experience listen to him battle my strange writing style 
 over the thanksgiving break my mom wanted to go to a comedy club with me 
 on the way there we talked about the classes i was planning to take next semester and i mentioned that i was taking yoga since my degree required one fitness & amp nutrition course 
 ten minutes into his comedy set the <unk> does a bit about how every man has tried to blow themselves but most guys are n't flexible enough to do it 
 and then he said ladies if your man decides he wants to take yoga now you know why '' 
 my mom loses it screaming laughter and hits me repeatedly like she wants my attention 
 i know what she 's trying to reference 
 i refuse to look her in the eye 
 no i did not decide to take yoga because i want to blow myself 
 but now mom will not 
 let 
 this 
 go 
 she wanted to see a movie at first 
 we shoulda seen a <unk> is my day off and my loving wife left me a boiled egg for breakfast 
 i forgot that she told me about the egg so after while it got pretty cold 
 i decided to warm it up in the microwave with some other food instead of boiling it again 
 after i took it out i decided to sit in the living in room and watch <unk> on netflix where i stuck the fork in the egg and watched it instantly explode in my face 
 not only did the egg go absolutely everywhere but i was also <unk> by hot gooey egg <unk> 
 to top it off my cat was sitting next to me and got startled by the egg exploding 
 he ran across my lap and dug his nails into me 
 i just wanted some god damn breakfast 
 i 'm too tired for this shit 
 excuse me while i go get the vacuum <unk> my co-worker 's butt is broken 
 she fell and broke her <unk> and has more or less been in excruciating pain since so when it 's starbucks hour i usually volunteer to go get a latte for her 
 naturally i usually draw a butt on it with a heart or a bandaid 
 i swear this is normal in our office 
 we 're <unk> or something 
 mostly just a hr nightmare come to life 
 so today my other co-worker and i go into the starbucks and both <unk> 's and mine come out at the same time decaf and regular <unk> 
 as per usual i ask for a marker and draw a butt this one has a thumbs up sticking out of the pelvis 
 then another decaf latte comes out and i pause 
 a woman with a bad case of <unk> is hovering and asking where her decaf caramel macchiato is just over my right shoulder 
 i freeze and look down sweat <unk> down my face as i examine the little order strip 
 the butt cup is tagged with <unk> instead of l for latte 
 oops 
 i turned the butt towards me and nervously presented her with her caramel macchiato 
 she took it looked at it her nose wrinkled as she looked to the barista i do n't want one with a butt on it '' 
 i look to the barista with a horrified *i 'm so sorry oh my god i <unk> face 
 he calmly offers up an additional cup to <unk> it into 
 she reluctantly accepts this <unk> <unk> and without looking at me turns her nose up to walk off as i ask for the marker again 
 she might have covered it but she 'll know 
 she 'll know she sipped that sweet caramel macchiato out of that butt <unk> this did n't happen today but back in high school 
 my cheeks still get red every time i think about this 
 my boyfriend my senior year of high school lived in the same neighborhood as i did so we saw each other fairly often 
 he was hanging out at my house after school one day and my parents decided to leave to go pick us up some food for dinner 
 we had been dating more than a year at this point so they were okay with leaving us alone 
 well the second they left we got down to business and the blow job train was <unk> 
 since we were both really into it we did n't hear the garage door go up or the downstairs door open 
 next thing i know i hear my dad calling my name coming up the stairs 
 my boyfriend 's pants are down 
 i 've got <unk> all around my mouth 
 apparently my dad had been calling me on my cell this whole time asking about a clarification on what we wanted to eat so he had a pretty good idea what was up 
 my bf puts a pillow over his crotch and i wipe the side of my face and sprint to the door 
 i open it right as he 's standing outside of it 
 hey dad what 's up '' 
 hey <unk> i brought y'all the food you wanted from moe 's but it seems as if you 've already eaten '' 
 cue silent <unk> 
 i hang my head in shame 
 boyfriend leaves 
 i eat my <unk> alone in my room 
 context : my mom and i need to clean house desperately so we 're doing a deep clean and possession filter this week 
 stuff we want we keep stuff we do n't we trash or give to <unk> etc 
 so i 'm going through my room sorting things into piles of keep and donate 
 on my desk i notice a pillowcase 
 <unk> i did n't put that there ... i wonder what 's inside 
 * i look inside to see if i need to sort this 
 inside there 's a cleaning rag a couple of pens ... and a dildo 
 this is a big one too like a foot long and about the width of a <unk> ball 
 i have no idea what to say or do at this point 
 conveniently my mom <unk> this exact moment to walk in and check on my progress 
 she sees me holding the bag and her eyes instantly bug out 
 we stare at each other for a good ten seconds 
 it 's awkward 
 i hold out the pillowcase and say i think this is yours '' 
 all she can do is look back at me take it and say thanks '' 
 tl dr- found my mom 's dildo while cleaning palpable tension as i give it back <unk> 4 dayz edit : holy crap i did n't expect this to be this big 
 thanks y'all for making it this big 
 not sure if front page yet but still 
 edit 2 : hello /r/all 
 goodbye inbox 
 edit 3 : i finally figured out why there were so many comments involving broken arms 
 ew 
 edit 4 : <unk> gold 
 thanks 
 now i can tell my friends that my first gold and big post came from a dildo 
 but seriously thanks to the redditor who gilded me tifu when i went to see my friend with benefits for a study break 
 things got heated pretty quickly and soon i was going down on him 
 he <unk> me that he was going to cum so i tried to take a quick deep breath so i could finish him off 
 i was apparently too late because just as i <unk> he came and i immediately started to cough violently 
 feeling <unk> i totally left him hanging with the saddest orgasm ever while i had panicked thoughts of my mother finding out from the <unk> that i died due to drowning in cum while giving a bj 
 luckily i was able to catch my breath but have been coughing all day ever since 
 here 's to hoping that i do n't develop an <unk> pneumonia and have to tell a doctor what happened today 
 at least my lungs ca n't get pregnant 
 the slightly ironic part is that i actually got <unk> certified today so i just learned what to do when somebody is choking but would have had no way to save myself 
 tl dr- i was giving a guy a bj and cum went straight down my <unk> causing me to violently cough 
 my husband and i shower together regularly as we are big fans of being naked together 
 last night while my husband was washing his hair i decided to be a <unk> because thats just the kind of person i am and i thought it would be funny to shave one of his ass cheeks 
 after about four strokes with the razor he turned around and looking puzzled said are you shaving my butt '' 
 we had a little laugh but then he decided everything needed to be evened out so he went ahead with some all out <unk> balls and all 
 after the shower we got ready to lay in bed and watch the <unk> 
 normally we would never eat in bed but as we were in the middle of a busy stressful week we decided to plate up some nachos to eat while we watched the movie 
 my husband loves <unk> and goes all out when he makes them 
 he shredded fresh cheese cut up fresh <unk> warmed up some salsa and put it all on a tray so we would n't get crumbs everywhere 
 we eat our nachos watch our movie clean up and lay down to get some shut eye 
 after a kiss goodnight husband reached down to adjust himself and a few seconds later starts freaking out 
 he had never washed his hands after making nachos and just grabbed his freshly shaved balls with <unk> hands 
 we realized what was going on had to run downstairs and pour the last of the milk into a bowl so he could put his junk in it 
 so there we are at <unk> a.m. holding his bait and tackle in a bowl of milk in the living room while tears silently stream down his face 
 now i 'm telling strangers on the internet about it 
 tl dr : shaved my husbands ass and dipped his dick in <unk> was on the treadmill next to these hot chicks and i didnt want to look like a bitch so i put the speed faster than i usually do 
 well it was too fast and i ended up tripping over my feet and landed very hard 
 it took me a while to <unk> because i had the wind knocked out of me 
 the girl next to me stopped her workout and started asking me if i was ok. a gym attendant came over to check out the situation 
 i was extremely embarrassed and felt like a retard so in my most confident voice i put on a smile and said youre on camera it was just a prank 
 i thought my acting skills alone would sell that and i would be on my way but this fucking chick started asking me where the camera was 
 i pointed in a general direction and said my friend is over there filming 
 the gym attendant looked annoyed and asked me which guy is filming us so i started stuttering and looked for the most <unk> guy 
 i saw some fat guy on the bicep machine looking at me so i pointed straight at him and said that guy 
 i told them his water bottle is actually a camera 
 the gym attendant was angry and said we dont have permission to film here and said he wants the footage deleted 
 i apologized and said my friend will delete it if you ask him to 
 the gym attendant immediately started walking toward the fat guy on the bicep machine 
 thinking of the extremely embarrassing situation that was about to <unk> i literally booked it out the door 
 yeah im never going back there again 
 original post here : <unk> i posted this on tuesday but those <unk> mods would n't let me 
 it 's fine now 
 * okay so like i said i went into school today and at lunch went to the library 
 she was n't there this time around so i went to the cafeteria 
 now i had gotten strange looks and some laughs earlier in the day so i knew she had spread the word with my <unk> to masturbate 
 when i went into the cafeteria i saw her with her friends so i decided to sit alone at the table across from her 
 i had no lunch as usual so i simply stared at her for say thirty seconds before realizing i was being cringy so i went up and sat as close to her as possible 
 immediately her friends either giggled or called me nasty and told me to sit away from them so i acted 
 i read every single comment and i chose was i thought would be the most flattering and best plan by <unk> a couple of suggestions 
 in front of all her friends i said something like this : gf i 'm sincerely sorry for disgusting you 
 however i want you to know that the very reason i chose to jack off to you was because i cared about you '' 
 i obviously was n't that eloquent but she was blushing so i thought i was doing well 
 over all the naked women on the internet i chose your body to lust to 
 i had hoped you 'd think it 's flattering '' 
 i was wrong about how i was doing 
 do n't talk to me anymore '' said gf 
 i was desperate so i used what i learned from <unk> 
 gf i have n't jacked off to you in nearly a month 
 please i do not jack off anymore 
 not in 25 days '' 
 she ignored me 
 i left in defeat and shame 
 we 're officially broken up and i 'm now known as the fapmaster around school 
 *edit* i 'm fapmaster flash now 
 a lot of things happened since tuesday 
 this is n't the right sub for the story though.this literally just happened 
 so my boyfriend and i are long distance and like most long distance couples we tend to spice it up via facetime 
 this morning his sister had just gotten in the car to go to ikea so we started having a nice private session of <unk> sex 
 i was moaning and talking like you do when i heard a weird buzzing and stopped hearing my boyfriend 's voice 
 i kept moaning for a few seconds and then heard a very scared and <unk> hello '' 
 the video was still on my boyfriend 's face so i had no idea what the fuck was going on and was legitimately afraid someone had tapped our phones or something 
 i hung up 
 2 seconds later my boyfriend calls me back 
 his sister had taken his car to ikea 
 the bluetooth was on in the car 
 when she turned it on the audio synced to our facetime call while the video stayed on my boyfriend 
 my boyfriend 's sister heard me masturbating 
 fuck 
 edit : for clarity edit # 2 : hello fellow redditors 
 this is your friendly neighbourhood op 
 for some reason lots of you do n't believe the bluetooth scenario 
 clearly if i understood bluetooth this story would n't have happened 
 however bf 's house is a <unk> and his room extends out front and is right next to the driveway 
 it 's probably about 25 feet 
 i do n't fucking know 
 tbh it does n't really matter if you do n't believe me 
 it wo n't make it <unk> 
 i really wish it could because now my bf 's sister knows what i sound like when i flick the bean 
 goodbye and do n't make the same mistakes as <unk> literally just happened 
 i have time stamps to prove it 
 and no i 'm not using a throwaway because fuck it all 
 i 'm angry about it 
 this is also the short version and i 'm gon na be leaving out a few technical details 
 so i 'm a 911 dispatcher 
 i just started at a new agency in the middle of july 
 i had three years experience before starting here so this place decided i do n't need any official training 
 <unk> ... ..they 're so wrong 
 about an hour ago a poor old lady called 911 wanting an ambulance for her husband because he is n't feeling well 
 no problem 
 wait 
 they 're way out in the country where <unk> get <unk> 
 welp 
 so i 'm looking at my map and it 's telling me which ambulance i 'm supposed to send 
 easy right 
 nope 
 no one ever showed me how to page that specific crew 
 oh and there 's no instructions written anywhere that tells me how 
 so i guess 
 i find the correct '' speed dial button on my phone and dial 
 problem there is that the damn button is mislabeled 
 cool so they call back and say nope 
 not our area '' 
 <unk> 
 so i try sending the next closest ambulance 
 they say hey is n't that agency 's <unk> 
 sure is but i 've failed in <unk> them 
 alright well they said they would go 
 welllll ... <unk> this time it 's been 25 minutes 
 poor woman calls back and says husband is feeling better 
 we 're gon na go in the car '' 
 i 'm really glad and lucky it was n't something more serious 
 i could have killed that man 
 edit : well this blew up way more than i was expecting 
 couple things for clarification 
 i could n't ask anyone for help which i 'm more than okay with doing because i was alone 
 my coworker had too much overtime so they asked her to leave early 
 i did n't have a chance to say anything about her leaving and i do n't think it was up for debate 
 she was told by higher ups that she had to 
 yes my <unk> system told me which ambulance to send 
 that was n't the issue 
 the issue was the mislabeled button and not knowing how to contact anyone after that 
 i did eventually figure it out after the call was complete after searching through about eight different radio tabs 
 i know there are no written <unk> 's at this agency but that does n't mean i quit trying 
 so yes reddit 
 today *i* fucked up 
 i take full responsibility for the whole situation 
 i can say it was lack of training and no written <unk> which is still an issue but in reality i should have been able to figure it out a lot sooner than i did 
 this literally just happened 1 hour ago 
 so i 'm just sitting in the classroom working on some stuff when my art teacher comes to my friend and asks him if she can use his scissors 
 he does n't mind and hands her the scissors 
 she starts cutting something and in the corny mood that i am i say nice <unk> miss '' 
 just as i realised what i said she looks me in the eye with a cold look on her face 
 i immediately say that i 'm sorry after which she walks away and does n't speak to me again for the whole lesson 
 did i mention she 's lesbian 
 reddit tifu 
 i have some issues with <unk> <unk> and have had for a while 
 today i had to go to my doctor to get a rash on my dick checked out which i knew might be an issue but my doctor is usually a nice old guy so i figured i 'd be alright 
 when i got there though i was told i 'd be with a different doctor did n't recognise the name 
 got in and she was fine 
 i mean seriously beautiful 
 just the thought of this woman looking at my dick touching it made me feel all kinds of feelings and then bam 
 great 
 so i excused myself went to clean up said i suddenly needed to piss she seemed to think it was a bit odd but i guess she 's seen <unk> 
 i actually just did it again thinking about it 
 get back a couple minutes later and we discuss the problem she asks to take a look 
 i knew this was coming but i figured i just came so i should be fine right 
 nope 
 a single <unk> finger touches my tiny flaccid penis and it pathetically <unk> the tiny amount of <unk> that was left in me 
 hopefully it 'll be the old guy again next time 
 tl dr : came to the doctor 's came at the doctor came on the doctor 
 alternate tl dr : i came she saw no conquering involved 
 update for those weirdos wanting to know more : she was very professional about it asked if i wanted to clean up i did and then carried on and asked if i wanted help with it i am seeking medical help and therapy so hopefully that 'll sort it out 
 as for the guy who asked how much for some unfathomable reason : imagine letting a teaspoon of golden syrup drip down your fingers and you 've about got <unk> happened a couple months ago but whatever 
 i sat down at a computer in the student center at my school 
 there 's maybe a dozen other computers <unk> in the vicinity as well as a couple couches and <unk> pong tables for people to goof around on 
 as i started doing homework i figured i 'd put on my headphones and play some music 
 i had been telling a friend earlier about a song another friend and i had made in high school that literally just repeats <unk> '' and do the nasty '' a bunch of times 
 i load it up to listen again for a quick laugh and turn up the volume 
 as i was listening i noticed the song sounded kind of muffled so i turned it up a little more 
 it 's almost 30 seconds into the song and i realize what 's wrong just as a crucial point of the song came 
 as the drop approaches i scrambled for the mouse to hit the pause button but it was too late 
 the speakers shouted loud enough for everybody around to hear : sex 
 in the butt '' 
 song for reference : post 1 : post 2 : hello again reddit 
 it 's been 3 ish months since my last post about this and my inbox is having a slow death 
 quite a bit has actually happened in the past few months 
 i messaged the mods who gave me their blessing to post a final update 
 so this is it ... stop pm'ing me 
 we shall refer to my gf as megan '' and her sister as amy '' 
 january after thanksgiving amy stopped talking with us entirely 
 we tried calling texting we even went to her apartment and were told she had moved out about a week earlier by her <unk> 
 megan asked her parents if they had heard from her and they said that amy visited saying she was moving to another state east coast 
 her parents were surprised we did n't know about it and proceeded to ask a lot of questions that we dodged around trying to keep them out of the whole mess 
 megan used her parents phone to call amy she picked up and immediately hung up right after she heard megan 's voice 
 i told megan she just needed to give it some time and let everyone cool off until things got better 
 february amy called megan 
 i was n't home when the call happened work but the conversation was not productive according to megan 
 amy called saying she wanted megan to know how sorry she was and she did n't mean for this whole situation to be so <unk> 
 megan told her it was all water under the bridge she was n't mad anymore understood you ca n't control feelings i 'm a bit of a <unk> you get the point 
 amy did n't buy it and admitted she still has some feelings for me which proceeded with megan getting really pissed off 
 amy getting upset because megan said it was all fine but apparently it is n't 
 amy hangs up 
 megan vents to me about how she could still have feelings for me 
 i was a little pissed at the time as well but as we all know 
 getting over a crush is a lot easier said than done 
 megan realized her mistake of blowing up at her tried calling over and over with no avail 
 end of february i got engaged reddit 
 this may seem like horrible timing but megan and i have discussed marriage previously even before this <unk> 
 it was our 4 year anniversary since dating and i could tell she wanted me to propose 
 baby talk looking for a house subtle stuff 
 as you can guess she said yes 
 her parents had given me their blessing and we asked them to call amy and tell her for us 
 her parents are well aware that we are n't on speaking terms they understand us not saying what about 
 they did and we did n't get a call or anything from amy 
 two days ago amy showed up at our door 
 tears were shed many apologizes congratulation 's on the engagement 
 i excused myself to let them talk however i 'd be lying if i did n't say i was n't <unk> a tiny bit 
 short style : amy has a boyfriend now got a really nice job out on the east would like to come to our wedding 
 of course megan and i are extremely happy this whole mess is mostly sorted out 
 was a little awkward talking to both of them together 
 i 'm sure there will be a running sexting joke among us for a while **tl dr : amy moved did n't talk for a month megan and amy talk and get even more angry i <unk> engaged amy comes back we all made up wedding <unk> 
 stop pm'ing me <unk> edit : <unk> thank you for catching my mistake in the first post 
 much appreciated 
 edit 2 : obligatory front page excitement 
 also to those pm'ing me thank you for the kind words on my engagement 
 to those sending me videos of three some incest ... it 's still not going to happen 
 edit 3 : to those asking for a wedding update no 
 i promised mods i would n't post anymore about this 
 plus it 's months away and there 's really no need 
 if anything i 'll just make another edit on this post whenever the wedding happens and let you guys know 
 also i 'm not going to correct coach to couch 
 honestly too funny at this point.this just happened this morning 
 we were married several months ago so rest assured i 'm not writing this on our wedding day 
 for a wedding gift my wife bought me the most beautiful new breitling chronograph wristwatch 
 i had <unk> over them and lusted after one for many years thinking it would likely take me years to save up enough to buy one 
 my wife is the only thing i loved more than this watch 
 we had completed some work on our home over the weekend and because monday night is garbage night when i got home from work i needed to haul the garbage out to the curb 
 so being careful not to scratch my watch i remove it from my wrist and place it on the roof of my car in the garage 
 in the <unk> i get busy with a few things and forget it is there 
 she arrives home 
 we change clothes 
 we hop in my car and head to the gym as usual 
 we workout drive home cook dinner watch a movie go to bed 
 normal night right 
 i still to that point had n't realized i 've misplaced my watch 
 i wake up in the morning to head to my office as usual going through my normal morning routine 
 the last thing i do before leaving in the morning is to put on my <unk> <unk> kiss my wife goodbye and head out the door in marital bliss 
 only on this day it is n't sitting in the same spot in the closet where i normally leave it 
 the emotion shock and pure panic that i immediately feel is something difficult to describe 
 while i realize it is just a watch and the previous sentence may sound like an <unk> <unk> me to christopher <unk> 's character in pulp fiction this watch means so much to me 
 it is in an instant that i realize what i 've done 
 i sprint out the door in full business dress and walk up and down the streets of my neighborhood pouring sweat <unk> searching for my <unk> possession 
 it is at this time i realize i must go home and <unk> my wife 's help in potentially finding the watch 
 i will call in sick to work if i must 
 at the very least i need to tell her i 've lost it 
 she handles receipt of the news in the standard calm <unk> loving manner albeit internally she 's likely fuming mad in which she handles all bad news and we begin our search following a long discussion of where it might be 
 at this time many other theories for it 's location are offered and swiftly rejected 
 i know in my heart exactly what happened 
 we change back into active wear and set off to the first place we think it might be : the entrance to our neighborhood 
 i go left and she goes right careful to avoid being hit by cars on their morning commute 
 it is n't 30 seconds into our search when i turn around and she is holding the watch head above her own 
 an awesome sense of relief washes over me 
 we find remnants of the watch bracelet in the street undoubtedly having been run over many a time by passing traffic 
 she actually located the watch a mere six inches from a storm drain 
 what luck it was n't lost forever 
 it was even still ticking 
 <unk> are evidently built to the same <unk> standards as an <unk> <unk> tank 
 5 years ago she asked me to pickup bread from the grocery and instead i came home with a bag of peanut butter m & amp m 's and some beef <unk> forgetting the very item for which i went 
 i suspect this story will replace that one as the one of which i will never hear the end 
 here 's what it looked like when we found it 
 to quote <unk> <unk> : now if you 'll excuse me i 'm gon na go home and have a heart attack '' 
 tl dr - i lost my wife 's wedding gift to me a breitling chronograph wristwatch by leaving it on the roof of my car and driving off 
 fourteen hours later my wife and i find it near a storm drain just outside the entrance to our neighborhood 
 my wife then allows me to continue to live 
 edit : whoa 
 thank you for the gold kind stranger 
 i ca n't believe how much this took off 
 thanks to everybody for your comments 
 i 'll be sure to post a <unk> once it is <unk> my whole life i have been fluffing up and here is why 
 you may think the shampoo before conditioner rule is simple no 
 well so do i now but until less than a day ago this was not so clear too me 
 i 'll start at the begging 
 my entire life i have been washing my hair the <unk> way 
 i have been putting conditioner in before my shampoo 
 every morning i would get up and assume that everyone experiences their hair to be a texture like the dried up ground of mars or to think that theirs was very similar to thousands of pieces of straw 
 but no it was n't until i was talking to my friend about how they wondering what would happen if they put conditioner in before shampoo that i have been doing it all wrong 
 this morning i tried putting my conditioner and shampoo in the correct way round 
 after my shower i put my hands through my hair and it felt like a great goddess and had got a beautiful piece of <unk> from heaven and replaced it with my hair 
 it felt so glorious i realised what i had been missing out on 
 so yes reddit my whole life i have very much been fluffing up.obligatory this did n't happen today it happened a few months ago '' 
 a little background : i 'm from a north-african country <unk> to be more specific 
 our mother tongue is arabic and french is our second language 
 during summer me and two of my very close friends decided to go to a hotel and spend the day drinking and swimming 
 everything went as planned and we were having a good time 
 we had a few beers and started hitting on some girls by the pool 
 here 's where the fu started 
 instead of speaking arabic the whole time and being who we are i decided to lie to those hot girls and told them we were french 
 my friends had to go along with it 
 we were having the time of our lives when we heard a huge fucking explosion 
 boom '' followed by 10 seconds of silence and then everyone lost their mind 
 everyone was running for cover and we did n't know what to do so we got inside the hotel and stayed there waiting for police to come 
 our brains did n't realize what happened so we were still speaking french and pretending to be fucking tourists 
 here 's where the fu happened 
 police arrived at the scene and started talking to everyone in there and making sure no one got hurt 
 when they spoke to us we were still speaking french and told them we were tourists we did n't have <unk> or passports with us 
 no one bought it so they took us in 
 we went to the police station wearing nothing but some shorts and they started <unk> us 
 we were still drunk at that time and continued to speak french 
 they could n't know who we are so they assumed we were trying to blow up the place or giving information about the tourists inside 
 fml 
 long story short even after telling them who we were they were still trying to find something that would link us to the other suspects 
 we had to stay in custody for 5 days 
 and that 's how tifu reddit 
 tl dr : spoke in french ended up in custody and being mistaken for a terrorist 
 this happened a few years back 
 just a typical day in my sophomore year of high school 
 my first class of the day spanish 2 is just getting started 
 we start going over our new subject material which happens to be asking people their favorite things 
 our teacher has us counting off numbers to put us in our groups 
 me and the blind girl are the only group of two which i did n't mind because she was probably the <unk> of the class 
 anyways our teacher drew a random card only that the student could see 
 mine read <unk> <unk> <unk> color <unk> '' 
 which of course translates to what is your favorite color '' 
 as soon as i read the card to her silence 
 as i slowly looked up at me teacher the whole class slowly turned and stared at me 
 of course the blind girl did not have an answer and started crying 
 i sincerely apologized and went home for the rest of the day 
 our teacher never let us be partners again after that day 
 tl dr : spanish teacher set me up.i was just taking a stroll and decided to kick this rock in front of me 
 turned out to be a snail and now i feel like an asshole 
 edit : i was not expecting to this to blow up 
 and since i helped snail <unk> out so much i 'll walk by the same place tomorrow and fuck up every single snail i can find 
 and oh my god whoever gilded me is a boss and the snail probably thinks it was down just to laugh at him more 
 if he 's even alive ... let me start out the story by saying that i do not normally carry <unk> around in my school backpack however i had rolled them up in a pair of jeans for when i spent the night at my boyfriend 's place earlier on in the week and i assumed that when i took said jeans out the red lace <unk> that was carefully tucked within them was also thrown into my hamper 
 i believed this until i found myself whipping out my spiral notebook from my bag to take notes for a very impatient and vigilant professor with the panties hooked onto the wire binding 
 those exact panties were then flung from my notebook and of course they couldn’t fall out nicely right next to me so i could <unk> pick them up 
 no they flew through the air in a perfect arch with my <unk> eyes following them all the way to the ground where they had landed about 5 feet away from me 
 mortified i got up and retrieved my <unk> pair of underwear without a word then sat back down with a face that was probably only a shade or two off from the lace <unk> i quickly put back into my bag 
 the only person who was probably more traumatized than me was the professor who for the first time in the entire course found himself completely speechless 
 tl dr – sent my underwear sailing through the air at the beginning of a lecture 
 i 27 year old male live with a close female 29 year old friend of mine 
 i have known her all my life and she is like family 
 i came down for breakfast this morning and my roommate made a joke about interrupting my masturbating for eggs and bacon 
 it was funny 
 i laughed she laughed her boyfriend laughed 
 to take the joke a step further i joked back that i was not doing that the way to tell is to hand me something after i leave my room if i refuse to take it with my right hand then she knows 
 less laughter awkward silence ensues 
 i realize i made shit weird and change the topic 
 i put the whole thing out of my mind and go to work 
 when i got home from work today i went up to my room to read 
 when i came down my roommate walked out of her room handed me some papers nodded and walked off 
 every time i would come out of room she would come up and hand me something 
 finally it happened 
 i was browsing the internet and somehow found porn ... after i go to walk to the bathroom and my roommate hands me two books 
 i grab them both with my left hand and start walking away 
 she bursts out laughing and runs to tell her boyfriend 
 tifu by giving my <unk> a jerk off <unk> and she thinks it is hilarious 
 edit : today i came down for breakfast and my roommate hands me toast 
 i take it with my right hand walk to the table swap it with her toast with my left hand and proceed to carefully eat it using only the left 
 she had no idea how to react 
 after i was done i washed my hands and left her standing there trying to figure out what to do 
 edit 2 for clarification 
 my room is on the only room on the top floor 
 it opens to a set of <unk> stairs and leads to the hallway 
 her room is opposite the stairs 
 the bathroom is down the hall 
 i pass her room on the way to the bathroom 
 edit 3 for yet more clarification 
 i wo n't touch my dick and then not wash my hands after 
 i spent many years as a cook and some habits die hard 
 so there really is n't much to this story 
 my friends and i have been planning to have a drag day where we go to school as the opposite gender 
 i have been looking forward to this for a long time and naturally had some stuff planned out and ready 
 that is everything but something to press my boobs down 
 i did n't want to pay for a legitimate <unk> for a one or two day thing so i decided early on to use ace bandages 
 unfortunately the morning of i was running around frantically looking for the bandages and could n't find any so i thought fuck it i 'll just use ductape '' 
 that was my first mistake my second one occurred when i did n't use tissue or anything to cover up the nipples before applying ductape and so even originally i was extremely uncomfortable 
 i was unable to breath deeply and found out the hard way that coughing was a terrible thing to do 
 i went to school joked around with friends for a bit and then continued on with classes 
 then in third period a horrendous event occurred 
 i sneezed 
 and with that sneeze the ductape ripped and my boobs exploded out underneath my shirt i went from an a to a c in less than two seconds and was <unk> 
 not sure if anyone noticed but it would n't be hard to luckily i have a sweat shirt on hand and am currently wearing it 
 gon na make it through the <unk> damn it 
 do you know in windows sometimes when you start to type in a text box that you think is the active one but it is n't 
 and you notice only when what you 're typing does n't show in the text box you want so you click on it to activate it 
 that happened to me this morning 
 as usual i did n't really think much of it 
 so yeah i was calling someone a fucking cunt on reddit 
 they deserved it i carry no guilt there 
 but as i was typing this <unk> masterpiece my company 's it group decided my computer was n't safe on the network anymore because of lack of reboot to finish installing updates so i could n't access anything any longer 
 i figured i 'd do a quick reboot 
 when i did windows went through the whole do you want to save your changes to document <unk> '' 
 i click yes 
 come on just hurry up and reboot and stop asking these ridiculous questions 
 computer comes back and i get distracted by some email from a recruiter 
 i send my resume there 
 then i think oh well let 's <unk> the job sites shall we 
 i find four more great jobs for which i 'm totally qualified and <unk> upload my awesome resume 
 got an email right back hi lawrence please check your resume 
 i think there might be something wrong 
 thanks '' 
 opened word loaded the resume and there it is right in the <unk> : <unk> cunt <unk> edit : thanks for the gold 
 update : i figured there was no reasonable way i could come out of this <unk> so i did what any <unk> person would do i wrote a tifu 
 then i thought about it some more and thought fuck it and sent them the link to this 
 the recruiter responded that this was one of the funniest things she 's ever read 
 but she there 's no way she would submit me 
 so bittersweet 
 i have n't heard anything from the other four 
 edit 2 : apparently in my slumber this fu made the front page 
 sweet 
 anyway there is no update really but i want to say that i really like the mix of comments we have them all 
 the equal fuck-ups i did this too sorry bro '' the workplace efficacy committee how dare you do this while at work 
 the <unk> you use filthy language 
 you are a vile disgusting creature 
 the people who laugh at others misfortune i like you folks and the internet detectives did you notice he did n't put a space 
 something 's up 
 that space should not be there 
 i 'm calling bullshit 
 and the reddit front page <unk> committee this made the front page 
 reddit is going to hell 
 but yeah this really happened exactly in the manner i described in the original op 
 and i only sent the link to this to the person who contacted me 
 i did n't send it to all 5. that would be a really stupid thing to <unk> week i 'm on a <unk> '' <unk> i 'm staying with friends and family in <unk> of a vacation trip 
 the last few nights i had been at my mom 's 
 since my brother and i left the nest about a decade ago she has turned our rooms into guest rooms 
 thus staying here basically feels like a free bed & amp <unk> of my mom 's <unk> chinese <unk> and no we do not have general <unk> 's chicken or the numba 19 for dinner every night or on *any* night 
 she had probably gotten used to the feeling that the entire house is her <unk> as is her right ... which also means that she has gotten used to not knocking before opening closed-doors 
 my mom and i are close and i usually tell her about my new relationships so long as they 're at least somewhat one of <unk> <unk> 
 but the times i 've had a white <unk> or middle eastern girlfriend we broke up before she ever found out or i had no other choice but to reveal it like bringing the gf to a family wedding or my <unk> school graduation 
 i 've been dating a girl for exactly 3 months but i have n't told my mom about her 
 why 
 because she 's white or as my mom would say in <unk> slang <unk> <unk> my mom being an asian mother judges my <unk> just as much as she judges me why no <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 why no harvard 
 sorry a <unk> will have to do mama 
 the girl i 'm dating is in summer school so that she can finish a semester early in the state university in our city 
 going to a state school -- unless it 's <unk> or <unk> -- is frowned upon by my mom 
 me 
 i do n't care so long as she 's not the type to not know the difference between their and <unk> 
 so the combination of a <unk> <unk> girl a state school student and a girl about 9 years younger than i am is not exactly my mom 's dream 
 thus my mom thinks i 'm single and has zero reason to believe that i 'd have a girl over at her house day time or otherwise 
 this is crucial since maybe she would have been more cautious about opening closed-doors but that 's for later ... anyway mom works 7-4pm 
 i invite erin '' over for lunch 
 i cook her the numba 6 since it 's a <unk> occasion 3 month anniversary 
 she had class from <unk> and i went to bed around 3am last night writing the next great american novel faster than the speed of love part ii '' since i have no time during work to write 
 in other words we were both pretty tired by the time lunch was over 
 we nonetheless head back to my guest room '' and fool around for a bit 
 erin 's on her rag which i usually would n't mind for sexy time but erin 's not at that stage yet so there was a lot of <unk> and dry humping and it eventually led to some <unk> time i.e 
 i got a <unk> <unk> get it 
 bc i 'm asian and ca n't hit her throat <unk> er lol 
 being male having just finished eating and having just getting my nuts sucked through my urethra with her continuing to <unk> it after i finished which is part torture and part ecstasy you guys know that feeling ... i essentially got instantly paralyzed 
 we were both so tired that she left her top off and my shorts were around my ankles 
 we snuggled and kissed yes it 's just my own jizz show your girl some love and respect 
 the bed is <unk> 'd in such a way that the <unk> direction goes from the wall to the door so when you look through the door you see the bed <unk> beginning with the foot of the bed 
 my mom works 7-4pm 
 we finished around 2pm 
 the plan was to have erin leave before 4pm i.e 
 before mom gets home as a 31 year old it 's embarrassing i know 
 but we were <unk> <unk> tired 
 so tired that we were both <unk> and more <unk> we passed the f out within minutes 
 i figured a 20 min nap would n't hurt we might even get to watch a game of <unk> episode together before she leaves 
 but this was no ordinary nap 
 this was not a power nap but a <unk> nap 
 it 's the rip van <unk> type of nap that makes you feel like you just woke out of a coma and you have no idea what time or day it is 
 next thing erin and i know the door opens slowly with a slightly declarative death star '' 
 before fully opening 
 no knock nothing 
 as i hear my name i instantly realize what had just happened : we napped for over 2 hours and my mom 's home 
 this is summer which meant that we were fooling around and sleeping on top of the sheets -- no <unk> 
 the next 2 seconds felt like 2 minutes <unk> 
 erin 's first instinct was to put her forearm over her boobs and reach to the <unk> of the bed for her top which meant that she had to sit up and bend forward <unk> the door and my mom to grab her top no doubt that she could n't cover everything with her thin forearm and <unk> boobs 
 recall my shorts were still around my ankles 
 *my* first instinct was to pull up my shorts while on my back ... which meant that i threw my feet up in the air like i just do n't care well i did care ... and it was like i was doing a <unk> stand with my elbows supporting me 
 this meant that my back and ass faced toward my mom ... and my balls were almost tucked back between my thighs and i <unk> my mom 
 i monkey brained her 
 and i shot my feet upwards 2-3 times to try to get my shorts on more quickly which meant that my balls <unk> more and my thighs opened and closed in rhythm exposed to my mom 
 the monkey brain was bad enough but i also showed her a slightly agape asshole that was no less exposed than the average <unk> girl too shy '' to show her own <unk> 
 and again those leg jerks to try to get my shorts on just made my <unk> open and close accordingly 
 it was like my asshole was playing <unk> with my mom 
 with that classy display my mom shut the door as if <unk> park raptors were coming after her 
 erin and i were <unk> in shock 
 i honestly ca n't recall what we said other than do you think she saw anything '' 
 of course she did denial was potent and immediate 
 it was all a blur after this 
 erin got dressed i finally got my shorts on like a non <unk> 
 i opened my door slightly and i heard my mom downstairs <unk> and getting dinner ready 
 this gave us the ok '' for erin to slip out 
 so she did 
 i showered and then waited an hour before coming down 
 here 's the thing about many asian families 
 we do n't do awkward 
 well we do awkward things but we never talk about awkward things 
 it 's basically like fight club but for awkward situations 
 the first and second rules of awkward situations is you do not talk about awkward situations 
 times like this i wish i had one of those cool '' parents that i read about on reddit who makes jokes to break the ice and directly address the awkwardness 
 there was no <unk> the horn of <unk> could not break the wall at dinner 
 the whole night it was just <unk> statements and responses no eye contact 
 my mom was angry but she could n't express it via discussion since discussing it would be breathing life into something that never happened '' in my mom 's mind 
 i was mortified and while i 'm able to talk about awkward things it would 've been selfish to force that upon my mom 
 so the awkwardness just stewed and stewed 
 and it 's still <unk> 
 <unk> really 
 we ate dinner no words really 
 my mom did n't finish her dinner probably because she ca n't get the visual tea bag out of her mind or the image of a random '' white girl 's boobs spilling over her arm 
 such is life as an asian family 
 tomorrow i head to my brother 's place up north 
 literally the <unk> thing that can remedy this is time and now my watch begins 
 tl dr -- my mom walks in on me and my gf sleeping half naked and she sees boobs along with me upside-down <unk> her line of sight with an element of spread b-hole to bottom it off 
 being asian we did n't say a word of it -- or anything -- which let the whole awkwardness <unk> even more 
 edit : tl dr **edit2 : thank you for the gold and for all the <unk> compliments -- they made my day and were a great birthday gift bday was 4 days ago 
 ** so reading the story about the guy fucking the shit '' out of a girl reminded me of this story 
 your typical this didnt happened today but a few years ago '' so i was 22 and in the army 
 i had my share of one night stands and random relationships and so on 
 so i had met this girl and we dated on and off for a couple months 
 it wasnt super serious but we had fun and at that time thats all that <unk> 
 we broke up a few weeks before i went on leave vacation and hadnt spoke for about a month 
 as i was coming back we started texting 
 we werent ready to jump back into dating but decided to be fwb 
 so talking my entire drive back the subject of anal had come up 
 i had never done it but was eager to do so 
 she had done it a few times but she didnt think it was all that great but was willing to do it for me 
 we talked about all the aspects of it making sure she was cleaned up what i should expect and do and so on 
 by the time i got back in to town and took a short nap we were ready to hang out 
 we ended up watching a movie and hanging out 
 now i have to explain my <unk> 
 it was 3 separate rooms and a shared kitchen and bathroom 
 they kept the rooms that werent occupied locked 
 thankfully an incident had happened and a guy had kicked his door open and they hadnt been back out to fix it the guy had moved to another room already so we decided to use the room bare mattress and all to do the deed 
 we get down to business and everything is going good and im ready to mount up 
 so i start going to town and everything is feeling great and she is enjoying it too 
 i pulled out for a second and i stop ... i lock down at my dick and it is covered in shit 
 its not normal dark brown stuff but it was more of a grey <unk> color 
 i dont say a word but i run to the bathroom 
 i run to the shower and thrust me dick into the water trying to clean it off without touching it 
 she is waiting in the bedroom when i come back 
 as i start explaining it to her she realizes what happened 
 she glanced down at the mattress and there is grey specks all over the place they trail all the way up her leg and all over the place 
 we formulated a plan to get everything cleaned up and we both shower and she leaves 
 the story does have a happy ending because i ended up marrying her and <unk> been together almost 3 years now 
 tl dr girl pooped on my dick so i put a ring on it 
 edit : holy poop on a stick or on a dick maybe batman this blew up 
 some of the questions i keep seeing : i was young and stupid she claims she cleaned up multiple times guess she didnt get it all out 
 the gray <unk> was the poop 
 why was it grey 
 i have no idea i 'm not a <unk> and never cared to research it 
 she has no health problems she 's having <unk> surgery at the end of the month and everything says she is fine 
 i think she didnt realize poop was on her 
 she was probably embarrassed i mean i hauled ass to the bathroom as soon as i saw poop dick 
 edit2 : this blew up more than ever 
 thank you stranger for the gold 
 this is the best birthday present a redditor could ask for this happened in november 
 i recently found out about this subreddit and felt an urge to share this 
 backstory : i 'm a ~40 year old man from sweden 
 my parents and i were born in <unk> 
 i work as a professor at a university in southern sweden 
 i have a magnificent beard 
 after a week in new york city i was on my way back to sweden from jfk airport 
 i 'd been to a conference for 3 days and doing tourist stuff the other time 
 this was my first time in <unk> and it was amazing 
 jfk is a big airport and it took me some time to find my gate 
 i boarded the plane found my seat and sat down next to an indian gentleman with a red turban 
 i closed my eyes and mentally prepared for a long flight back to europe 
 after literally 2 seconds i hear a woman shouting look arabs hope to god there not terrorists '' 
 opened my eyes to see a <unk> year old lady staring at me and the indian with evil eyes 
 everyone in the plane was now standing up and looking at us 
 i felt more pity then anger towards her as i asked her in a calm way if she thought i had something hidden in my beard 
 the angry look on her wrinkly face changed to pure fear 
 security terrorists terrorists take em <unk> they have <unk> '' she yelled 
 lets just say the indian gentlemen and i missed our flights and i was searched in ways i did n't think was legal 
 in hindsight i <unk> feel more anger then pity towards the wrinkly <unk> **edit : wow this really blew up even got some gold 
 op not delivering <unk> tho 
 thing is ... i wrote this to prove how easy it is to fool y'all 
 wrote it in 10 minutes tops 
 do n't believe everything you read 
 i mean a <unk> without a beard 
 <unk> occasionally have weird <unk> walk events 
 usually these <unk> are based on something relevant in my life at the time 
 for example when i used to work at starbucks a few times i got up in the middle of the night and walked around the bed moving my arms and hands as if i was at the coffee bar making drinks 
 my wife is a light sleeper and always wakes up when i start my <unk> 
 she used to yell at me to snap out of the dreams but over time she has grown accustomed to it and basically <unk> it now 
 last night i watched the tron remake 
 and then i got up in the middle of the night picked up my ipad air and threw it really hard like a <unk> 
 ran after it 
 picked it up and threw it at the window in the bedroom 
 window did n't break but made a <unk> noise 
 i actually remember hearing this noise in my sleep and thinking that maybe i should n't be doing so much tron stuff 
 but i still ran over to pick it up again for another throw 
 threw it back really hard at the first wall 
 at this point my wife was screaming really loud for me to stop 
 i snapped out of it and went back to bed 
 the ipad still works but is badly dented in a couple corners 
 and i have a couple holes to patch up in the drywall 
 wife thinks i need to see a sleep <unk> do n't often get to see my grandmother but this time i made a special effort to drive the 4 hours to my house 
 my parents could n't make it and i did n't want to drive all that way alone so i invited my new girlfriend jess 
 jess is one of those kind <unk> people who love talking to old people and all that kind of thing so i thought it would be nice for my grandma to meet her 
 so we get there and it 's full of old people maybe 7 or 8 of them 
 my grandma is pleased to see me and jess and i are the center of attention for some time 
 we eat some sandwiches and drink some champagne and whatnot 
 then it hits me the sudden and overwhelming desire to poop 
 occasionally this happens to me like maybe once every couple of months especially if i have been working out a lot earlier in the day 
 anyway i go upstairs to the bathroom but some old dude is in there 
 i wait and i wait 
 i 'm there for about 5 minutes and i 'm now having to clench my butt every 10 seconds to stop the poop from coming out 
 i knock on the door and ask if the person will be much longer 
 no reply 
 oh god why wo n't they reply 
 are they dead 
 i ca n't wait any longer 
 my grandma has a weird set up where the toilet and the bath are in separate rooms but right next to each other 
 i bolt into the room with the bath hoping a toilet will appear 
 it does n't but i have an idea 
 i run downstairs clenching my butt the whole time sneak past the living room and grab a bunch of the little party serviettes 
 they 're pink with pictures of party <unk> and candles on 
 i have a whole wad of them 
 i reach the bathroom again shut the door and bolt it 
 i positively rip my pants and underwear off 
 then i desperately begin lining half of the bathtub with those serviettes 
 placing each foot on the side of the bathtub and holding onto the wall for support i let the poop fall out of my ass 
 there are a few wet farts but the poop is quite solid and falls out in two well formed large logs 
 they lie neatly on the serviettes and i briefly stop to imagine them with candles in 
 chocolate log cakes 
 i 'm suddenly filled with pride looking upon my creations 
 but i 'm sorry friends my grandma ca n't find you here 
 i wrap them both up as neatly as possible 
 little party parcels of poop 
 i take one carefully in my hand he 's heavy 
 i open the bathroom window and look down upon the new extension my grandma had built onto the house 
 it 's like another living room but almost entirely made of glass glass roof and walls 
 i can see that during the time i have spent pooping the party has moved into that room i can see there 's some kind of special set up a table with snacks and whatnot everyone gathering around it 
 that 's how big and clear these windows are i can see everything 
 but the only way of getting rid of these parcels is by throwing them out the window 
 or at least that 's what my <unk> post poop brain is telling me 
 i decide to launch it at an angle about 45 degrees out of the window it should be <unk> enough for no one to notice and land nicely in the neighbor 's yard 
 hopefully someone will mistake it for cake or an animal will eat it before anyone notices 
 that 's what i think to myself as i enthusiastically launch it out of the window 
 only the log is much <unk> than i thought originally 
 if you have ever tried to throw an <unk> <unk> too hard and had it explode in your hand before you are able to fully launch it you will understand what happened next 
 i threw it too hard and it was too soft 
 part of the log collapsed in my hand 
 i do n't exactly understand the physics but the poop broke into 2 one part the smaller part launched over the house extension but not quite into the neighbor 's yard 
 the bigger part fell directly down onto the glass roof of the extension 
 i watched in slow motion as it fell the wind blowing most of the party serviettes away only one holding on tight to the body of the log 
 the log hit the glass roof with a small but audible thud 
 holy crap 
 everyone looked up 
 crap 
 they kept staring 
 crap 
 i ducked inside the bathroom and closed the window 
 what do i do now 
 i put on my pants and look <unk> and the second log sitting in the tub 
 its little brown head poking out and looking at me in disappointment and fear 
 what was going to happen to him 
 <unk> n't worry little buddy your coming with me there 's nowhere else i can put you '' 
 i wrap him up tighter to keep him safe 
 it 's me and him against the world now 
 there 's no way i can see out of this situation no excuse i can think of 
 my girlfriend is going to leave me and my grandma is probably in the middle of a <unk> arrest 
 i grab my last friend in the world and place him carefully in my pocket 
 i walked downstairs like a prisoner about to be <unk> i was thinking of all the things i did wrong that led up to this moment 
 i was tempted to leave just walk out and drive home but what about jess 
 i waited in the hall hoping she would come out but she did n't no one did 
 i walked into the extension hoping that no one would really notice 
 i was wrong 
 everything was silent 
 some of the old people were still staring up at the poop 
 i decided against my better judgement to look up and see how ad it was 
 god it was bad 
 the glass was seemingly <unk> the poop 
 it looked even bigger from this angle 
 i ca n't lie though part of me was proud 
 and then the most awful thing happened 
 i laughed 
 i could n't stop giggling 
 i was so nervous i just laughed 
 i made eye contact with my grandma who is now standing directly in front of me 
 somehow in that split second i decided all of this would be so much better if it was a joke 
 <unk> 's just a joke '' i blurted out through my high pitched giggles 
 she started to cry 
 full on sobbing tears running down her face she could n't even speak 
 i do n't know what she was trying to say but the words would n't come and i well i just carried on giggling 
 i now knew it was time to leave 
 jess was in complete shock 
 i grabbed her and made for the door 
 i did n't know what else to do 
 she did n't say a word 
 as we left the house desperate to get away from this place as quickly as possible i plunged my hand into my pocket to grab my keys 
 i plunged my hand into my pocket 
 my poo pocket 
 the consistency was indescribable 
 soft with hard lumps 
 gooey but almost silky 
 i immediately pulled my poo covered hand out of my pocket poo and bits of wet <unk> were stuck to my fingers 
 i shrieked 
 i stood there staring at my hand 
 jess took one look at me came closer as if she did n't quite understand then she realized what it was 
 we made eye contact i do n't know why but in that moment i thought a smile would make everything better 
 it did n't 
 without a moment 's delay she turned away and vomited 
 it was only a little vomit like orange spit 
 maybe a <unk> 
 but still ... i made my girlfriend vomit 
 she did n't look at me again she literally ran back into my grandmother 's house 
 i stood there knowing i needed to leave now more than ever 
 i searched for my keys but to no avail 
 the theory i have now is that they must have fallen out of my pants when i so enthusiastically ripped them off during the crisis 
 so i put my hand back in my pocket in order to hide it and walked down the busy main street for 20 minutes in order to get on a 3 hour train to go home 
 i have n't slept since getting home 
 i have n't heard from my grandmother or girlfriend and i have no idea how to retrieve my car 
 ahhh fuck it 
 here it goes ... last year i 27yr old male had a 7 month <unk> hell hole of a relationship with a gorgeous insane cocaine fiend 27yr old female 
 now in all honesty although i had been clean for 18 months prior to meeting this sexy <unk> i had had a drug career spanning 12 years that would make charlie sheen 's eyes water 
 i 've ingested drugs that have altered my optical world into a completely different <unk> akin to a <unk> <unk> disney movie 
 <unk> <unk> that have resulted in my penis hiding inside my body resembling a tiny frightened vagina and on one binge in particular mixed two tabs of acid with powerful horse <unk> <unk> which resulted in me perpetually looking inside my boxer shorts to see if i 'd soiled myself every 45 seconds for 9 straight hours 
 but your hear for shit arent ya 
 so i 'll continue 
 i had had no inclination that my so had a habit of her own for the first 6 weeks of our 'relationship 
 however on one friday night she arrived at my apartment for drinks and <unk> related activities and i could instantly spot something amiss 
 she <unk> back and forwards throughout my pad demolishing glass after glass of cheap wine and filling my head full of at this point only verbal shit 
 as someone who had pushed my body above and beyond its chemical limits i <unk> that cocaine was the culprit 
 my only fear at this point was that she had <unk> all of the pretty white powder to herself and that i was going to be <unk> to hours of unrelenting verbal <unk> sober as a judge 
 this would be an unbearable evening 
 so i come forward and come straight out with it 'so have you got any coke left 
 she looks perplexed startled 
 she ca n't believe she 's been <unk> 
 with her oscar winning 'i 'm not on high grade cocaine performance 
 oh please 
 the ambient lighting in my apartment is <unk> in my eyes off her sweaty glistening forehead 
 she 's clenching and <unk> her fists the shit she 's talking about oh the shit she 's talking about 
 quit the game sweetheart your on drugs and i fucking want some too 
 after explaining how i knew to her pretty stupid face she proceeds to reveal the <unk> 
 it 's good and there 's plenty to get both our <unk> racing 
 we begin <unk> the ill gotten <unk> like a pair of <unk> hunting pigs 
 fuck yeah i 'm high let 's fuck 
 i do n't know if you readers have <unk> in a good rail or two of high grade cocaine but if you have n't allow me to explain 
 the first line fired up your <unk> will instantly release a months worth of constipation at a speed that makes the speed of light look like snail pace 
 it truly is the most effective laxative 
 it 's unfathomable 
 she has not shat on me yet 
 we begin <unk> in cocaine <unk> sex and its incredible 
 the sexual chemistry is immense every breath of each others is felt every desire noted 
 you have n't fucked until you 've fucked in coke 
 in my head i imagine my dirty little coke fiend and i are like gods and <unk> picture brad pitt and and <unk> <unk> 
 proper <unk> grant romcom shit 
 in actual fact we were two out of breath sweaty <unk> coke heads <unk> fucking in a <unk> apartment in the <unk> of nowhere 
 but i digress 
 another thing about decent cocaine is that it can revert a mans <unk> into the pitiful size it was as a child 
 do n't ask me to explain how ask science 
 were <unk> and she is trying to make do with what can only be described as a nub of wrinkled skin attached to two sorry looking balls 
 she 's one lucky girl i 'm a great catch 
 i dart my tongue in and out of her sopping hole then ass 
 hole ass hole ass 
 asshole 
 that 's where shits made 
 i apply fingers 
 fingers in asshole toungue in pussy 
 fingers out of asshole enter tongue enter foreign object 
 a nugget of foreign object <unk> and hits my front teeth 
 my eyes water my nose points north my tongue <unk> 
 drawing her produce into my fucking mouth 
 now i do n't expect you to know what human shit tastes like and nor should you 
 dig deep in your memory and think of the <unk> smelling fart that <unk> had the displeasure of chewing 
 times that by an incomprehensible number 
 then times that by ten 
 your still nowhere near what it tastes like 
 so yeah i ate some shit 
 tl dr arrange my funeral bring the <unk> she opened her hole and shit on my <unk> ... this just happened about an hour ago 
 i just woke up and felt the urge to do my morning wee 
 i walked into the bathroom and as i did i noticed a rather large house spider lurking next to the toilet 
 now i do n't have a <unk> of spiders per <unk> but once they get to the point that you can hear them thump on the floor when they fall off a surface i start getting a bit panicky 
 this particular spider was n't enormous but it definitely was n't small either 
 so i sit down whip out my phone to check if anybody had anything interesting to say on facebook no and felt the sweet release of <unk> 
 ah bliss 
 now this is the part where everything went horribly wrong 
 i <unk> some toilet paper and folded it over ready to wipe when - oops 
 i dropped it 
 thinking fast i snatched it just as it hit the floor yes the floor is clean and brought it back up to wipe 
 wait 
 what was that on the paper 
 some <unk> 
 a <unk> 
 these are all the thoughts that were going through my head as i brought the paper ever closer to my lady parts when i should have been thinking abort now for the love of christ stop what you 're doing '' 
 but no 
 the paper engaged 
 then as i was wiping i realised what had happened 
 in the split second it had touched the floor it had landed directly on the spider and it had hitched a ride to its urine soaked death 
 i took the paper away and saw the spider sat directly on my vagina 
 the next part still <unk> me now but in between my scream and jumping off the seat i decided in my wisdom that i also needed to make sure this thing was dead 
 so i punched it 
 yes i rammed that fucker into my pussy as hard as i could 
 at this point i 'm crying and trying in vain to wipe the spider corpse out of myself but i 'm just <unk> it around 
 so i 'm just covered in tears snot urine and spider guts and i have n't even had coffee yet 
 the half hour shower i took still has n't made me feel clean and i ca n't even begin to explain to my husband what the hell happened 
 edit : thank you very much for the my first gold : i did n't realise it was my <unk> too 
 and thank you to everyone for their comments i feel much better now 
 some quick answers to some questions i 've been <unk> no the spider did n't go inside '' me when i hit it it was a term of <unk> however in the aftermath of wiping i ca n't be sure where any parts of it have ended up without putting a <unk> down there which i 'm not willing to do 
 sorry for my lack of formatting i 'm on reddit is fun and it does n't seem to like page breaks 
 this one is from back in my kindergarten days ... so there i was one of the few white <unk> in my south side <unk> elementary school 
 one day i 'm hanging out on the playground when this little black boy runs up to me and asks will you marry me '' 
 i panicked and kicked him in the <unk> and ran away 
 shortly after i 'm sent to the principal who is also black 
 she asks me why i kicked the boy and i began to panic 
 i was only in america for a short time and my english was very poor 
 i quickly thought back to when i did n't want to deal with peanuts because i did not like them and i would say i was allergic to them and bam 
 no more peanuts to be dealt with 
 using this logic i did n't want to deal with this situation so not knowing what allergic means i told my black principal that i was allergic to black people 
 shocked she called my mother who had even poorer english and my mom confirmed that yes indeed i was allergic to black people 
 after all what in the world could allergic mean 
 tl dr : terrible english led to unintentional racism 
 edit : i see some people are linking me not liking peanuts with not liking black people 
 the way i wrote this i can see how that indeed comes off as <unk> racism 
 i meant i did n't like eating peanuts and i did n't like being in this situation 
 the way the principal spoke with me made me feel like i was in trouble because she felt that i kicked the kid because he was black and therefore i said i 'm allergic to black people '' 
 most of my friends were black since it was a <unk> black community and i continue to have black friends that i love dearly though i get people can have black friends and still be racist 
 i honestly did not mean to offend anyone with this and i 'm sorry for those that i did 
 i stopped watching porn about a year ago 
 there were a variety of reasons but the important part for this fuck up is that i do n't watch porn 
 how do i get myself off you ask 
 i write sex stories 
 i get a story in my head type it out and do the deed 
 here is where this becomes a fuck up 
 a month ago i was horny and home alone so i wrote a story 
 it was n't a sexual fantasy that i would want for myself but it was fun to write 
 in this story a guy writes a story about his wife totally <unk> him in a variety of <unk> ways 
 wife finds the story and plays it out for him 
 you can see where this going 
 i wrote the story got off and forgot about it 
 flash forward to last night 
 i get a text from my wife right before i leave work 
 meet me in the bedroom when you get home '' 
 this is great i think 
 we 've been in a little sexual slump lately and a good bang is what we both need 
 what do i see when i get home and walk into the bedroom 
 wife in leather <unk> and thigh high <unk> with a riding crop and strap on dildo 
 short skirt and panties for me on the bed 
 <unk> 
 the worst part was the look on her face 
 it was this really <unk> look like i would never do this normally but i 'm trying really hard to make you happy '' 
 she read the story and reasonably assumed it was what i wanted 
 the selfish part of me wanted to explain the situation and back out but i thought of how embarrassed she would feel 
 therefore i said fuck it lets go '' 
 did i get fucked in the ass wearing panties and a skirt 
 yes 
 was it worth it to make my wife feel good about herself 
 absolutely 
 edit about what i 've learned my wife 's reaction and the story : i 've learned a lot in these past few days 
 first more guys are into being penetrated than i thought 
 second i would have totally dismissed being <unk> a few days ago 
 after a mostly good experience i realized that i need to be more open sexually with my wife 
 more communication about our wants and needs and so forth 
 i should also work to try new things that she might like 
 third i have discovered that one can <unk> generally quality content regularly to his favorite subreddit for years and accumulate roughly 600 <unk> karma and zero reddit gold 
 that same individual who involves himself in a misunderstanding that results in his whipping cross dressing and penetration of two of his <unk> by both body parts and a plastic <unk> can gain two months of gold and over a thousand upvotes 
 an interesting <unk> that i judge neither positively nor negatively though i thank my wealthy benefactors 
 i told my wife that i had never intended to act out the story and was pretty shocked when i arrived home 
 the fact that we both enjoyed ourselves made it less a confession and more a casual aside 
 she responded that she had never expected to actually go through with it until it was happening 
 we agreed that we could occasionally incorporate some aspects of our previous evening into foreplay and sex but it would not become a regular thing 
 finally the issue of the story 
 what my wife found was the first of a five part <unk> where the <unk> 's life <unk> out of control as a result of writing stories that essentially come true 
 part two would be an extension of the first but incorporate aspects of public humiliation 
 part three would deal with <unk> four with cheating and five with the resolution 
 i am pretty glad that i only finished most of part one 
 if i had the thing finished or worse partly finished she probably would have thought i was insane or a complete deviant 
 i am <unk> between posting what i 've finished part one actually writing the entire story and posting everything or posting nothing 
 i almost see the story like the conclusion of a <unk> king novel 
 it exists better in your imagination than on paper 
 anything i wrote would <unk> what you have envisioned 
 thus i need some time to think it over 
 edit 2 : thank you to /u/cyae1 for narrating my adventure 
 so i made this sex calendar as a joke for my boyfriend who 's in town right now 
 i put it on the fridge so i can reference it from time to time ... specifically when i want it 
 fast forward to yesterday for some reason my power was n't working correctly in some rooms it was on in others it was n't so i called my dad over to see if he could figure out what was going on 
 i completely forgot about the calendar on my fridge and he walked around the apartment checking <unk> to see what worked and what did n't 
 it was n't until i went to get something to drink from the fridge that i saw it and realized i had to hide it immediately which i did 
 i was n't sure if he had seen it but he had n't said anything so i hoped for the best 
 then in the evening i get a call from my mom 
 she just wants to talk like always but then she says my dad said i have very interesting choices of fridge <unk> 
 i did n't know what to say i just laughed and pretended like i did n't know what she was talking about but now i have no idea how i 'm going to look my parents in the face the next time i see them 
 tl dr i made a calendar that said i want my boyfriend 's dick every day and my dad saw it.so today i got home from work tired and tense and in need of a shower 
 i immediately had the brilliant idea to take the edge off my mood with a little help from my brand new $ 100 vibrator but i could n't decide which to do first the shower or the me time '' 
 another brilliant idea emerged : i could simply do both at the same time and if it resulted in me lying in the bottom of my tub muttering heated <unk> to my shampoo bottle so be it 
 the vibrator had been <unk> as fully <unk> so i did n't think there would be any problem with taking it into the shower even though the cashier at <unk> 's had told me that that particular line of <unk> <unk> to have an issue with the charging port on the bottom where the seal would wear down after a <unk> or two and no longer be <unk> 
 i ignored this nugget of wisdom in favor of awesome shower bliss and all seemed to be right with the world 
 that is until i actually checked the vibrator after using it 
 i was still in the shower but even still i could see definite <unk> <unk> from the charge port seal 
 shit i possibly ruined my new vibrator 
 i spent so much money on that thing 
 what could i do 
 i immediately had my <unk> <unk> of brilliant ideas which was to immediately try to suck out the water 
 the charge port was n't on the business end so i figured it could n't be that gross 
 cue the taste of blood to remind me it could be that gross because aunt <unk> was in town and apparently had accompanied the water up the charge port 
 there was n't much water in the vibrator but i still got a definite taste of uterine lining 
 nothing makes you realize your own stupidity like having to <unk> back the line of thought that made sucking liquid out of a recently used vibrator seem like a good idea 
 vibrator still works though so i 've got that going for me which is nice 
 tl dr : did n't believe my new expensive vibrator 's advertising would lie to me so i ended up sucking period water out of it to try to save it from <unk> have a deal with the company i work for where they pay for my train fair i.e 
 i buy a monthly ticket give it to the secretary and then get <unk> for it 
 so every first of the month i buy the ticket at the ticket machine before getting on the train and for the rest of the month just <unk> it in the same slot in my wallet 
 unfortunately due to friction during the course of every month the writing on the ticket fades more and more and four weeks in the letters are just barely visible 
 i had received multiple complaints from the ticket <unk> understandably i basically showed them a white piece of paper at the end of the month 
 once i had almost been thrown off the train 
 after about half a year of this i have an idea friction wo n't be able to harm something that is laminated right 
 the tickets are small enough to fit into the standard business card size lamination pouches of which my company has plenty lying around perfect 
 so feeling pretty good for having this genius idea i set everything up and wait for my little problem to disappear as the pouch with the ticket gets slowly pulled into the machine 
 about 20 second later i see the ticket appearing on the other side but wait why is there just a laminated black bar coming out and where the hell is my ticket 
 then it hits me thermal paper 
 for those of you who do n't know thermal paper <unk> when heated so you do n't need printer <unk> used for tickets and such the thing about lamination machines is you ca n't just stop them you ca n't just rip the whole thing out no i had about a minute of watching the true <unk> of my idea unfold 
 so i take the damn thing go to customer service to try to explain the situation but after the first sentence she turns her head and says to her colleague <unk> another one 
 apparently two weeks earlier someone had the same idea as me 
 i get a replacement ticket with an <unk> note stapled to my black bar for the rest of the month and head home to my family 
 at the dinner table i struggle whether to tell this embarassing but also quite funny story 
 in the end i decide to tell them 
 and here it comes : when i was finished with my story and expected to be made fun of my dad says <unk> the same thing happened to me two weeks ago 
 tl dr tried to laminate a train ticket that was printed on thermal paper ended up with a black bar turns out my dad had the same idea two weeks prior edit : added explanation of the concept of thermal paper update/comment/whatever : shoulda <unk> woulda 
 i was so <unk> by the sheer brilliance of the idea that at no point did it occur to me to think of <unk> 
 and the country is <unk> btw so yeah we 've heard of <unk> but mostly still use hammer and chisel on a stone plate and yes a stone plate probably would have <unk> the laminating : update/comment/whatever # 2 : <unk> <unk> upvotes 
 thx you guys 
 and i hate the fact that due to countless tv series and movies this number even means something to meso i met a girl on tinder and she seemed really nice and pretty so after a week or so of talking we decided to meet up before i even met her at the bar i get a text that says you better not be in this for the sex ... i did n't even bother answering i get there and she is <unk> <unk> than in her pictures and later find out they were from 4 years ago ... she eventually starts talking about how she is n't happy with her size 
 i am a bigger guy myself so i told her why do n't you do what i do i go to the gym and diet and i 'm down <unk> so far she called me an <unk> asshole ... so then later we started talking about snowboarding and i showed her pictures of my <unk> trip and she saw one of me and my close friend who happens to be a girl well apparently she did n't like the fact that i had a close platonic friend because all she did was question me about her for an hour i eventually said i 'm sorry i have to go and left her with the bill for my two beers 
 as i 'm on my way home i get a text that said look what you are missing out on it was a nude picture of herself and two videos of her masturbating and the last text said she would have played with my g spot ... it was not a pretty sight and i just blocked her number ... so yes that was my crazy date edit : plutonic to <unk> off i am sorry for not articulating myself too well english is not my first language 
 well when i read all this tifu posts i find myself thinking : done that '' to a scary amount of the posts but then it hit me i <unk> seen anything like this tifu before so here it goes 
 just to make things clear : in norway drinking age is 18. and the sexual age is 16. to long to read 
 it 's in audio now 
 this happend about 10 years ago i was 17 years and the legal drinking age in norway is 18 but i looked older so i snuck in to a bar 
 i was drinking having fun and start to talk to this lady 
 she did not drink so we talked about that for a while while i was getting more and more drunk 
 i remember that i thought she got nice teeth '' 
 yeah that drunk 
 <unk> 
 out of the blue she asks me if i wanted to go to her place 
 i thought well i 've done worse '' and well we left 
 she told me she was 28 years old and i was impressed 
 i was finally getting an experienced girl 
 <unk> i could learn something new from this chick ... well we get to her place and she gets undressed so did i. she goes down on her knees to give bj i remember thinking how long does it take to get the d in her mouth '' she finally started and wow what a bj it was the best i 've ever had 
 better than any sex i 've ever had before 
 well after a period of time i was done and that 's where i realised the fu 
 she looked up at me and smiled and she was fucking toothless 
 she had <unk> out the fake teeth and layed them on the floor under her 
 i never noticed that because ... <unk> ... shitfaced 
 enough said 
 i started screaming like a girl and started walking backwards i did n't see the shower <unk> and fell in her shower while hyperventilating making small <unk> noises 
 for f sake 
 she looked like a toothless <unk> eating <unk> 
 well needless to say i was scared out of my wits so i ran over my clothes taking them with me hiding in the kitchen trying to get dressed 
 she came out to the kitchen and she had put her teeth in again i was still scared as hell so i ran out 
 she started calling me but i did not answer but after constant calling for 2 hours i took the call and the weird thing was that she started apologizing to me 
 i was shocked 
 on top of it all i needed a place to stay for the night so what the hell 
 long story short 
 i dated her for a year and had a whole year full of fantastic bj 's 
 oh and she had a <unk> and that is why her teeth fell out 
 and yes i know i was an asshole for reacting like that but i panicked 
 tldr : got a bj from a toothless girl got scared fell in her shower while trying to <unk> ... this happened last friday but <unk> 
 i have been hanging out with this girl for about a year now lets call her yuki '' who is by far the most attractive girl i have ever see gave up being a model in tokyo to study 
 so its a standard friday i go to the bar and meet up with a bunch of friends 
 we are all getting drunk and partying hard when yuki '' comes up to me and says that she is very drunk and feeling bad and wants me to take her back to her place 
 in the taxi she was getting pretty frisky and playful which i ca n't lie and say i did n't like ... but when she said she was very drunk was a huge understatement 
 so anyways i carry her up stairs get her into her place and set her on the couch 
 she said she was thirsty and that she felt like she was going to puke so i went and grabbed her a glass of water and a bucket 
 i walk into the living area and she is butt naked bent over the arm of the couch looking back at the <unk> to the kitchen 
 this girl is fucking fit 
 <unk> and yoga have left this girl in flawless condition 
 i almost died of massive blood loss upon entering the room 
 she looks over her shoulder at me and says i want it bad ... i have wanted it bad for so long ... i <unk> it '' and then <unk> horrible <unk> cocktails all over her hair and couch 
 i carried her to the bathroom and got her into the shower and after a few minutes so comes out and wraps her arms around me and kisses me the most nasty second hand cocktail ever 
 i moved back and kissed her forehead and said that we should try this again sometime when she is n't completely wasted 
 grabbed her some <unk> and got her to bed then let myself out 
 apparently she did n't go to sleep ... instead she <unk> her semi abusive ex 
 and now they are back together talking about getting married 
 fuck my life 
 tldr : 10/10 girl gets wasted and tries to fuck me hard i be the gentleman my mother raised and leave 
 edit : 
 my fu is not moving in on the obvious attraction from the previous year ... let shit get all twisted and weird and let an amazing but damaged girl slip past 
 edit # 2 
 was drunk and wrote this 
 probably left out a large portion that left me seeming a tad rapey 
 lil backstory ... her ex basically told her she is nothing except tits and ass and ruined her career and life with insecurity since high school 
 she quit her job to try and go to school and get a real job because she hated herself 
 some <unk> syndrome type stuff 
 tifu by not <unk> up and making the first move months ago 
 final edit 
 drunk more than semi <unk> is me sounding post aside 
 if you get a chance travel 
 teach english on the other side of the world save up some money doing that then travel around europe 
 and basically get <unk> adventures in 
 someday you will be old and out of chances 
 visit womb club in <unk> once at bare minimum 
 <unk> edit : no i do n't think not raping a girl needs praise and no not raping her was n't the fu in this tifu 
 the fuck up was the couple months before all of this because i was kinda being a man whore with people not in my group of friends 
 which btw is not hard at all as long as you fall somewhere between <unk> hill and brad pitt on the have a white dick scale '' and have the confidence to not be a <unk> 
 she broke it off with him last night 
 turd got drunk and started pushing her around and insulting her with shit like thank me for making you quit <unk> 
 you are too ugly to be one anymore '' and things along those lines 
 do n't care if i never get to give her the d at least she is n't marrying a soul <unk> sometimes when i show friends or people how you can request money over google wallet i 'll send a request for a few thousand bucks to close friends with a note saying something like for my ransom '' or need crack '' 
 they know whats up they read it chuckle and reject the request it 's all good 
 except today i got this email from google ... edit : all out of inbox invites <unk> and <unk> and <unk> enjoy your inbox everyone else go bother those guys : this happened just umm <unk> minutes ago 
 i was browsing reddit and happened upon an especially funny thread 
 usually nothing i read here makes me laugh but that one made me break up 
 i <unk> the laughter <unk> with a mix of fake coughing and just keeping my mouth shut 
 unfortunately this made my face turn red and my co-worker think i 'm choking 
 she proceeded to tackle me what 
 and do some bonecracking <unk> thing she thought was <unk> 
 this caused quite a commotion and other co-workers came over to see me pushed against the wall with the female co-worker sitting on me and crushing me while my face is all red and i 'm huffing and puffing 
 on the plus side my face was in her <unk> for a few minutes i kind of did enjoy that 
 that there were hundreds of little baby ants swimming in it 
 this happened a while ago 
 i was walking through a busy underground train station on my way to a job interview when i saw an old lady struggling to push her trolley into an elevator a wheel had become jammed in front of the doors 
 this interview was super important and i had planned ahead by leaving early and giving myself an extra 30 mins in case something went wrong 
 i figured i had more than enough time to help this lady out 
 i tucked my portfolio with my resume and all my original documents and certifications under my arm and offered my help 
 she gladly accepted 
 however as i was pushing her trolley into the elevator i forgot i had tucked my portfolio under my arm 
 gravity and the worst kind of luck took their course and my portfolio fell right down the gap between the floor and elevator doors 
 oh dear i hope that was n't anything important '' said the old lady 
 i did n't have the heart to tell her what i 'd just lost half an hour before one of the most important job interviews of my life 
 do n't worry 
 it was nothing 
 have a great day '' 
 i said <unk> a smile and walking away before freaking out like a mad man 
 i did n't know whether to laugh or to cry and frantically started calling the elevator company to see if there was anything i could do 
 the guy on the other end just laughed at me and said that the best they could do would be to take a look early the next morning but added that it was quite likely my portfolio would be wrecked and greasy 
 additionally there would also be a hefty service fee involved 
 needless to say <unk> was a bit of an understatement 
 after calming down and <unk> with myself for a few minutes i decided that i should still go to the job interview seeing as i had already made the trip 
 besides i figured that the worst that could happen is that i 'd be turned down 
 now slightly behind schedule i ran and managed to get to the interview just in the nick of time 
 hi nice to meet you 
 how 's your day been '' 
 the interviewer asked as i shook his hand 
 i could tell he was feeling a little uncomfortable 
 i 'd just given the <unk> and <unk> handshake of my life 
 <unk> honestly ... i 've just had one of the worst 30 minutes of my life '' intrigued and a little surprised he asked me what had happened 
 i told him my story and he laughed until his face went red 
 the rest of the interview went surprisingly well after that 
 a few days later i got a call 
 the interviewer loved me and despite me not having a portfolio i got the job 
 in closing whilst tifu more importantly til that even the worst kinds of situations may surprise you in beautiful ways 
 **tl : dr** i helped an old lady and lost my portfolio with all my original certifications down an elevator shaft half an hour before a really important interview 
 this fu happened yesterday night 
 so my sister who lives nearby had to go out shopping for a bit and decided to leave her 5 year old daughter with me 
 i have <unk> coming up so it 's not the best time to babysit but being the good brother i am i agree 
 the night is uneventful and it 's getting way past her bedtime so i take her upstairs to my room to sleep 
 a few minutes later she comes down and tells me sing me a song so i can go to sleep '' 
 i am really <unk> with my studies and being the lazy ass i am i tell her i 'm really busy right now but you can just go on my computer it 's right by the bed and search 'go to sleep on youtube and you 'll find a bunch of songs '' 
 yes she knows how to use a computer kids these days 
 anyways a few minutes later my sister returns 
 she comes in and i tell her proud as ever that i put her to sleep by playing a lullaby on youtube 
 so we walk upstairs and as we near my bedroom we can start hearing a <unk> it sounds nothing like a lullaby 
 walk in and all we hear is ... and go to sleep bitch 
 die motherfucker die bye bye motherfucker bye bye 
 go to sleep bitch 
 why are you still alive 
 why 
 die motherfucker '' 
 i do n't even know why i said to type go to sleep '' and not lullaby '' or some shit 
 i 'm retarded 
 pretty sure i 'm not <unk> her again 
 i finally succeeded by basically pressing the razor as hard as i could and <unk> rubbing it back and forth as fast as possible but i 'm so so raw and incredibly late 
 i guess i should edit this since it 's getting a lot of attention 
 i was planning to use my electric clippers but they had been unused for so long they did n't hold a charge despite being plugged in all night 
 i did cut the beard down with scissors after <unk> the clippers did n't work 
 it was originally 3 or 4 inches long before i cut it 
 but i did n't have time to cut it super well cuz i was late so i sorta panicked and tried to improvise 
 it was n't a job interview i was returning to work after being on <unk> for awhile 
 yes i still have the job 
 and yes my boss is already well aware i 'm a dumbass 
 as to why i waited until the last minute it 's kind of a long story but i was sort of living out of my <unk> surfing the prior week then i moved into a new place over the weekend and just finished unpacking the night before 
 i 'm also very lazy and like to sleep in 
 i 'm gon na dip out now and let you all enjoy my stupidity 
 no further questions 
 after work edit because i care enough to show everyone who 's freaking out about me being a waste of human life that i was ultimately successful an after picture now with slightly less <unk> .so as of right now i have been in the detroit airport since 2pm <unk> 
 my flight to visit my grandmother for the holiday break is now delayed yet again until about 10:30 am ... <unk> 
 anyways so yesterday i was on my merry way to visit my grandmother in kentucky from my university in <unk> <unk> 
 i 've been flying ever since i was a baby so as usual i just went ahead and proceeded my travel plans as i normally do 
 i expected an hour long <unk> from my flight from <unk> to dtw and then an hour long flight to indianapolis from dtw 
 now this is where i fucked up 
 while i was about to board my first plane the people at the service desk announced that the plane was <unk> and they needed two people to let go of their tickets in exchange for $ 700 in delta travel money 
 as a poor student i was intrigued by the offer but alas my grandmother was driving two hours from evansville indiana to meet me at the airport 
 due to <unk> and guilt i declined the offer and continued to wait to board the first plane 
 about twenty minutes later after the first class boarded the flight agents announced that they <unk> the amount to $ 1,000 
 i really wanted to take the offer but like i said before my grandma was already in route to pick me up 
 as much as it <unk> me i thought of all the badass places i could potentially visit with the $ 1,000 
 again i declined the offer 
 fast forward to when i am on the 1st plane ready to fly in the sky like the fucking magic school bus the pilot announces that we have to go back to the gate because it started to snow 
 at that moment i instantly panic as i have checked in my <unk> <unk> since it was too big to fit in the <unk> provided 
 i have about $ <unk> borrowed camera equipment from my school and i get nervous that things might break because of the snow 
 i 've read multiple times that camera equipment and electronic in general should not be exposed to extremely cold temperature let alone <unk> 
 we come back to the gate at about 6pm and i ask if i can have my bags since i am worried about potential damage 
 they inform me that there is nothing they can do for me since it was put in the giant storage thing under the plane 
 i continue to <unk> in my head but remain cool and calm when taking to all the of the agents 
 i mean i need to act like an adult right 
 call grandma apologize for not being able to land in <unk> and schedule an alternate plane to get me to evansville 
 2nd plane is supposed to leave at 8:30pm i 'm pumped 
 get on the plane the pilot informs us that this plane needs to be de-iced '' so we need to chill for a quick minute 
 fast forward about 2 hours and it is finally our turn to be de-iced 
 they <unk> us and the pilot lets us know that during the process the chemicals accidentally damaged some equipment 
 we have to go back to the gate and they cancel our flight at about <unk> 
 luckily delta is giving out <unk> hotel and food <unk> 
 me being a poor student jump at the opportunity 
 get my hotel voucher and head out to catch the shuttle for some much needed rest 
 i have a small sweater and it is freezing balls outside 
 awesome ... .the shuttle ends up super late due to the ice and i end up checking in at the hotel by 1am 
 get to bed by 2am and then wake up at 6am to make sure i get back to the airport on time 
 i get to the airport check-in same ol same ol 
 sit down eagerly for my 9am flight to visit my grams and they delay me another hour 
 i 'm here in the airport writing this now 
 i really hope i get to leave today 
 tldr : had the chance to get $ 1,000 for free declined and ended up stranded in detroit without food or clothing 
 20 hours into vacation spent in the airport 
 sweet update : my flight left at 11:30am and i am now safe in my grandma 's house 
 the airline lost my bag and it is now in indianapolis 
 they said they would be able to ship it to me by 5pm today ... hopefully 
 thanks for all the awesome response 
 yes i have learned a lot from my experience and now realize all the mistakes i made 
 nothing i can do about it now but learn 
 yes i am a visual art student who is doing a <unk> in photo from brown and i take classes at <unk> 
 update tldr : home now lost bag learned a <unk> this is not today but a few years ago in high school 
 i had failed my classes thanks world of <unk> at least i got all classes on max level so it was kinda worth it and was forced to <unk> the entire year 
 the first day of school i did n't know anyone in my new classes and took an empty seat in my <unk> class 
 a very attractive girl took the seat next to me we were grouped in pairs 
 in the following weeks we hit it off pretty well 
 but not much happened aside from the chatting 
 around <unk> she got very close physically to the point where her leg was always touching mine during class 
 we were both invited to a christmas party of a mutual friend 
 i had a few drinks and i somehow became the center of the party 
 i had learned how to shuffle a few weeks back and danced my ass off 
 it seems this beautiful mating dance aroused my potential mate significantly 
 i eventually took a break from performing my mating dance and sat on a table 
 suddenly she and a few of her friends stood in front of me 
 i have no idea why she brought her friends 
 we talked for a while and then she tried to kiss me 
 the most logical response was to slap her in the face obviously fist half closed which is exactly what i did 
 i was blessed with good reflexes thanks to my dad who liked to <unk> with me when i was just a wee little boy 
 threat <unk> 
 what does this girl think ... fucking with me huh 
 all she said was you <unk> do this 
 why '' 
 it was only after i left for college that i realised that she indeed wanted to fuck with me but in a different way 
 i was an average guy who played wow skipped classes and smoked pot 
 and for some reason this girl liked me very much 
 the thought of her liking me did n't even cross my mind once during all these months of her foot-fucking and rubbing me 
 i have plenty of other stories like these if people are interested 
 ok this happened yesterday but did n't think of posting about it here till this morning ... i had a long day at work yesterday and when i got home all i wanted to do was relax so i got a drink and took a nice hot bath 
 i had my phone with me texting and browsing facebook 
 i decided to update my status and took a pic of my legs in the bath and posted how nice it was to be home in the bath 
 one of my friends messages me and said did you know you can see for vag in that pic 
 so i went and looked and even though i did n't see it on my phone when i took it i had not been low enough and at the bottom of the screen you could clearly see my freshly shaved vagina 
 i took the pic down but it was up for <unk> friends family coworkers all had the chance to see it 
 i do n't know who saw it and who did n't before i took it down 
 update : so yesterday morning i get called into my <unk> office and he is there with hr and they ask me to sit down to discuss something 
 basically they said i could do whatever i want in my personal life but i need to keep the company 's best interest in mind 
 in <unk> <unk> in facebook that could reflect poorly in the employees and the company 
 i was asked to please keep this in mind and i had to sign a form that i understood and that they were not saying what i could post but that i needed to <unk> the company positively 
 they never said anything about the photo but obviously that had to be it i was <unk> by the time i left and i avoided my supervisor the rest of the day today i called in sick 
 i do n't want to face anyone 
 the fu happened a few hours ago but the motion has been set couple days ago… & amp nbsp it was a beautiful weekend the weather was sunny but <unk> and i spent it with the pretty lady that i 've been dating for the last six months 
 <unk> shines in and it was sexy times 
 grabbed two condoms and used one first night 
 second night rolls around and we talked about how we 're both tested clean so ... you get the idea 
 now this was a <unk> place so naturally when we leave we clean the place 
 i cleaned the kitchen and she cleaned the bedroom 
 proud of our <unk> we left with smiles on our faces 
 & amp nbsp fast forward to earlier today 9am 
 time for a meeting with my staff 
 everyone gets settled in and i start the <unk> 
 about 5 minutes in i needed my laptop to show performance stats and without my knowledge my pretty lady had <unk> me with the unused condom that is <unk> between my ipad and laptop 
 with one swift move i pulled my laptop out of my backpack and the surprise condom came flying out landed right smack in the middle of the conference room table 
 & amp nbsp my jaw drops half way my mind is blank and i blinked in slow motion 
 silence ensues 
 then bursts of laughter while my face turned into boiled lobster color 
 one of my minion said boss you had a good weekend ” the other minion quickly added maybe he did n't have a good weekend ... cuz… '' & amp nbsp <unk> the rest of the meeting was not productive 
 & amp nbsp throwaway account ... cuz my minions are all <unk> & amp nbsp edit - hope you and my minions all got a good laugh i have an excellent team and specifically used the word minion because thats our office humor 
 everyone on my team has a minion or two on their desk 
 so many happy meals were eaten that <unk> i have no doubt someone is going to be pranking me by hiding condoms in my <unk> or my <unk> or <unk> do n't give them <unk> & amp nbsp tl dr - did n't use condom end up using it in a group setting 
 unlike most fu 's this literally happened this morning 
 to make things clear i do smoke weed once in a while and have nothing against adults smoking weed 
 so today the secondary school where i teach were holding a <unk> <unk> for <unk> celebrations 
 as a <unk> atheist i had no choice but to volunteer in gods work '' as most of the teachers did too 
 i got info from the class <unk> that two students have brought a <unk> of weed to sell to aid '' celebrations 
 i got them and got the weed 
 as a drug enforcement agent wan na be i made them burn it all in class with everybody still inside 
 the <unk> of a few students made me realized my <unk> fu 
 i evacuated the class but by then most were mildly high 
 this being <unk> nothing is going to come out of this but i really did fucked up 
 edit : took a while but i 've upvoted every single comment on this thread both positive and negative except <unk> comments fuck those guys 
 long live karma okay so this happened around 3 months ago 
 keep in mind i 'm a guy who likes <unk> and tends to make a lot of puns 
 so i had been dating this girl for about a month and a bit and things were going really great 
 we were alone one day and we were spooning i was the big spoon and i had my hands resting around her waist under her shirt 
 eventually she gets an idea and says 'hey wan na touch my boobs 
 and being the horny teenager i am i 'm like <unk> yeah i do 
 and thus began the moment i began to fuck up 
 okay maybe it was because i was a bit nervous but for some reason as i started working my way up to her boobs i began to <unk> in david attenborough 's voice like i was some explorer on an adventure to her boobs 
 after crossing the grand canyon her belly button i eventually got to her breasts where i said wow i must have fallen and died in the grand canyon because it feels like i 'm in <unk> i thought it was pretty smooth and i think she thought it was kind of cute 
 looking back she probably did n't it was pretty lame but it did n't last long because i was instantly back into explorer mode 
 <unk> it looks we 've reached <unk> land i 'm going to call it ... <unk> and this is where i really started fucking up 
 <unk> i need to watch out for booby traps i started to giggle a little bit but i kept it together 
 <unk> n't get too close to the <unk> they might give you the boobonic plague 
 at this point i was trying so hard not to laugh i was holding back tears 
 eventually i got to her <unk> where i could n't help but say <unk> a second how the hell did we end up in nepal and then proceeded to laugh uncontrollably to the point where i could no longer continue my boob <unk> adventure 
 she broke up with me the next day 
 i 'm not sure if it was because of the boob incident but i still do n't regret it and i would totally do it all over again 
 tl dr my girlfriend let me touch her boobs and i fell into a booby trap got the boobonic plague and went to nepal before we broke up the next day 
 edit : wow i ca n't believe this post got gold thank you so <unk> did this 
 in a waiting room with limited seats and other patrons randomly <unk> 
 a mom and her son walk in 
 i have an empty seat on their side of me so i slide over so they can sit next to eachother 
 she gives me an odd look and says thank you but we will sit over here '' 
 so i look at the seat i just offered to her child ... it 's not a seat ... it 's a trash can 
 tl dr i politely offered for a child to be thrown away 
 edit : hey reddit 
 /u/markreadsreddit did a great narration of my fu 
 check it out 
 this story actually happened about 6 years ago 
 my sincerest apologies for the length of this story as i am <unk> and often include too many details 
 but i think reddit might enjoy this 
 it was a sunny warm sunday and i had been hunting for the recently released <unk> android phone on craigslist 
 after emailing back and forth a few times we arrived at a great price for not one but 2 phones 
 so we arranged to meet at an apartment complex about 30 minutes away 
 i gathered my cash and drove to the location 
 i was stupid and young at the time and did not comprehend how dangerous the part of town i was heading into was 
 but i felt relatively safe upon arrival since it was a pretty well populated apartment complex and there were lots of people around in <unk> daylight 
 i was standing on the sidewalk in between the parking lot and the pool area where a bunch of kids were playing swimming shooting each other with water guns etc 
 parents were all around watching 
 even so i had folded up all the money and stuffed it in an almost empty pack of cigarettes 
 i was wearing jeans a t shirt a gray hoodie with two pockets on the front flip <unk> and glasses 
 i put the cigarette money pack in my left hoodie pocket and i had a switchblade in my right hand in the other pocket 
 hey it seemed safe enough but i was being cautious- or so i thought 
 so the seller comes out shes a 20 something girl and shows me the phone 
 i have a look agree to the purchase and she says she needs to go back up to the apartment to get the other phone and <unk> 
 she asks me to come up to the room with her and i decline haha 
 i am so smart 
 and respond that 's ok i 'll wait here '' 
 she comes back down another time to apologize that its taking so long and goes back up to get the rest of the stuff 
 i 'm standing around happy as can be when she comes back again and starts talking 
 i ca n't even remember what she said because this is when shit got real 
 like real real 
 as in time slowed down and i entered an alternate reality where this was happening to someone else and not me 
 she 's <unk> about something and suddenly i feel wetness on the right side of my face 
 i sort of laugh thinking one of the many children has got me with their water <unk> 
 ho ho 
 well played little sir 
 then i notice that the area once full of playing children was completely empty 
 not a soul to be seen 
 my brow furrows as my synapses fire at previously inexperienced speeds to try and <unk> myself 
 i notice that the wetness feels oily 
 my eyes go back to the girl and i notice that she has stopped talking 
 then she bolts 
 i look to my right the direction of the blast and see a skinny man crouched very low <unk> around a parked car 
 confusion intensifies 
 then i see a shadow to my left 
 i turn just in time to catch a glimpse of a very large man charging at me who immediately lands a <unk> magnitude right hook on my left <unk> 
 i go down 
 hard 
 my <unk> fly off my glasses are <unk> and my arms go flailing as i hit the rough asphalt of the parking lot 
 it is at this point that i realize that the wetness was mace or pepper spray or whatever you want to call it 
 it <unk> into my eyes my mouth my nose its all over my hands and its pretty much all over my face now 
 the burning begins the scorching searing pain of mount doom tearing at my flesh and mucous membranes 
 the pain is over <unk> 
 i am trembling with adrenaline even as i write this 6 years later 
 no sooner than i stop <unk> on the asphalt does my large <unk> <unk> now kicking me in the ribs and punching me mercilessly left right left right left right 
 he 's screaming give me the money 
 give me the money bitch '' 
 i yelp like a little girl desperate for any <unk> or even acknowledgement of what is happening 
 i remember my mother always telling me that in her rape defense courses they taught her to yell fire '' and not rape '' as people are more likely to come to your aid 
 so naturally i yelled everything 
 fire 
 rape 
 help 
 stop 
 no 
 fire again '' 
 but it was in vain 
 i am no greedy person and my life was not worth whatever money i had brought and so i quickly decide to offer it up 
 but when i reached into the pocket to get the cigarette pack with the money in it i found nothing but <unk> 
 struggling to squint through the searing pain my eyes darted around but i could n't find it as i was <unk> blind without my glasses 
 i do n't have any money '' 
 i began to yell between the blows 
 but he was not having it 
 i know you have money '' he retorted 
 and so i desperately rolled over and said take my wallet i dont have it just take it '' 
 and take it he did 
 he rifled through my left jeans pocket and took my shitty flip phone and then grabbed the back pocket of my jeans which contained my wallet and ripped the entire pocket off my jeans 
 this ripped a huge <unk> out of the jeans almost all the way down the leg exposing my nearly bare ass as i curled into the fetal position on the ground 
 but the blows did not cease 
 rolled over onto my right side as i was my right hand found its way into my right hoodie pocket 
 my hand gripped tight around the switchblade 
 i did n't even think twice about what i was about to do and in retrospect it could have ended a lot worse 
 i rolled back to my left and as my arm came out from under me i flipped the knife open and began waving and <unk> and tearing the space immediately around me into little <unk> 
 i was blind so my eyes were jammed shut which meant i had no direction in my attack 
 i <unk> to attempting to appear as insane as possible and began shouting like a mad person 
 obscenities sounds animal noises anything 
 and it worked 
 all i remember hearing was oh shit '' and then the <unk> footsteps of that asshole running away 
 i stopped my <unk> attack and drug myself to my hands and knees 
 i had to get out of there 
 i found my glasses cracked and scratched close by 
 i struggled to get them on and <unk> collected my keys and one flip flop when i looked up and saw it : about a foot under the back of my parked car laid the cigarette case containing the object of the assault 
 somehow the irony of the situation gave me strength and i collected my money 
 i stood up and shouted angry with the world 
 fuck you 
 fuck you all '' 
 and jumped in the car 
 i had no phone and obviously nobody was going to help me so i got the fuck out of there 
 i drove 
 a few miles 
 nearly blind 
 as i sat at a stop light shaking my mind began to assemble the facts 
 this was a setup 
 there were 3 <unk> 
 i was the victim of a craigslist scam 
 now i should mention at this point that i am an <unk> and was at the time a law student 
 my desire for justice is a driving force in my life and <unk> <unk> me beyond my ability to express myself 
 i gripped the steering wheel tighter white <unk> and when the light changed i floored it 
 i <unk> into a tiny gas station with two <unk> and about 30 square feet of <unk> space 
 i bolted inside and surveyed the store 
 most of it was a large glass box where the attendant would sit <unk> from the pieces of shit that passed for people around here 
 my ass was exposed 
 i had tears <unk> down my face which was red as a tomato and i was mad 
 really fucking mad 
 a little old asian lady was sitting in the glass box and we locked eyes 
 she was using a <unk> phone 
 i locked onto that phone like a fucking fighter jet and demanded loudly give me your phone '' 
 she pointed outside and said use <unk> '' 
 i had zero fucks remaining to give and so i insisted 
 lady i am not fucking around 
 that phone 
 your phone 
 give it to me '' 
 she stared at me blankly and slid it through the little window on the counter 
 i <unk> 911 and began shouting at the phone as soon as i heard a response 
 location 
 squad car 
 name 
 mugging 
 battery 
 now 
 i hung up 
 not knowing that milk and oil are the best treatment for pepper spray i walked to the soda vending machine 
 i pulled the plastic wrapper from a sleeve of large cups stuck it in the ice <unk> and filled the bag 
 i tossed the phone on the counter thanked the nice lady for her help and went outside to wait for the cops 
 as i sat there <unk> my face they pulled up 
 i told them what happened and they mumbled something into their radios 
 they calmed me down a bit then put me in the squad car and drove back to the scene 
 i collected my missing flip flop and we looked for my phone but didnt see it 
 back in the squad car and they drove me next door to a <unk> motel 
 as we pulled in i saw the small parking lot filled with cop cars dogs and officers everywhere 
 i got out and retrieved my last crumpled cigarette from my <unk> 
 i asked a homeless man sitting on the curb for a light and stood there ass to the wind smoking my cigarette of victory as the cops <unk> my 3 assailants out of a second story room onto the balcony of the motel 
 i walked up the steps looked them each in the eye and provided <unk> id to the officers with some <unk> 
 do you recognize this person '' 
 yes 
 thats the asshole that pepper sprayed me '' 
 do you recognize this person '' 
 yes 
 thats the piece of shit that beat on me '' 
 do you recognize this person '' 
 yes 
 thats the cunt that set me up '' 
 this got a laugh from the cops as they <unk> and led them downstairs 
 they took me to the <unk> to finish up the report document the craigslist post etc 
 i borrowed a cell phone and called my mom i was staying with them over the summer and lied telling her i ran into my friend and was hanging out with him but would be home soon 
 they had freaked out and were calling police stations to file a missing person 's report at this point since i wasnt answering my phone 
 my wallet was returned to me <unk> in a paper bag since they had tried to flush it 
 i added insult to injury when i used the bathroom thinking i had washed all the pepper spray off my hands 
 wrong 
 my dick began to sting but by this point it was the least of my worries 
 they took me back to my car i threw on some shorts i had in there and went home to fill my family in 
 they were hysterical but my dad thanked me for lying to my mom until i was there tell her in person 
 the next day my boss berated me for showing up a few minutes late 
 i told him the story showed him my <unk> and he gave me a pass but i would later reflect on that morning as the first of many instances in which he treated me like crap 
 i grew to hate him even more than my <unk> 
 in the end they all went to jail for several years 
 the last of them just ended their probation this month 
 in the mean time i finished law school got engaged paid off half my student loans and made something of myself 
 fuck those guys 
 edit <unk> for answers tldr and more information : to <unk> and everyone else scared of craigslist : later the next day i met up with someone else from craigslist and bought the phone from them at the same price 
 my parents were freaking out and i 'll admit i was a little nervous but i was n't going to let those assholes <unk> my life 
 at all 
 this is america fuck them i was going to buy that phone come hell or high water and if that guy tried to screw me over too i 'd fuck him right back just like i fucked them 
 <unk> i usually meet people at a well lit gas station downtown 
 i go to houses and stuff still but never in that part of town 
 never 
 i know much better 
 not exactly a police station but there are often cops parked there and lots of camera so its much safer 
 i have bought and sold hundreds of items on craigslist without incident and am a huge <unk> of the service 
 this is by no means an <unk> post 
 and for <unk> : once the cops had the location of the incident the apartments and the time like ... 5 min ago they figured i guess that they either could n't have or probably had n't gotten far 
 so they searched nearby locations 
 they <unk> a brief description that i gave them to some other officers while we were standing at the gas station one of whom questioned the attendant at the motel next door 
 the attendant <unk> remembered checking in 3 people matching the <unk> recently and gave them the room number 
 looks like they just jumped a fence and between the motel and apartments 
 i doubt there was even a room they just wanted me to turn a less visible corner 
 anyways the cop called in the <unk> and they surrounded the building 
 then they called us over from the gas station we swung by to get my flip flop and by the time we got there well ... you read the story 
 what i ca n't <unk> properly was how fast once they showed up they had these guys <unk> 
 seriously efficient police work i was blown away 
 oh and there were probably so many cops since this location happened to be very close to the station 
 fml lol tl dr : thanks to <unk> op goes to buy phone from craigslist sale is a setup for a mugging 
 op gets maced and beat on they steal his wallet but not the money as op was smart and hid it and rip his jeans 
 op pulls out switch blade and acts like a mad man to scare his assailants off 
 op goes to petrol station and calls cops 
 assailants go to prison op wins at life 
 this just happened -- <unk> i 'm so embarrassed 
 ok so my back has been stiff recently 
 i work at a desk 
 after sitting with clients all morning my back was really hurting and i needed somewhere to stretch it out 
 i first tried to do it standing up in the bathroom but those stretches did n't reach the right muscles so i knew i needed to lie down to do it 
 clients are always coming in and out of my office so i knew i had to find a place that was <unk> 
 i decided to do it underneath this big conference table because no matter where you walk you ca n't see underneath it unless you 're bending down 
 my break was an hour long so as soon as it started i got under the table and stretched 
 it was awesome after a few minutes my muscles finally relaxed which felt amazing 
 i still had like 45 minutes left and no one had bothered me so i thought what the hell '' and decided to close my eyes edit and sleep <unk> for a bit 
 when my alarm vibrated in my pocket signaling the end of the hour i opened my eyes to see a bunch of legs sitting around the table -- there was a conference going on 
 i had a client at the top of the hour so i knew i had to leave and in my head i 'm like <unk> how am i going to explain <unk> but i could n't wait for them to finish -- it was clear that they were in the middle of it and were n't ending anytime soon 
 very slowly i pushed one of the empty chairs out from the table 
 everyone above stopped speaking -- i could tell they were looking at the chair seemingly moving of its own <unk> 
 i stood up from the floor to a group of <unk> <unk> and said there was no way to do this without it being awkward so ... my back was really hurting ... sorry to interrupt '' 
 there was dead silence as i walked out of the room 
 **tl dr** took a nap under a conference table woke up to a conference going on above me 
 was forced to interrupt the conference to go back to work.so today i was playing some pokemon y looking for a female combee to evolve 
 great 
 after killing a few <unk> that i spent an hour the day before to find i still did n't find a female combee 
 then i found a shiny 
 the first shiny i 've ever seen 
 me being a huge nerd i decided to take a picture of it <unk> i caught it 
 i grabbed my phone and tried to hold it close 
 then i accidentally bumped into the touch screen 
 shit 
 the next thing i knew was that the touch screen turned blurry and the only words i saw was you got away safely '' 
 edit : thanks for the gold 
 it 's just as shiny 
 : i currently work in a <unk> firm where we use skype as our main form of communication 
 today i took my laptop to work since i wanted to watch some netflix during my break 
 instead of using my work computer i used my personal 
 so after my break i sit down to do some more work when my manager asks if i can <unk> in conference call with my boss and some of the upper management i tell him that i 'm on my personal computer but can add me by using my name as username 
 so a couple of minutes after i get the invite and i accept 
 so far everything is fine when suddenly one of the guys from upper management not the one who invited to the call says who the fuck is <unk> 
 that 's when it hit me i really fucked up 
 i forgot that i have that silly <unk> and a pretty fucked up picture to accompany it nsfw 
 so now my boss is kinda pissed and hr possibly wants to talk with me <unk> 
 tl dr : my boss does n't like tits with <unk> 
 edit : update posted here 
 edit 2 : tifu of the week 
 thanks for the support and the <unk> <unk> 'm posting this because a nurse and a doctor at the hospital where i was treated suggested sharing this story with the internet to hopefully prevent others from almost accidentally killing themselves 
 i have a bunch of health problems and one of those is that i tend to get at least two kidney infections a year 
 i do n't have symptoms of a <unk> 
 i just suddenly get a specific type of severe back pain exhaustion and a bit of <unk> 
 i knew i had another infection about two weeks ago and made an appointment with my primary care physician 
 she does a <unk> test in office confirms i have an infection and sends out for a <unk> 
 i tell her i 'm in a lot of pain 
 she gives me a seven day supply of painkillers and ten days of an antibiotic 
 when i get a kidney infection the pain usually lasts longer than the course of antibiotics 
 so i knew i was going to be miserable after those first seven days when i ran out of painkillers 
 here 's where the fuck up starts 
 i had previously read about poppy seed tea being a good pain <unk> 
 i do a bit of research on it and decide it 's worth a shot 
 poppy seeds are legal to buy and i could n't find anything about <unk> tea out of them being illegal 
 so i order a big bag of poppy seeds online 
 they come friday the 18th just one day after i ran out of prescribed painkillers 
 i 'm of course still in massive amounts of pain so i was excited to try this 
 i brew the tea as per the instructions i found online 
 it tastes bitter and absolutely horrible but i figure if it helps the pain i can deal with it 
 since it tastes so bad this is where i make the major fuck up 
 i chug it as quickly as possible 
 everything i had previously read said to drink slowly and see how it affects you 
 i probably downed about 32 <unk> 
 at first i thought this poppy seed tea was the best thing ever 
 my pain was gone 
 my mood was pretty amazing 
 i was just talking to friends on facebook messenger and hanging out with my boyfriend and a friend of ours 
 my boyfriend went to take a nap before his night shift so it was just my friend and i hanging out on our <unk> 
 maybe four hours after drinking the tea i start to feel a bit woozy 
 i went to the bathroom and felt incredibly dizzy 
 i walk back to my chair and knock over a can of pop on the side table and collapse into my chair 
 the last thing i remember is my friend asking if i was okay 
 i think i nodded yes 
 apparently i passed out 
 my friend thought i just fell asleep 
 my boyfriend woke up shortly after this to get ready for work 
 my friend tells my boyfriend i 'm passed out but he can hear me breathing so he thinks i 'm okay 
 well suddenly i make what they called a death <unk> '' and stopped breathing 
 a few seconds later i gasp for air 
 they 're trying to <unk> me and i 'm completely non responsive 
 my friend even tries a <unk> rub with no response 
 they know now that shit 's fucked and call 911. the emts and police would not believe that all i had was poppy seed tea 
 they jammed an <unk> <unk> line into my knee basically a big ass needle to administer emergency medicine when there 's no time to fuck around with an iv to get narcan in me 
 i have vague flashes of memory from the ambulance 
 they keep asking what i took 
 i keep telling them poppy seed tea 
 they keep asking what i really took 
 did i take heroin 
 did i snort some pills 
 nope just the tea 
 it 's the same thing in the emergency room 
 the nurses and doctors are asking what did i really take 
 they 're telling me i need to tell them the truth because i just went into respiratory arrest and almost died and they need to know how to treat me 
 i tell them i just drank poppy seed tea 
 they ask if i took vicodin or tylenol 3 because they found empty bottles of those at my apartment 
 i say no the tylenol 3 was from when i had a horrendous three week long period in january 
 the vicodin was for this kidney infection but i ran out the day before 
 they get me <unk> and have me on oxygen 
 they let my boyfriend in to see me 
 i 'm still woozy and half out of it 
 a nurse comes in and asks how i feel 
 i tell her i feel terrified and stupid 
 she says good 
 you should '' 
 aside from her everyone else was really nice though 
 a doctor comes in to get my side of the story now that i 'm <unk> 
 i tell him the exact process for making the tea how much i drank how i felt and the last thing i remembered 
 i guess they finally got my <unk> screen back and saw i was n't lying 
 i had to stay for two days while they monitored me 
 also i was on the wrong antibiotic for the kidney infection so i 'm going to be in pain for at least another week 
 my white blood cell count when i was admitted was <unk> after 8 days of taking an antibiotic 
 they think i may have sleep <unk> as they took me off the oxygen last night since my levels were normal 
 in the middle of the night they dropped significantly so they put me back on it 
 so now i have to schedule a sleep study 
 oh i also had to talk to a social worker to confirm that this was n't a suicide attempt 
 it definitely was n't 
 it was just an attempt to not be in horrible pain from an infection 
 i was the talk of the hospital though apparently 
 every shift change the new nurse and tech would ask to hear the story 
 then they 'd tell me that because of me this hospital and their emts now know you can treat a poppy seed tea <unk> with narcan successfully 
 one nurse kinda laughed at me and told me the last time he heard about anyone making poppy seed tea was in <unk> i felt like a huge jackass for accidentally <unk> 
 i put my boyfriend through emotional hell 
 i did a lot of crying this weekend 
 the moral of my story is you should probably avoid trying to make poppy seed tea 
 the amount of active drug you brew out of each batch can <unk> <unk> even from the same bag of seeds 
 if you do make it i would highly suggest learning from my dumbass mistake and not chugging a bunch of it at once 
 also if you happen to live in a state where you can get narcan over the counter it might be smart to keep it on hand if you 're going to try it 
 tl dr - made poppy seed tea for the first time in an attempt to treat pain from a kidney infection 
 <unk> way too much as it tastes like bitter asshole 
 felt amazing until five hours later when i went into respiratory arrest and came very close to dying scaring the hell out of myself and my poor boyfriend 
 now i 'm dealing with kidney infection pain as well as horrible pain in my knee from having a needle drilled into it as an io line for emergency medicine to save my life 
 feeling grateful to be alive but ridiculously stupid for putting myself in a situation where i almost died 
 **edit** - i just got a pm from the emt that was with me in the back of the ambulance that saved my life 
 either it 's a small world or reddit is a big place probably a bit of both 
 he informs me that they do n't have the <unk> version of narcan and they did make two attempts to start an iv on me 
 i know i 'm a hard stick you should see how much the <unk> try to pretend they do n't hate me when i need blood drawn 
 so the only option was the io line 
 this is a small town i 'm in by the way so kind of not surprised they do n't have something everyone else thought was common 
 but that was definitely really cool i got to thank the emt that saved me in a reddit pm 
 also someone bought me reddit gold and i know it 's cringey to add an edit to say thank you but i think it was really kind of them so i 'd like to say thanks 
 and thanks everyone that sent well wishes telling me they 're glad i 'm alive 
 it means a lot to me that strangers give a shit that i 'm okay after i did something incredibly stupid 
 narration by /u/cyae1 my fiancé a guy and i a girl wanted to go see fifty shades of grey on valentine 's day with another couple good friends of ours who told us a few days ago that they might want to go see it with us 
 anyway this morning i texted the girl who is listed in my phone as ashley r. do you want to go see fifty shades of grey on valentine 's day '' 
 in order to figure out our plans 
 the response : i 'm going to city across the state to visit my mom for her birthday '' 
 ... ashley 's mom 's birthday is not this weekend 
 i looked at the contact name i had texted -- <unk> r. -- and realized that i had just asked my boss to go with me to see fifty shades of grey on valentine 's day 
 edit : update -- as soon as i realized what had happened i ran over to my boss 's office thankfully the office next to mine and apologized profusely for sending him the text and even showed him the text conversation between my fiancé and i about asking our friends to the movies 
 he just laughed and said no worries 
 but still 
 i was so fucking embarrassed before i explained the situation and still am quite a bit 
 edit 2 : clarification 
 edit 3 : fiancé 
 edit 4 : a lot of you guys are being really negative with your comments 
 all i wanted to do was share a funny story with you 
 i 'm sorry for misspelling fiancé '' and wanting to see the <unk> ... my husband is in the army and went on tour in the middle east 
 he returned earlier this morning and everyone of the <unk> were in their <unk> 's when they came out of the terminal 
 i was in such a <unk> state of excitement and extremely in the mood '' that i hadnt even noticed him as he came through the terminal 
 he is twenty six and has changed a but since the last time i saw him 
 i saw a younger man approaching my direction and waving with a smile in his face 
 he kinda looked like my husband so i started towards him 
 i was about five feet from the soldier not thinking to look at the name patch before a little boy went flying past me and jumping into the man 's arms 
 i felt a sudden wave of fear come over me as multiple thoughts went through my head 
 was my husband coming home to a different family 
 did he die or go mia without my knowledge 
 where the fuck is he 
 i must have looked scarred shitless because i heard him laughing from my left 
 i turned to see him standing there <unk> over in agonizing laughter and i could n't help but laugh through the tears 
 i punched him in the chest for laughing at me but hugged him like i would never let go 
 on our way back home he turned to me and said if you would have jumped into that man 's arms i would have died laughing 
 maybe the kid was a sign '' 
 my husband will never let me live this down ... tl dr thought another soldier was my husband saved from embarassment by a kid edit : controversial stuff making butthurt noises edit from husband : my wife made errors in this post and in the comment thread 
 ignore them 
 i 'm only a sergeant <unk> 
 i enlisted as an <unk> and <unk> <unk> before basic 
 i did n't volunteer to stay i redeployed with a different unit as <unk> 11b and there were strings pulled to do that prior to me returning home 
 i was deployed for six months after basic and wanted to get my <unk> active out of the way 
 i 'm still in the ng and am currently <unk> about transfering to army full time 
 it was more of a practical <unk> since my unit and all surrounding <unk> were n't going to <unk> for nearly a year except one that was <unk> three weeks after i was due back 
 i spent three weeks jumping through <unk> while others were making calls and pulling strings to get me redeployed 
 as for the security clearance issue the army recruiter did n't want to go through the trouble of getting me enlisted so i decided to go ng 
 that took time and i waited until i was twenty because i was getting free <unk> through the toyota dealership i worked for 
 sorry for any confusion ... i should have told my wife that reddit was also known as the brutal '' front page of the internet 
 sfc mistake was likely from my brother being a sfc edit from husband : 2 : the laundry got folded ... it was still <unk> so everything is <unk> free ... almost everything ... edit <unk> print tattoo : i can not believe she mentioned that 
 that is a horrible story and i could probably post it in a different sub ... maybe of this receives more upvotes though 
 i do n't think you deserve the story behind it ... fuck that was an unintentional pun edit : not putting story up i guess 
 any suggestions as to a subreddit it would for in to kids are <unk> 
 our little angel has been eagerly soaking up all the naughty words we say and happily shouting them back at us 
 not only does he love saying shit '' 
 but if we ever say shit '' he 'll follow up with a hearty fuck '' 
 so we have a brainstorm -- we would use a different word 
 something innocuous 
 innocent 
 we go with pudding '' 
 after a few tries at this he gets it but now whenever we say pudding '' 
 he responds by shouting fuck '' 
 not exactly what we were going for but at least we tried right 
 but that was n't the tifu 
 this was : today is his 2 year birthday 
 his preschool allows us to bring in a special treat for the class and then they all sing him happy birthday '' 
 but given the general freak out about nuts and peanuts you ca n't bring in cakes or cupcakes 
 so i bought some treats 
 pudding cups 
 turns out the teachers were not amused at his response when they told the class hey everybody 
 guess what we have for a birthday treat -- pudding '' 
 so this actually started about 9 months ago but whatever ... so i 'm in school but i 've got a few years on me 
 well after an especially rough month of class my good friend tells me that he has bought my wife and i tickets to go see glitch mob 
 of course i 'm pumped and start planning how to make it a memorable show 
 i have n't smoked in a while and i decide that a lil <unk> would be the perfect way to enjoy the <unk> 
 so the day of the show i roll up a couple fat ones and start drinking so i can have a nice buzz before i smoke 
 fast forward i 'm good and gone 
 i 'm partying like i 'm in <unk> all over again and loving it 
 the ride to show involves me smoking about $ 80 worth of good in an hour and acting like a jackass 
 the show is awesome and way too loud for this old bastard but i 'm loving it 
 near the end of glitch mob 's set my wife and i bail and head to the car 
 i pass out for a few 
 show ends 
 our friends come out and we start heading home 
 somewhere along the way i lean out the window and puke puke files into the rear window and hits my friend 
 pretty bad right 
 he 's like a brother tho so he brushes it off 
 literally 
 and we make it home 
 this is where i fuck up ... so my wife and i have been married for about 5 months at this point and i can still do no wrong somehow that has since changed 
 i remember very little of this but apparently she also had a great time at the show and i was able to get myself together after the <unk> puke session 
 friends have dropped us off and i 've showered and brushed my teeth in some <unk> hope of getting laid 
 well it works 
 i 'm no ryan <unk> but i 'm fairly smooth when i 'm halfway gone 
 i wake up the next morning to an amazing breakfast and my wife telling me how much fun she had at the show and how much more she had when we got home 
 yeah ... alright ... i 'm feeling good about not blowing my load in under 20 minutes 
 straight up boss status 
 i did n't even remember putting on a condom 
 so it 's a <unk> victory 
 well it turns out i did n't wear a condom 
 9 months later and i 'm currently sitting in the hospital with my wife as she prepares to give birth to our first child 
 tl dr tifu by getting wasted being too charming and not wearing a rubber today i become a dad and could n't be happier about it 
 update 1 : thank you for all the <unk> 
 sorry for taking so long to update but my wife and i have been exhausted 
 she arrived yesterday morning 
 she 's healthy beautiful and i 'm already in love 
 we found out about a month after the show when my wife tried to take a <unk> of wine and got instant <unk> 
 she sent me to the store for tests right after and after 3 tests we realized we were never gon na be the same 
 weed around here is stupid expensive for even shitty stuff 
 regardless it 'll probably be legal in all 50 states before i smoke again lol and despite how crappy her <unk> story may be she has two parents who love her and could n't be happier to have <unk> why they owned condoms 
 definitely nsfw but it 's exactly as the title says ... i was so tired and it 'd been a huge day and the bf had been giving off signals all day which i gracefully ignored because we were busy or others were around but he 'd gone and done a heap of nice things for me throughout the week so when he started giving signals i thought i 'd just give him head he 'd enjoy it it would n't take long and hopefully i 'd be asleep in 10 minutes ... turns out all of that was true ... except i was asleep in about 2 ... and he was n't finished ... i woke up the next morning sleeping <unk> and i did n't remember falling asleep during it ... but i definitely did n't remember finishing it 
 bf apparently felt so weird about the fact he had to take his sleeping gf off his dick and tuck her into bed that he went and slept on the lounge ... i do n't offer sleepy sexual <unk> anymore and he does n't ask for them after a certain time ... tldr : i 'm a shit <unk> december i was stationed in japan with the navy and i rode my bike to work every day about 4 miles one way 
 one day while riding home i noticed my brakes were loose 
 i thought to myself boy that 's going to cause an accident one of these days '' 
 upon getting home i <unk> then up and tested them 
 they worked great 
 the next morning i have to go in early because i have the first watch so i am grumpy and sleepy 
 a few minutes into my ride at the bottom of a hill i get a phone call 
 being grumpy sleepy going fast and having forgotten that my brakes are now responsive i slam on both brakes 
 the bike stops i keep going 
 i lost my grip on one hand turning the handlebars 90 degrees and the handlebars stab into my hips and i fall to the ground cursing 
 i miss the call but they call back right away so it must be important 
 it was n't 
 the person calling just wanted to tell me i had the first watch 
 i get back onto my bike and ride the rest of the way slowly because it feels like i just got punched in the gut 
 i get to the ship and go to change into my uniform 
 when i take my sweat pants off i see that my <unk> are red 
 which is odd because they were grey when i put them on 
 i look at myself to see a 3 inch gash over the base of my penis 
 the handlebars hit so hard it ripped my skin open 
 <unk> inches lower would have castrated me 
 i put my pants back on and go down to medical 
 it was a larger ship so it had a <unk> medical staff 
 i am a bit freaked out by the time i get there but being early people are just getting to work 
 the first person i find is a half asleep chief petty officer with coffee in his hand 
 how do i explain what happened 
 me <unk> uhh chief i got in a bike <unk> ... uh ... and i got cut ... '' ... what '' 
 i pull my pants down in front exposing blood soaked boxers i 'm cut bad chief i need help '' 
 <unk> <unk> twice wakes up ok go lie down and i 'll have a look '' many people proceed to look at my penis they send me to the base clinic and the clinic sends me to the hospital in town 
 now this is a japanese hospital so they send me with a female <unk> 
 i explain i had a bike accident and that i am cut down there 
 she explains to the doctor 
 many japanese people proceed to look at my penis 
 i <unk> did not take a picture of the open wound but i did get a picture of the stitches 
 nsfw obviously 
 by the time i got back to the ship everyone knew that i had some sort of dick related accident 
 i was sitting in my workshop and my friend walks in and <unk> a napkin to reveal a <unk> covered breakfast sausage and says here i picked this up off the road this morning '' 
 tl dr : had a bike accident almost castrated <unk> is my first post on reddit so be <unk> im a 15 year old guy btw 
 this happened a week ago 
 i was down with a fever and had a huge headache my mom decide to give me a whole lot of medicine to make me feel better 
 as my dad was coming back from the us my mom wanted to go to the beauty parlor and get a haircut and some <unk> <unk> was n't in the mood to tag along with her as i was still drowsy from the medicine but she said she would buy me some chocolate if i went with her and so i did 
 this is where the fu starts 
 my mom went into the ladies section of the parlor and i waited in the reception browsing my phone almost about to fall asleep 
 after around 30 minutes the medicine effect starts wearing off and i start having a serious headache 
 i do n't know why i thought going into the ladies section was a good idea but in order to find my mom i did 
 now i do n't remember this part accurately but i think i saw a door at the end of the room and my <unk> high mind decided that 's where my mom <unk> ran and burst through the door ... and there was a lady there getting a bikini wax thankfully not my mom <unk> never seen something like that in real life i drop my phone in shock which cracked its screen 
 the lady screams and threw something at me that hit my head and somehow because of how <unk> i was it knocked me <unk> woke up too see my mom apologizing for what i had done 
 tl dr : i went to the parlor high on meds had a <unk> and ran into the wrong room saw some pussy and got hit in the head edit : <unk> had been really flirty and sexual 
 when i proposed the threesome i was <unk> testing the waters if you will you know exactly what i 'm talking about 
 she was was not amused 
 at all 
 whatsoever 
 tl dr- if that 's too long for you then go fuck yourself 
 and two other people.okay so technically this was last night 
 so for some back story : i 've known him since <unk> in high school 
 he was the older boy i crushed on and we were never more than just friends '' 
 fast forward a couple years i had a kid with another man and became a nurse he became a firefighter & amp emt we 've been together for two years now and he has become the perfect <unk> 
 we live together and have talked about marriage and another kid with no real plans 
 both his family and i have continuously joked about how he would never pop the question and it 's generally the subject of conversation whenever we run into someone we have n't seen in a while when will you two ever get married '' and he would always have some excuse or reason why he did n't feel he should ask at the moment 
 today ish we were coming home from holiday shopping and his phone rang 
 i answered it because here it 's illegal to talk on the phone while driving and the voice on the other end said : hello this is ******* calling from <unk> & amp <unk> we were just calling to tell ******* his ring is ready for pick up '' 
 update : 5 days until christmas and he refuses to acknowledge said incident happened 
 not sure if he 's so upset it 's out of denial or if he believes that by not <unk> about it i 'll forget 
 prepare for another update in 5 <unk> 10 years ago but this story reminded me of this 
 the house that was the party spot during our early 20 's had a cat that was always around 
 for whatever reason he obsessed with pee <unk> 
 we mainly <unk> outside so anytime someone had to take a leak we would just go around the side of the house 
 just about anytime anyone took a piss the cat would come over an sniff your pee bat at it just generally be fascinated by it 
 it started off as a drunken accident but someone peed on the cat and said he did n't even seem to mind 
 then it became a regular thing to pee on the cat because apparently he liked it and we were young drunk and dumb 
 i 'm going to go water the cat '' became a normal saying 
 we did n't think much about it and this went on for months 
 we just thought it was some feral neighborhood cat because it was <unk> outside 
 anyway we 're out one night doing our regular thing and hear his <unk> <unk> oh mr. boots ca n't remember actual name how do you always get so wet 
 let 's get you dried off again '' 
 all our mouths dropped as we looked at each other while this sank in 
 this poor old lady has probably been picking up a <unk> cat and/or letting it inside the house every time we had a party 
 as bad as we wanted to feel we could n't help but laugh 
 i do n't think anyone could breathe for 10 minutes 
 we stopped peeing on the cat after that and my buddy said he <unk> her leaves for her the next day just because '' when she asked why 
 i still feel bad to this day but ca n't help a guilty chuckle when i think back on this 
 edit : who knew peeing on a cat would get you gilded 
 thanks stranger well here is the obligatory this fuck up did n't happen today but 4 years earlier 
 when in high-school i had a crush 
 i will call her <unk> n and i were really good friends and we hung out all the time 
 she was really sweet and beautiful 
 we would watch movies stayed over and also even <unk> about others 
 over time my feelings grew for her but being the boy i was i never had the balls to ask her out 
 she is a hardcore football fan and so am i not <unk> the real football 
 we were watching the final match for the league cup 
 after 90 minutes full of swearing and screaming our team won 
 we were so happy that we hugged each other and when she was kissing my cheek i turned my head 90 degrees and kissed her lips 
 she was shocked and jumped backwards 
 i was so embarrassed that i left her house without saying a single word 
 all night i thought how i fucked up our friendship and <unk> next day i get a text from her saying if i wanted to watch a movie with her 
 young me thinks that this was a bad idea and says no 
 fast forward to last day of high-school 
 she gave me a usb stick saying it had the photos of us she had ever taken 
 this is where the fuck up starts 
 that day i lose the usb stick and later i forget about it completely just to find it hours before i make this post 
 i plug it in and there is only one text file in which she explains how she had a crush on me during high-school how she would like to hang out with me more and so on 
 so yeah reddit i fucked up 
 tl dr : i lost the stick my crush gave me to express her feelings 
 edit : i 've messaged her we laughed it over i explained her my feelings back then and i learned she is currently single 
 <unk> <unk> 
 somebody 's got a date in two days <unk> <unk> : since everyone is asking i will update this post after the date 
 do n't worry wish me luck so i do n't return with another tifu post 
 update : reddit our date did n't go really well 
 4 years change a lot of things as you may <unk> 
 got ya 
 date was awesome and it went really well 
 the date : i picked her up from her place and went to have a dinner 
 then we went to watch the football match of our team the date was planned like this and i am so lucky that our team had a match today in our city 
 after the match we grabbed a drink and then i took her back to her place 
 night ended with a good night kiss 
 so yeah reddit i did n't fuck up at all 
 but i think i have used all my luck till the end of my life so expect more tifu posts from me : p also here is a photo from before we head into the <unk> 
 for those who say this post is made up pm me and i will send you the photo the morning after the sun did rise i looked below to find no surprise 
 penis in trauma writhing in pain dried blood around me <unk> now stained 
 i got up and ready a piss i did need so i went to the loo but continued to bleed 
 now i was in agony help i must seek my injury had stopped me from taking a leak 
 so i left my house to go see the nurse for the next situation i could not <unk> 
 the nurse said to me what is the matter 
 my response was my dick is in <unk> 
 so i whipped out my dong and showed her my plight viewing the damage gave her a fright 
 how did you do it 
 i gave my <unk> plowing a chick without lubrication 
 so i was silly and wrong to assume that i could have sex with a dry and tight <unk> 
 the damage was done the <unk> looked <unk> my penis must heal until no longer weak 
 no sex for 6 weeks and no masturbation devastated i was from this information 
 so i sit here now posting my story about this one time when my penis got <unk> 
 stay safe everyone thank you for reading but now i must go my penis is bleeding 
 <unk> e : thanks for the gold stranger do n't even know what it means but it looks cool 
 e2 : i 've just realised how lucky i am that this happened after the <unk> 
 silver lining 
 ever since i was a teenager i have had very intense <unk> about having sex with a giant roach 
 it started in 9th or 10th grade when we read the <unk> by <unk> <unk> 
 as i started to think more and more about the roach creature that the character had become i started to imagine what it would be like if a woman turned into the roach instead 
 i found this idea very <unk> 
 i would not be repulsed or frightened of her as the characters in the story are 
 i would take care of her 
 then my thoughts started to get sexual with the character 
 eventually i sort of dropped the bit about her having been a human woman first and i kind of imagined this <unk> roach species 
 they are giant roaches the size of a person and have complete intelligence 
 i kind of over time <unk> up an imaginary friend '' of sorts 
 she was one of these roaches and her name was ogtha 
 i would <unk> about her often 
 whenever i masturbated i 'd be imagining elaborate scenarios of me and ogtha making love 
 when i started to have actual sex i found i could not uh ... perform if i was n't thinking of ogtha 
 so basically now anytime i have sex with a woman i am pretending that she is actually ogtha 
 not just think about ogtha i concentrate intently to <unk> that i actually am doing ogtha 
 i do n't want to think about the girl at all 
 there is only ogtha 
 of course this sex can never be as exciting as my fully imaginary sessions with ogtha there are things that her multiple <unk> and <unk> allow for that a human woman can never match 
 so anyways i 've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for about a year 
 3 or 4 times i have tried to have sex with her and not pretend she is ogtha but i just ca n't do it 
 so essentially every time we have sex i am imagining she is ogtha 
 i finally confided this to her the other day and i was blown away by her reaction 
 i thought she might take it a bit badly at first but that she 'd get used to it 
 no 
 i have never seen such a look of disgust before 
 <unk> is not an understatement 
 she is not even returning my texts now 
 i am afraid she is actually going to break up with me and also that is going to tell people about ogtha 
 i do n't know how i will face anyone 
 this is going to sound silly but i also feel guilty about feeling shame as if ogtha will be saddened by this even though i know '' she is imaginary 
 i just do n't know what to do at this point 
 edit : the reddit user cyae1 was kind enough to speak my post into a youtube video : he asked i put it in my post 
 i did this because i do think an audio can be good 
 i do appreciate being placed on <unk> still feel like a huge jerk i 'm 34 years old and i teach grade <unk> history 
 school here started last week and obviously the first weekend just finished 
 i was in last period with my grade 10 advanced class and i asked them how their first weekend of the new school year was 
 no one raised their hand so i randomly chose a boy in the back of the class 
 it was awful '' he replied 
 i decided to say in a joking voice well anything is better than being at school right '' 
 he went silent for a few seconds and said in a low voice well my dog passed away on saturday and my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer but i guess that 's better than school right '' 
 the room went dead silent and i had to leave the room for a few minutes 
 <unk> 's my birthday so my mum says she is going out to get something for my birthday surprise and will be back in about an hour so i decide to shower and get ready for my birthday surprise 
 so i get out of the shower and i do n't have a towel but since i was home alone i walk to the dining room where there is a laundry basket full of clothes and towels because that 's where my mum usually does the <unk> 
 so yeah i skip down stairs naked singing to <unk> swift - i knew you were trouble 
 so i skip into the dining room naked singing 
 all of a <unk> 
 surprise 
 almost my whole class from school was there and some family members including my grandparents my mother cousins and my auntie and uncle and i just basically skip in singing my heart out loudly thinking i was home alone completely naked dripping wet 
 i am now in my room on my own crying my eyes out my crush was there as well and they all saw me <unk> was out really late last night 
 i woke up today hungover at about 12pm 
 i usually need to stay in bed for a while and let my brain heal from the damage i did to it the night before but i really had to make it to grandma 's by <unk> for sunday dinner 
 i just suck it up and roll out of bed and its off to grandma 's we go 
 so i get there and grandma starts feeding me the meatballs and <unk> she 's had cooking since probably 5am 
 usually i eat the whole plate but this time being hungover and all i only got to eat about 2 or 3 before my stomach started feeling a little <unk> 
 i excuse myself from the bathroom to attempt to relieve myself of the pain building inside my intestines 
 i remember reading that thread about how humans are n't designed to sit on toilet bowls 
 the basic idea being your bowels are <unk> until you sit in a <unk> position 
 the poster recommended putting a stool in front of the toilet and using it to <unk> your feet while you 're pooping 
 i 've been meaning to try it out but have n't had the chance 
 i do n't have a stool or otherwise appropriate tool in my bathroom either 
 i remember the thread saying that this natural position for <unk> will allow you to poop twice the normal amount and get it all out of your system in one smooth shot 
 i figure what better time to try it than now so i can get all those toxins out of my body and hopefully it will make me feel much better 
 what a stupid idea but when you 're sick and nauseous and you 're about to shit your pants you get a little desperate 
 grandma 's got this magazine rack next to the hamper 
 my great uncle built it a long time ago 
 everyone in my family has one 
 he liked to work with wood before he passed away 
 it looked well built and <unk> so i decided this would be my stool device 
 by this time i could feel the hot <unk> pool building up around my anus 
 i quickly unzip and drop <unk> 
 my pants are now around my ankles 
 mistake # 1 
 i position the magazine thingy in front of the <unk> 
 i put one foot on it to test its weight capacity 
 seems ok besides this thing was built during ww2 i 'm sure it could handle my <unk> <unk> body mistake # 2 
 i put both feet on it and this is where the shit hits the fan 
 it cracked instantly 
 my feet were tangled in my jeans and i was going nowhere but down 
 the last thing i remember before my head hit the sink was this is going to be loud '' 
 i 'll never be sure how loud it was because i passed out when my head hit the sink or floor 
 i was only out for a short time but when i woke up my grandma mom sister and cousins were crowded around me with the rest of my family watching from the door with looks of horror on their face 
 i lifted my head up and instinctively felt my face 
 bloody eyebrow and the side my head is killing me 
 grandma started yelling in yiddish something like get away from the boy 
 give him some room 
 and covers my ass with a towel 
 thats when i remembered i was naked from the waist down 
 suddenly the smell of shit hits my nose 
 there is diarrhea everywhere 
 i shit all over the place 
 all over the sink wall toilet paper roll the floor and my legs 
 it was the <unk> thing i have ever seen 
 anyway long story short ... i cleaned it all up and explained to my family what actually had happened 
 they think i 'm a freak but yeah they probably thought that before today anyways 
 why ca n't you shit like a normal man '' my uncle said 
 i was so embarrassed 
 i just left 
 i hate you reddit 
 i 'll never listen to you <unk> this young lady around 24 years old who comes in the gym where i work pretty often with her 4 year old son 
 yesterday she didnt have her son with her 
 we joke around a lot and were talking for a while so i asked where 's your kiddo at 
 doing meth with the neighbors again '' 
 in a very jokingly way since like i said we mess with each other all the time 
 well she got a real bad look on her face and walked away 
 turns out she 's in celebrate recovery because of her former meth addiction 
 and her son was with her neighbors 
 <unk> i 'm a newly <unk> member of a dance company 
 as such i am keen to please and promptly carry out any task that is asked of me 
 yesterday the company director christian softly spoken and very <unk> asked me to send her a version of a song i was going to use for a performance 
 in my haste to comply i looked up the song on youtube wrote her a quick email saying my version is better quality but this is just to give you an idea of the performance piece '' hit <unk> and send 
 note the part where i did n't actually copy the youtube hyperlink 
 that 's very important 
 what was on my clipboard you ask 
 oh only this delightful fellow : i linked the real thing and tried to smooth it over but she still has n't replied 
 what does the fox say 
 the fox says ifu 
 i feel like i must preface this by mentioning that i am a girl 
 that 's what people seem to be focusing on most when they find out about it 
 my best friend and i met when i was 13 and he was 10. we got along great despite him being what i felt was just a little kid while i thought i was an adult 
 i am now 20 which makes him 17. also he has a hot mom 
 like way beyond hot 
 she got pregnant at 16 and she is now <unk> anyway this all started when i went out with some other friends this past weekend 
 he could n't come along because he is underage this is in canada so drinking at 18 here though most places start at 19 we went to a local bar which while it was not originally its design now <unk> to a mostly gay and especially lesbian <unk> 
 i am bisexual and it 's one of my regular <unk> spots 
 so one beer and a couple <unk> into the night i 'm dancing with my friends and i decide to go to the bar and get another beer 
 when i get to the bar i notice my friend 's mom is there so i get a beer and sit down next to her and chat her up still oblivious to the fact that my friend 's mom is at a lesbian bar 
 by the time i finish my second beer i 'm getting tipsy i ca n't hold my alcohol and it finally hits me 
 this is a lesbian bar and this woman is here chatting up and checking out other women 
 i let the alcohol and weed get the better of me and i 'm flirting a bit but trying not to be too obvious 
 i eventually get her to come dance with us so i drag her to the dance floor 
 we 're dancing keeping up the <unk> of a conversation and she puts her hand on my waist 
 i felt like my face must have gone completely red i must have been blushing to bad thank god it was dark 
 but i was having a good time so i quickly relaxed and got up closer 
 eventually my high was wearing thin so i excused myself and went outside with my friends to smoke up 
 she showed up outside and surprised us by asking to smoke up with us 
 yeah she 's a cool mom 
 we go back in now i 'm good and buzzed and all kinds of <unk> dancing with her and without thinking about it i kiss her 
 she <unk> 
 it gets pretty intense dancing slowly making out hardcore 
 the night goes on and we call it a night 
 we 're all walking home and me and her split off from the others cause we live on the same block 
 she takes my hand and walks with me right by my place all the way to hers 
 amazing sex ensues 
 i wake up in her bed the next morning 
 no awkwardness or anything between us just like it was any other day 
 yesterday night she calls me up she has all of her son 's friend 's phone numbers 
 booty call 
 she comes to my place crazy sex ensues again 
 this morning my roommate wakes up to find my best friend 's mom half naked and <unk> in the living room eating cereal and watching cartoons 
 now he found out and obviously totally hates me 
 roommate says my friend has a huge crush on me and everybody knew except me 
 **tl dr** : met my best friend 's mom at a lesbian bar 
 she took me home and had her way with me 
 booty call a few days later 
 her son hates me <unk> so my friend todd '' and his <unk> wife tiffany '' are kind of <unk> 
 tiffany likes to do that weird european cheek kissing thing 
 i do n't really understand it and it makes me kind of uncomfortable 
 i 've mentioned to my wife how it 's weird that every time we see todd & amp tiffany she 's doing this kissy thing 
 my wife jokingly suggests that next time i turn my head and kiss her square on the lips that would surely make her stop doing it 
 we both chuckle about it 
 fast forward to last night where me my wife and a bunch of friends are at todd 's 
 tiffany does the kissy thing when we arrive of course but otherwise we have a good time and are drinking some 
 eventually we 're leaving 
 todd tiffany myself and my wife are at the door saying our goodbyes 
 tiffany leans in for a cheek kiss and drunk me decides it would be funny to go ahead and peck her on the lips instead 
 because lol that will teach her for always doing that stupid cheek kiss thing 
 i move my head with what must have been amazing timing and accuracy and get her square on the mouth ... and then ... i do n't know what happened she was kissed me back 
 not quite full-on open mouth but definitely not a small peck either 
 i think we were both slightly stupefied by what was happening and did n't pull away for at least a few seconds 
 eye <unk> were raised 
 i think someone said well goodnight '' and we left without making further eye contact 
 it was a very quiet ride home ... tl dr <unk> kissed my buddies wife goodnight in front of him and my wife 
 she kissed back 
 **edit** obligatory well this blew up '' 
 sorry i 've been at work 
 <unk> * todd and tiffany are recently married and i sometimes still call her his girlfirend '' instead of wife 
 so sorry 
 * my wife was somewhat pissed 
 thought i might have a thing '' for tiffany 
 said i should n't drink so much etc etc 
 i think she 'll get over it 
 * i talked to todd he said tiffany is pretty embarrassed but he does n't seem to really care and thought it was kind of funny 
 <unk> : ** on the minus side it 's going to make things awkward for a while 
 on the plus side i do n't think i 'm going to be getting cheek kisses in the foreseeable future either 
 moral of the story : i do n't recommend making out with other <unk> wives in front of your wife 
 unless you 've got some kind of understanding first 
 <unk> <unk> ending : ** tiffany todd myself and my wife are having an <unk> hot tub gang bang this <unk> a great big pile of snow and got excited about jumping into it like a swimming pool 
 long story short it was not fluffy and now my neck hurts 
 proof : tifu & gt warning to readers this story does mention the existence of sex 
 ok so this story beings monday night at a bar in seattle 
 while at said bar i see a very attractive young woman 
 now this girl was n't your everyday monday night bar drinker 
 she was beautiful tall long dark hair and that look in her eyes that said i 'm here because i 'm vulnerable ... '' i had to stop myself from yelling <unk> '' 
 when i spotted her 
 without wasting time i run over and introduce myself 
 i do n't want to <unk> but my pick up skills are <unk> to seattle women 
 i do my mating dance for a few hours and would n't you know it we 're headed to my place 
 we hop in my truck get to my apartment and proceed to basically eat each others faces 
 success 
 after a night of <unk> rainbows and <unk> we awake and begin the awkward <unk> ritual but as i said this girl was n't a normal monday night stand 
 she confidently stands up revealing her stunning naked body holds eye contact with me and smiles 
 remaining naked she stroll to the bathroom turns on the shower and whispers you coming or what '' 
 needless to say i liked her 
 again success 
 by this time im already late for work its around <unk> so i call in and say im having car problems a joke rich with irony but that will be understood later 
 now i could tell this <unk> was taking a strange turn when last nights date who will from now on be known as crazy '' asks me to leave 
 yes leave my own home ... i laughed waiting for the punch line but it never comes 
 she stared at me with what at the time seemed like a great whites <unk> black eyes 
 i took the hint and decided to just give her some space who knows what crazy is dealing with 
 i step out of the apartment for about 10min and walk down to 7-11 for some coffee 
 when i return the first thing i notice is my truck i was speechless ... crazy had taken what looks like a <unk> hammer and smashed my windshield only there was no hammer to be found 
 as if that was n't enough she then <unk> all 4 tires i stood in wonder for some time and then <unk> my apartment was most likely destroyed 
 took a deep breath and walked to my <unk> 
 i slowly opened my door closed my eyes and prepared myself for complete devastation 
 when i finally mustered the courage to open my eyes i could not have been more shocked 
 nothing was broken not only that but nothing was moved 
 in fact crazy had folded the sheets and shut off the lights 
 i started to suspect that this was an example of chance 
 that perhaps crazy had just had a bad day and left while simultaneously a <unk> had randomly or mistakenly destroyed my car 
 i was really hoping this was the case because crazy was still super hot and seemed normal 
 this was not the case 
 a neighbor told me herd to crack of the windshield and watched crazy slit all the tires with a <unk> 
 he also had no clue what she used to smash the windshield 
 i never asked for her phone number and doubt that ill be seeing her again 
 i did n't <unk> this post to help me search her down and make her pay for the damages 
 i am paying for the damages myself and i 'm also not involving police 
 after spending a little time in heaven with crazy and then spending a little money to cover the sobering damages 
 i have to say worth it ... so heres to you crazy thanks for a wild night and a good story 
 tl dr met a beautiful women made sweet sweet love she ruined my truck 
 basically a country song ... note sorry for the grammar i 'm at work and had to tell the story while it 's still fresh 
 this happened in march 
 most genuine apologies for length 
 my boyfriend and i occasionally like to go see movies in the theater but we try not to because the prices are <unk> and we try to only <unk> when it 's a film we believe is better experienced in a theater 
 this time however we really had nothing better to do and we went to see unfinished business '' with vince <unk> it looked <unk> 
 we sat behind a girl and her boyfriend they were kind of all over each other i was thinking that they would keep to themselves when the movie started so i was n't all <unk> yet 
 the lights go off and the <unk> start the ones where they show the little animation that says do n't run in the case of an emergency report suspicious activity <unk> turn off your cellphone* '' 
 it 's <unk> how quickly this girl whips out her phone and begins social <unk> ... she 's bored already 
 i ignore it the first couple of times the <unk> start she 's still on her phone 
 the movie starts she 's whipping out her phone every couple minutes then remains on her phone for 10 minutes puts it away <unk> with boyfriend ... whips out her phone again goes on facebook is texting people showing her boyfriend whatever 
 so about halfway into the movie this girl is still whipping out her phone every couple minutes doing the same things as if the events going on outside this theater are so extremely significant that she can not stand to wait an hour and a half to get back to it 
 why do people like this even pay to see movies then ruin it for others 
 so finally i turn to my boyfriend and ask him if i should say something 
 he says if she does it again just politely ask her to turn off her phone 
 after all we paid like $ 22 to see this shitty film so we might as well <unk> to enjoy what we 've paid for 
 there were probably 15 other people in this theater and nobody else is on their phone 
 i wait until she does it three more times 
 then i politely tap her on the shoulder and whisper hey do you think you could turn off your phone please the screen is really <unk> '' shut the fuck up bitch 
 fuck you '' 
 she starts <unk> screaming at me as if she 's indefinitely lost her cool 
 taken aback i say woah calm down 
 what is wrong with you 
 just turn off your phone ... '' she just keeps yelling fuck you bitch i 'll kick your ass 
 shut the fuck up 
 blah <unk> i can do <unk> '' 
 and then i lost my fucking cool i start getting defensive no fuck you you fucking bitch '' 
 i just lost it 
 my boyfriend was all wtf '' 
 her boyfriend was all wtf '' 
 my boyfriend says to me she 's just an ignorant bitch '' 
 and the girl has the audacity to yell at us can y'all shut the fuck up over there 
 that is so rude '' 
 to which her boyfriend replied babe just turn off your phone ... we 're in a movie theater '' 
 she did n't turn her phone on again 
 when the movie was over my boyfriend and i were the first ones out of there and i hear her behind me where is that fucking girl i 'm gon na kick her ass '' 
 i hid aside a fountain drink machine 
 i was so heated just livid 
 we have n't been to that movie theater since 
 it 's pretty awful 
 movie theaters are generally pretty awful 
 **tl dr. asked the girl in front of me to get off the phone and she starts screaming at me and when i tried to keep it together i ultimately stooped to her level and made a huge scene 
 ** so this happened earlier today 
 enter me enter sexy blonde girl 
 after a night of heavy flirting i finally convinced her to come back to my apartment 
 i put on some rock to get us both in the mood for some aggressive sex she had let me know she was into it beforehand and broke out the condoms 
 it was going great 
 approximately 4 min after foreplay and getting it in my little soldier decided he wanted to get some fresh air 
 my brain did n't register the fact that i was n't still inside her and decided to start going even harder than i was before 
 my johnson bent in half and popped 
 it sounded like the most satisfying knuckle pop 
 i looked down and my <unk> was black blue and bigger than my wrist 
 i cried and ran out if the room because of the pain 
 apparently fractured <unk> exist 
 she left very soon after 
 tl dr : you can beat your meat you can choke your chicken but god <unk> you ever break your <unk> 
 edit 1 : holy 
 this got big 
 rip inbox 
 edit 2 : figures my gold cherry would be popped after i break my dick 
 thanks kind internet stranger 
 edit 3 : sorry for no response for a while i was in surgery 
 apparently this happens more often than you would <unk> this was n't today '' post 
 it was last saturday and my friends presented me with the question '' hey <unk> what does a vagina feel like '' 
 rather than trying to explain a whole new concept to my friends i decided to relate it to something we all know and love ... or so i thought 
 i responded with '' do you know when you feel your butthole ... '' the room went silent 
 after a short pause i was met with <unk> laughter 
 various what '' 
 and huh '' 
 sounds ensued 
 turns out not everyone has felt their own <unk> before 
 from what i 've recently learned nobody i know has ever felt their butthole 
 now everyone at school calls me finger <unk> '' and the butthole kid '' 
 not just the guys i told but everyone 
 fuck my life and not in the butthole 
 i had to remove the word pussy from the title because of the auto mod rules for weekdays obligatory did n't happen today bit goes here 
 so it 's new years eve 2010 and all of our friends and their kids are over at my house to celebrate ... except josh 
 josh is home sick with the <unk> 
 his wife and kids are here 
 all the kids are inside playing video games and watching cartoons while most of the adults are in the garage <unk> out and drinking and smoking and the usual party stuff 
 around 11pm or so the party is full swing and josh calls his wife to ask her to come home early because he was feeling so awful 
 we are all <unk> on him in the background and she is complaining as well since she does n't want to go home early and basically tells him to call his mother 
 right before she hangs up the phone i get up behind her and scream towards the phone you are n't that sick throw some clothes on and come over pussy 
 it 's new years eve 
 <unk> '' 
 well the next morning i have to get up for work ... i step over all the passed out kids and friends and go on about my day 
 then she josh 's wife gets a call from his mother saying they are taking him to the hospital
