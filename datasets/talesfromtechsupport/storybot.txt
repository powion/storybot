so my story starts on what was a normal day taking calls on the front line for a large cable company. the job pays well and for the most part the people i deal with are fairly nice to talk to. quite often we'll get calls from seniors (especially in the morning) who have premise equipment issues such as "snow on screen" or "no signal" on their tv sets connected to our digital equipment. now my heart does go out to some of these folk because up until recently (past few years) we would supply straight analog cable to many homes (coax direct from wall to tv with scrolling guide). however most cities we service nowadays require our digital equipment to receive channels, and this has caused a lot of frustration with older people who don't know how to operate said equipment (ie. always having your tv set on "video" or "hdmi" to get picture). so often times we get customers who are repeat offenders with long ticket histories of these types of issues. so anyway, i get a call from an older gentleman who's quite bitter and mean right off the bat (doesn't like that i asked for his address / telephone number to verify the account, hates that he has to speak with a machine before reaching an agent, etc.). i have some experience handling these types of customers, however this call was going to be a little different. i spent over 45 minutes with this guy (we'll call him mr. smith) trying to get his tv set connected to the digital box properly so he could receive a picture. no luck. he was getting clearly frustrated by the whole ordeal and started blaming me for not being able to do my job properly, how i was useless, etc. whatever. like i said, i've dealt with this before so i tried my best not to take it personally, but eventually i had to ask him if we could book a service tech to the home (a courtesy call) to get his tv working correctly. unfortunately, our booking calendar was showing an appointment 3 days out. that's when he dropped this on me: "don't bother sending a goddamn technician, because i'll be dead by then. i'm 94 and tv is the only thing i have left, are you really going to make me wait for a tech?" i instantly felt bad. i mean, i've heard every complaint in the book as to why people don't want to wait for a tech but this one kind of got to me. i'm in my mid-20's so honestly i can't even imagine how it must feel to utter those words. so i spoke with my supervisor, who said they'd see if we could get someone out earlier...but we couldn't promise anything. so i let mr. smith know and he was predictably not very happy with my answer. at that point it almost sounded like he started to cry and went into how he has no family left, and no friends that come visit (this was after i asked if there was anyone in his building that might be able to help). man. i felt terrible, so i took it upon myself to ask mr. smith if i could pay a visit (he lived in a small city over from where i was, not very far to drive). he was a little shocked i was willing to do this, but sounded thankful i was willing to come out and help him personally. so i head over, get to the residence and meet him - within 30 seconds i had the cable running again (simple input change) and even brought him a simplified remote for his set top box to avoid this problem in the future. that's when he started crying. he goes into how he hasn't actually spoken or really interacted with anyone for years. he gave me a hug and told me how thankful he was that i came out and helped him, and told me how sorry he was for being so mean earlier on. i said it was no problem and i was happy to help, and that was it - i left. 3 weeks later, my supervisor comes to my desk and asks me if i could come speak with her for a bit about an account for "mr. smith". turns out, he sent the cable company a letter outlining how thankful he was for helping him with his issue and how it really "made an old man happy again for once in a very long time". the letter was framed and put on our front entrance to retail. i guess the moral of this story is no matter how nasty someone is to you over the phone, sometimes they're not always a terrible person and just going through a lot. i still think about mr. smith occasionally when i get those nasty customers and it makes me feel a little better. anyway thanks for reading just thought i'd share how this one call changed my outlook on life :) i witnessed this astounding it meltdown around 2004 in a large academic organization. an employee decided to send a broad solicitation about her need for a local apartment. she happened to discover and use an all-employees@org.edu type of email address that included everyone. and by "everyone," i mean every employee in a 30,000-employee academic institution. everyone from the ceo on down received this lady's apartment inquiry. of course, this kicked off the usual round of "why am i getting this" and "take me offa list" and "omg everyone stop replying" responses... each reply-all'ed to all-employees@org.edu, so 30,000 new messages. email started to bog down as a half-million messages apparated into mailboxes. it fail #1: not necessarily making an all-employees@org.edu email address - that's quite reasonable - but granting unrestricted access to it (rather than configuring the mail server to check the sender and generate one "not the ceo = not authorized" reply). that wasn't the real problem. that incident might've simmered down after people stopped responding. in a 30k organization, lots of people go on vacay, and some of them (let's say 20) remembered to set their email to auto-respond about their absence. and the auto-responders responded to the same recipients - including all-employees@org.edu. so, every "i don't care about your apartment" message didn't just generate 30,000 copies of itself... it also generated 30,000 * 20 = 600,000 new messages. even the avalanche of apartment messages became drowned out by the volume of "i'll be gone 'til november" auto-replies. that also wasn't the real problem, which, again, might have died down all by itself. the real problem was that the mail servers were quite diligent. the auto-responders didn't just send one "i'm away" message: they sent an "i'm away" message in response to *every* incoming message... including the "i'm away" messages of the other auto-responders. the auto-response avalanche converted the entire mail system into an agent-smith-like replication factory of away messages, as auto-responders incessantly informed not just every employee, but also *each other*, about employee status. the email systems melted down. everything went offline. a 30k-wide enterprise suddenly had no email, for about 24 hours. that's not the end of the story. the it staff busied themselves with mucking out the mailboxes from these millions of messages and deactivating the auto-responders. they brought the email system back online, and their first order of business was to send out an email explaining the cause of the problem, etc. and they addressed the notification email to all-employees@org.edu. it fail #2: before they sent their email message, they had disabled most of the auto-responders - but they missed at least one. more specifically: they missed at least *two*. [part 1]( [part 2]( [part 3]( part 4 &gt; to:boss@company &gt; from:steve@client &gt; subject: out of office &gt; dear sir: &gt; i apologize for the inconvenience, but i need to request file xyz from you. my phone is having trouble recieveing emails, however, but i can receive the file by facebook message. &gt; steve jack had been out of the office about twenty minutes when boss forwarded this to me. i called him at his desk. "hey boss. i just got the email you forwarded me. you need me to send file xyz for you?" "yes. can you...can you send people files on facebook?" "yes, i can. but i'll have to use the computer jack's been using, though. it's the only one that can access facebook." "right, right. i'll meet you in my wife's office." i hung up the phone and launched a single .bat file on my desktop. it ran its commands and then deleted itself as i walked away. * i got to boss' wife's office a few minutes later. i smiled to her and boss before crossing to the computer. "give me a second to bring up facebook and then--" i turned the laptop around to face us and boss's wife reached over, moving the mouse. the screen flared to life. boss stared. boss' wife gasped. a soft moan, followed by the neigh of a horse, emanated from the laptop. she frantically closed the video window...revealing a second window underneath it; a bing search for "*best places to buy weed near me*". she closed that one, too...revealing buzzfeed's "*10 signs you're over your job*". as she slammed the laptop shut, boss shook his head, red and shaking with anger. "how...how was that--i mean, i thought--who was using this computer?" he roared. boss's wife shook her head. "jack was using it about a half-hour ago..." as as if on cue, jack appeared in the doorway with the leftovers from lunch in a carryout bag in his hand. boss's back was to him. "that kind of thing should be blocked!" he yelled at me, pointing to the laptop. i nodded. "i agree. jack said he needed to use the unrestricted computer for some important projects. that's why he asked you to retrieve the key to my desk last week, right?" i pointed to the door with my chin and boss saw jack. jack blinked at boss. he looked at me. he looked at the computer. then back to me. i could see it dawned on him what was going on. "y-you did something to my computer, didn't you?!" he demanded. of course i had. i had copied a hidden batch file onto jack's desktop from a usb drive when i "fixed" his computer the other day. a file that would send me his browsing history without remoting into his desktop or alerting him. then, all it would need would be a remote command, which i'd set off from my own computer. the file would then delete itself after launching three web pages as soon as the mouse moved...three of the most incriminating web pages jack had ever visited on the computer. all it needed was a remote command, which i'd set off from my own computer. granted, it wasn't entirely untraceable, but the only person who'd know what to look for was in this room, looking with as angry a face i could muster at the awful end user who had become the bane of my existence. boss's wife chimed in. she was, at least, slightly more computer-savvy than her husband. "no. clickity didn't do anything. he just exited the...you know. the screensaver. whatever was there must have been what you were...um...*working on* when you rushed out of the office for lunch." she glared at jack and then addressed boss. "he must have forgotten to close out the evidence of his *blatant* misuse of company property." i shook my head solemnly. "and i trusted you with this unrestricted computer, too, jack. i even gave you your own email address for the company because i thought you'd be an asset. clearly...clearly i was wrong." i tried my best to sound hurt. boss's wife nonchalantly picked up the laptop and handed it to me. "jack, i am rather upset that you'd do something like this. i hired you as a favor to your mother. and you can be certain she'll hear about this. now go home." jack stood there, shaking. he probably had an idea of what i had done, but he'd have no way to prove it. "but...he...i..." he pointed at me wordlessly. "get out!" boss yelled. jack burst into tears and ran from the room. * now, as i write this, it's been four weeks since jack was terminated. i "patched" the "security hole" from spotify and the interns are listening to music again. i didn't give the spare desk key back to the office manager. as for jack...i saw him the other day when he stopped by with his mother. he came and knocked on my door. "um...clickity?" i looked up and narrowed my eyes. "what." "i just...i wanted to say i'm sorry for...for saying that stuff and...acting like i did..." i blinked. "...and...um...now that i've apologized, i was hoping you could tell my mom that i didn't really look up any of that stuff. you...you know you're the one who did it. not me. i mean..." he took a breath. "i mean, i've learned my lesson...so..." *seriously?* "come on, clickity. she's made me get another job...and she cut my allowance...come on!" he looked at me pleadingly. i almost felt sorry for him. almost. actually, not even almost. i shook my head and went back to typing. jack continued standing there, and after a few long moments i looked at him. "you can go now." and then he was gone. **edit:** clarity on my evil plan **edit 2**: wow! 3 gildings on one post. you guys are the best. **edit 3**: wow. this story has gotten a total of 20 gildings: one on part 2, one on part 3, 17 here, and one in /r/lounge. i am overwhelmed with happiness that you all enjoyed my story this much. :)[part 1]( part 2 [part 3]( [part 4]( the email was pretty self-explanatory. "due to recent reports of alleged security problems by an intern, i have had to temporarily block access to spotify. i apologize for the inconvenience." it got around relatively quickly that jack was the one responsible. two of the interns quit. they stopped playing music out loud. none of them talked to jack. he wasn't in the intern room for very long anyway. about a week after his hire, boss's wife decided to let jack just use her office while she wasn't there, presumably because he complained about how the interns were all being so very mean to him. * day 8. i got an email from jack. "i'm having issues accessing buzzfeed." i didn't even move from my chair, emailing back a simple reply: "due to management concerns, buzzfeed is not allowed per our firewall settings." his email was immediate. "please? i just want to check some things while i'm on lunch." i replied back a simple "no" and went about my day. and that was the last i ever heard from jack. i'm kidding. *of course it wasn't.* * day 9. someone had opened my desk. see, i have a laptop in my desk. the laptop is set up to bypass the firewall if we need it, like if we need to find a business by looking them up on facebook or read a news article on a usually-blocked news site. it's common knowledge i have it. someone had unlocked my desk and taken the laptop. i stormed down to the officer manager's desk. she and i have the only two keys to my desk. i told her that my desk had been opened and that a company laptop was missing. "oh?" she said, confused. "boss came down here and needed the key to your desk." "boss!?" i was taken aback. "i...alright." maybe boss needed the laptop for something, i told myself. but that didn't stop me from going straight to boss' wife's office. there, sitting at the polished hardwood desk, sat jack, with my laptop. and my desk key next to it. i approached. "jack, i need you to give me that back." jack shook his head. "i got approval from boss. the computer in here was acting funny, so i asked if i could use your spare laptop and he said yes." i was completely stunned. "so you asked boss to get you the key to my desk--" i picked the desk key up and put it in my pocket--"then take my laptop, and use it for..." i looked over the screen. two windows docked side by side: facebook and cheezburger. "...this?" he shifted the laptop so i couldn't see the screen and cleared his throat like i was intruding on his private data. "thanks. you can go now." *you can go now.* *you. can. go. now.* nope. nope, nope, nope. shit doesn't work like this, man. i felt like i wanted to just slap the child sitting in front of me, but i steadied my hand and took a breath. the only laptop with unrestricted internet access was in the hand of a spoiled intern. the only laptop with unrestricted access. i smiled at jack. "alright, no problem. have a good day." i walked out of the office. i had a plan. jack was fucking going **down**. **edit**: wow! thanks to whoever gave me gold![part 1]( [part 2]( part 3 [part 4]( "dude...your self-control must be like gandhi." my friend steve, who works for one of my company's clients, heard me ranting about jack while we had a coffee. i shook my head. "i know. but what am i gonna do? slap him? get myself fired?" "sounds like it'd be worth it." i sighed and took a steadying sip of my coffee. "i have a plan, though. but i need your help." he perked up and then scowled. "my help? oh, no. i don't like this guy much, but--" "i'll put the whole story on reddit if you help me." he thought about it. "alright, but on one condition: you tell everyone that i am the hero that made your evil plan possible." and so, for the record, steve became the hero who made my evil plan possible. * day 11. i got a call from boss. "clickity, i just got a call from jack." *of course you did.* "what seems to be the problem, boss?" "he says you've made his new computer not work." i blinked, staring at the speaker phone. "*his* new computer? you mean our unrestricted computer that he's...using?" "yes, yes, that one." i could almost see boss lean in to the speakerphone. "i don't know what your problem is, clickity, but jack complains that you're preventing him from working. so i need you to fix his computer now." click. as if on cue (or more, as if he had been outside the office listening) jack appeared at my doorway with the laptop. "so i need you to undo whatever you did." he opened the laptop and sat it in front of me, on top of my paperwork as if to say *you know...regardless of whatever you were doing ten seconds ago.* i seethed, pulling out a usb drive and plugging it into the laptop. i grumbled wordlessley as i clicked a few buttons on the laptop and then a few on my computer. i unplugged the usb drive and closed the laptop. "there. have a nice day." jack picked up the laptop and turned for the door. "you better not screw with me again." as soon as he was gone i smashed my pencil sharpener with my fist. * day 14. it was the perfect day. boss's wife was in the office so jack was sharing her desk and, from the looks of my remote viewer, doing absolutely nothing at all. i sent out an email. &gt; to: internemail@company &gt; from: clickity@company &gt; subject: intern appreciation day &gt; hiya interns! i just cleared this with the office manager. for your hard work, i'm treating you guys to lunch. go see the office manager and pick up a (local pub and burger joint) gift card and have a great day. thanks for your hard work! a few minutes later the phone rang. boss's wife's office. "it, this is clickity." "this is jack. i just saw all the interns walk out...what's going on?" "oh, it's intern appreciation day. didn't you get the email? i sent it to the...oh." i sighed. "i completely forgot to send it to your email because it's separate. yeah, all the interns are getting lunch." "thanks for letting me know," jack said with audible edge to his voice. "if i hadn't called you, you wouldn't have told me at all, would you--" he's cut off by a disapproving "tsk" from boss's wife. i cleared my throat and ignored jack's i-own-you attitude. "go quick and you can still catch them--" "fine." jack hung up the phone. i took a few reassuring breaths and texted steve.i'm sitting here stewing in my own juices. damn home phone (which i keep because the security system uses) started ringing at 5:45am. yes i was asleep goddamn it. i don't get to it quickly enough and the answering machine picks it up and hang up. then i hear my mobile phone start ringing downstairs... must be some kind of family emergency so i make it downstairs in time to hear the home phone start up again. i answer, still half asleep and half scared that something big has happened. &gt; [me] "hello?" &gt; [fof] "hi dallasitguy, this is $guyyoubarelyknow. do you have a second? i can't get my laptop on my home wireless and i really need to check to make sure my flight is on time." &gt; [me] "who the fuck is this again?" &gt; [fof] "this is $guyyoubarelyknow. i'm a friend of $otherguy. we met at $neighborhoodbar a couple of weeks ago. my internet's down and i remembered you're in it so i looked up your number and gave you a ring. can you help me real quick? &gt; [me] you ~@!$~@#$$#$%*^%*&amp;%$#^%@#$!@#$!@! !%!@$@! !#@$!$ !%$%#$^$#&amp;$%*&amp; @#$%@#$%@# @#$%@#$% @%@$#%#%@#%!! do you know how early it is you presumptuous sob? i barely even know you and you wake us up so i can help you with your ~#!#@$#@!~ internet connection? don't you ever ~!$!@!#%$! call me again you @!~!#@~^%!! &gt; [fof] "uhh... sorry... i didn't think you'd mind... i just... &gt; [me] "go f yourself!" click. so... i'm up now. edit: i called $otherguy to find out if he gave the guy my home &amp; mobile numbers. he did - last night about 8:00pm or so he claims. i made it clear to him that he's officially on my shit list as well. i'm tempted to do a conference call with both of them in the middle of the night every night for the next week, but i suppose that would keep me from sleeping as well and therefore be self defeating. hell is other people.a call comes in, a user reports her keyboard is going erratic, it is "possessed." i take a stroll down to the office bearing a new replacement keyboard. i get there and i begin to make sure that it is indeed a faulty keyboard, and not just some gunk sticking the key down. i open up notepad and immediately i am barraged by "...nnnnnnn..." everything seems fine otherwise, this keyboard is the same model as the replacement i brought over, so relatively new, no sticky keys either. very well a faulty keyboard it is. until... ...until i move the tower and notice a second, wireless keyboard sitting on the side of it, laying flat on the floor, with a stack of papers and a tissue box sitting atop. i pull it out and notice the n barrage has stopped on the screen. i press the n key once again and an n is added to the word file. exorcism was performed, demons were banished, am now priest. part 1 [part 2]( [part 3]( [part 4]( i had been working as a small office's sysadmin for a little over two months when jack was hired. jack was a paid intern whose mother was friends with my boss's wife. jack grew up in the wealthiest county in the state (where my boss lives) and has had everything he ever wanted. a sense of entitlement that hung around him like the smell of five-day-old socks was the first thing i noticed upon being introduced to him as he went around the office. "jack, this is clickity, our, erm...uh...tech...guy..." my boss introduces me, in that way that old bosses who don't use computers often do. jack extends his hand. "oh, cool. nice to meet ya." i shake. "welcome aboard." jack is very eager to get started doing...whatever. "will i get a business email?" as if this is the most interesting thing ever. adorable, i think. "eventually, yes. for the moment though, we have a shared email for interns on staff. i'll get you the credentials shortly." most of the interns use the shared email for a while until getting their own. just standard procedure. "you run the firewall, right?" "yes." "so you can block and unblock sites?" "yes." jack's eager smile is contagious. "cool! nice to meet you." he waves and the boss and jack leave to go be introduced elsewhere. now, dear reader, you might be wondering why i would call jack the worst end user ever given his politeness and general smiling demeanor who has some understanding of what a sysadmin is, and what a sysadmin does. that's above average when it comes to end users. well, we're only getting started here with jack. -- the first thing jack did was complain the moment he was out of earshot. he apparently explained to the boss that it really would be professional to have his own email given his experience and the fact that he was really more than just an intern. see, jack knew his shit and that was that if he complained to mother, she would complain to boss-wife, who would complain to boss. and boss, figuring an email is a small thing to ask for, had a request to set up a personalized email account for jack on my desk within the hour. this was not to be a good start of a relationship with one's it guy. -- day 2, i got an it ticket for the room where the interns work. it's a large open office with a bunch of computers and printers where the interns print stuff all day long. because it's such mind-numbing work, they tend to play music off of pandora or spotify in there. the ticket says: "from internemail@companyemail: hey, we're having issues with spotify. not super important, but please help if you're free! thanks" aw, those guys are always nice to me. maybe it's because i leave reddit unblocked on our firewall so they can reddit at lunch. an hour or so later i have a few free minutes and i head down. i check out spotify and find the issue and fix it. jack is there and watches closely. "we can use spotify here?" he asks. "yep," i reply. "pandora works, too," another intern adds. everything checks out and i leave the happy-again-they-can-play-music interns and jack. -- a couple hours later, i got a note on my desk. see, boss knew i allowed people to play music and such at the office. he believed was that spotify is a huge security risk, leaving holes in our firewall through which everything from viruses to malware to cyberterrorists could come through. boss was unhappy that i would allow such a threat to exist in our system, and ordered me to close it up. i called boss. when i asked who told him these incorrect things about spotify? oh, jack did, of course. i explained that spotify was not a threat, and that jack was simply mistaken. jack, however, was on the other end of the line, in boss's office, on speakerphone, and interjected: "dude, it's alright if you didn't know about the security issue. but don't try and make me look bad for your mistake." i'm stunned as boss hangs up the phone after demanding i fix it. **edit:** claritythis is a second hand story told to me 20 years ago by someone who was already a veteran sysadmin back then, so it could have happened in the 80s or early 90s. the scene is a factory making heavy machinery. they are modern and the factory floor had terminals connected to a mainframe for tracking parts and whatever else they needed it for. one day a sysadmin gets a call from the factory floor and after the usual pleasantries the user says: &gt; i can't log in when i stand up. the sysadmin thinks that it's one of those calls again and goes through the usual: &gt; is the power on? what do you see on the terminal? have you forgotten your password? the user interrupts: &gt; i know what i'm doing, when i sit down i can log in and everything works, but i can't log in when i stand up. the sysadmin tries to explain that there can be no possible connection between the chair and the terminal and sitting or standing should in no way affect the ability to log in. after a long back and forth on the phone, he finally gives up and walks to the factory floor to show the user that standing can't affect logging in. the sysadmin sits down at the terminal, gets the password from the user, logs in and everything is fine. turns to the user and says: &gt; see? it works, your password is fine. the user answers: &gt; yeah, told you, now log out, stand up and try again. the sysadmin obliges, logs out, stands up, types the password and: *invalid password*. ok, that's just bad luck. he tries again: *invalid password*. and again: *invalid password*. baffled by this, the sysadmin tries his own mainframe account standing: *invalid password*. he sits down and manages to log in just fine. this has now turned from crazy user to a really fascinating debugging problem. the word spreads about the terminal with the chair as an input device and other people start flocking around it. those are technical people in a relatively high tech factory, they are all interested in fun debugging. production grinds to a halt. everyone wants to try if they are affected, it turns out that most people can log in just fine, but there are certain people who can't log in standing and there are quite a few who can't log in regardless of standing or sitting. after a long debugging session they find it. turns out that some joker pulled out two keys from the keyboard and switched their places. both the user and the sysadmin had one of those letters in the password. they were both relatively good at typing and didn't look down at the keyboard when typing when sitting. but typing when standing is something they weren't used to and had to look down at the keyboard which made them press the wrong keys. some users couldn't type properly and never managed to log in. while others didn't have those letters in their passwords and the switched keys didn't bother them at all.**edit: this post has received a tremendous amount of attention, which is awesome. and while i

memories of a client of my own that was paranoid and rightly so (as an aside, /u/jayykidd, we are totally making pars a thing around here). as a bit of backstory, i spent five years doing it consulting in a rural town about an hour from portland, or. i worked for a small company with a few other consultants and a couple of bench techs. my job was primarily server/network engineering-centric, but having done my time as a front-line tech i'd periodically involve myself in the more interesting/complex cases we'd see from our walk-in customers. one day we had a woman come in. she caught my eye because she was in her late thirties or early forties, and actually quite attractive. she had short, platinum blonde hair and bright red lips, and was dressed and styled like she was transplanted right out of a 1950's era magazine ad. one of our bench techs greets her and starts talking to her. right out the gate i can tell she is panicked and, by the sound of it, tin-foil hat levels of crazy. shit, there goes any desire i had to flirt with her and maybe see if i could buy her a drink. i listen in on the conversation anyways, because it's at least a change of pace from the monotony of my day-to-day. after a few minutes of her going on about how her husband is spying on her through all manner of devices, my bench tech looks back at me with a *can-you-please-come-help-me-and-make-her-go-away* look on his face. i oblige, as i appreciated that the front-line guys respected me enough to ask for my help on these things. i walked up front, introduced myself as the supervisor, and told her that since her issue was so unique and serious it'd probably be best if our more senior staff handled it. now that i was seeing her up close, i could tell that under her classy outfit and marilyn monroe-esque makeup was a deeply distraught woman. her eyes looked baggy, and tired. like she had been up too late crying. obviously, at this point i'm just playing along. this isn't my first rodeo, and generally what happens is the client claims some individual or three letter agency is monitoring their computer, we tell them our hourly rate for forensics ($150 an hour), and suddenly the men-in-black-suits watching them aren't that big of a deal anymore. now, to be fair, we actually *did* specialize in computer forensics and data recovery, working extensively with the local police department and a handful of legal firms on a number of cases where they needed expert help, we even had a guy on staff full-time who wore that hat most days. the local police were pretty small-time and farmed out at least some of their computer crime related work to us on contract. in the cases where people *did* want to pay, we would do our due diligence, and prepare a professional report of our findings accordingly. we would meet with attorneys and testify in court, as necessary. generally it was fairly benign stuff like gathering chat logs and browser history for a divorce proceeding where one spouse accused the other of cheating or something similar, and wanted evidence to back that up. back to the client at hand. she insists her husband is monitoring her every move, tracking her vehicle, monitoring her computer, and recording her in her own home. here's where it gets interesting: she claims that she *knows* all of this, because he has told her about it. in fact, he has gone so far as to threaten her life if she tries to tamper with any of it. she says she has tried to apply for a protective order against him, but ostensibly without some sort of evidence of his behavior, nobody would take her seriously. i give her the crazy litmus test and i tell her that in order to gather evidence discreetly we would need two of our senior consultants to investigate. $300 an hour, four hour minimum. she pulls out her wallet. fuck, she's serious. we agree to start with her vehicle to check for signs of the gps tracker. she says she is parked several blocks away so her husband won't know she came to a computer store (we were in a downtown area surrounded by retail stores). so i grab my toolbag and holler at one of my colleagues (who has been tuned in himself from his back office desk) to join me. so the lady, myself, my colleague, and both of our now intensely curious bench techs (all of us in matching company polos) follow this lady down the street to her car. what a motley crew we must have been. we get to her minivan begin our process of looking for this gps device. now, gps trackers (at least the commercially available ones) require two things, generally: dedicated 12v power and an unobstructed (at least by metal) view of the sky. they basically use gps to grab the coordinates and then a gsm/cdma (cellular) signal to relay the positional data to a web interface or something. so there really aren't that many places they can really be mounted that are both effective and discreet. we spend some time looking around the undercarriage, rocker panels, and even bits of the interior. battery doesn't have any additional leads running off of it, fuse box isn't tapped anywhere for power. nothing. just as i'm starting to lose faith that this may not be quite as exciting as i had perhaps hoped, i find the fucking thing. it was tiny, not much bigger than a flash drive, and mounted behind the front grille. it looked pretty much exactly like [this]( the reason it didn't need auxiliary power is that it wasn't an active device. this device did not provide real-time tracking, rather it used some internal memory and a couple aaa batteries to log gps data for days at a time. at some point, when the van was not in use, the guy would grab the gps device, upload the data to his laptop, maybe swap batteries, then remount it to the car. fucking hell, this lady was very much indeed paranoid and rightfully so. now that we've established that she isn't batshit insane but that she actually *is* being tracked by her husband, the tone amongst our team became drastically more serious. obviously, something sinister is going on, and we aren't sure what, but by the sound of things this lady really is fearful of her life. she has entrusted *us* to gather evidence and help her get a protective order against him, which is something i think all of us took quite seriously. we show her the tracker and she breaks down into tears because it's the first evidence she has physically seen. we take photos of it, and carefully install it back where it belongs. i sort of assumed that a gps tracker on your fucking car would be proof enough for a judge to issue at least a temporary protective order, but she seemed insistent that she would need more evidence to make it stick. our next moves have to be conducted very deliberately. she claims that her home is bugged, and so is her computer. we will need to go onsite to investigate accordingly, but it will have to be at a time when both her husband isn't home and when we will be able to quickly create a report for her, leaving her enough time to get a protective order before the day's end. we couldn't chance him coming home later, reviewing whatever it was he was recording, and finding out that she had taken action to have him investigated. it wasn't going to be for at least a week before there was a time that was just right. we made arrangements with her back at the office and i offered to walk her back to her car. she accepted, and on the way she confided in me many of the personal details of her life and her obviously abusive relationship with her husband. in the interest of protecting her privacy i'll simply say that it sounded like she finally figured out how manipulative he was, and when she said she wanted out he wasn't about to let that happen. i asked her again if she really was afraid for her life, and the sincerity of her "yes" was both scary and heartbreaking for me. i asked her if she had thought about getting a gun, and she said she had, but that he would notice the large sum of money needed to purchase one missing from their joint account. as the gravity of the situation weighed on me, i offered to let her borrow one of mine. she was awestruck, but i assured her that it was completely okay. at the time, i had several handguns and rifles, and i couldn't think of a more appropriate situation for someone to have one. my car was parked close by, and we walked over to it. i tried to gather some idea of her familiarity with guns, as the thought of giving one to more or less a complete stranger, especially one that might not know what to do with it, was unsettling to me. it sounded like she had at least a basic understanding of their function, had gone shooting before, etc. in my mind the pros of her having at least some means to protect herself outweighed the cons, so i moved forward. in the trunk, i had a [ruger lcp]( which is a very small .380 caliber handgun that i kept in my get home bag/emergency survival kit. it was fitted with the factory installed crimson trace laser grips, which i had dialed in to about 10 meters. we went over the basics of how to use it safely, i showed her how the laser worked, and told her that, for her situation, all she had to know was that the bullet would go more or less where the red dot of the laser was. she was crying, and frankly at this point i pretty much was, too. i gave her my cell phone number and told her to call me if she needed someone to talk to. we hugged for a while before parting ways. it wasn't a romantic hug or anything, it was that kind of hug that's exchanged when someone *needs to be held*. like, when your best mate tells you his mom passed away or something. she needed the comfort of knowing that she wasn't alone, that at least one person took her seriously, and i'd like to think that i gave her some hope that things would be *okay*. the next week was tense, as we prepared for our investigation. my coworkers and i spent considerable time discussing and researching ways to triage her computer to look for evidence, as well as how to approach the search of the house. when the day finally came, we arrived onsite at the specified time armed with our forensics tools, flashlights, laptops...anything we might need. i set to work immediately on her computers (a home desktop and a personal laptop) while two of my colleagues began their search of the house. i removed the drives from her pcs, and using a usb write-blocker, (which physically prevented me from writing/modifying any information on her drives) i made a clone of both drives. for the sake of speed, both drives were cloned to ssds. once cloned, i put the pcs back they way they were and began mounting the cloned volumes and investigating. the drives were mounted into a quarantine vm, with no wlan access. scanning the drives with a number of antimalware programs didn't turn anything up. looking through the file system however (paying special attention to hidden files and protected system files), turned up some things that didn't look quite right (filenames and directories that looked obfuscated). i made the call to boot up both pcs off of the cloned ssds and look that them live to see if maybe i could catch an obfuscated process running, or something. nothing. with nothing else open, i ran a *netstat -an* out of cmd. there were a handful of tcp connections active. one by one, i started performing dns lookups on the ips. everything was normal active connections for background processes like skype. then, i found it. an active connection to a clearly obfuscated domain name. it looked like a license key with a *.com* at the end of it. something like 24w25-188egff-98001qrd.com. it was hiding in plain sight, and it was registered to spectorsoft corporation. guess what they sell? yup. surveillance software. the pc was running something called [spector pro]( which was capable of monitoring all of the users activities, browsing history, keylogging, even sending remote screen captures to a mobile phone or email based on target keywords. it was the full nine yards for monitoring. i screen capped everything for my logs, shut the system down, and swapped the forensic ssds for the original disks to put everything back the way it was. not too long after, our other two guys found some evidence of their own. two separate (and frankly, rather rudimentary) cmos cameras hidden in the master bedroom. one in the closet in a shoebox, one in the smoke detector in the ceiling. both, if i recall correctly, were simply wired to 9v batteries and recorded to sd cards. all things considered, they were pretty low tech. the contents of the memory cards would have had to be moved off at least once a day, and the battery probably changed at least as often. we didn't touch anything. lots of photographs were taken. we went back to the office and compiled all of the evidence into a document for her, and i passed the disk images onto our forensics guy for further evaluation. i met with the client later that day to present her the report so she could furnish it to the court. the gratitude she had for us was absolutely immeasurable. we didn't charge her for our services. getting to play a role in stopping her sick fuck of a husband from engaging in whatever it is he was doing was payment enough. i'd like to tell you that i know how this story ends. i'd like to say that the guy was put away in jail forever, and my supreme it prowess and white-knightery wooed her into my arms and we lived happily ever after. but frankly, i don't really know what happened. what i *can* tell you that about a week after we gave her our report, i met her for coffee at a place across the street. she looked visibly better. her puffy, tired eyes were gone, replaced instead by ones that seemed to glisten with warmth. her skin was radiant and beautiful. she was smiling, for the first time i'd seen. an immense weight had been lifted off of her, and it showed. she told me that she was temporarily living with her mom and dad, that a restraining order was in place on her estranged husband, and that she was finally filing for divorce. she told me that for the first time in a very long time she felt safe, and that she felt happy. in the parking lot, she gave me back the little handgun, profusely thanking me again for the work we did. she hugged me, both of us teary-eyed, and we parted ways. for me, it proved to be one of the most emotionally rewarding experiences of my career. edit: thank you to everyone who's gilded this post! it's definitely put a smile on my face.my mom is sweet, but she has this notion she shouldn't bother me unless its important. my phone rang last week while i was home. day off. &gt; mom: "do you have a minute honey? my internet doesn't work, either computer, nor the tablet either.. i was thinking maybe you could come have dinner later and look at it? i bought chicken, soft cheese, wine, and i'm baking a.." somewhere later down the menu i already fixed it. i work at the telco, and have access to my tools remotely, i saw it had no valid ip so i reset the modem and the router we provide her. basic lease renewal issue. it happens, everything else is green. &gt; bytewave: "boom, magic, you're online mom." &gt; mom: " whaa? ... oh. you're right." *sounds disappointed.* "thank you, that was really fast, i guess i won't trouble you to come over then." ... clearly she was more excited at the prospect of the meal than the free tech support, but for her it seems something broken or a holiday is required to 'trouble' me to hang out. &gt; bytewave: " hey hey there, i was promised a home cooked meal here. i'm happy to come anyway." &gt; mom: "haa that's fine, its nice of you to be polite. but i know you're busy, you don't have to. we can do this another time." okay let's do this the easy way. reach back to the tools, deprovision the router. &gt; bytewave: "there, its broken again mom. and it'll stay that way till dessert." &gt; mom: "oh! lovely then, shall we say 6 o'clock?" *cheerful* ... [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](i have been working my way up the food chain at the little it company i'm with. the clients i deal with i treat much like i did customers at starbucks. compassionate, caring, empathetic, blah blah good customer service, blah blah. and this has put me in good favor with all of our clients that i've dealt with. one in particular is a mid-size, regional company that specializes in giving sociopaths a lucrative opportunity to exploit people less strong willed than them. i'll let you determine the field. they are not my primary "station" but i help out there when the ticket queue gets overloaded. we can call them slimeco. most of the folks there that i deal with, while slimy in general, are quite pleasant towards me. i'm the cheerful guy with the laptop who doesn't make promises and just does what needs to be done, unlike the three other burnt-out techs stationed there who make hard deadlines they never meet. but there is one woman here who is beyond help. ever see that episode of kitchen nightmares or whatever it was that had the husband and wife pair that the wife was just completely convinced she could do no wrong and that everyone was out to get her? that's this woman. not literally, but a bit-for-bit duplicate. she is a problem for everyone, and my pleasant demeanor doesn't mean shit to her because i'm just trying to ruin her life. i avoid her like the plague because i have more important things to deal with than her fifteen tickets about the same goddamn bullshit that has been resolved over and over again. we'll just call her the.harpy from here on out. this past saturday, the fourth, i'm up at my friends' cottage for the long weekend, when i get a call from a number i don't recognize. i answer, because at 2am it could be important. something could be wrong at home, or with my family or what have you. &gt;me (groggily) "uh...hello?" &gt;the.harpy "finally someone fucking answers. aren't you guys on call or whatever?" &gt;me "i'm sorry, who is this?" &gt;t.h "who the fuck do you think it is? it's the.harpy from slimeco. my goddamn laptop keeps restarting." &gt;me "how did you get this number?" &gt;t.h "why does that fucking matter? you're it. you're on call. that's how it works. fix my fucking laptop or i'll have your job." &gt;me "this is a personal cell phone and i'm not on call, ever. we don't have 'on-call support'." &gt;t.h "if i can get a hold of you, you're on call. and this laptop you gave me isn't working. it keeps restarting and i need it to do my fucking job." &gt;me "i'm 200 miles away, i have no internet access so i couldn't remote in if i wanted to, and it's a holiday weekend. slimeco. is closed until tuesday." &gt;t.h "well i work off hours and i have work that needs to get done so get in your fucking car and find some internet and fix my fucking laptop" &gt;me "i'm sorry. there's nothing i can do. i'm not going out looking for an internet connection at 2 in the morning on a holiday weekend just because you decided you need to work right this second. i'm not even a dedicated slimeco. technician. i'm only there when support is needed, and i haven't been in the branch since last week." &gt;t.h "i don't give a **shit** you work for us and you will fix my laptop right now. i don't care if you have to drive all the way here to do it." &gt;me "you know what, you're right. i just need you to submit a ticket so i can get to it in the system and i'll head right over to the nearest starbucks." &gt;t.h "that's what i fucking thought. you know i shouldn't have to jump through these kind of hoops to get shit done around here. you should just be grateful you have a job at all you fucking dimwit" &gt;me "yep. you're right. go ahead and place the ticket and i'll head right on over to starbucks and remote in and get this all taken care of for you right away." &gt;t.h "good." she hangs up. i immediately put my phone on silent. my laptop is sitting comfortably in it's docking station back at the main office, 200 miles away, the nearest starbucks is about 40 miles away, and i go back to bed, about ten feet away. i check my phone in the morning. 61 missed calls. 14 voicemails. two hundred and thirty-nine emails. alternating between personal attacks fired off like text messages, and submitted tickets. funny how her laptop was stable long enough to submit around fifty tickets and another 180-ish emails. i blocked her number after that. i got into work today, and my boss had a similar situation. she kept calling his phone, long into the night. &gt;boss "you're nicer than i was. i just told her to enjoy her holiday weekend and hung up." *i wonder if starbucks is still hiring* _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ***an update: slimeco brought in the lawyers, and the excrement hit the fan.*** my boss spoke with upper management yesterday, and today when i came into that office (as i normally do on wednesday), i was immediately escorted to the board room by two security guards. the president, cfo, chairman of the board, slimeco's lawyer, our it firm's lawyer, and my boss were all at the table. i found out my boss had threatened to file a proper criminal suit as a result of t.h's behavior, on my behalf. it was explained to my boss and i that t.h, while an obvious problem, is a high-earner for the company and they would not fire her. however, it was discovered through an internal investigation that she had, in fact, gotten the numbers of all of the techs out of the cfo's blackberry. we don't know how she got into the blackberry, but what we do know is that the cfo left his blackberry unattended which is a serious security compromise and also a violation of the contract between the company and my it firm. some very strong words were exchanged between slimeco's officials and my boss. the lawyers agreed that it was, in fact, a serious breach of contract leaving any data available to unauthorized users, and it was made clear that the contract in place would be terminated at the end of the meeting. it was later explained to me that, given the nature of the breach, we'd basically have an "all hands on deck" situation where every available tech would report to slimeco and start pulling servers, switches, and any other leased equipment. estimated time of dismantlement was about two and a half hours. (there was also the phrase "wood chipper for hard drives" thrown in there. i don't know if this was literal or a figure of speech.) for the next two hours i was not allowed to leave the room. my boss, his lawyer, and slimeco renegotiated the contract on the spot. a 36% price hike, increased security improvements, and a couple other things that went right over my head. the lawyer then pointed out that i was still well within my rights to, and asked if i would be, seeking legal action. i asked what my options were. before he even got it out of his mouth, slimeco started talking about a "settlement" to keep me from going any further. without going into too many specifics there, a check was cut (and immediately cashed because they ain't gonna play me for no fool), the.harpy was put on an actual probation, my boss gave me the rest of the week off — billed to slimeco — so i can have an actual vacation, and i'm no longer going to do any service at slimeco. not the outcome i expected, at all.this story is pretty much almost 5 years old, but i want to vent it out, it's been causing me grief and i just need it to share it to finally feel calm. as you may remember, i live in mexico and things are not exactly pretty, thankfully i know how to watch my back and don't make enemies, but sometimes, destiny catches up with you. i had finished my training and got a certificate that allowed me to work on a computer store and repair computers, arrived early, everything normal until 1pm, guy comes in, wants his hdd wiped clean and a brand new copy of windows 7. i didn't ask many questions, just took it to the back and started working on it, gave the case a nice cleaning and removed the dust, boot it up, then manure hit the fan. i hear from the front how the front glass breaks and people started yelling my boss and the man to get the f*ck down, as well lots of insults to the client, before i could react, someone comes to where i was, pointing an ak rifle variant at me, i jump to the floor, eating that dirt and holding my hands on the back of my neck, avoiding any eye contact &gt;$t: what did you do to that computer!? &gt;$me: nothing!!! i didn't get to touch it! i was just cleaning it!!!! &gt;$t: lies cabron!!! &gt;$me: check it yourself, everything is intact! i could feel the barrel pointed agaitns me, i heard someone else come in and take the pc away, it felt like hours until they decided to retreat back and run away. once i recovered from the shock, i stand up and head to the front, my boss was on the phone, crying histerical, i didn't even hear the police syrens, then i noticed the client was missing. i was not allowed to see the security footage, but the client was taken away, he was identified as a cartel member, body discovered hours later. if it wasn't because i needed the money, i would have quit inmediatly, thakfully me avoiding eye contact probably saved my life. edit: i see many people doubt it, it's fine with me, but i'm going to clarify a few things. &gt;everyone speaks in spanish, i simply translated it into spanglish for style. &gt;i live in a dangerous city, hence why i watch my back. &gt;i never learned what was in that hdd, i'm better not knowing. this happened a while back but it's still the best thing that ever happened to me at work. true story. so, i was hired by a big defense company (upgrade tanks, naval weapons, etc) with over 3500 employees. you can imagine this was a very big company. we were in building 34 and if you needed to go somewhere quick you took a bike or an electric car. i usually did 2nd line support, but they had a couple of people call in sick and asked me to do first line support. it was a friday and not much was happening, besides the usual emailproblems and tech guys turning off unix machines that needed a checkdisk command with admin rights. the phone rings. &gt; yes hello, this the secretary of the ceo. we need you to come over now! we have a big problem. &gt; me: what seems to be wrong? &gt; her: mr ceo is trying to open a file in word, but everytime he does this, scrambled text is showing up. i think we are being hacked! (this was a big issue, since a couple of weeks before this a group of activists broke into the company and climbed on top of our radar tower) &gt; me: i'll take a look from here and take over your screen. hang on. so i take over his screen this is what happens: file, open: jkahsfhjkhjhjjjjjjfjjjjjsakkkalalllallallalallal*uuu**jjjdkjkjaslklkssssssssssssss &gt; her: i don't know what this is. you see?!? this is so weird... now, i knew what was wrong at this moment, but i wanted to see in person. you don't just walk into the exec office every day. &gt; me: uhuh. i'll be there as soon as possible! so i grab this electric car, drive over and 5 minutes later i walk into the executive building. a very nice building, totally different from the rest of the offices. they even had their own dining room and bar. the security guy sees me coming and waves me through, he was informed of my coming and understood the importance. i get out of the elevator at the top floor and am greeted by the secretary, a manager and some other assistent, all a bit panicked. &gt; come over, have a look at this! the ceo says.. he shows me: file, open: jkahsfhjkhjhjjjjjjfjjjjjsakkkalalllallallalallal*uuu**jjjdkjkjaslklkssssssssssssss so i look at him. i look at every single person in that room. you could feel the suspense. i look back at the computer. i pick up the newspaper that was on top of the keyboard and ask: &gt; try again please? the looks on their face: priceless. (got a free lunch with the ceo) -edit- formatting*in case you didn't see the edit on the other post, it was suggested i post a standalone update* my boss spoke with upper management yesterday, and when i came into that office today (as i normally do on wednesday), i was immediately escorted to the board room by two security guards. the president, cfo, chairman of the board, slimeco's lawyer, our it firm's lawyer, and my boss were all at the table. i found out my boss had threatened to file a proper criminal suit as a result of t.h's behavior, on my behalf. it was explained to my boss and i that t.h, while an obvious problem, is a high-earner for the company and they would not fire her. however, it was discovered through an internal investigation that she had, in fact, gotten the numbers of all of the techs out of the cfo's blackberry. we don't know how she got into the blackberry, but what we do know is that the cfo left his blackberry unattended which is a serious security compromise and also a violation of the contract between the company and my it firm. some very strong words were exchanged between slimeco's officials and my boss. the lawyers agreed that it was, in fact, a serious breach of contract leaving any data available to unauthorized users, and it was made clear that the contract in place would be terminated at the end of the meeting. it was later explained to me that, given the nature of the breach, we'd basically have an "all hands on deck" situation where every available tech would report to slimeco and start pulling servers, switches, and any other leased equipment. estimated time of dismantlement was about two and a half hours.

at all.a tale from the other side - my friend bought a netflix box for a tv, and when it wouldn't work, asked me to come set it up. i couldn't get there until after work, and when i did it was working. she said she called google to fix it (it was not a google product, nor does it use any google services) so i thought she googled the company number and had them fix it. i wanted to show her it wasn't google she called, so i checked the caller id. it was google. after a while on the phone a google tec support guy helped her set up an unrelated product for free. i guess google really is a helpful service. tl;dr girl wants a cable box set up, but is attacked by dragons while eating tacos. you don’t do any work on friday in it. if it goes wrong, you’ll be there all weekend fixing it. so, in the spirit of being careful, friday afternoon drinks were a tradition. 4pm friday was beer o’clock, and as the resident only-person-not-excited-by-crown-lager, responsibility for arranging the drinks fell to me. no big deal right? except that this was the day that i finally got an unlimited account with the local liquor store that would be billed to the company automatically. i wasn’t going to waste it. i did not waste it. our small 10-person company got rip-roaringly drunk. like ‘arrested for being outside in this state’ drunk. there was jack daniels cans stacked to the ceiling. chips had fallen liberally to the floor. someone couldn’t find a bin and filed a chicken wing in the file cabinet, under ‘c’, for chicken. it was one of /those/ drinking sessions where everyone is just a total mess. around 9pm, after five solid hours of aus-spec partying, we broke off and headed into the night. i wandered down to a nearby bar and watched some bands play for an hour, downed another jug of beer, and smiled to myself that the week had ended. fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony. my phone buzzed in my pocket. i ran outside, tripping up the stairs as i went, managed to steady myself against a signpost, and answered. it was the ceo. the primary and secondary route servers were down. i stood frozen in time for an instant, the same way a deer looks at the headlights of an oncoming car, and then asked him to repeat himself. &gt; ceo: yes both the route servers are down the entire state is offline get in there now fix it do whatever it takes i cannot stress enough that these two servers were the most important thing our company had. they, in and of themselves, were the primary thing around which our business existed, and all other things were secondary to them. my state was by far the biggest, with some of the biggest isps and content providers in the country attached. and this was the first full network outage we’d ever had. and it was my problem. and i’d consumed enough alcohol that my blood could have been used as a fire accelerant. i yelled .. something, and ran off in the direction of work. it was only when i bumped into the glass front doors before they opened that i started to realise how drunk i was. when the elevator arrived at my floor, and i bumped into both sides of the hallway before making it to the door, i knew i was in trouble. that hallway was only 20 feet long. but it didn’t matter. my wallet hit the card reader. i’d made it. habit’s a funny thing. you get so used to the noises, clicks, beeps and responses that you realise something’s wrong in an instant. there was no response from the card reader. an error, surely? interference, something new in my wallet? i dug the card out, throwing my wallet on the ground and badged it on its own. nothing. not an ‘access denied’ six beeps, or a ‘card format unrecognised’ five beeps. nothing. the lights were on, but no-one was home. a few feet away, the keypad for the alarm was lit up like a headlight convention. all the lights were on, the screen totally blacked out. no beeps for keypresses. just .. nothing. the blood drained from my face. the route servers were inside, suffering some unknown fate, our customers probably getting more furious by the minute, and i /could not open the door/. again. no, sod it. i wasn’t taking any more of this security system’s crap. i was getting into this datacentre, security system be damned. you all know what i’d tried before, and i knew as well, so i didn’t bother trying again. my tools, once again, were behind the locked door, and then the light went on over my head. &gt; chhopsky: i can’t .. go through the door … i can’t .. go around the door .. i can’t go .. under it …. but can i go over it!? this is the logic of a drunk engineer; try all the dimensions! there was a chair that we left outside for people working outside the dc, so in my infinite wisdom, i dragged the chair over to the wall, and lifted a ceiling tile. unlike the dc, where the ceiling tiles were weighed down with hundreds of heavy cables, the office was free and clear. and the wall itself stopped at the ceiling. so, pushing the tile into the cavity between the suspended ceiling and the concrete, i hoisted myself up into the ceiling. this did not work as well as i’d hoped because i was not very strong. i kicked and pushed off the wall, scrambling to push myself up onto what i now realised was a very thin wall. for those not familiar with a suspended ceiling, metal rods are drilled into the concrete block above, and a grid pattern hangs below it. inside those grids are weak, light tiles basically made of a combination of cardboard and plaster. looking at the predicament i’d gotten myself into, it became apparent that the only things that were going to support my weight up here were the tie-rods into the concrete. so i’d hold onto the rods with my hands, and lying prone in the ceiling, distribute the rest of my weight along the horizontal connectors. i’d drop down onto the file cabinet at the far end of the room, about 15 feet away. this plan was /flawless/. and it worked. for about 6 of the required 15 feet, upon which point my hands slipped, and i fell through the centre of the ceiling tile, towards the floor below. by some insane miracle, i landed mostly on my feet, scrambling ungracefully to regain balance, coughing up ceiling tile dust and god knows what else. probably asbestos. when the coughing stopped, i ran over to the security panel, pulled the power, and plugged it back in. it beeped a single happy post beep and hummed to life, making normal sounds instead of the endless buzzing it had been making before. my access restored, i quickly found the problem - a circuit breaker had tripped, and due to a wiring error on the part of an electrician at some point, both route servers had been wired into the same circuit, rather than the different feeds on different ups’s via different distribution boards that they were supposed to. with a dustpan and brush, i set about cleaning up the nightmare my dramatic entrance had caused. it was not a small mess - ceiling tiles are about 5 feet by 2 feet, and this one had exploded. it took about an hour. after finally sweeping up all the mess, putting the ceiling tile i’d broken to get up there back together, and replacing the one i’d broken getting down, i walked my ass out the door, feeling smug that no-one would be the wiser for my ceiling entrance, and i’d have a grand story to tell. monday morning rolled around and i was the last one in. aaron stared at me. &gt; aaron: what the hell did you do to my desk? &gt; chhopsky: ... wha? i walked into the office, and stared in horror. i don’t know what the hell i’d cleaned up but it looked someone had hit a bag of flour with a baseball bat. it was /everywhere/. how wasted was i? what did i spend an hour cleaning? and how in almighty crap did i diagnose an electrical circuit being miswired and split with no electrician tools of any kind? i have no idea. but what i did know, was how to break in. so i documented the procedure, and added it to the tech support wiki.normal day at it support, after dealing with school computers with broken power supply finally break time. suddenly i hear that someone is entering my sacred lair. &gt; woman: good evening sir, i coming here with my laptop... hell no. old lady, old laptop, my senses are telling me it's gonna be pain for next few hours. &gt; woman: sir, i don't have internet on my laptop! everything was alright before i took it to xyz it support for cleaning!!! its getting even worse. knowing xyz, rival it support in same small city, they screwed something pretty bad, as it happened many times before. &gt; me: let me look at it i turn laptop on. it booted super fast, like it was not old dell but new nasa machine. it was at raw state from another it support, chrome, some random antivirus. but that's none of my business, turning on chrome. uhh... &gt; me: ma'am, it looks like everything works well here, internet is working alright, you sure it's not problem with your connection? woman looked at me like i offended her ancestors &gt; woman: can't you see sir, they deleted internet from my computer!!! oh. i got it... someone in xyz deleted **internet** explorer from her laptop, changing it with chrome. poor woman didn't had clue what chrome is. &gt; me: oh yes. i see... guess what. i took back internet explorer icon on the desktop and made it chrome executable. &gt; me: done! you can check it ma'am she takes the laptop &gt; woman: hey, it's back! *doubleclick* and it looks much better now! you, sir, you are a magican! i charged her 20€ for this. i don't even feel bad. edit: my first /r/all, not sure i should be happy or ashamedphone rings, it's an employee at long term client (ltc). ltc employee: "hey dallasitguy, it's ok if i take the shared drive home so i can work from home today and over the weekend, right?" the "shared drive" is a nice big dell t620 tower server with three vms (ad/file/print, exchange, sql). me: "of course not! what the heck are you thinking?" ltc employee: "i have to have some reports finished by monday. i can't get anything done here, people keep interrupting me. so i need to work this weekend but i can't come in. so i'm taking the shared drive home, ok? that won't cause any problems, right?" me: "it's not ok, it will cause all kinds of problems! don't disconnect anything, please!" ltc employee: "you always make such a big deal out of us doing it stuff on our own. it's no big deal, no one here works on the weekend and the rest of my group is out today. just relax, i already have it in my car. i'll bring it back on monday." i immediately try to remote into the server... it's offline. me: "wtf? you already put the server in your car??" mobile phone starts ringing. ltc owner is calling me from his mobile on my mobile. me: "ltc employee, hold on for a second your boss is calling on another line." i answer the mobile. ltc owner: "our email is down. everything is down. we can't get to the internet. what the heck, that thing is nearly new, it shouldn't be down!" me: "i'm on the phone with ltc employee. she has the server in her car and is about to take it home so she can work from there over the weekend. i'm telling her not..." ltc owner: "!@@%@#$%%!!! !#@$#@$#@! !@##$$@#^_&amp;&amp;!!" click. i switch back to my landline and tell ltc employee, "your boss wants to talk to you right now." ltc employee: "yeah, i think i hear him coming down the hall. i'll have the drive back monday! bye!" click. i'm going to wait until they call but i imaging i'll be heading over there to bring the server back up. christ, i hope she didn't just unplug it but i bet she did. **tl;dr** - employee trys to take server home so she can work over the weekend. billable hours ensue. **edit:** i'm back from the client site. things were pretty f'd. the vm that's the domain controller and does file &amp; print was fine, thank goodness. the exchange server os was fine but i had to clean up the exchange database and the sql server i had recover by restoring the system image from last night. and there was a fourth vm that i'd pretty much forgotten about that is just a domain controller. i only set it up because i had a fourth server license available. it was fine as well. the staff member apologize profusely. kind of annoying after a while. and for reference, there is no server room. the server sits under the "it desk" at the far end of a room full of cubicles.first off, i've never actually done tech support. i've always been a programmer, but i shared this story elsewhere and someone said it was appropriate for here, so now i'm posting a more detailed version. it's the summer of 1997, and my first day of my first job after spending 5 years at college for an ms in computer science. while the boss is showing me around, he gets an important phone call leaving me outside with his 3 secretaries -- he was always very busy, and would be lost without their assistance. we strike up some conversation about our jobs, and one complains about how she has to keep track of some stuff on the server to make reports that the boss wanted daily, and it's just the most boring, tedious crap. eventually boss comes back out and finishes showing me around and i get settled in at my desk as the lead dev comes by to get me started on some work. of course, being the bright-eyed, not-yet-disillusioned, early-twenties computer nerd eager to prove my worth, i didn't just want to do my job. i wanted to do it great and really impress people. go above and beyond and be appreciated. and the complaining secretary from that morning had plopped a great opportunity to show that i'm a real go-getter right into my lap. so over my lunch break i cooked up a simple script to collate all the information she needed for her reports so that all she had to do was press one button and make sure the report was generated correctly. i run it by the lead dev and he okays it. i eagerly rush to tell the secretary how i've made the worst part of her job much less horrible, expecting her to be giddy at how helpful i am. the boss comes back from lunch as i'm starting to tell her, and he wants to know what i'm so happy about. as i tell them how i've automated the creation of those daily reports he wants, his face lights up like he's found the goose that lays golden eggs, while hers drops like i just took a dump in her purse. it turns out that making those reports was *all* she was doing. the boss had hired her for that rather than just asking one of the devs to do what i had because he didn't even know it was possible. that was her last day there, and i was instantly promoted from junior dev to normal dev with a nice pay raise for showing great initiative and saving the company the money for her salary and benefits. i guess i *did* get what i wanted out of it...deep in the bowels of the southern us swamps there lies a collection of half-nerds, half-rednecks... **cast:** **me:** the hero whose sanity is tested greatly by those he tries to save. **benchtech:** an old navy vet who doubles as both in-house support, phone support, and procurement for the business. **mma:** former mma fighter who now works as one of our front two receptionists. really nice, but can come off as really direct and intimidating. **i7kid:** you'll see... **i7mom:** you'll cringe... **eldson:** i7mom's eldest son. now normally i hate getting problem customers so early in the morning...but this one ended up being quite hilarious/sad. i am normally the second one to arrive at $deepsouthit in the mornings. benchtech always gets there way before opening time to catch up on his paperwork and take inventory in case we need to order anything... now before i get into the meat of the story a small note...we mark up our prices compared to where we buy them. fairly standard practice i know and it's not by much, just enough to make a reliable profit. this goes for anything a customer asks us to order as well. now onto the show! i arrived this morning to find a car already parked out in front of the shop and waiting for the doors to open at 8:00. since i am an on-site tech primarily i normally park up front as it is easier to get in and out of where our building is located. as i get out the lady in the car sees my company uniform and gets out. she is followed by a little freckled pre-teen. i tell them good morning, they seem friendly enough as they greet me back. i open the door and, for lack of other things to do, i flip the open sign on and decide to man the front desk until mma gets here. &gt;me: "so how can i help you folks this morning?" without saying anything the kid puts a sheet of paper on the desk. i take it and look it over...it's a list of pc parts along with a vendor name and price. it's some pretty decent hardware too, lga2011 i7, sli 980s, 1200w psu, something you don't expect to get from a 12 year old...also very expensive... &gt;i7kid: "i need this built." &gt;me: "this is a pretty nice computer, also expensive, what are you going to use it for?" &gt;i7kid: "a few video games." &gt;me: "is that all you are going to be using it for?" &gt;i7kid: "yeah, mostly minecraft, league of legends, and a few shooter games." &gt;me: "well this will definitely run all those, but this build might be a little overkill for that." &gt;i7mom: "look we already discussed this with his older brother, he works with computers too, and that's what we want. we already did the research for you and those are where you can get the parts cheapest from." &gt;me: "well i thank you for doing that ma'am, but if we order all these parts it will come out more expensive than your total listed here because we ultimately mark up our prices on hardware we order except on pre-built machines that we sell up front." &gt;i7mom: "that's ridiculous!!! they're our parts why should we pay extra for them!?" &gt;me: "that's just our policy ma'am, we wouldn't make much a profit on custom built machines if all we charged for was the labor, so if we have to go through the trouble of ordering in all the parts, especially from so many different vendors. if these were parts we had in stock i'd be willing to negotiate, but all of this is pretty non-standard high end equipment. now if you want to order the parts yourself and bring them to us we'll be more than happy to just bill you for the labor then." &gt;i7mom: "i don't have time to go hunting for all those parts and who knows when they'd get shipped here?" at this point i7mom is looking a little upset, i can see benchtech looking around the corner from the back area, and mma walks in and takes her seat at the second front desk, and i7kid is currently playing on the demo computer we keep up front. &gt;me: "if you'll give me a moment ma'am i'll tally up all these parts and tell you what our price would be for it." she huffs, but nods and lets me do the math...afterward we'd gone from a significant amount of money to a fairly hefty markup with the price as high as it was. i tell her and at that point the vein throbbing in her temple became that much more prominent. &gt;i7mom: "you're trying to rip me off aren't you!" &gt;me: "no ma'am i'm trying to give you some options to better fit your situation. this build, if we build it, will be an amazing piece of technology. however for what it is being used for we can build you a significantly cheaper machine that will achieved nearly the same results." at this point her phone rings and she steps off to answer it. mma rolled over and asked what was going on, which i fill her in to the details. she's not a tech, but she pays attention and understands the role various parts play in pc's, so she got the jist of what i7mom's issue was. at this point i7mom came back up to the counter and holds her phone up to me. &gt;i7mom: "this is my oldest son, he is the one who told us to buy that computer." taking the phone i say: &gt;me: "hello this is cyrillus at $deepsouthit." &gt;eldson: "did she just say i recommended that monster of a pc?!" &gt;me: "yes sir, they said you recommended these as the parts best fitting your little brother's situation." &gt;eldson: "son of a b****...alright look i told them very, very clearly that he did not need that build, that i could put together a list of parts that would work great for him, but he wanted what i have and i let my mother pressure me into making that list. i do a lot of graphic work for my company so my computer needs that horsepower, his doesn't. do not let them talk you into building a pc that expensive, my parents don't need to go spending that kind of money right now. they can afford up to about two grand right now." &gt;me: "i understand sir, i can definitely work with that." &gt;eldson: "great...thanks...here is my phone number in case you need my help convincing them." i took down his name and phone number in case i needed the leverage...which i am glad i did... &gt;i7mom: "well?" &gt;me: "ma'am he and i are in agreement that the parts you have listed here, which he uses for a *business* machine, is too much and too expensive for what you want." &gt;i7mom: "you're lying, he told me those were the right parts." &gt;me: "he said those are *his* parts for his *work* computer. your son there will not be doing the kind of things that eldson is doing. as i said i can save you a lot of money if you will let me put together a parts list based on what we have here and what i can order from our usual vendors where we get discounts and the mark ups may actually come out cheaper than standard." that seemed to get her attention and she agreed to at least let me make another list of parts and our price. i checked what we had in stock and put together a good listing for her. it was a decent build, high end i5, one of msi's better gaming mobo's, 8gb ram, aio water cooling...you know, the kind of front line gaming build that can tackle just about anything you throw at it short of massively demanding games and applications. i showed i7mom the specs and, more importantly, the $1600 price tag which included assembly labor. she looked at the price difference and said, &gt;i7mom: "wow...and you're sure this will be good?" &gt;me: "yes ma'am, that's in line with what a lot of gamers these days use. in fact for the games he told me he was playing most this build is probably still overkill." &gt;i7mom: "that's awesome, how long would it take you to have this ready." &gt;me: "end of the week at the least, we need to order two of the parts on this list as we don't carry those standard. the rest we have in house and you won't have to pay the extra shipping costs on." at this point i7kid got bored of messing with our computer and decided to come up to the bench and look at the parts list i had made. his mom and i were in the middle of discussing payment (as for things we order we have to get that in advance, the rest can be paid on pickup). &gt;i7kid: "this doesn't have an i7..." &gt;me: "no, but this particular i5 will be more than enough for what you need." &gt;i7kid: "i want an i7..." &gt;i7mom: "honey the nice man said you don't need it for the gam-" &gt;i7kid (in the most bloodcurdling and high pitched screaming voice you can imagine): "i want an i7!!!" he then proceeds to put on a pouty face and glare daggers at his mother. she glares right back, then looks at me, &gt;i7mom: "any chance you can get an i7 for the price of the i5?" &gt;me: "...not a chance." i know i was technically fibbing here as we did have some older i7 procs, but after that little display i just wanted to feed the fire. &gt;i7mom to kid: "you're not getting an i7." for the next five minutes all we could hear was the glass shattering screaming of what could have passed as a dying hog. all the while there were repeated sobbing cries of "but i want an i7!!!" over and over and over... in the end i7mom ended up having to drag her son out of the shop and they drove off. i don't know if they will be back, i don't know if i *want* them to come back... mma got up and stood at the window to watch them leave and, as she turned around and saw the demo computer she balked, blushed, and waved me over (should note here that the computer monitor faces the front display window). the kid had half a dozen tabs of porn opened... now i *really* hope they don't come back. edit: to clarify the $1600 price tag broke down like this. $1200 in hardware, $250 in markup (i have no control over this) and $150 in labor for estimated assembly and os installation. edit 2: welp definitely wasn't expecting this kind of reaction, glad everyone enjoyed it. only my third story so i'm still trying to get reddit formatting down. thanks for the gold/all the comments!today everyone on our network received an e-mail in foreign language with suspicious attachment (word document with macro, with encryption virus). it is called locky. i receive a request to look into suspicios e-mail from user. me: have you opened the e-mail? everyone has received a suspicious e-mail with encryption virus, so you should not open any e-mails from unknown senders. user: no, i haven't opened it yet. me: good. let's delete the e-mail using shift and delete, so it is not stored even in deleted items folder. user: wait a second. me: alright! just delete it and be careful with such e-mails in future. user: it had a document attached, but it is only gibberish. could you look at it? me: you opened the attachment? user: yes. me: well, turn off the computer, unplug internet cable and you are free for the rest of the day. tomorrow we will take your computer, it will have all its files encrypted and unusable. user: why did you do that? me: i told you it is a virus and not to open it. user: i'm writing a complaint. she then hang up. ------ edit: today, my boss listened to recording of the phone conversation and praised me for being so calm. computer was indeed disconnected and our engineers are working on it (there are few more computers that were infected from these e-mails). recording of the phone call will be used in investigation about the user, probably will result in firing her. as it turns out these e-mails have been sent to all 6700 work stations that our company support. our guys managed to block couple of thousand e-mails, and we have warned everyone about the virus, but probably going to have quite a few more of idiots opening the virus. edit 2: user faces charges for knowingly putting computer system at risk, which can result in fairly large fine, and almost certainly leads to firing. also it might even be considered a criminal offense.many years ago, i got a field report of a few systems that were turning themselves off during the night without warning or seemingly a reason. we had some temperature-monitoring software that would automatically shut the system down if it got too hot, and the logs showed that was what was happening. but it was november and the systems were in snowy regions, so too-hot didn't make sense. a quick look through the code showed me the problem. the programmer was reading the current temperature as an unsigned byte instead of a signed one (as the data sheet for the part specified), so that an actual temperature of -1° c (which is crazy cold for a system) was being read as 255° c, and so it would shut down immediately. later investigation found that the affected systems were in unheated loading dock areas. the fix was, of course, easy, but testing it required putting the system in our kitchen freezer (with the various cables coming out for power, the monitor, and so on). the ceo walked in while i was sitting there with a keyboard, mouse, and monitor seemingly hooked up to the refrigerator and just said, "i don't think that i should ask what you're doing." after recovery from my stroke i was in desperate need of work. so desperate i took an overnight shift at an webhost for tech support. most nights it was pretty calm and people that called on my shift were usually just looking for more help with their website than just trouble shooting, but night staff had the time and it helped break up the monotony of the shift. occasionally i would get gems like this. &amp;nbsp; i get a call and the guy is frantic on the phone. after finally getting him to confirm his username and password i ask which website of his is down. i type the url into my web browser and surprise i get his website no issues. next i vpn to my home computer and pull it up there no issue again this is where we get into basic pc troubleshooting (reminder this guy is losing $1k/hr because his website is "down") &amp;nbsp; it is at this point that we get into basic pc troubleshooting and the following transpired. me: okay are you using a mac or pc cus: pc me: can you click on the start menu and type in cmd cus: i cannot the screen is black me: *deep breath* is there a light on the front of your monitor and or your tower cus: no me: *deeper breath* is the cable plugged into the back of the device, and can you trace that cable back to make sure it is plugged into the wall. if you have a power strip can you see if it is in the on position cus: *rustling* i think it is, but cannot quite tell me: what do you mean you cannot tell? cus: i can't tell it is dark me: dark?!? can you turn on a light cus: i could get a flashlight, but there is no power me: *head desk* i assure you sir your website is up you can check it again when you have power back &amp;nbsp; tl:dr; someone making "~$1k/hr" from his website was unable to tell the difference between him being out of power and his website being down... &amp;nbsp; edit: formatting second edit: rip inbox thanks for all the replies stories very entertaining!okay, so the vpn service went down and as a result everyone in the universe is calling us asking what's wrong, why can't they get in, when will it be up, yada yada yada. we put a voice message on the line telling people there's an outage and we'll get it taken care of as soon as possible. some people hear this, and probably hang up knowing that it's being addressed, others wait on hold for fifteen or twenty minutes just to complain to us that the hold time was too long, and give us belligerent advise on how to maintain a vpn that we have no control over. of course there are lots of people who've been on hold for twenty minutes, long enough to hear the outage alert at least ten times, just so they can ask us questions that would have been explained in the outage alert. i would get calls like, "when is it going to be back up? what happened? why can't i get in?" i'm literally praying for an asteroid strike because humanity has become that damn stupid. i get a lot of really belligerent callers who are threatening to take me to task if i don't get them a solution to log in soon. i keep telling them that there is nothing to be done, but one lady i have to write up a complaint on to my manager for follow up with hr because she crossed a line in her complaints. this is the pattern of the day, and finally it happened. two cubes over from me a loud angry call goes into a headset, "motherfucker, clean the shit out of your ears! you sit on hold listening to a message that answers all these questions and you still wait to ask me what you already know? how'd some peckerwood motherfucker like you get a job with a computer!" she called him "peckerwood" maybe the caller is in the south. she growled into the phone some incoherent words, hung up, grabbed her purse and walked out. just then my boss comes running up after hearing what was yelled at a client wondering what happened. the lady i was on the phone with, who wasn't being belligerent, heard what was said and asked me specifically if she really heard someone tell a caller to clean the shit out of their ears. i apologized to the caller and explained we're inundated with calls and we've gotten so many rude callers our ability to keep professional has strained to it's limits. she was understanding and hoped everything worked out. i don't know what her standing will be tomorrow, i'm pretty sure she's gonna get fired. but for a minute i looked back on what she said into the phone and managed to laugh, she lived the dream. i wish i didn't envy her a little bit, but how many times have i wanted to say the same thing to a rude caller. [update] [update] [update] [update] [update] she was not fired, but she's been suspended for a couple of days and is has to get some counselling. the call was recorded and though it was not made available to anyone i learned that the caller was very nasty to her. she's going to be coming back, but she's had some other things that have been bothering her and it's all compounded. i work at a hospital. doctors are the worst people to support and because of that i see a voodoo witchdoctor for all my health needs, asside from that most people are pretty average, accept for benjamin. benjamin works in the mailroom of my buiding. he's always friendly and smiles at everyone. he also has down syndrome, but we sort of take care of him and let him know what a good job he does ever chance we get. so today, i'm derping at my desk and i get a call, it's ben. me: helpdesk, this is wonderweirdo ben: hi wonderweirdo, i need someone to come look at the computer in the mail room, it wont get onto the net. me: okay, let's do some trouble shooting. ben: i already tried a couple of things, i rebooted the computer, and when that didn't work i tried to refresh the ip and a dns flush, that didn't work either. i tried to ping yahoo.com but nothing came back me: (impressed) wow, you did all that already. okay, did you check to see if the network cable is connected?" ben: yeah, the ligh is flashing that orange color. me: (nodding) okay, i'll put in a ticket and get someone from deskside over there. ben: thank you. me: you know, ben, that was some pretty good work you did. you should come over to it and work with us. ben: (giggling) nah, i see the way you guys go crazy over there, i'm too smart to do that. i chuckle for a second and after i put in the ticket and end the call i realize how a kid with down syndrome did the trouble shooting before he called for help, and how that kid with down syndrome had better computer skills than the doctors i support. then it hit me that he said he was too smart to come over to it and work because he can see how we all go crazy. so he said he's basically smarter than me. after taking a minute to look around at myself and my peers, i think he's right. my first job out of college was a catch-all position. i'm an aerospace engineer (with a minor in mechanical) and i've worked it my whole life before i graduated, so they had me consulting on design, drafting, modeling, programming, everything... so i'm working at a small aerospace company making a system for light aircraft ([hence my faa story, here]( one of the things i had to do while i was there was design a database to track all the paperwork and keep track of everything that we made/tested/sold for a 5 year period. so i do. spent about 6 months getting everything ironed out to the point where i could roll it out to the office (like 5 whole users). i sent a 1 page document with it on how to operate it, and tell them that if they have an error, they are to click on nothing - i put a lot of effort into error reporting. this was my first ground-up sql program, and it integrated a lot of external functionality with office documents, pdfs, automatically printing reports, etc, so there were a lot of moving parts that could go wrong. they didn't listen. so i sent out a link to everybody that would update the program on their computer, with the only explanation being "improved error reporting functionality." and tell them that their old program will no longer work, so they have to update. fast forward to about lunch time when i suddenly hear the old monty python line "no one expects the spanish inquisition!" at maximum volume from down the hall, closely followed by "holy s***" and a few other choice surprise expletives. i quickly hop out of my seat and walk down the hall only to find my boss is sitting about 4 feet from his desk looking a bit pale as i walk in and try to not laugh &gt;&gt;boss man: what the hell just happened? &gt;&gt;me: you hit an error. &gt;&gt;boss man: but why did it yell at me? &gt;&gt;me: because nobody was telling me what errors they were getting, so i rigged up a notification for myself... and this was the simplest solution to the problem. what the update really did was add a few lines of code to set the system volume to 100%, and play a .wav file at full blast, so i would hear it, and i could come talk to the user about what they were doing when the error occurred, and read what the error said. needless to say they were less than thrilled with my "improved error reporting functionality" and i told them i'd take it out as long as they continued to report errors to me, and they gladly complied. tl;dr - the average user would rather talk to the developer than face the wrath of the spanish inquisition. [edit] yay gold! thanks mister "anonymous" - you seem to be everywhere on the web.a little rant-ey as i am still annoyed over this, mostly because i should've seen it coming. my brother-in-law came to me with a request two weeks before christmas, if i could preconfigure a new gaming laptop for his sister and her 8-year old son in such a way it would be as kid-safe as possible. sure, no big deal. i upgraded the windows 8.1 it came with to windows 10, set up a 'mother' account as admin, and a 'kid' account as a limited user. preinstalled the games it came with, and installed steam all setup for her account. to top it off i installed a copy of avira antivirus and set everything up to update automatically, then gave my bil specific instructions to tell his sister never to allow the kid to log into her account. laptop is packaged back up and goes under her tree... and yesterday i receive a frantic phone call if i can come over to my bil's place as the laptop has problems. i boot it up to windows and find a cryptolocker-like virus has made its way onboard. glad it's not connected to any network, just as a client on the guest wireless, i ask for the history. december 25th: laptop is unpacked and little vandal is overjoyed. joy that quickly turns to anger as he can't install random apps. december 26th: little vandal has gotten his mom's password and finds he still cannot install the crapware he wants, so he disables uac* and uninstalls avira. december 27, morning: cryptolocker has done its work and has destroyed the laptop. december 27, midday: i pull my hair out in frustration. fortunately i had a recovery disc with me so i just wiped the os and did a reinstall. windows 10 automatically reactivated. i reinstall avira and lock it with a separate password... unfortunately i had to still give the mom admin rights but i emphasized how it was definitely, 100% that little vandal managed to get access to her account that messed things up. laptop works again, mom is happy with me and angry with the kid, bil beers me, and i tell them all that the next time i will be charging money. *uac = [user account control (wiki)]( tldr: if you allow the vandals to enter italy, don't cry if rome is sacked.to set the scene, i'm currently a student studying computer science and i work at my university's help and repair desk. i've seen a lot, everything from a $1 natty lights turning into a $1500 macbook replacements, to grad students losing dissertations to crypto-locker, people still using dial-up in 2014, and of course tons of virus as a result of college students clicking ads in an endless search of free music, movies and porn. this specific case happened about a year ago and i want to share it because i think about it from time to time. i was sitting in my consulting station probably browsing reddit and attempting to homework when our receptionist greeted a user, took his information, a brief description of his problem and added his ticket to the queue. i don't remember his name but his problem description was just "needs to remove audio file from phone". figured heh this should be easy (a typical old faculty member needing help with his phone kinda thing), i asked him to come sit at my station and took a look at his problem. he sat down next to me and pulled out his phone (an old gs ii i think) and an even older laptop. i asked him what was wrong and he told me that he had some voicemails on his phone that he wanted to save on his computer (kind of an odd request, but i went with it anyway). he unlocks his phone for me and i navigate to his phone app and pull up the voicemail. while i was looking at the phone he said there were 3 voicemails from the previous weekend were the ones he wanted saved. i played the first one on speaker to see if they were playing properly and it was really quick message. "hey dad, just wanted to let you know i'm on my way home. see you soon, love ya, bye." (oh no....) i looked up from the phone and i saw this poor man start crying. i put two and two together and my worst thought was confirmed. this poor man had just lost his daughter in a car accident a few days before and he want her last voicemails to him so he and his wife could still hear her voice whenever they missed her. not breaking down into tears for his man was harder than any ticket i've ever taken. his daughter was my age and it immediately made me think of my family and how much they missed me. i knew then i was going to do everything in my power to get this right. my first thought was to just plug an aux cord into the headphone jack on his phone and record the audio using audacity on his laptop. but when i plugged an aux cable into his phone and laptop i couldn't get anything to record. shit. i tried using my headphones to see if i could hear anything on his phone and nothing. i looked inside the aux jack and i all i could see was dirt and something sticking out of a caked on mess. i ran his phone upstairs to our repair desk and grabbed compressed air, tweezers, q-tips, alcohol swabs, just about anything that i could thing of that would clean out his headphone jack. after about 10 min or so of cleaning i could finally hear audio coming out of my headphones. relieved, i recorded all the voicemail messages and saved them for him to be able to listen to whenever he wanted. i felt awful for what this guy had to go through and i was glad i was able to help him. to me, this was a reminder of how quickly life can change. i'm sure everyone on this subreddit will sympathize with me whenever i need to complain about bad users, or just dumb people, but just remember for some users you can make a world of difference for them. edit: wow, thanks to everyone showing support. i never thought working tech support would ever leave me with a story i would never forget. edit2: thanks for the gold! as awesome as it is to get gold, it feels different getting it for a story like thismy story takes place at a radio station. yesterday i got a ticket with the title &gt; "no sound, need it to work" with the very detailed description &gt; "please fix it". i didn't know it yet but i've been waiting for this ticket for about a year. a similar thing happened then and i've been plotting what i'd do in a similar situation since then. i came to $user's desk and immediately knew what i had to do. what i had prepared for. what i was destined to do. what would be my legacy in this company. i was about to blow this poor user's mind. i saw the little circle with the red line through it next to the speaker in the task bar and my adrenaline started pumping. it was time. so i wave both my hands over the keyboard, humming quietly and as i'm waving my hands around, i subtly hit the "mute" button on the keyboard. i turn to the user and proclaim "it's fixed" and walk away from the mind explosion. behind me, i hear "what?" followed by a click and the sound of a promotion audio clip playing and i know: from this point on, my story will be passed on to generations. the story of the machine whisperer. the legendary pc guy. the tech support wizard. from this day on, i have to lead a life of secrecy. what if anyone found out what i had actually done? i would become an outcast. declared a freak. driven into exile. i'm the hero this station deserves. they won't hunt me. because i know magic. because i'm not their hero, i'm a silent guardian, a watchful protector, a tech support wizard. so, this happened to me a few days ago, and if it's taught me anything, it's that jobs will apparently come back to haunt you from the grave. a little bit of background, i'm a former arcade technician and used to co-own a small business, which i quit a year ago for reasons. every so often i'll get stray clients calling me for service from looking at old business cards and a few times i've actually gone and done work for them no problem. extra money is never an issue. i got a call a couple days ago from an angry customer that i vaguely remember servicing nearly 2 years ago, who we shall call $al. the exchange that ensued goes as follows: &gt; $me: "hello, this is mini speaking." &gt; $al: "yes, you serviced a machine of mine a while back and something has gone wrong with it. i understand my warranty is still good and i was hoping to get this fixed as soon as possible." at this point i'm wondering how she got my number. i recently got a new phone with a new number so this really didn't make much sense, but i carried on. &gt; $me: "alright miss. i'm sorry to say i don't work there anymore, but i can certainly come out and do the job for you for a fee. if that's not an issue, could you please tell me what machine and what sort of issues it's having? perhaps i can work it out over the phone." &gt; $al: "but the machine is still under warranty. shouldn't the repair be free?" &gt; $me: "no ma'am, i don't work for $company anymore. if you ask me to come and repair your machine, i'll be working freelance. that warranty is only valid with $company, who to be honest, i don't know if they exist anymore." &gt; $al: "but the warranty has your name on it. that should mean you honour it no matter what." at this point she's getting irritated. apparently she expects me to do the work for free. &gt; $me: "while it may have my name on it, it doesn't mean i have to honour it. granted yes, i'll discount because it was my work to begin with, i'm not going to come out and service the machine for free. as i said, the warranty is only with $company, who i am not a part of anymore." &gt; $al: "this is ridiculous. i was told by $formerboss at $company that you'd come out and do this no problem. i really need this fixed as soon as possible and i was guaranteed there wouldn't be a problem!" &gt; $me: "i'm sorry ma'am, i'm sorry for any inconvenience, but i'm certainly not going to come out for free to do work that $company should be handling, even if it has my name on it. you still haven't said what the issue is." &gt; $al: "no, the issue here is that i have a warranty, a signed contract with *your* name on it." &gt; $me: "but that is only valid with $company! i'm not going to go out and do their work for them on my free time for free." at this point, i'm ready to just hang up the phone. i've been polite and professional even though i didn't have to be at all... and to be honest, i'm rather confused now because i'm sure i've said to her "i'm not their employee anymore." &gt; $al: "but i was *assured* by $company that this would be handled for free. they told me you would have no problems and this warranty was guaranteed for the lifetime of the machine." &gt; $me: "ma'am, what part of "i don't work there anymore" don't you understand? i don't care what he said, i'm not tied to them anymore. i'm seriously happy to help but i'm not going to fuckin' come out and do this for free just because the guy i worked for a year ago said i would. that's not how it works!" &gt; $al: "i'm reporting you, this is absolutely ridiculous!!" &gt; $me: "hah! to who? my mum?" at that point she hung up. it's been 3 days now, and going over that i'm still just as confused as to what she was thinking as i was when she called me, if not more. people will never cease to amaze me. and i still don't know how she got my number o_o edit: oh dear o.o i certainly wasn't expecting to make it to '/r/all'! i'm humbled. and i took out an erroneous $ that was in the wrong place. today i am a semi retired, semi burnt out old tech spending my declining years in a small rural area. but when i was little more than a pimply faced youth i was the technical manager of a electronics distribution company that was in the process of being swallowed up by a big multinational. it was an exciting time, complete upgrade of the network, new servers and computers, integration into a multinational system. extra it support staff, and i was in charge of the project from our end. exciting times, in a very short time the project was completed, and would you believe it well under the expected time and 35% under budget. it was even fun to complete. then the fun came to a crashing halt in the teleconference between us and the "executive in charge" of it for the company that now owned us. i was expecting a thanks for exceeding all requirements, maybe even a small bonus. instead i was told that the systems would all be run from new head office, and there would only be 2 it positions to support all 5 offices across the country, all hardware support was being outsourced. the real kicker was that the positions being offered where little more than tier 1 positions to submit tickets to the hardware support company or to the head office support team. the salaries being offered was 60% less than my current salary. i calmly asked him to confirm that he was firing 12 people, and offering a pittance to the 2 who would remain. then i simply said "no", dropped my id and keys on the desk, picked up my coffee cup and left the building. all the it staff followed me. i never formally resigned but i think they got the idea that i was not coming back. i got a job delivering pizza for the two months it took me to find a new it position. i still made more money than they had offered me. tl/dr a young it manager has his first brush with corporate management. refuses to play the game i love my cousins (oi, not in that way) but they're often thick as mince. so it was with no shock to me when i get a text from one of them saying that he can't connect to the internet. oh, and someone's changed the name of his wifi to "stop stealing my wifi". having been to his house before - and connected to his wifi - i know for a fact he has a wireless router, and a password set up by his isp. i go through basic troubleshooting (turn it on and off, it it plugged in etc) and eventually say he should look at the label on his router and connect to the ssid written on it. he says it's not on the list and asks me to come round and have a look (i'm a 30 minute train journey from his house so 'come round' feels more like a day trip). anyway, i get there and sure enough, the ssid on his router isn't there. i try the 'stop stealing' ssid, tried the password written on the router and it didn't work. i ask him if he's changed the wifi password. he - of course - said he didn't have one. that he went into the admin controls and turned it off a week ago because he got a new phone and forgot what the password was. i go back to the router and show him the label with the ssid and the password. it's at this point i noticed that all the lights on the front are geblinkken on et eauf rapido. and then it clicks. he made his wifi public. someone nearby accidentally connected to his, and thinks it's *their* own wifi. yet they had enough computer knowledge (or google-fu, or luck) to get into the admin page and lock it down. so i look up the default admin credentials on my phone - turns out it's "admin" with no password - reset the router to factory settings, log in to the admin console, set up a secure admin password (of my choosing) and set up wpa and a password of his choosing. *and told him not to remove it*, and changed the ssid to "no, it's not your wifi". **tl;dr** it's not your wifi if you don't have physical access to the router.so i'm doing my casual helping hand labor at college, making sure all professors have backups and working cad software, everything okay, happy, flowers everywhere. but then the fire nation attacked. i was done doing backups of everyone's favourite $glassesprofessor, after getting his laptop back (happy ending!) when we suddenly see his superior, $mrangryglasses come in and point at me with an angry yet cold look. &gt;$mrangryglasses: crescent, you playing tech support student was funny, but now you managed to screw everything this time, pack your stuff, and get out. me and $glassesprofessor couldn't get to understand what was just going on, why was he being like that? &gt;$me: excuse me professor $mrangryglasses, but, what are you talking about? &gt;$mrangryglasses: you know what you did, you caused a massive security breach at this college, pack your stuff and get out, i'll let the principal know what you did. &gt;$me: but... what...? then i saw the security guard coming through the door, making me signs to stand up and follow him, i still had no idea what was going on.... thankfully our hero $glassesprofessor decided to stand up for me. &gt;$glassesprofessor: woah woah woah, hold it $mrangryglasses, crescent did nothing like that, he's been a good student and tech support guy, you are not taking him away until we all get to know what happened. &gt;$me: please professor $mrangryglasses, what are you even me accusing of? another teacher heard what was going on, the head teacher of the carrer. &gt;$mrsengineering : what is even going on here, what are you even doing to crescent? &gt;$mrangryglasses: ah, head teacher, good that you are here. he pointed at me. &gt;$mrangryglasses: this kid messed with the secretary's computer, now her files are lost, the screen is broken and a robotic voice is controlling it. my capacity to even was broken, first, i'm never allowed to handle computers like that, second, its obvious why, third, what was that robotic voice and broken screen? &gt;$mrsengineering: calm down $mrangryglasses, we need to first take a look at that "virus" of yours. and so, we were escorted to the principal's office, and a very angry secretary was staring at me, after a discussion with everyone involved, i was able to handle the computer. what could possibly go wrong? i was just on the edge of being expelled. so i take a look at the screen, and immediately recognize it, it was no virus, no spyware, it was something much worse for everyone in the room. windows 10. &gt;$me: professors... this isn't a virus.... this is the new version of windows. everyone was staring at me, i sigh and look at them. &gt;$me: secretary, you installed a "recommended update", right? &gt;$secretary: yes, for security measures, now look at what it happened with everything you did to the other computers. i struggled not to loose my mind, but the kind $glassesprofessor help me explain the whole windows 10 thing, and the secretary nearly cried for what she did, not the only one.... so i reverted windows back to 7, everything was still working, good good, everyone was happy, except $mrangryglasses, who refused to say a thing. i need a break. tl;dr: secretary got windows 10 by herself, i deserve the chair. update: so i did have a meeting with the board of teachers and the director, in case it wasn't clear, this is how colleges in mexico work (or so it's my understanding) i summarised the whole story to the director of the college, with $glassesprofessor to my side, she was patient and hear us both, with $mrangryglasses sitting on the other end of the table, she concluded it was a extremely serious accusation, and turns out the rumors were true, his attitude and he's already undergoing internal investigation for bribery, while he's unlikely to be fired (for reasons i cannot learn about) i won't be assisting any of his classes in the future. so i'm completely exonerated of all charges, and to avoid any future incidents we are revoking all user permissions and hope to create an official it department, i'll have some compensation for the incident (no semester payment for two years, woo hoo!!!) and a couple of other things. thanks everyone for their wonderful support, your ideas will help this college have a better future, cheers!i saw a story yesterday about letting users set ticket priority, and it hit home with me. we allow the same thing, so naturally every single ticket i get is marked critical. i just laugh about it now. anyway, about a week ago, one of my favorite users, "kurt," came over to my cube with a problem. "hey man," he said. "i've been going back and forth for a while trying to decide whether to mark this case 'minor' or 'moderate.' i don't want to cause you guys too much trouble. what do you think?" "kurt, bless your heart," i said. "i haven't looked at that field in five years." then i dropped everything i was doing and helped him set up his new phone. because he deserved it.so this was an interesting one. we have a user who uses a laptop and a docking station. the docking station is wired into an ethernet port so if the wifi went down for whatever reason there is a backup wired connection. well i was tasked to install a new desktop computer in the same room as the user, unfortunately we have run out of ports in our switch to accommodate this extra desktop pc so it was agreed that we would recycle this users ethernet cable from his docking station. so i simply unplug his cable and plug it into the new desktop. i was having trouble assigning an ip from our dhcp server so after a bit of faffing about i realized the network cable was coiled up and unplugged from the wall under the table. so i plug it into wall and patch the switch upstairs. job done. 4 hours later i get a complaint from the irate user saying now that he is using wifi, his network connection is very slow and unusable and demands we sort a cable for him. so i pick up a new cable, connect one end into his docking station, coil up the other end and leave it dangling under his table and ask him to reboot his laptop. not had a complaint sinceat the university i work for, we regularly get calls from parents trying to do everything for their children. even though we aren't really supposed to do a password reset for someone who isn't the account holder, our standard procedure in the case of a parent trying to reset their kid's password is to get the account holder on the line and ask their permission for the password reset before continuing. with freshman orientation coming up, we had several calls like this today, but this one was a little different. &gt; me: $university service desk, this is nathan, how can i help you? &gt; mother: i need to reset my son's password and get some information about his account. i won't be going with him to orientation, and want to write it all down for him. &gt; me: do you have your son there with you? we will need to get his permission to reset his password. &gt; mother: of course, let me go get him. &gt; mother (yelling): get down here! i need you to give the man on the phone permission to look at your account! &gt; son: hello? &gt; me: this is nathan from $university service desk, i just need your permission to reset your password. &gt; son: no, my password does not need to be reset. we will call you again if there are any issues. &gt; *phone slams down but line does not drop* &gt; *background yelling for the remainder of the time before i leave the line* i think i may have just been party to the moment a child became independent.  so, i'm family, friends, neighbors, and sometimes school tech support. so, yesterday was my day off. i have no classes on wednesdays. school for me started almost 2 weeks ago, and for k-12, it started a week ago. i get a call from one of my neighbors. she's a really really sweet little lady who immegrated from mexico around 15 years ago. she's a single mom with a 12 year old boy who absolutely loves his computer. his dad built it for him a couple years ago before he died in a mining accident. he will not let anyone touch it. i love getting calls from her because she makes me a lot of really good mexican food and she takes to instruction well. so, she explains her issue. &gt; her: i have a issue. okay, wonder what's going on. she calls me for a lot of things. &gt; me: okay, what seems to be the problem? &gt; her: my son's room. its, on fire. &gt; me: what! call 911! &gt; her: wait. fire, not right word. &gt; me: okay. are you meaning hot? calientae? &gt; her: si. &gt; me: i'll be over in a couple minutes. i grab my tech support bag and my general repair bag and head over. i get there and she leads me to her son's room and the second i walk in, i get hit by a wall of heat. it's almost 10 degrees hotter than the rest of the house. &gt; me: holy! fire isn't too far off. &gt; her: si. &gt; me: okay. i'll see what i can figure out. i walk over and the closer i get to the computer, the hotter it gets. i touch the computer and the case is physically hot. i shake it awake. enter the boy's password (i remember it from the time he got a lot of malware from doing what boys his age do.) i check his core temps and see them at 165f, then check his gpu temps and see they're at 170f and 175f. shit. that is not good. i turn it off, open the case, and visually inspect the parts. nothing looks out of the ordinary, just really hot. i turn the computer back on, put it into bios, and look to see what's going on in the case. i look at it and realize, none of the fans except the cpu fan are spinning. i run back home and grab a couple 120mm fans i have laying around from taking a few old computers apart. i plug them in and the work. i pull out the original fans and put in the new ones. i run prime95 and wait for half an hour while i'm waiting on my food and for him to get home. i'm sitting there reading on my phone monitoring temps while i read reddit. i hear the door open and spin around in the chair. he comes running in and attempts to pumple me. (i'm 6'2" and 350 pounds, he's 5'0" and 140 pounds) i hold my arm out and push him back by his head. i get him calmed down after a minute or two and get him to sit down on the bed. &gt; him: why were you touching my computer? &gt; me: your room has been really hot lately right? &gt; him: yeh, i guess. &gt; me: your fans failed, and the ones remaining couldn't push air well enough through the case to keep the temperatures down. &gt; him: oh. okay. &gt; me: i put in new fans and it should be cooler and the computer should last longer. he cracked a smile for the first time all night. &gt; me: i thought you'd like that. &gt; him: thank you. he starts quietly happy crying and hugs me. i make sure the temps were good and turn off prime95. i start an antivirus scan. &gt; me: let's get some food. we go into the kitchen and his mom had made fresh tamiles and a whole bunch more mexican dishes. tl;dr: i love doing this job sometimes even when i don't get paid actual money. edit: autocorrect...i don't technically have a job in it, but i work in a games shop so i spend most, of my day reformatting playstations, and showing people how to connect controllers. one day, a kid came in with his parents. he was around 10 years old. he walked up to the counter, put a copy of gta v for the 360 in front of me, and announced that it didn't work and he wanted his money back. i glanced at his parents, unsure whether or not they knew that this was an 18s game that they were allowing their child to play, but they looked annoyed so i didn't comment. me: "sure, no problem. what's the problem exactly?" kid: "so i put in the disc 1, and that's all fine. but then i put in disc 2 and nothing changes! it still wants disc 2!" me: "okay, that is odd. i'll just throw it in my xbox and have a look" he looked annoyed that i wasn't just taking his word, but i ignored it and carried on. the customer is almost never right about these things. i test it in front of him, and everything works fine. i look up at his parents, as i put the game back on the counter. kid: "but it doesn't work on my xbox!" both him, and his father looked annoyed at me. i don't know how it even crossed my mind, the only explanation is that this job has desensitised me to the total lack of common sense of the general public. me: "hmm.. probably a silly question, but when it asks for disc 2.... you take disc 1 out of the tray before inserting disc 2, right? " i looked at the kid. silence. i look up at the father who is also staring at his kid. dad: "you did that, right?" more silence. i slide the game across the counter. "have a nice day!"like most sane individuals, i am on my countries national do not call list. unfortunately, a few less than scrupulous companies didn't get the memo. this is the story of how i provided "tech support" to one in particular. for the past few months i have been receiving calls from telemarketers asking if i want %voicespammer%'s services. the first few times i politely told them to respect the do not call list and do not call again. when they kept on ignoring that i figured it was time to use my voip support abilities for some fun. so one evening, i was hanging out with my family, raising my kids and such, when i hear my phone politely inform me that there is a long distance call coming in. looking at the caller id, i see the number of someone who legally should not be calling me. being slightly bored i answered and prepared to have some fun. this telemarketing company gave away alot of information about it's system within the first few seconds of a call. by having 5 seconds of silence followed by the unmistakable default [asterisk]( conference join sound, i already know what software they are running, how they manage their agent queue and quite a few ways to forcefully ask them to not call again. once i heard the conference connect beep i have to work quickly to set my trap, hoping that they would take the bait. me: "tech support, can i have your agent # please" spammer: "........ um hello, i'm calling from %company% and" me: "i'm going to stop you there. your system has detected that there is a issue with your workstation and has automatically sent you through to tech support. can i have your agent id please" confused spammer: "is this mr psychotc i'm speaking with" me: "no, your system is still displaying the last expected connection on the screen, however you have been connected to tech support due to the issue which your system detected. can i have your agent id so i can help you with this?" *i'm obviously making a guess about what type of setup they might have, hoping that i'm close enough to completely lure the prey into the trap* sheep: "oh, ok, my id is %probably a default setup value incremented by the number of agents% me: "ok, thank you now i just need some info while i pull up your system. can you take a quick look at your phone? does it say "polycom" on the front?" sheep: "yes" me: " ok, i'm showing a potential issue with your phone. i need you to run a diagnostic on the phone. can you let me know when you are ready?" sheep on the ramp to the abattoir: "ok, what do i have to do?" me: "ok, on your phone i need you to press 4, 6, 8 and * at the same time, let me know when you are done sheep: "ok, it's asking for a password" me: *hoping their voip admin left things at default* "ok, now enter 456 as the password then press the button marked enter." mutton: *unjoin conference sound* and it has been a few months since i last heard from them. some technical details for those who do not work with voip and polycom products. the sequence above is the reload firmware and reset to factory defaults hotkey and the default password to allow the reload. most polycom phones take about 5-10 minutes to reload the firmware, reboot and reload settings. more if they didn't setup dhcp properly. **tl,dr:** i know more about your phone system than your company does edit: grammar/typo and a thank you to everyone who upvoted, downvoted or replied. especially haakon666 for letting us know about lenny.this was a conversation not 20 minutes ago over our interoffice messaging system here at technophobes r us. ---------- *user is starting a conversation* *user has invited &lt;7 managers&gt;* user: cookie_eater108 keeps changing my password its not funny *manager 1 has left the conversation* me: i'm sorry, what's this about? user: cookie_eater108 you keep changing my password every few days and i can never login. very unprofetional. *manager 2 has left the conversation* me: i assure you i don't change passwords for fun. but i can help you with your login troubles. me: at the top right of your keyboard, there are 3 lights, num lock, caps lock and scroll lock, is the caps lock key light on? user: well it wasn't on just awhile ago user: stop turning my caps lock key on this is unbelievable *&lt;5 managers have left the conversation&gt; * got a priority request from a corner-office executive, her new laptop was broken. a minor fix, easily corrected by system restore. while the restore was going on, ms. senior executive was having an epic rant "we waste both my time and yours by purchasing these unreliable off-brand laptops! whoever heard of "dɥ" laptops anyway? i was mystified for a moment and then silently turned her laptop around so that she could see that 'dɥ' was actually 'hp' upside down. she turned bright red and then started laughing. then she gave me a glare that could freeze ice and said "if i find this story posted on facebook your employment with this company is over". i nodded and solemnly agreed this episode was absolutely inappropriate for facebook. i thought i'd share one of my proudest moments as a bench tech. i suspect most of us who are interested in this type of work frequently encounter customers with lost data. usually the issue is resolved with a simple undelete application, of which there are many. sometimes we have to roll up our sleeves and image the disk and attempt to recover readable files. no matter the method, it's the best feeling in the world to be able to call the customer and tell then you did recover their wedding pictures or important school work. the look on their faces when they come in to pick up the freshly burned dvd with their critical data makes you forget all the mouthbreathers with their insect ridden e-machines (almost). but then there's that feeling you get in the pit of your stomach when you plug in the customer's pc and hear the "click bang" or "boing whirllllll" of a failed hdd while the bios reports no bootable drive. you have to look them in the eye and tell them you are already 99% sure the drive is dead and there is nothing you can do about it. you hand them the little card with the number to drivesavers or similar professional data recovery and warn them it's going to cost a lot of money. you are kind enough not to scold them about their lack of a backup, that would only cause pain now. they already know. flash back to 2007. one morning i get to the shop to find a customer standing outside the front door with one of those ubiquitous claim-shell dell pcs under an arm. the look in his eyes alone tells me all i really need to know about the situation. i tell him to come in and put the pc on the counter. we exchange niceties as i plug in the monitor and keyboard and turn it on. we encounter the message he told me to expect, the pc can't find a bootable drive. i open it up to make sure everything is plugged in and notice the drive is not spinning. not good, but there could be an innocent answer. i pull the drive and try it out with a known good power supply. unfortunately with the same result. i tell him "(customer), it seems you have a failed hard drive. since it won't spin up i can't really help you." his exact words: "it doesn't matter what it costs, please get my data back!" it turns out this guy is an office manager at a local veterinary practice. it must be a fairly big organization as they employ about 10 vets and about 40 other folks including cleaning staff, etc. this pc under his arm contains the entirety of their accounting everything. payroll, tax stuff, accounts receivable, everything. he explains that they will go out of business if they can't get the data on that drive. i let him know that data recovery from a failed drive takes specialized skills and resources, neither of which we have in this mom 'n pop computer repair outfit. i give him the drivesavers card and tell him to be prepared for a bill in the $1000's if they are successful at all. considering the importance of his data i thought it was a no-brainer to go this route. $2000 is nothing to a medical office likely billing out over a million dollars each year. well, i would not be writing this if the dude had any sense. he's like: "$2000 for data recovery? and it might take weeks? i don't know... can't you do it?" i tell him the truth: if i try to recover his data and fail there is a huge chance i'll make it worse and less likely for a professional data recovery specialist to get it. he really needs to go to the specialist. yet despite this, he continues to talk me into it telling me they can't possibly go weeks without this pc. they need their data by tomorrow for tax reasons. so i told him to give me his number and i'd do some research and get back to him. i call in my fellow nerds and we research (our google-fu was strong that day). we end up with a list of about 8 or so things to try to order them by risk. we even manage to find two of the same model drives from the junkyard downstairs to look at. by early afternoon i think we've learned what we can and i call the customer. i tell him i'll try it, but it's foolish. he describes an office in pure chaos and says they are willing to take the risk. i tell him i'm going to charge $75 / hour for my time successful or not, to which he agrees. i also tell him to bring in any other dells they purchased as the same time as the broken one as i want more drives from the same batch if possible. my boss prints out a unique addendum to our usual waver all customers sign, something to protect us from the consequences of potentially (likely) destroying this data and the other pc drives as well. guy shows up 15 minutes later with sweat on his brow and three more clam-shell dells. we're lucky, the serial numbers on these drives are close enough be the same batch as the broken one. these are a better match than the drives we already found. so we now have the one failed drive and three good ones. i go shopping to pick up items needed for the potential data recovery methods. i purchase some dry ice, a couple of torque bits and eyeglass screwdriver to fit, ziplock bags, and microfiber gloves from a photography shop. i try to make arrangements with a buddy who works in a chip fabrication plant to use their clean room if needed. that was impossible but he was able to get me a couple of those dust free bunny suits and face masks. unfortunately they were pink. but this was war so i did not complain. the first thing i try is swapping the pcb between a good drive and the failed one. the good drive works fine with the failed drive's pcb, but the opposite is not true. next we tried putting the drive in a usb enclosure and plastic bags and cooling the drive with the dry ice. after 1/2 hour we tried again, again without success. i then tried powering the drive and kinda spinning it back and forth hoping to jump start the motor (or something?). needless to say that was not working. we needed to open the drive up and see what secrets might be inside. we took apart one of the three good drives to see if it was even possible to do a platter swap. i've taken apart many drives and knew the most difficult part would be not damaging the heads. sometimes you have to remove the arms holding the heads to even get the platter out. but luck was on our side! the arm in these particular drives could be pushed down and would not get in the way when we pulled the platters! even better they smoothly went back onto the platters without hanging when you carefully pushed it back. i dawned the bunny suit, much to the delight of the other nerds, and took the drive and tools into the bathroom. i set an audiobook playing and started scrubbing wall to ceiling with wet rags to collect all the dust i could. i taped over the air vent and along the door frame. then i collected hot water into a trash can and added the dry ice. that much dry ice in that small room made quite a bit of fog which supposedly helps bring any dust out of the air. i don't know if this actually works, but i was concerned about adding that much co2 into a small sealed room. i made it a point to hold my breath if i was reaching down to the floor. after the fog was gone i noticed no ill effects and proceeded to phase 3. the actual platter swap went without incident and hardly warrants description in this story. just a few screws and aluminum spacer rings. i just tried to line up the two platters so they were aligned the same way relative to each other in the new case. obviously i could not get nearly the same level of precision at the physical scale of the data on the drive, but i did the best i could. we held our breath while we booted up the bench pc with a linux data recovery live cd. it found the drive! i started to read an image from the drive, which seemed to work fine. i did a typical data recovery on the image and i found files!!! i actually recovered that data! the customer was thrilled and didn't blink an eye at the bill (something like $700) or the fact we destroyed the other drives in the other pcs. i even got a $100 tip for risking o2 deprivation and the ridicule of my peers. that evening we had pizza and mountain dew paid for out of the register. i kicked butt at counter strike. my wife called to say my mother in law was not able to visit after all. it was the perfect day.a tale from awhile back. i was relatively fresh on senior staff. senior staff and management have access to a pretty great albeit arcane tool that lets us essentially enable or disable any box while completely bypassing the billing system. while extremely handy for troubleshooting, its a recipe for abuse in the wrong hands. therefore, everything we do with it is thoroughly logged. but that's just it, it's *only* logged. nobody checks these logs unless something comes up. back then, something came up. at the time, we were trying something new when it came to office parties. it being overwhelmingly men and sales csr overwhelmingly women, we came up with the creative idea of having 'joint csr' parties. great idea that works to this day, but there was *this* incident. a likeable frontline guy i knew had a pretty sweet girlfriend, with an odd quirk. she's young, very young. legal in canada *at the time* (age of consent laws changed since), but their age gap was already borderline creepy. still, none of my business. this guy's manager was well over 10 years older than him, and at our first 'joint csr' party, he hit on his young girlfriend and stuff ensued. the story only became official watercooler talk material two months later, when she was officially... pregnant. my frontline coworker was losing his mind here, crying during his breaks, and i soon learned the details. his manager was always a bit shady, but damn, he was more than old enough to be his girlfriend's father. thing i knew, though, was that he almost got fired once by direction for giving shady discounts to some members of his extended family. since he wasn't in my good graces after i heard about all this, and on a hunch i decided to check his internal tools' logs. i discovered fifteen manually-provisioned modems and just as many cable boxes with 'test' profiles, aka, full access to everything and unlimited speeds and unmonitored data usage. no related accounts, just a series of mac addresses that weren't linked to anything. that blatant theft of service was already more than enough to get him fired, but just to be sure i put our horrible 'plaintext password offender' status to good use and read his emails. and yep! he's actually got evidence in his private mailbox that he's been giving freebies to his family! now, i was already pissed about the cheating with a girl too young to know what's up, but being stupid enough to so blatantly steal service through support tools *really* made me angry. that's the kind of thing that could make us all lose access to tools we need to get things done. wasn't particularly interested in being officially involved in all this, though. so i just took the relevant logs showing he's free-riding his family along with email evidence, logged in into an untraceable 'training account', and printed them on all corporate printers. *all* corporate printers. yeah i wasted paper, i apologize to the dead trees. he lasted twelve hours. reader is free to determine if he deserved it either for quasi-pedophilia, abuse of emergency technical tools, or just being that dumb. personally, at the time, i deemed he was guilty on all three counts. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](i am a semi retired, semi burnt out old tech who left support in the big city to spend my declining years in a small country town helping small business, home users, and the occasional farmer. in spite of the fact that i left the city over 11 years ago i still get a cry for help from the big smoke (australian for city), this one came from a favorite client, a "silk" or queens counsel. for those of you not from oz he was a lawyer, and a very senior one at that. he had just moved on from his aging blackberry after many years of being prodded by his wife who was an apple fanatic he now had a shiny fruit phone that he was rapidly growing fond of. after a couple of calls when he asked a few simple how to type questions he was very happy with the new phone, till a couple of weeks later when i got a panicked phone call. qc: "mountainwombat, there is something wrong with my phone, i am missing calls, it doesn't ring anymore! should i return it?" mw: "hmmm, qc, look on the side of the phone, remember i told you how to turn the ring off so you wont be disturbed in court? is the mute switch on?" qc: "oh..... mw, you know that i deal with the criminal element on a daily basis? and that i could engage any number of people to ensure your silence?" mw: "yes" qc: "i trust that you are going to be discreet, and not tell my wife about this, i wouldn't hear the end of it!" i promised to remain silent forever, and that his wife wouldn't learn of it from me, provided the account was settled promptly. we both laughed. a few days later i received a small wooden box in the mail that included a cheque, a bottle of bundaberg master distillers' collection rum, and a note that read "as agreed". i love a client with a sense of humour! edit: words, spellingactual call i received this morning. i'm in texas, so please read his dialogue in a texas accent (think [bill engvall]( that's pretty close), it like fifty times funnier. &gt;q: thank you for calling [computer company] this is q, how can i help you? &gt;x: hello? yeah i'm in some kind of pickle here i was wondering if you could sort me out. &gt;q: well i'll see what i can do sir how can i help you today? &gt;x: you see my computer was running slow and my wife thought it may have been because of the dust. &gt;q: well, dust can disrupt your system if it's bad enough, but i'm sure it's probably just--- &gt;x: now, now, son, let me get to it. [wait... that's not the problem? alright.] so this woman decided...for whatever reason between heaven, hell, and high water...to put the god damn laptop...in the dishwasher! [utter silent shock on my end] you there son? &gt;q: yes sir, i am. do you mind if i put you on hold just for a moment? &gt;x: yep that'd be fine. &gt;q: [hold; run to bathroom; laugh until i cry; go back to my desk; take a deep breath; take off hold] ok. wow that does sound like quite the predicament sir. but there might still be a chance that the hard drive is still ok and we might be able to retrieve your files, its very slim, but it is possible. &gt;x: oh no she pulled the hard drive. &gt;q: well thats good because -- &gt;x: nope son, let me get to it. [silent anticipation] you see, this bag of hammers... pulled the hard drive... and put it on the top rack to make god damn sure it got clean!! [stunned silence] i know you there son, i can hear you breathing. &gt;q: i...um, wow, uh... &gt;x: now i normally don't allow people to laugh at me or my problems, but this ain't exactly normal. so you go on ahead. [both of us just erupt with laughter] &gt;q: that is quite the pickle, mr x. &gt;x: so anyway, you got any dishwasher safe laptops for sale? best...call...ever.so this mother &amp; high school daughter just came in my shop. daughter had been working on a 24 page document for the past few weeks, it's due in 2 days. she had it saved in four parts, different files, but now 3 of the files are empty. word reports 0 words in the file. the only file that has anything is the first one which is 8 pages. to me it looked like a blank file had been saved overwriting the orig file. no, she says, just no. it's b/c her brother was playing a game on it. i said, "show me how you opened the file". she goes to a search box, types in microsoft word, opens it, clicks file/save as and selects her 8 page document. i said "wait, you're about to..." - "i know what i'm doing, ok!!", replace all contents, yes i'm sure, then she says "see!!! this stupid computer is erasing my work" i went back through it with her. "see that blank document you have open? well, you are overwriting your files with it when you are using save as." "well how do i open my fiiiiillleeessss then?!?!?!?!", "click open", i respond. see that part where it says replace all contents? that's what it means. she left crying.taco-mputerstore had another client, we offer besides office pcs, the possibility of building you a gaming pc. here in mexico pc components have their prices inflated up to 125% which is a huge impediment for pc~~mr~~ users and gamers to get a good system, yet if you can give us time, we'll build you a powerful system. i had a client, $gamerdad that came asking my boss and co-worker if he could get an imac for gaming, so i got to step in since it's usually my area. &gt;$me: good afternoon señor and welcome to taco-mputerstore, how may we help you? &gt;$gamerdad: greetings, i need you to give me the cost of a gaming apple device. &gt;$me: a gaming apple? well that is going to be a bit hard, what are you planning to play with it? &gt;$gamerdad: well me and my son are fans of world of warcraft, counter strike, lol, planet side and war thunder, amd since our laptop broke, we need a better machine. &gt;$me: well sir, i'm afraid the normal macs can't run those games, the specs and os simply wouldn't allow it. &gt;$gamerdad: i still would like to see them, since many say they are the best machines you can buy. &gt;$me: in a few ways yes, but very expensive, would you like to see the catalog? &gt;$gamerdad: well i... just give me the price of your best model. i pull out our catalog with all the models we have, and when i was on imac page, he points at one &gt;$gamerdad: this one, it has a 5k display and one of those radeon 9 cards so he knows basics :o &gt;$me: that is correct señor, but with shipping costs it will be $3200 dollars (59990 mxn). &gt;$gamerdad: oh... that is going to be expensive. my boss approached us. $elboss: señor, don't buy an imac, we've received many complaints and petitions to refund them since they are useless for games and whatever software they ask you at college. well he's right, we are sick of people yelling at us for having selling them something that doesn't work for them when only 5% of people here have access to an iphone, and not precisely the last generations. not to mention the apple providers have been jerks to us due to these complaints. &gt;$me: he's right señor, for a fraction of this price tag we can build you a pc battle tank. we engaged in a long conversation, but we were discussing the specs he can have, he told us about the monitor they already have and a few other things. i pulled out a paper and pen and start to write down. &gt;$me: so, we can get you a r9 390 for $380 ($7500 mxn), an i5 2500 processor for only $155 ($2800 mxn) that we have on discount, 8gb ram for $100 ($1850)... the final price tag was only $835 ($15000 mxn) &gt;$me: and now we have a battle tank of a computer, no matter what you trow at it, &gt;$gamerdad: let me get a moment to think. he walked around the store, made a few calls and finally decided to give us the greenlight. &gt;$gamerdad: i really want to keep playing, so let's do it. my boss charged the costs to his credit card and i started working on the computer, took me a few hours to get it running, as a gift, we gifted them led fans since they were only a few dollars more expensive. so hours later, father and son come pick it up, brand new pc build, his son gave us all a very happy handshake. &gt;$me: your father built for you one hell of a pc, you can even play at 4k with this beast. &gt;$son: woah, thank you dad! and thank you people as well! after a bit of conversation, they left, i received a small bonus for my work. (enough for me) still doing my best to save cash and move on from my gt 520, let's hope i can eventually get a better card, but for now, let's keep helping clients and users.about a year back a good friend of mine worked at my university's it help desk where students could come with computer issues. between classes i would often come over to hang out with him and other people working there that i knew from our uni's computer club. most issues people wanted help with were usually pretty easy to fix things internet problems, viruses and malware, changed settings and broken hardware (which we don't offer support for but usually help troubleshoot). sometimes something more serious like a shot os. on a somewhat busy day, this guy suddenly storms in with a huge desktop tower. now usually people came in with laptops, phones and tablets so we were all a little taken by surprise. he slams it on the counter and explains that he just built it the day before and it doesn't want to turn on. my friend asks me if i would take a look at it with him since i can get quite enthusiastic about self built desktops. we open it up and i immediately notice that this guy did not mess around as the gtx 980 and the asus rog motherboard spring into view immediately. we bring over a monitor, mouse and keyboard. plug everything in and hit the power button. nothing. we tried it one more time and wrote down the error code on the motherboard. a quick google search revealed that something was wrong with the processor. we double checked all the cables, made sure the psu was strong enough to power the rig and even plugged in a spare psu we had lying around all with the same result. we tell him that it looks like that his cpu might be faulty and i ask if i can detach the cooler to take a look at the cpu itself. maybe it is physically damaged. he agrees and as i screw off the heatsink i immediately notice that there is no thermal paste underneath it. i point this out to him and ask if when he started it for the first time it did turn on but then killed the cpu due to it overheating. he replies that he is 100% sure he applied the thermal paste. i show him that there was nothing i between the cooler and the cpu itself and ask him were he put the thermal paste. turns out he put it on the wrong side of the processor and probably gooed up and bent the socket pins. we ended up giving him the contact support information from the mobo retailer and manufacturer and then sending him on his way. tl;dr: dude comes into it help desk with a self built desktop that won't turn on. turns out he put the thermal paste on the wrong side of the cpu. this happened a few years ago when i worked at a small web design firm. because we were so small, us designers would sometimes take to the phones and offer support for our clients. it could be anything from explaining why something wasn't working, to giving them support on a cms. a bit of back story to this call. we had a new client who we had just completed a total rebrand for. new website, logo, company colours, fliers. the works. it looked awesome, except for one thing. the client insisted on us keeping an animated gif of a little guy waving a flag. whatever. her money. i get a call one day after she received the 5000 fliers and 500 business cards that we had re-designed and had printed for her. i think you can figure where this is going: &gt; client: hi, i received the cards and fliers today. there is a problem with the printing. &gt;me: that's not good. can you let me know what it is and i can get onto the printing company to sort it out for you. &gt; client: sure. the wee man on the logo. he isn't animated like on the website. he's still. &gt;me: *silent* &gt; client: hello? i said the little man isn't moving like on the site. that's what i wanted, the same as on the site. &gt;me: erm.. ahh.. hrm.. okay.. you do realise that having the little man move isn't possible...? &gt; client: why not? &gt;me: because it is a printed picture. on paper. &gt; client: but it moves on the website, and it is just a picture there. &gt;me: um, i don't know what to say, that's not how it works. i'll pass you to my supervisor. she genuinely couldn't figure out why the gif wasn't moving on printed paper. i was completely lost for words! edit: words. also. front page! this is my first post to hit it. i guess i'm like internet famous now. i'll work on my thank you speech. edit 2: ow... my inbox.the call center i work at caters to the employees for our company. we help with anything from troubleshooting hardware at the warehouse to error messages from sites that we support. one of the sites we support is for the employees to be able to access their paystubs, banking info, timecards, etc. and for the most part, the most challenging bit about it is trying to navigate to the damn thing. i can relate. i can empathize. (but design issues are out of my hands.) my caller lady in question was having problems with her password. sounded easy enough. i'd dealt with many similar calls in the past. if only i'd known what i did now. *innocent past self, just hang up that call right. now.* it started out with the normal routine. got her employee number, her warehouse number and name. &gt;she told me, "i just got transferred to this number and i just want to access my time card. i've signed in and everything and i can't get my time card." &gt;"so you were able to sign into the main site just fine?" i asked to confirm. &gt;"yes." she says. i find out that to access the time card, you actually have to sign in again. mmkay, whatever. design choice is a little annoying, but we all have to deal, right? so i tell her to use the same login info that she did originally to get into the site. &gt;she tells me, "it's *not* working. i *just* changed my password. why is this not working?" i don't know, lady. you tell me. of course, i try to keep as polite as possible. asked her to verify her username. asked her if her keyboard has the caps lock on? is the num lock on? (you know, the usual.) &gt;"there's nothing wrong with my computer. i just got this mac, it's a $3,000 computer. there's *nothing wrong with my computer*" um...ok. &gt;at this point i can hear her frustration heighten. "are they doing this on purpose?" she says. &gt;"doing what?" i asked, not knowing what i was in for. &gt;"they're blocking me from my time card. they aren't allowed to do that. that's *illegal*. they're doing this on purpose. i won't stand for this." oh. my. god. i don't know what the proper response is. i try to reassure her that the company wouldn't do something like that. i try to kindly tell her that *possibly* she mistyped her credentials or password? &gt;she shuts me down. "no. i *just* changed my password. i know what my password is." ok, time for plan b. i ask her to try to log out and try and change her password again. she is adamant against it. she pushes, eager to take whatever is left of my patience and crush it from existence. &gt;"i don't want to change my password again." at this point, i am desperate (to get out of this call.) i login via my own username and password. everything works fine. i log into my time card. damn thing works fine on my end. i tell her that this doesn't seem to be an issue with the *site*. (a nice way of telling her that it is user error from *her* end.) &gt;she tells me, "no. no. no. that's with your user that it works with, ok? that's not my username." somehow, i manage to convince her to change her password again. i wait in silence while she goes through the process. a part of me wished that she offered to call us back while she did this. i normally start up small talk, but i frankly didn't care at this point. she resets the password. she tries to login again. it says, "username/password incorrect." *someone end my suffering now.* she is not pleased. &gt;"why is it saying this now? what...what did you *do* to my username? you *broke* it." **oh. hell. no.** this accusation throws me off. i try to tell her that this username should be the same, i did nothing. *nothing.* she is still convinced i am guilty. &gt;she mentions to me, "i have a witness to this conversation, you know? my friend has been watching me talk with you this entire time." why is this happening to me. she starts muttering profanities about the site. she continues to blame me. i decide it is time to talk to one of our specialists for help. i walk a bit too fast. when i come to him, i almost trip over myself in relief when i explain the situation and he offers to take the call from me. my only regret is that i didn't come to him sooner. i come back to the caller, ready to let go....only to find she is not quite done with me. &gt;after i tell her that someone else is going to take the call, she asks, "wait a minute, what's your name?" i hate it when they do this. nonetheless, i give her my entire name. i spell out my last name. she tells me to slow down. &gt;i try to spell it again and then she finally says, "ok. you know. you need to speak more clearly ok? i have been more than patient with you this entire call. this is the least i deserve." i'm sorry....**what?** i'm seething. but then i speak more slowly. she is finally able to write down my info. i park the call. my specialist picks up the call. i sigh in relief at this finally being over and chat the ticket number to my specialist to look over my troubleshooting steps. at this time, i take my much needed break. i end up taking a walk to a secluded area and crying. i start worrying that i'll be in trouble and she'll report me. i wasn't thinking clearly. *however, this is not where it ends.* when i return from my break, my specialist is walking over to me. *oh no*, i think. except then he has me sit down and talks with me. &gt;"she was rude to me too. started cussing and giving me a hard time." oh my god. &gt;he continues. "so, i put her on hold and called her warehouse, and talked to the administrator on duty." he tells me that he told him about her behavior. he found that this woman is not a model employee. she's pulled this kind of behavior before. he tells me that he would like me to make a summary of everything that happened and send him the email and cc our supervisor and our manager. he makes sure i think none of this is my fault and tells me that the warehouse is going to look into writing her up. *i could die of happiness.* i could have been satisfied with just that...but then half an hour later, my specialist comes back. &gt;"she called back." he tells me, with a grin. oh. &gt;"what happened?" &gt; "she was much nicer this time to the person who answered." pft. of course. and then he tells me. &gt;"they found out she was fat fingering and she didn't type in her password correctly this whole time." yup. ________________________________________________________________________________________ *2/5/2016 update*: thank you to everyone who has been responding, i didn't anticipate my story picking up like this. i usually don't frequent reddit so i'm sorry that i'm not able to respond to everyone. i'm going to read through everyone's comments though! thank you for the advice and encouragement, this experience has been...interesting. by the way, i got a couple emails recently from the user's admin and gm apologizing for her behavior and saying that they are personally speaking with her about it. nothing further than that, but i think at this point, i'm not really angry about it anymore. also, a few of my co workers who sit near me gave me some chocolate, hugs and some of the more senior csrs told me some more user horror stories which made me feel much better. this didn't happen directly to me, but it did happen to my supervisor at my old job. he's told me enough stories over the years between his many different jobs prior to it that i can safely say that this is a true story. * let's call my old boss $oldboss. * let's call his supervisor $powertrip. * let's call the new guy $whiteintern. one friday, like any other friday, $oldboss throws a weekly full backup tape inside each of the three servers left in his small data center, a large reel into his vax, dropped off last week's backup tapes at the building next door, and walks down the block to the local burger joint for a beer and the burger special. then he heads home. it had been a hellish week at work. $oldboss had to fight with $powertrip about data center improvements that $powertrip implemented without consulting him. initially, it was things that were a major improvement: keypads on all doors coming into the offices, and a new kick ass door for the data center. there had been some small thefts in the office, and keys were no longer trusted, even after all of the locks were changed. the installers had tons of issues installing this crazy data center door, because the building was so old and used huge granite blocks about 3 feet thick and the data center was in the basement. this building could probably withstand a nuke. the door installers were instructed to keep the room safe from smoke/fire and water (no matter the cost), so the door was sealed on all sides and damn near impenetrable. $oldboss loved this, but as soon as it was done, $powertrip decided to have the sprinkler system extended into the data center as well. $oldboss flipped out over the idea of having water rushing above very expensive equipment, but $powertrip basically told him: "it's not your data center, it's $powertrip's data center. and i'll do whatever i think is best for it. $oldboss, you're just my flunkie that shows up to keep it in shape, and i pay you 1/4 of my salary so that you keep your opinionated mouth shut." $oldboss told me that it took every fiber in his body to not hit the man, let alone keep his mouth shut. he did, however, go to hr the next day and report the issue. it was dismissed without any reason given to him, and since he wasn't in the union with the rest of the employees he had little power. he told me that he decided to stick with the company because they were paying him well, the job was stable normally, and his daughter was getting a discount at the local college. after all, family does come before happiness sometimes, and $oldboss simply looked at it as a place where he could get paid for the next few years until his daughter graduated. only 3 years to begin a job search and network with other people! compared to his other previous jobs which were much more dangerous, this desk job was a godsend. over the next few years, he had few run-ins with $powertrip but they did what they were required to do and avoided each other. one thing that $oldboss did regularly that really pissed off $powertrip was to request environmental monitoring equipment for the data center. now that there were new ac units added as well as the sprinkler systems, he wanted humidity monitoring equipment as well as the noise sensors and flood detection systems. compared to other projects, this one was cheap. but $powertrip looked at it as a reason that $oldboss was trying to throw him under the bus: * $powertrip: "why do we need this equipment again?" * $oldboss: "because there are a few sources of water and moisture in that room now, and we didn't put these sensors in the room back when we added those water sources." * $powertrip: "so...you're saying that i made a mistake? i don't make mistakes, i fix them! having this meeting with you was a mistake. i'll talk it over with the bosses." $oldboss would send an inter-office memo to $powertrip ever year or so with the same proposal, worded differently each time, but apparently the damage had already been done. it was returned to him denied every year, with the same reason every time: "i don't make mistakes" written every time on the project approval notes form. finally, $oldboss's daughter was due up for graduating! the discounted education and the money they both contributed meant that she never had to worry about loans, and her education was fully paid off. she was going to be graduating in only a few weeks. $oldboss planned on leaving in the next few months, but figured he better follow rule #1 just one more time: cya (cover your ass). $oldboss found a new job that was going to pay a ton more, and told them that he'd need 4 weeks notice to hand over the reigns and give all of the proper info to the next guy. so he sent the inter-office memo one last time to $powertrip for the environmental sensors project, who responded with a nasty, hand-written note saying to never question him again or he'd be fired. needless to say, he went upstairs, put in his 2 weeks notice to a stunned $powertrip, went to hr and got his paperwork in order, and took the rest of the day off as sick. the last 2 weeks at this job had absolutely no interaction between $oldboss and $powertrip, except on the final day when $powertrip had $oldboss escorted out by police officers and all access codes to the doors were promptly changed. $oldboss had met his replacement that same day, some fresh-out-of-college kid who he would have gladly hired as an intern, but not someone to replace him. he went off to his new job, where everyone loved and respected him and his pay went up about $20,000 in the first year due to the major improvements he implemented. he was as happy as he could be. but then the event™ happened a few years later. nobody knows exactly how it started, but the fire marshal concluded that the vax dot-matrix printer apparently caught fire for some reason and probably lit the many large boxes of paper next to it. the closest sprinkler went off, and it kept draining water. keep in mind the following: 1. this data center is in the basement. 2. it is now a sealed room, ever since the insane door was installed. 3. the walls are not drywall, but 3ft thick stone blocks. on all sides. 4. all cables ran out of the data center ceiling into the maintenance room directly above them. 5. there is nowhere for this water to go but up, or through a $10,000 vault-like door that isn't moving the ceiling in the room was about 12 feet above. the water didn't reach the ceiling, but it did go up roughly 7 feet...apparently someone at the nightly guard desk stopped the system when the generic building alarm went off. however, since the office had keypad access installed in the last few years, none of the guards had ever needed to get into it during the night. the night guard could have probably called the head of the cleaning crew of the locksmith, but it was 2am on a saturday. what's the worst that could happen? monday rolls around, and the intern replacement is called in early since "vax isn't working". he tries to open the vault, but can't. he calls the locksmith, who takes one look at the vault said says "i didn't install this beastly thing! call that company!". by this time it's 10am and the many employees at this office are flipping out and execs are pulling their hair out. intern decides to go up to the maintenance closet and he peers down into the cable run hole and he goes white. you're not supposed to go full white, but he did. he ran to $powertrip, whose office had become a war room of sorts for the execs, since he was in charge of the it department. i was told the conversation went like this: * $whiteintern: "hey um quick question $powertrip....do we have any environmental sensors in the data center?" * $powertrip: "not this **** again! why isn't the system up and running yet, slacker? get the **** out of here and fix it!" * $whiteintern: *in a pissed off tone* "you're not paying me enough for this, so i'll just say it. the data center is filled with water and looks like a swimming pool. all of your equipment is now scrap." everyone in the room freaked out all at once. it was disorder as everyone implemented cya policy and the finger was immediately pointed at $powertrip, who was lost for a few seconds, but quickly found someone to blame. * $powertrip: "get the police on the phone! i know who did this!" * $whiteintern: "who did this?" * $powertrip: "obviously it's $oldboss getting back at me! i bet he did this!" ----------------- $oldboss's new job was only a few blocks away, and he was busy enjoying his monday morning with the free donuts that management would bring in at the beginning of every week. he was looking at a promotion to management, and had his feet kicked up on his desk, when he heard a commotion at the front desk. he looks out from behind his office door and sees a few executives from his old company standing there shouting for him. $oldboss gets up, walks over, and then notices purple-faced $powertrip being the primary agitator. "oh god" was his only though. * $powertrip: "here he is! you!!!! you terrible person!!! you're coming with us and you're going to rot in jail after the police get to you!!! either come with us now or we'll have the cops come over here!!!!" * $oldboss: "what in the hell is going on? what are you talking about? i'm not going anywhere!!!" * $powertrip: "you flooded the data center to get back at me you ******* **********" * $oldboss: "i what?!? you.....*sigh*....you know what? yea, i'll come with you." they walk him down to the old building, where police have already begun an inspection and the fire marshal was setting up pumps to get rid of the water. everyone of any importance was there: head of hr, security guards, every executive, and all eyes looked at him as soon as $oldboss walked into the room. the glares were piercing. the cops didn't know that $powertrip had done this, and were in the process of telling him that he shouldn't have done this, when $oldboss says: * $oldboss: "i'd like to make a statement. right now. in front of everyone." * $police: "that can wait until we're..." * $oldboss: "nope, this needs to be done now. i've been enjoying my new job for about 4 years now, and i'd like to get back to it as soon as possible. $hr-sally, if you'll note that before i left in my record i gave you every inter-office memo i ever had with $powertrip explaining why we needed environmental monitoring, and his reasons for denying them. can you read them aloud?" * $hr-sally: "let me find them here..........um....'too ******* expensive', 'i don't make mistakes', 'i don't make mistakes', and 'i don't make mistakes, and i'll fire you next time you bring this up'. * $oldboss: "thank you sally. and you'll note that despite my extensive knowledge of the equipment, and what was needed, that my boss doesn't make mistakes and he didn't feel that this was needed." * $powertrip: "i know you must have started the fire!!!" * $oldboss: "actually i was away with the ceo of my new company all weekend where he offered me a raise and a management position. i can call him down here if you'd like." upper management apologized to $oldboss and let him leave, at the loud protest of $powertrip. he didn't get to see what happened next. ----------------- less than a week later, he got a call to please come back to the old office at 9am by the guy that runs the company. you can't really ignore that call, so he went back. * $oldboss: "you wanted to see me, $bigboss?" * $bigboss: "we just started trying to figure out how to start over here, and i realized that none of us have any idea what we're doing. how would you like to come back to the company? * $oldboss: "there's no way in hell...." * $bigboss: "we fired $powertrip as soon as you left the room last week and escorted him out of the building for gross negligence of company property, as we had never heard about this environmental monitoring plan that you proposed. in fact, i'm not offering you your old position, as the guy that replaced you is one of my relatives. i'm offering you $powertrip's old position as our management head for it. with an increase from what he was getting paid." $oldboss was actually thinking of retirement in a few years, but this was too good to pass up. * $oldboss: "when do you want me to start?" ----------------- in the end, $oldboss took the job and spent the next few years training $whiteintern as best as he could, and along the way they happily worked on many projects together and hired many underlings (as it was becoming more and more popular with the other departments). i was one of the many underlings underneath $whiteintern that were hired to implement the new data center. this story is definitely one of my favorites, despite it taking a long time to tell, because it hits nearly some important rules in it: 1. cover your ass. (all of the time.) 2. do a good job. 3. don't burn bridges. 4. have a data recovery plan (storage area for reels and tapes was a separate building and everything was moved over there at the end of every week). 5. listen to those under you, beside you, and above you. in it, there are a million ways to get something done, and your way might not be the best way. at his retirement party, i remember that $bigboss gave $oldboss a [fishbowl cup]( full of vodka, but with a little metal data center in the bottom of it someone made for him. probably the best going away present anyone could have.this was a few years ago but it was embarrassing. taco-mputerstore sells your normal stuff you need to build and maintain pcs, all of it hanging in the wall behind the main counter for clients to see, including of course, our dear thermal paste. we were attending a few clients when suddenly a police truck stand in front of the store and a couple of policemen and a dog came in through the door, my boss reached for them. &gt;$elboss: officers, how may i help you? &gt;officer: señor, we received reports that your store is suspicious of selling illegal merchandise. me and the other two guys were shocked, the policeman with the dog came behind the counter and started sniffing around, i didn't do much except lean againts the counter and let them through. &gt;$elboss: what? we don't sell those things, we sell computer and computer accessories. &gt;$officer: we'll see about that. the officer with the dog reached for the syringe of thermal paste then hand it over at the other one, i tried to contain my laugh, since we had joked how the syringes looked like heroin. &gt;officer: *holding the paste* what is this? &gt;elboss: that is called thermal grease, paste or silicone, it's for connecting some parts of computers to the metalic surfaces that irradiate heat so the pc's don't overheat and die. not exactly the best description but a good eli5 he has used before. the officer opened it up and gave it a sniff, then the dog sniffed it as well, no reaction, we were allowed to open youtube and show him some videos of it's use. they spent about 30 minutes searching the store and the back of it, they found nothing of course. &gt;$officer: sorry for the bother, we got an anonymous call that your store was selling heroine, false alarm, our apologies. he signed some papers and later they left, good times. tl;dr: thermal paste is heroine.i work for a small computer repair shop, we deal with people whose computers have no warranty, people who want their tech support a bit cheaper. as such, we get some pretty crazy calls and people. i'd like to share one today. caller:"i've got a problem with my computer. it's telling me to buy a pet snake and i don't want one" me:(thinking it's a virus) "alright sir, are you trying to reach a specific website and it is redirecting you asking you to buy a pet snake?" caller: "no! every time i click this stupid file, it asks me to go out and buy a snake then try again!" me:"alright sir, can you read back the exact error message?" caller: "yeah, it says 'python required to run script'" me: "...sir i'm going to put you on hold for a few seconds." commence laughter, including tears. my co-workers stared at me. i walked him through the process of installing python, then showed the call to my manager, who regretted not being on the line when the call was made. edit: wow, frontpage. thank you to everyone! i`ll be sure to post more stories as they occur. edit edit: whoo boy. one more edit: 3,000 people (holy sh*t) in the it sector have upvoted this. i can't express how grateful i am, nor did i ever think i'd get so many. but before this turns in what sounds like an acceptance speech, i was thinking of starting a theory list as to how this happened in the first place. i'll list the direct quotations and whom they came from. if someone wants to add a theory or disprove one, feel free! mine and my manager's theory: the caller had a tech-savvy son who had copied over a python script to the dad's computer, which didn't have python, and was planning on installing it but forgot to or something. dad clicked on file and got suspicious. /u/argonwolf theory: bitcoin will give you bitcoins for basically acting as a proxy for their transaction network, essentially converting electricity into bitcoin. before the bitcoin boom and crash it was pretty common for hobbyists to install the necessary software on all the computers in the house to increase cash flow. i even saw a guy take like 20 raspberry pis and convert them into a bitcoin "strip mine", just having them run the proxy software. /u/sirenstogo theory: what it probably was an application that was a wrapper for the script and it could run without py but it wouldn't be able to launch the script /u/hellkittyanarchy theory: doesn't python have a portable version? maybe he was just drag and dropping it onto a portable version. /u/randommook theory: there are python scripts for cracking wep encryption. maybe he downloaded one of those without understanding what python was. /u/chipaca theory: python was probably installed but not on the path /u/malak77 theory: i would guess mining a cpu coin. crypto is really greek when you first get into it. /u/nuclear_weaponry theory: some mods for skyrim require python. i was working graveyards, about a decade ago, doing wireless networking support for a major pc manufacturer. i get this call at about 2am. it's a woman, fairly young (early 20s maybe), and she can't get on the internet. she is getting connected to her router wired and wirelessly, but no internet. i walk her through some standard steps, but the router is still acting kind of funky, plus i think she had comcast (we had a lot of trouble with them). finally, in the troubleshooting steps, we get to the point where doing a manual reset on her router is the next best step before just replacing it. so i told her to pick it up, turn it around, find that small, recessed button on the back left, and use a pen to press and hold that for 10 seconds. after a brief silence, she asks, "where is this hole again?" "on the back of your &lt;brand&gt; router, where you plug the cables in, it's on the far left." "hmm, i don't see it back here..." i'd done this many, many times before, and i knew the mistakes customers usually made, so i said, "move your left thumb, you have it over the hole." "oh!...i'll be right back." the phone click-clacks as it hits the desk, and the pattering of feet walking off in the distance can be heard. about 30 seconds later, the footsteps are back and getting closer. then she picks the phone up again. she says, "ok whew, i'm ready now. i just had to put a robe on, i didn't know you had cameras on these things. sorry for the free show."client runs a bunch of 24 hour convenience stores and i'm typically the one they call when the fecal matter hits the rotary air impeller when the phone goes off about 20 minutes ago at 11pm here i assume it's some kind of significant failure. a little quite voice goes "hey tactical_bacon, can i get a favour from you ? i'm $bigboss child process and friends with your daughter, can you tell me how to wipe my search history really quickly ?". obviously i'm in cya mode as she's about 15 so immediately start recording the call just in case, but i'm not going to nark her out to her dad just because she might have been up to something naughty briefly. she want to only wipe a single set of searches and a few page views from history which is trickyish to step someone through over the phone, so setup a quick remote session to do it for her. que an "oh fuck" moment because she's researching women's shelters and abuse reporting helplines, and needs to hide it. i have a significant feeling i'm going to be dropping this client soon. yes...yes you are...ladies and gentlemen of tfts i give you another wonderful tale of users who will not listen...and pay the price because of it. &amp;nbsp; today's tale involves a lovely little business that shall henceforth be named $staffingagency this business is one of our largest and most loyal/friendly customers. we have a contract with them that boils down to "if it's within business hours we've got your back." many at $staffingagency have direct numbers to my and other technician's cell phones as a courtesy and are a treat to deal with. there is that one though...ohhhh there is that one...every business has them. that employee is miss cantread (cr). &amp;nbsp; it is 6:00 pm on a saturday evening when i received her call. i was prepping for a raid in (insert favorite mmo here) and joking with friends on our voip server when i was forced to break away. i didn't recognize the number which, unfortunately, sets of a dozen red flags immediately within my mind. &amp;nbsp; &gt;me: "this is cyrillus." &gt;cr: "oh thank god someone finally answered i've been calling the office number for an hour now!" &gt;me: "i'm sorry who is this?" &gt;cr: "cr with $staffingagency, i can't print my report and it was due at 5:00. you need to fix it." at this point i set my cell phone to record the call (yay for work phones). &gt;me: "ookkkaayyy...are there any error messages on the printer?" &gt;cr: "no. can you come out here?" &gt;me: "i could, but i want to try some troubleshooting over the phone first." &gt;cr: "no i don't have the time for it and i know y'all are under contract to provide on site service." &gt;me: "that's only on weekdays during work hours. any kind of after hours or weekend work, which i am *not* required to do, is billable time." &gt;cr: "well that's stupid!" &gt;me: "that's our contract ma'am, i'm willing to spend a little time troubleshooting over the phone or if i was already out near your area, but i'm at home so phone troubleshooting is my next best option." &gt;cr: "fine, ask away." &gt;me: "so there are no error messages on the printer, how about the pc? are there any error messages there? have you tried turning it off and on? have you checked for jams? have you checked to see if there is paper?" &gt;cr: "it just won't print, i've tried **all** of that." &gt;me: "ok could you go into the control panel and tell me what you see?" &gt;cr: "i see the printer and, it says it has a document waiting." &gt;me: "and nothing else? i think y'all had a few other printers on the network that you should have listed there." &gt;cr: "nothing. look just...how much does it cost to have you come out?" &gt;me: "this would be under emergency rates, after hours, and weekend, so you're looking at $250 an hour...i could also do remote support to see if maybe i could fix the issue from here that would only be a weekend rate." &amp;nbsp; i figured that would dissuade her or at least let me fix the issue while doing my raid prep. nope... &amp;nbsp; &gt;cr: "fine. make the trip out here, i've got to get this report printed out before the end of the night." &amp;nbsp; about this time something clicked that hadn't before. $staffingagency had their main office in the same town i was in, but they had a bunch of satellite offices scattered all over the place and i hadn't ever met cr in my many trips out to the main office. &gt;me: "hey cr, which office are you at again?" &gt;cr: "i'm at $bigcitylocation. &amp;nbsp; i began cursing myself, $bigcitylocation was 2 and a half hours of driving away, but i couldn't just say 'that's too far for a saturday night', i'd never hear the end of it come monday. &gt;me: "ok cr...just so you know this is going to be $250 an hour **plus travel time**. saturday traffic in $bigcity is bad as i recall so i can't guarantee that my travel estimate will be accurate, but i'm thinking no less than a 2 hour drive." &gt;cr: "i'll pay it. **just**. **get**. **here**." &gt;me: "ok then." &amp;nbsp; after venting a little bit of the inconvenience to my guildies i prep myself and begin the drive. it was uneventful until i reached $bigcity where traffic became absolute hell. my two hour estimate turned into three. i finally arrived at the agency office, a little building nestled in the center of the city with barely five parking spots to its lot. walking in the building i met cr whom quickly ushered me off to the printer. &amp;nbsp; in big bold letters on the front of the printer: **out of paper** i couldn't believe it. i walk over to the pc and sure enough on the printer's status screen it shows in big bold letters **out of paper**. i take a new ream of paper (which were right beside the printer, open the tray, put it in, and sure enough her queued report comes spitting out...to be sure i did some additional printing, checked to see if anything was worn out, but it was in vain. the printer was perfectly fine. &amp;nbsp; cr shows up at my shoulder, &gt;cr: "oh good you fixed it, what was the problem?" &gt;me: "it was out of paper...it said so on the screen and on the computer." she flushed and had a look of anger as she looked down at the printer, then back up to me, &gt;cr: "and i'm supposed to pay for that?" &gt;me: "you agreed to the service call." &gt;cr: "this is going to be over a thousand dollars of billable time to have just changed a paper ream, i'm not paying that much!" &amp;nbsp; i'm not a very confrontational person, i get nervous and hate being under pressure...but occasionally i do snap. this lady interrupted my saturday evening, made me miss out on an activity i greatly enjoy and only do once a week, and made me fight evening traffic on one of the worst days of the week to do it. &gt;me: "you won't have to worry about paying me because i'm sending the bill to your main office with a full detailing of what it is we did here today along with a recording of that phone call. a phone call where *i told you* to check the printer for any sort of error messages, missing paper, and so on. i gave you the rate the trip would be, a trip i could have rightly refused to do because it is outside of our support contract, but i came anyway at *your* urging." it didn't quite come out as i typed in person, but i was able to calmly convey the meat of it and that's more than i can usually accomplish. she seemed to realize she had messed up. her reaction, as you would imagine, was the same quote used for the title. &amp;nbsp; tl:dr luser couldn't read, requests on site support, gets $1500 bill because of it. possibly fired. &amp;nbsp; **update:** well she's not fired, but i've been informed any troubleshooting calls from her location are now going to come through their main office first. they also worked out a deal with my boss to only pay half the owed bill due to how ridiculous the situation was. edit: clarification, this satellite office had 1 pc and 1 printer that only cr used. the other staff were specialized staff that didn't need a pc or worked from home off a vpn.yep. you read that right. a user got *terminated from his job* for forgetting his password. before you think that's harsh, consider that the user was a medical doctor assigned patients in the critical care department. this is the story. this morning around 2am i get a call from the ccu from dr. $ccudoctor saying he can't log into the computer. now, we use $bigmedicalsoftwarecompany that has several different components to it. each needing it's own password. but there are three main logon credentials that you need. and if you are a doctor, you need 1 less than normal since we use imprivata onesign. normally, all the physician has to do is swipe the badge in the reader, and enter a 4-digit-pin. but they also need their badge to leave the ccu, so no one really forgets it at work and has someone else use it to access the systems. all the doors are rfid locked and you're not getting anywhere without your badge. so once the doctor calls, i ask him what he's trying to log into and he responds with "the computer". i say "which application?" and he said "where i chart". so i say, "ok, where do you chart?" and he has the audacity to respond "on the computer!". thank you captain obvious. i say okay, so do you use the vm, or portal? and he said he uses the vm. so i remote into his computer, ask him to badge the reader and enter his pin. it didn't work. i reset the pin and asked him to do it again, and now it's asking for his ad password. i ask him to enter his ad password to verify its him, and then it will ask him to create a new 4 digit pin. he doesn't remember his ad password, so i change his password to 'password' and prompt the computer to make him change it. the computer prompts him to change it and he enters 6 characters and hits the enter key really hard. the computer rejects the password because it doesn't meet security protocol for a physician. they deal with medical records and can view phi on any patient in this hospital, so we want this complex. he gets flustered and starts complaining that his password doesn't work. i tell him that he has to have at least 8 characters, one capital letter, and one number. he says "i don't have time for this shit, fix it!" and hangs up the phone. come to find out, he went in the break room and ignored his patients blaming it all on it. after he hung up on me, i called the department director so she could maybe talk some sense into him. i didn't want a patient getting delayed care because a doctor can't come up with a password. but of course, the patient he was caring for went into cardiac arrest because he failed to resort to paper charting, and delayed patient care. the house supervisor found out about it and told him to leave the property immediately. security had to physically remove him. the patient is alive though. all is well with a new, younger doctor, that's actually kind of computer savvy. when i created his ccu account, he created a password with 12 characters and my system showed me it was "high security". that's rare. he probably used symbols. tl,dr - doctor forgot his log in information and delayed patient care. patient almost dies and doctor is escorted off the property. update: i was informed this morning that this particular doctor had a long list of previous issues with administration and failure to comply with hospital policy and procedure. this current incident was the "last straw" so to speak. update 2: wow!! front page **and** quote of the day? that's awesome. thanks guys!where i work is closed thursday &amp; friday for christmas. of the thousand or so people who work here, i'm among the remaining hundred who didn't take the week off for vacation. with my only work for today and tomorrow being a handful of pcs to image, i naively stayed up later than usual last night expecting to spend most the morning dozing through that process. just to spite me, a ticket arrived at 9:03am &gt; user recently changed offices and reporting that the display on his tablet is not working. user powers device on and nothing happens. i called user and learned the tablet's display is fine, it just doesn't work with the monitor when it's docked. user is an engineer, and since he is trusted with a $3000 tablet he should at least know how to plug in the two power cables and hdmi cable for his dock/monitor. my first assumption was after the move he connected the 65w travel power brick to the dock instead of the 90w, and the dock just wasn't getting enough power. the bricks are roughly the same size and it happens all the time. user was "too busy" to read the label on his brick and verify whether that was the case or not, so i grabbed a brick and some video cables and made the drive to user's new office *30 minutes away.* what i was greeted with was the dock, monitor, and tablet still sealed in the user's moving box... i looked at the box. i looked at the user. i scowled. the user acknowledged my scowl. the user attempted to explain how he had unpacked everything and it didn't work so he put it all back and resealed the box and and... i continued scowling. user sensed i wasn't buying any and excused himself from the scene. i unpacked and connected everything. it all worked fine just as it should have. user had a box of a dozen dunkin donuts on his desk. i liberated half. (edit) surprising level of interest in this one. no, i wasn't going to notify a manager/supervisor. installing it equipment is part of my job, so this clearly fell under it. i'd have been perfectly happy to make the 30 minute drive to connect it for him if that's what he'd initially asked for, instead of saying something was broken and putting my brain in troubleshoot mode. yes, the donuts were delicious. hello all - this is my first post on this forum, my colleague having only recently shown it to me. this story is 100% true, although i sincerely wish it wasn't. one weekend in 2008 while on-call doing internal support for a mortgage company, i get a call from a remote underwriter. she tells me that due to a winter storm, she was working from home rather than the office today. as a result, she's using a desktop she has had for several years already, rather than her usual laptop. her complaint is that it is 'slow and noisy'. to demonstrate the noise, she held the phone up to the machine. i conceded that yes, it was indeed whirring audibly. i remoted in, and couldn't find anything seriously wrong with the machine, aside from it was old, and somewhat overwhelmed with the workload - it had 2gb of ram and was running xp, with quite a lot of company pre-installed bloat, e.g. just enough memory to boot up and not much else. i told her there wasn't much i could do about the performance, but she should clean the machine out with some canned air, and check for random loose parts that could be rattling in the bottom of the machine. satisfied, she hung up, agreeing she'd clean it out. 20 minutes later, she calls again, to inform me that the machine has stopped working all together. nothing she could do would get it to turn back on again. she said it hadn't worked since she cleaned it out. upset for her, and annoyed my advice had led to the problem, i sent her a shipping label to get the machine to me so i could fix it. when the system arrived, i could not power it on either. i looked inside it to investigate, and found a nightmare - there was literally melted plastic everywhere. some had dripped onto the cpu fan. one of the corners of the motherboard was drooping, like cheese on a tv commercial whopper. immediately, i called the user. &gt;"so, this machine is a goner, m'aam." &gt;"why? i did exactly as you said!" &gt;"you used canned air?" &gt;"i didn't have time to go to the store, i just used a hairdryer." &gt;"...you what?" &gt;"you know, a hairdryer? it blows air, and it got all the dust out." &gt;"you used a hairdryer inside your desktop tower?" &gt;"yeah, and it scared me when it started making sparks." &gt;"you had it plugged in while you were doing that?" &gt;"i never turned it off, i didn't want to disconnect from the vpn." this one just happened. so i work as the it manager at a hotel and resort. our spa had called me to tell me one of their keyboards wasn't swiping credit cards (it's a keyboard model that has a built in credit card swipe). so i head down there, open up notepad, slide my card, and sure enough, nothing. so while i am looking at it, one of the employees at the desk asks me if i've ever seen the it crowd. "do you ever get the urge to answer the phone and say 'hello, it, have you tried turning it off and back on again?'" i smile, and tell her yes. then i say to her "ok, your keyboard is fixed." she looks surprised, as they had assumed the keyboard would need replacing. "what did you do?" i look at her, smiling at the irony of the situation. "i unplugged it and plugged it back in. aka, turned it off and back on again." she smiled and gave me a high five. i love easy fixes.sigh. if you are aspiring to be an it tech, stay the hell away from hospitals. that being said, i get a call from an ed doctor and it goes like this: &gt; me: it, this is smhdd can i help you? doc: yes. this is dr. $givesentirename and this computer down here in the ed next to room 14 will not com on. i tried to holding the button, i tried un-plugging it and plugging it back in. nothing works. i have patients that need my services and my care and i am being prevented from doing my job. i need to get these orders in so i can get meds on my patient. me: okay. just go to paper charting. i'm going to grab a pre-built brand new system and head that way right now. doc: okay, because i have to get this charting done and provide for my patients. i have to be able to access the computers in a timely fashion. me: yes ma'am. on my way now. doc: okay. thank you. the thing about the computers is that they are there to assist the physicians. never should a computer cause patient care delays because human beings don't need to be rebooted and repaired as often. these doctors should know that if they know a patient needs $drug, they can give the patient that drug and use the forms like they did before the wonderful world of computers. so i get down to the ed and as i'm rolling a cart with a brand new system on it up to the terminal, there she is with her overly detailed explanation of what she has tried in terms of troubleshooting. the entire time, my eyes are fixed on the monitor stand-by light that is **not on** and i can't look away. she finally stops talking and i walk over and re-seat the power cable into the back of the monitor in one swift motion and the monitor pops on and springs to life. i smiled at the doctor and told her "merry christmas" and walked away. because that's what you do. you fix the issue, and get the hell out of the way. they need to work and small-talk is not something that we do. we do what we need to do and move like the wind. once i got back in my office, the house supervisor called me telling me that this particular doctor filed a complaint on me for making her look like she was stupid. i explained what happened, what i did, and what i said, and the house supervisor started laughing and said, "oh, so she *actually is* stupid.". oh the joys of working in a hospital. this story recounts the worst service call i ever ran. if i had never got that job and was stuck delivering pizzas for the rest of my life, i probably would have been okay with that if it meant i didn't have to deal with this. [warning, this story contains brief use of adult language, reader discretion is advised] it's around quitting time friday, just doing my paperwork after a surprisingly lax day when boss man calls me up. &gt; boss man: new call came in; high priority. end user from derp group says she needs her laptop serviced; no power/won't turn on. think you can handle it today? &gt; me: no problem, boss man. so i call the end user about 5 minutes later to try and do some simple troubleshooting/diagnostics over the phone to get a better idea of the issue before i actually visit the user. &gt; brriinnngg brrriiiinnng &gt; end user: it's about damn time &gt; me: i'm sorry? what? &gt; end user: you *are* the derp service tech, *riiiiight?!* &gt; me: erm, yes. i'm calling with regards to your service call numb-- &gt; end user: i don't care what number it is, just get over here! &gt; me: ma'am, i'm more than happy to help you with this issue. i'll be able to help you better if we go over some deta-- &gt; end user: do i have to tell boss man and let him know you're not doing your job?! that's right, i know who your supervisor is, don't think i won't! at this point, i couldn't help but let out a small chuckle. &gt; end user: this isn't funny, get over here, now! i could hear her frustrated scream slightly fade away as she went to put the phone on the receiver. *-click-* boss man walks over to me. he heard the whole thing. &gt; boss man: you know, it's almost 5. you don't really *have* to take this... &gt; me: ehhh... i'll take a look anyhow, she sounds like she could use some help. &gt; boss man: you're a braver man than i, manyinterests. i'll be available if you need me. i gather as many details from the service call request as i can, grab basically every possible part i could possibly need and head out. luckily, the derp building is less than a 10 minute drive, should be an impressive response time. i arrive at the derp building. given the circumstances, i forgo the customary call on arrival, get my visitor badge and head for end user's office. i knock on the open door to signal my arrival. mistake. &gt; end user: ***jeeeeeezuss!!!*** are you trying to kill me?! i'm so dumbfounded i can't do anything but just look on in shock and awe. she is a hot mess, her fancy business attire is all but ruined. her office looked lake a tornado passed through. writing utensils scattered about, (*several* of which were broken in half) papers scattered everywhere, spilled cola... after staring at one another for a moment, i speak up. &gt; me: hi, end user? i'm here t-- &gt; end user: about time! she directs me to a laptop on her desk. &gt; me: so, i understand it won't power on, is that correct? &gt; end user: -annoyed- ***yes*** that's the reason i called! the damn thing is dead and it won't turn on, fix it. &gt; me: sure thing, ma'am, but first i'd like to ask you some ques-- &gt; end user: go on, ask. &gt; me: when did you first encounter the problem? have you had issues with your battery holding charge? issues with the charging port/cable? or anyth-- &gt; end user: no. i don't know. just fix it. &gt; me: okay, well i ju-- &gt; end user: well i just don't care! do you know who i am?! do you know what will happen if you can't get this working? do you realize how important this is?! i sat and listened to all the reasons why this needed to get done *now* for about 2 minutes straight. it doesn't sound like a long time, but it was. after she was done, i said nothing and just took a look at the computer to try and see if the led diagnostics work. before i even tried... it appeared as though end user tried jamming the charging cable into the jack violently... and missed... several times. there was obvious signs of damage to the plastic. hopefully it's just cosmetic. &gt; me: would you happen to have the ac adapter here? &gt; end user: the what?! &gt; me: the charging cable. she points to a drawer. i open it up to find the end connector has been damaged; bent at a pretty decent angle. i close the drawer. &gt; me: -hesitantly- erm... actually i brought one of my own along. i was surprised i didn't get an earful from end user for about 30 seconds while i fetched the ac adapter from box containing every part this computer has. little did i know, i was just in the eye of the storm. plugged my ac adapter in, the charging light flickers once after i jiggle the adapter in the loose socket. i get it in a sweet spot and am able to maintain power and turn the laptop on. end user begins to turn that frown upside down. the lcd is damaged. the display is completely useless. as policy dictates, because i discovered customer induced damage i had to inform end user that i would have to call the manufacturer company to check to see if her warranty covers "accidental" damage. i was really cutting her a break with jack damage, but a damaged lcd couldn't be ignored, or i'd get in trouble. &gt; me: ma'am, because i've discovered some physical damage on your laptop, i'm going to have to call into support to confirm your warranty covers accidental damage. &gt; end user: are you serious?! it's covered, just fix it. &gt; me: unfortunately ma'am, i can't until i call, that's our poli-- &gt; end user: i can't believe this! we'll see what *boss man* has to say about that! while i call in to confirm her warranty, end user goes and frantically dials the phone. i'm not even sure if she knows what number she's pressing. she definitely dialed more than 10 digits. when her call does not connect she lets out a blood-curdling scream and slams the phone down on the receiver as hard as she could, breaking the handset (pretty impressive, actually) end user was not, by any means, a dainty woman. at this point, end user just stares at the wall breathing heavily while i'm on the phone with support. her warranty does *not* cover accidental damage. i inform her that her warranty does not cover accidental damage and i would be unable to perform the repair unless she or someone else was able to sign the work order authorizing the repair and incurring the cost of the out-of-warranty repair for a new motherboard and lcd assembly. evidently, her scream from earlier had worried the few workers that were still left on the floor. security was summoned and arrived at end user's office. it was the guy who gave me my visitor badge. &gt; security man: *-very concerned-* is everything alright in here?????? i could not -- still cannot -- believe what happened next. end user breaks down screaming and in tears. after about 15 seconds of uncontrollable screaming and sobbing, end user lashes out... &gt; end user: he... *-sob-* ... he came in here and he ***attacked meeeeeeeeeeeeee*** *-sob-* i, i, i, i *-sob-* was j- j- just trying to help him fix it and he att**aaaaaaaaaaaaacked meeeeeeeeeeeee** *-uncontrollable crying/sobbing-* what. the. fuck. i am stunned. the security guy is also stunned. we exchange stunned expressions. &gt; end user: *-big gasp-* he slammed my comuutteerrr *-sob-* into my phoooooone! *-sob-* -crying continues- i couldn't believe what was happening. the security guard radios for the police to be called. fuck. fuck. fuck. seriously, what. the. fuck. the security guard instructs me to sit at a cubicle adjacent to the office while he addresses end user. i call up boss man and tell him what's going on. by the time i finish explaining to boss man what happened, the police had arrived on scene. i ask boss man to call my fiance and tell her what's happened. &gt; police man: sir, i need to ask you some questions. i'm frantic &gt; me: look, i have no idea why she's acting this way, the place was a mess when i got there, i swear i didn't lay a sing-- &gt; police man: calm down. i'm not worried about that. just tell me what happened. i recount my version of the events to the officer. there's now 4 officers on scene. after about an hour of waiting in a cubicle alone, boss man and my fiance show up. i'm almost in tears when i see them. (from the joy of seeing them, not so much from the distress, just thought i'd clarify &gt;_&gt;) i give my fiance a hug, trying to keep my composure. i thank boss man for coming and bringing my fiance. boss man can tell i'm real shook up. he did a good job of calming my nerves as we waited to hear back from the police. &gt; boss man: not quite how you expected to be earning overtime, is it? we laugh and talk for a while. another hour and a half later and police man comes back. he looks pissed. this worries me. &gt; police man: -sternly- manyinterests. &gt; me: yes? &gt; police man: i'm going to need you to fill out this affidavit describing what happened here today. you're not being charged and are free to go. ms. user is being charged with making a false report. relief finally came to me and my fiance, we hug. i begin filling out the affidavit so i can finally get the hell out of there. &gt; boss man: looks like you got your work cut out for you there. &gt; me: shouldn't take too long to put this down into paper. &gt; boss man: no, i mean, you're still going to have to service that laptop; you've been assigned to the call and on site for like 4 hours now, it's a high priority call! i stare blankly for a second. &gt; boss man: *aahhhhh* gotcha! just kidding - you can do it monday. i give him an amused/unamused face and then we say our goodbyes. i finish the affidavit and go home wishing i still delivered pizza for a living. we ordered pizza for dinner since my fiance didn't have a chance to cook. gave the delivery guy a big tip and told him not to quit his job. edit: thank you so much for gold! my first post in tfts! i am truly humbled.so i'm a relative newbie in the land of tech support - started around 6 months ago. still, that hasn't stopped me from running into some real airheads, though i will say that 95% of my users have been very, very good. sometimes they do stupid stuff, but most of the time they're apologetic when they've done something silly and are generally pleasant people to work with. except a few. so, about 3 months ago, $user puts in a ticket. she uses a personal laptop for work to remote access into the system, and she's forgotten her password. this also happens to be the admin account. she is locked out of her laptop. now, we're usually an agreeable lot. if someone had come to us and said that they had locked themselves out of their personal laptop and they weren't sure how to fix it, we'd help them out. probably say it might take us a little while since it'd be a 'spare time' sort of job, but we'd get it sorted for them. unless the person in question happens to be a gigantic tool. let me set the scene - $user comes up to my desk, five minutes after writing the ticket, carrying a laptop bag, and immediately i'm on red alert. i know for a fact this isn't a company-issued laptop, and i also know this woman is notorious for being a pain to deal with every time. my boss sits on the other side of my desk, facing me, so is easily in eyesight and earshot of everything that's happening. &gt; $user: hi, i've forgotten my password for the admin account on my laptop. do you have a record of it? immediately i wince. of course we don't have records of the non-company-issued laptops, but i have a feeling she isn't going to see it that way. &gt; $me: this is your personal laptop, correct? &gt; $user: yes. but i use it for work. so it's a work laptop. you should have the password. i wanted to point out how wrong that logic was, but decided not to anger the fairly senior member of staff. instead i just nodded sagely as though she was completely correct, and offered to help. &gt; $me: well, i'm afraid we don't. we might be able to- &gt; $user: well that's ridiculous! it's a work laptop, you should be able to get into it for me! you set it up! &gt; $me: well no, we set up the remote desktop application so you could do your work remotely, we didn't- &gt; $user: you should have tracked the admin password. i know this stuff, my husband works in it! at this point, i'm just sort of blankly staring at her wondering what i did to deserve this woman speaking to me as though i'm something stuck on the bottom of her shoe. being new, i was already being quailed into just doing as she said, but thankfully, my boss isn't so easily frightened. &gt; $boss: excuse me, just so i'm hearing this correctly - you have a personal laptop that you have forgotten the password for and you're saying this is our fault? and instead of asking politely for us to solve this problem for you, you're talking to my staff like dirt? he did not say dirt. at this point she gets a little meek, and places the laptop on his desk. &gt; $user: well ... can you get me in? i really need it. my boss looks at the laptop. he looks at me. he looks at the $user. he looks back to the laptop, and carefully pushes it back towards her. &gt; $boss: your husband works in it right? i'm sure he can sort this out for you. bye bye. to this day i don't think her 'it husband' has got into her laptop. edit: well this blew up while i was asleep. for all those talking about a fix, we certainly could have got her in. we didn't want to. and yes, my boss is awesome, as are the rest of my coworkers. and thank you for my first gold.this tale comes from many moons ago when i worked it at a college. this was originally going to be a reply to a comment on another story but it wound up being huge, so i'll submit a new post instead. i was doing the rounds one day in the admin block, only to find an elderly woman leaning right across her desk squinting at a 17" crt. i thought she must have been an old hag at first, and that was her punishment for upsetting someone in it, but i still felt bad for her and asked if she would like me to at least make her font bigger so she could read it from her chair. she turned out to be one of the nicest people that worked there and she never submitted any tickets for anything because she didn't want to be any trouble , so i asked my manager if i could take 2 spare monitors over to her desk to assist her work (besides, leaning across like that all day can't be good for you). i found 2 24" lcd monitors (biggest available at the time) and took them over to her desk and showed her how to easily switch between monitors for multitasking and window management. i left the office feeling good for having made such a difference to someone's job and making things much easier for her, even though it was such a simple task, then i got back to my pc to update the job on the system, only to find a ticket submitted from the admin block. i knew the username well, she always submitted priority one tickets for her audio not working (hurry! you must go unmute her audio!) or her mouse stopped working (better go plug it back in, proto!) turns out her 23" monitors weren't big enough, not now someone in the office had 24" monitors! of course, priority 1. i had the pleasure of informing her that we had none left in our asset stock and our next asset order wasn't for another 3 months, so she would have to wait for the order to come through. a week later, i was doing the rounds again and i saw she had switched monitors with the elderly woman! not on my watch! i went back to my office to fetch my tools and the swiveling monitor bracket that was taking up my limited space in the storage room, glad to get rid of it. i made my way back and began drilling and screwing, making sure this bracket was fully secured, then began the monitor transfer, removing the stand so they were completely useless without the whole bracket. as the last cable was being plugged in, the monitor thief returned and demanded to know what i was doing. &amp;gt;me: i'm returning these monitors to the machine they're assigned to. &amp;gt;her: you can't do that! she doesn't even need monitors that big anyway! &amp;gt;me: actually, i have to, the asset tags are assigned to that machine, so they must stay where they are for security purposes. &amp;gt;her: what a load of bullshit! don't try pulling that on me, i'll be seeing you manager as soon as i'm done here! you just wait! &amp;gt;ceo: what's all the yelling out here? &amp;gt;her: he took my monitors! &amp;gt;ceo: what are those on your desk? &amp;gt;her: ... &amp;gt;me: as i was just explaining, the monitors i've just mounted on this bracket are assigned to this machine, so she's not to take them again, which is why they're now a permanent feature of this desk. &amp;gt;ceo: .... didn't we have this conversation a few months ago? i told you before to stop helping yourself to all the office equipment because it makes for unnecessary hunting down of asset tags and updating of locations when we have our monthly audits. &amp;gt;her: .... yes sir. i then took the opportunity to remind her the ticket system is not to be abused and if she submits a priority 1 for something like plugging in a mouse again, i'll be setting up a script that automatically sets her to priority 5. ceo had a good chuckle and wandered off, shaking his head, while i left out the opposite door, feeling a burning in my back as she stared daggers at me. edit: wow, this was more popular than i thought it would be. i'll have to dig into the deep recesses of my mind and bring you guys another story of the same calibre. short, but i'm sure many of you have had the same or a similar experience. very brief background. i work for a company who does it support for businesses and schools, both on site and remote work. this stemmed from a user logging tickets on our fault logging system that started off reasonably pleasant, but quickly became pretty ridiculous. it then led to this phonecall to my boss. &gt;user: since *billerss* attended site and installed the new projector, my internet at home has not been working. i want someone to come to my house and resolve this issue, free of charge. &gt;my boss: obviously this is not related as the two are in no way linked at all- **user interupted** &gt;user: of course they are all linked they are all computers. how can you be serious. you need to resolve this issue. &gt;my boss: unfortunately that is not our issue and we have are not obligated to provide free home support. i can maybe help you through some possible fixes? &gt;user: but you're it..? all it is supported by our contract. it was at this point my boss proceeded to sit them down and discuss what is and isn't in their contract. safe to say that user hasn't called again. 9 years ago i was neck deep in a project when i get a frantic call from a customer representative. our normal mortgage rep was on vacation so they threw $cuterep in the deep end of mortgage lending despite no training. &gt;cuterep: *crying* i was doing the paperwork for a home equity loan, and i don't know what i did but all the documents are gone and they're going to fire me and i'll have to go work at mcdonald's or start stripping and... &gt;me: well don't go buy pasties yet. let me take a look. i go over, but i'll be damned if she didn't manage to delete all of the mortgage lending templates. &gt;me: give me an hour, and i'll see what i can do. i had to drive 30 minutes to where we stored our offsite backup tapes. i get back, throw the tape in, and about 10 minutes later have everything recovered. &gt;me: ok, double check but everything should be back out there now. wait...why are you still crying? &gt;$cuterep: it's just been a really stressful week, and i just knew i'd messed up really bad. thank you so much, harp, for everything. *sniff* would you like to come to my birthday party this weekend? 9 years later we're married and have a 6 year old girl. so always remember to have good backups, and don't judge a user from your first impression. they may just go and turn out to be a smart, funny, chill person. edit: whoa, this blew up. after we started dating a few weeks later she pretty much just moved into my apartment. we dated and worked together for about 2 years, and on election night 2008 she took a pregnancy test before going out with her friends for her birthday. we have a nepotism policy at work that management ended up re-writing for situations like this. we decided she would resign after her maternity leave was up (side note - i still appreciate work for letting her stay on and pay her maternity leave when they didn't have to). 18 months after our daughter was born $cuterep and i eloped in vegas. a year and a half later we bought a house, and we're still in love and happy together. my very first job was as the help desk for a company of 400+ employees. my "office" was literally a converted closet in the back corner of the building, and my entire purpose was to sit there and wait for someone to call me so i could assist them with a technical issue. when i first started i was paranoid of doing anything wrong which could get me fired, so i didn't even use the computer to browse the internet. i just sat there each day, staring at a phone, waiting for someone to call for technical help. unbeknownst to me, the company occasionally had a "surprise half-day". on a random friday, the ceo would email the company informing everyone they could leave at noon and start their weekend early. unfortunately, since i was new i had not been added to the "_all" mailing list and was not informed of this occasion. and no one thought to check on the help desk kid sitting in the back closet to make sure he knew to leave early. so my first "surprise half-day" was spent sitting in a closet, alone, staring at a desk phone, diligently waiting for a call from someone... anyone... when the entire company had left 4 hours earlier. i only realized something was amiss when i walked to my car at the end of the day and the entire parking lot was empty to add salt to my wounds, my dad also worked at the company at the time. when i arrived home my dad just asked "what took you so long?". thanks dad. tldr; started job as help desk, sat alone in a closet staring at a phone, was not informed that the entire company left early my career in it is relatively young. prior to this i made lattes and dealt with day to day abuse from cranky yuppies. nothing has really changed, honestly. i got a call from my boss the other day. &gt;"hey hrdwrsftwrmlwr, one of our new clients is opening an office and they're going with imacs. you're familiar with macs, right?" ah shit. i know exactly where this is going. &gt;"yeah. why, what's up?" &gt;"well, you're kinda the only one at the office who knows them. i haven't touched a mac since the first gen imacs, so i'm gonna send you out to set things up." ahh yes. the ol' "putting os x on the resume coming to bite me in the ass". mind you, i do know os x. better than i know windows at this point, to be fair. because that's what i use at home, and have since 2003. so, seeing as it's part of my skill set, i head 40 miles out to do their setup. upon arrival, i'm greeted by the owner of this particular company. &gt;"so, we bought 20 new imacs since they're the best computer out there. shit. &gt;"and i just need to know this is going to run all of the software we use at our other offices. shit. &gt;"it's kinda mission critical these all play nice with our windows machines and do what they do. shit. &gt;"in fact, is it possible to just install windows 7 on all of them?" i'm flabbergasted. this guy. this fucking guy. he bought 20 27" imacs. he spent $3,000 **per machine** for a tb of flash storage and 16gb of memory. and he wants me to basically completely remove any reason for having purchased macs. so i stood there for a second and thought "you know what? i'm not gonna argue with him. i'm just going to sit here with my head buried in my hands and rub my eyes and think about my life choices. i'm going to stop at starbucks on the way home, and ask for my old job back and just forget about all of this tomfoolery." &gt;"yeah, actually we can do that, but you're going to have to buy windows licenses for them. that's gonna run you around $2k. plus the time it's going to take to do the installs and what have you, you will probably go over budget." &gt;"i don't care, these are the best computers money can buy and i want windows." &gt;"alright. i'll have to make a couple calls really quick." and i did. and we got it all sorted out. and the better part of two days was spent loading the machines with windows and the boot camp software. aside from the resolution maxing out at 4k, they were coming out great. and then another request from the owner. &gt;"hey, can you make these *look* like macs? they don't look like macs. they look like windows. i don't want our clients to think we're using windows." this office isn't a client facing office. no one but the employees come in here. there isn't a single client that is going to see these machines. ever. for any reason. so i'm going to try my best to convince him this is a bad idea, because i am a rookie and that's what we do best. try to reason with people. people that buy $3,000 machines to run office and a handful of other applications. (also i don't feel like dealing with the inevitable calls and complaints from skinning these things, but that's neither here nor there) &gt;"well, any unnecessary skins or overlays might affect the stability and performance of the machines. it'd be best to leave it as it is." &gt;"these are the best computers money can buy, they're not going to be affected at all." stop. using. that. phrase. &gt;"it's not about the machines, it's about the software. your programs won't run ~~properly~~ with those skins installed." ah, yes. tell him the things won't run. then he has no option. &gt;"well, can't you program one that will work? you're an it guy, you have to know how to program this stuff!" i don't. i have no fucking clue how to do what he's asking of me, and i don't want to touch it with a ten foot pole. &gt;"i'm sorry but that's a bit outside my skill set. you'd have to contact a programmer to do it specifically for what you need." &gt;"don't you have one at your company?" &gt;"no, unfortunately we don't have any programmers on staff that do this sort of thing." &gt;"well then ask them! someone has to know how!" so i step into the other room and call one of our programmers. &gt;"hey $chiefprogrammer, the windows imac guy wants a mac skin on these things." &gt;"that guy is insane. his last lab was a nightmare. he kept going on about buying the 'best machines money can buy' and wouldn't shut up about how much money he spent on the workstations." &gt;"so, what do i do now?" &gt;"put him on the phone." there is a couple minutes of back and forth between the owner and the programmer. he hands the phone back to me. &gt;"your programmer said it would cost a half million to write that program and take at least a year to deliver." what. that's not...actually that was not a bad move. &gt;"yeah, it creates some serious compatibility issues. i mean, it could ruin these machines if it's not done properly." &gt;"well i'm not paying that much or waiting that long! no one sees these machines other than the employees anyway! that's absolutely fucking ridiculous. if apple can make them look like macs i don't see why you can't too." and that was that. he went back to his office, i finished up with cable management and the other housekeeping and headed back to our office, where i promptly went into $chiefprogrammer's office. &gt;"you told him $500k and a year for that?" &gt;"the only language this guy talks is money. you have to reason with people in that sense sometimes. just throw outrageous figures and they accept the limitations. this guy just needed a *really* outrageous figure." tl;dr: programmer speaks many languages, even user. **edit: for all of you suggesting a vm, don't worry, it was suggested. but "that's not real windows. it won't work with our software" trumped any other suggestion i had.** in my [last story]( we met the owner of a particular restaurant where i used to work. a particular individual who had a particular aversion to spending a single penny on anything that she didn't deem absolutely necessary -- and her definition of "necessary" was very, very skewed. in that story the cat was let out of the bag that i was "good with computers," so henceforth i became the computer guy and i got tasked with looking at anything vaguely electronic in the restaurant. this wasn't as bad as it sounded, despite our antiquated point-of-sale and backend software running on aging (and failing!) hardware. which, as previously explained, would no longer be serviced by the original vendor after the owner called them up and cussed them out over the terms of the service contract, claiming they were "ripping her off." this also meant that other folks who worked at the restaurant brought me stuff to fix. this was during the recession, maybe two years or so after the iphone had been released and during the start of the smartphone boom. so i got brought a lot of phones, laptops, netbooks, and sometimes even desktop machines to fix. i worked up a standardized rate for my services so everyone got the same fair deal and i got paid. the kitchen staff in particular were always especially appreciative and had were happy to pay me for my trouble. but then. one day there was a third computer on our counter. our usual two point-of-sale machines, of course, including the one which was still running with an espresso tumbler full of pennies weighing down its northbridge heat sink. that computer, and the owner's refusal to replace or repair it properly, is where we left of last time. but next to it was a swanky all-in-one touchscreen terminal running a demo of a new pos package. be still my heart! an actual monetary investment? i almost couldn't believe it. but then the inevitable happened. &gt;"two thousand dollars!" the owner shrieked to no one in particular as she stormed through the dining room one day. she had a freshly torn open envelope in her hand, which she thew into the cashiers' wastebasket on her way past. i surreptitiously took it and found it was an installation estimate from the vendor who supplied the new pos terminal. it had a new printer with it as well, presumably which would replace our stone age kitchen ticket printers. i noticed it was networked, and plugged into our hub with an ethernet cable rather than a parallel cable. &gt;"two thousand dollars for a few wires!" she continued to rant. "we can do it ourselves!" she poked me in the chest as she said this. &gt;"i'm going to go out on a limb and assume that by 'we' you mean 'me,'" i said. &gt;"of course! you're the computer guy, right?" &gt;"$40 an hour," i said nonchalantly as possible. &gt;"what?" she bellowed. "beyond ridiculous! i already pay you." &gt;"barely," i said. "i work for tips. you pay me $3 an hour. if i'm climbing around in the rafters stringing cables all over the place, that's way outside my job description. and i'm not making any tips while i'm doing it. you want skilled work, you pay skilled rates. just like the kitchen staff does. if you want me to do it when i'm on my shift i'm staying clocked in, too. if you don't want to pay me twice i'll do it on my next day off." &gt;"fine! whatever! do it tomorrow!" &gt;"after we close, or what?" i asked. &gt;she was turning increasingly crimson. "no, right when we open." i should point out that the entire kitchen, which is where all the cables and printers had to go, had a drop ceiling from the '70's over it. all the existing cables went through the ceiling, since the floor was a concrete slab. anything i touched up there would trigger a dust-and-plaster blizzard. &gt;"bad plan," i tried to explain. "you're going to get dust and god knows what else all over an operating kitchen." &gt;"i don't care! i'm not coming in early just for wires!" she stormed off. well, the business license ain't in my name, lady. see if i care if a health inspector shows up when i'm elbow deep in 40 year old drop tiles right over your grill. i bought a big ol' spool of cat5 (and got chewed out for the expense) and a box of rj45 cable ends ("why can't we reuse the ones from our old cables?") and right at opening the next morning i got to work. all told it took me three hours to make six cable drops because i had to keep working around the cooks. if i weren't doing it in a running kitchen i could have finished in half the time. but at the end of the day i pocketed $120 and kept the rest of the cat5. i forgot to tell you the rationale behind getting the new system in the first place, though. at least as the owner explained to me, she was convinced money was disappearing from the tills and employees were stealing it. our old pos system was set up to require manager overrides out the wazoo for pretty much everything, including changing already printed orders for any reason and opening the till without the key... which was frequently missing. the owner had the only override code and she was rarely there, so her code was an open secret. presumably since she canceled the service contract with the vendor of the old system she was unable to -- or unable to get help with -- changing anyone else's user permissions. the new system was going to solve *all* of our problems. it will stop money from getting filched from the till, it will solve our ingredient waste, it'll scrub the bathroom floor, whatever. i told her in no uncertain terms this was nuts. but i imagine she'd painted herself into a corner by pissing off the old system's vendor. for what it's worth, the guys from the new pos company spent a lot of time customizing the system to meet our -- or rather *her* perceived -- needs. this included setting up our menu in the system, all the accounting stuff, automatic mapping of our delivery area, the whole nine yards. this system also supported newfangled (for the time) rfid keys which could be used in lieu of passwords. i imagine this made the owner's little ears perk up most of all, since it meant she could just keep her key with her and micromanage to her heart's content without anyone being able to shoulder surf her password. the demo terminal was kept on the counter for a few weeks and we were able to play with it, make practice orders, and also provide feedback to the vendor to help with the setup. so far, so good. i asked the owner when the new system was going to be installed, figuring i'd have to be on hand to help. she refused to tell me. i found out why on a sunday morning about a month later. i arrived at the restaurant a little before opening because the owner had gone on vacation back to greece for two weeks. her notoriously unreliable maintenance guy and second-in-command was predictably still in bed hung over (guess who was actually doing the stealing, by the way) and thus no one else could open. still a little foggy from working until close the night before, i was pleasantly surprised, initially, to find that all of our old computers and printers were gone and replaced with swanky new touchscreen terminals and the new network printers. i guess they must have come in after closing last night with the owner and set everything up? how kind of her to tell me. that surprise became much less pleasant when i booted up one of the machines to discover that it was blank. as in, it had the software installed but it hadn't been configured. all of that work we did with the vendor on the demo terminal? not apparent. our menu, blank. our map, blank. our user list, empty. except for one user, with the owner's initials. grand. i said a very naughty word and went to the supply closet to see if our old computers were there. of course they were gone. i phoned the owner. no response. i left her a voicemail, employing a few choice words. i was just about ready to drive downtown or wherever it was to the vendor's office and strangle somebody, but i had a restaurant to open. my cashiers were starting to show up now, and we had a really big problem. so, having to take orders by hand on paper is not technically the end of the universe. occasionally we had to do it during, for instance, power outages and so forth (of course the owner had us working and cooking by flashlight rather than closing temporarily). but a bigger problem was that *everything* went through the system. this was true with our old system as well. it was our punch clock for tracking employees hours, and i wasn't going to trust that to paper because the owner was already notorious for wage theft and looking for any excuse to cheat people out of pay. our inventory of ingredients and purchases from vendors was tracked through it, our deliveries tracked and assigned to specific drivers, etc. even our credit cards were processed through the system. in other words, we were hosed. and since we didn't open until well into lunchtime on sundays, i already had customers queuing up at the door. suddenly a lot of eyeballs were on me. &gt;"what are we supposed to do?" our head cashier asked me. &gt;"take orders on paper," i said. "cash only. use the old carbon copy pads we have under the counters. just use the damn computers as calculators for now. anybody needs to clock in or out, see me. i'll see what i can do about this." what would i do about this? i tried the owner's phone again and got nothing. perhaps stupidly, i did not have any contact info for the new system's vendor because the owner was being so secretive with me. i started wishing i kept that estimate she threw away. all the times she met with the vendor it was behind closed doors with... our maintenance guy. needless to say, he was not answering his phone. i singled out our second most reliable driver. &gt;"you! go to bob's house and wake his punk ass up." (i'm calling him bob on account of how that's his name.) &gt;in his best darth vader impersonation my driver said, "find him and bring him to me..." so, the rfid keyfobs the new system used could also be overridden with a password. on a lark i tried the owner's old password, which unsurprisingly didn't work. on the third attempt i got in, though. youngest daughter's birthday... backwards. the passwords were numeric only, and since the touch screen terminals didn't have keyboards this was obvious enough because when you were prompted for a password it only gave you a number pad. it was at least an hour before my driver managed to drag bob, red-eyed and hung over, back to the restaurant. in the meantime, business worked like this: i, using the owner's admin account, holding a paper copy of our menu in one hand, added things to the system's menu in the order they were needed as customers ordered them. then one of the cashiers, on the other terminal, would enter the order and it'd print in the kitchen. in the scant seconds between orders i managed to set up pretty much everybody with an employee login and get them clocked in. and using the owner's manager override ability, edit their time card to the correct time. i figured as soon as i had a chance to breathe after lunch rush i'd go through and add in anything we missed on the menu and figure out how to get the credit card processing working. so eventually bob was brought before me, looking very miserable. i didn't even have to ask him the question. &gt;"so, the owner flipped out about paying the new computer guys for the service contract," he said, openly lighting a cigarette right there behind the counter. "but she didn't want to give back the new computers. so they said they'll take back all the set up stuff they did, and she said she didn't need them anyway, so they left." &gt;"and i was supposed to learn this when?" i asked. he just shrugged, and slouched off to the back room. i was later able to confirm the story from the vendor after i got their contact info from bob. the support guy i talked to there was apologetic and very reasonable about the whole thing, and once he figured out he was dealing with me and not the owner he even went a bit above the call of duty and helped me with getting our credit card processing set up. but i can understand the vendor's viewpoint... no pay, no service. no ticket, no shirt. by the end of the day i was able to get the system fully set up, get everyone put in the payroll system and clocking in and out, and get the ingredient inventory tracking working. i didn't get a phone call from the owner until the next day. obviously i had to give her a brief rundown of what i was able to accomplish. as soon as it dawned on her that i'd done many things like setting up new users which she was promised could only be done by an administrator (her) she went ballistic. never mind all the other problems that this ill-conceived plan of hers caused, her only concern was having complete and total control of the system while everyone else had none. &gt;"you *hacked* my system?!" she shrieked at me through the phone. &gt;"no," i said, "i saved your business." i hung up on her.so i am an i.t specialist at a small company and we often get samples of furniture that is to be shown to the directors via a piece of software that was created in house before i started working there. the program simply allows for someone (me) to add an image of the sample and then the program will send an email to the director and tell them to view the image on the program. it's tedious but only has to be done every so often. so we just got some new samples into the office, and before i got chance to take a picture and upload it to the program, the office manager send a picture of them to one of the directors via text. he didn't tell me about doing this, he simply did it. when i uploaded the images to the program and the director got an email, i was asked to bring the samples to his house. i started to move the samples at which point the office manager realised what has happened and proceeded to explode at me, telling me this program i made was useless and undermining his work even though i didn't make it. he told me to take the samples to the director and never come back because i was fired. i told the director this when i got to his house, and i also told him how the office manager had spent 3 hours out of the office to buy a football shirt. the director looked furious, told me to go back to the office and he would follow, he went in before me and is now currently down the hall screaming at the office manager while i type this up. feels good. tl;dr: office manager fires me over program i didn't make, he gets a royal bollocking from director for trying to fire me and also for being out of the office for 3 hours to buy a football shirt. **update 1** first of all i'm so shocked at how much this has blown up! may not be considered blown up for some but this now has more up votes than all of my other posts combined! a lot of you have been saying to start logging everything/get dirt on the manager, and i've been logging what's been going on since. i've also just managed to get access to his emails so i can start to mess with him to take his mind of me if i need to. so far what he has done is just ask me stupid things like, 'why is my laptop not turning on?' when it's out of battery and not plugged in. i tell him this and he tuts like it wasn't the correct answer. more to come soon. **update 2** yes i am british. **update 3** so i took your guys advice and scrapped the whole going through his emails thing. he also seems to be being friendly with me. i was stuck in edinburgh yesterday and couldn't get back to work in manchester and he's been cracking jokes about it.**user**: i'm locked out **me**: ok, what's your name? **user**: jane b. *sees multiple jane b's on the system* **me**: what's the b stand for? **user**: ... i don't know what you mean. it finally happened. i literally asked a user their name and they said "i don't know". this is a tale about bravery. bravery in the face of execution. bravery of those small few hold-outs that serve their caustic masters so that they can feed themselves, their wives and their children. those men and women who listened, understood and resolved an issue of monstrous proportions. i am a computer scientist. i am a software engineer. i am an electrical engineer. i have designed cpu's, written os's, implemented network stacks and developed system libraries. i am a guru. my disciples think i am some kind of motherfucking magician. in this story, i am user. for a year i had comcast and lived in a run down apartment in oakland. for six months i had an unusable connection between the hours of 4pm and 9pm. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- circa 2003. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- week 1 saturday, calling regarding ridiculous ping to the outside world (400ms+). after 45 minutes of music. **tech 1**: &lt;speech&gt; **me**: &lt;account info&gt; **tech 1**: how can i help you? **me**: i have been having a very high ping to the internet after about 4pm till about 9pm everyday since i got your service installed. i have tried restarting the modem, the router and my computer. **tech 1**: please restart your computer. **me**: ok. but, i have already done that. [i actually had restarted my computer, but i did it again anyways.] **tech 1**: i understand but we need to make sure that this doesn't fix it. **me**: well, i get these high pings from all five of my computers, not just the one i am working on right now. **tech 1**: um, how do you have five computers using the internet? **me**: with my router. **tech 1**: uh... a what? **me**: a router. **tech 1**: sir, we don't support non-standard equipment. **me**: excuse me? 10 more minutes goes by as i disconnect my router, directly connect my computer to the router and power cycle the modem twice such that my pc's mac address would get registered with their system(relevant). the high ping remains and i eventually get the tech to say the magic words: **tech 1**: it looks like we are going to have to send out somebody. **me**: thank you. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- next monday the tech arrives and we go down to the drop. i had not been present for the installation. the drop was in a locked basement inside of a locked cabinet, both of which will be relevant later. the /r/cablefail was truly astonishing. the single rg6 line that came in from the street was split 48 times. none of the lines were labeled. there were 9 splitters involved. we spent the first 15 minutes yelling at each-other, 4th floor window to exterior basement door, to figure out which line was mine through the process of disconnecting one connection at a time. mine ended up being the forth split down. rj6-&gt;6way-&gt;4way-&gt;3way-&gt;3way-&gt; me, which i had split again with a 2way. one for cable, one for internet. **me**: well, what can we do about it? **onsite tech 1**: i dont know. **me**: it works in the morning and late at night. **onsite tech 1**: it is probably because when people get home in the evening they turn on their tv/internet and you are getting interference. **me**: so, what can we do about it? the onsite tech closes and locks the cabinet. **onsite tech 1**: nothing. it is a wiring issue on the premises. we are not responsible. talk to your landlord. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- my landlord was more or less a slum lord (oakland). the building was falling apart and was in serious need of repair. the landlord, to put it mildly, didn't care. i was frustrated. by the time i got done playing phone tag with my worthless piece of shit of a landlord i had decided that i needed to talk to comcast again. week 3, thursday. still have a ping of 400ms. after 30 minutes of elevator music. 2:00pm. **tech 2**: &lt;intro&gt; what can i help you with? **me**: i have had a very high ping to the outside world between the hours of 4pm till 9pm rendering my internet unusable. i am interested in obtaining a partial refund for the time. **tech 2**: i am sorry to hear that sir. would you please reboot your computer? **me**: this is not an issue with my computer. comcast does not have a large enough drop for the apartment building i am in. **tech 2**: i am sorry to hear that sir. we need to go through these basic troubleshooting steps to see if we can alleviate the issue. for the next twenty minutes i play repair man. eventually the tech once again says the magic words. **me**: can i schedule the tech to come between 4pm and 9pm? **tech 2**: very well sir. you will have to wait until next thursday if that is the time slot you want. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- week 4, thursday. onsite tech 2 arrives around 4:30pm. perfect. after explaining the issue and what the last tech had said he checked the signal in my apartment. **onsite tech 2**: lets go look at the box downstairs. after unlocking the basement and the cabinet he lets out a low whistle. **onsite tech 2**: which one is yours? **me**: this one. i point at the line that goes to my apartment. **onsite tech 2**: alright, so here is the issue. you have way too many splitters between your line and the drop coming in. i am going to replace the ends on your line to ensure we can get the best possible connection and then i am going to check the pole. we can run a new drop but that could take up to six months. at this point the tech looks at me. **onsite tech 2**: i am not allowed to reorder these splitters because they are the owners property and other customers utilize these lines. and now i realize he is staring deep into my soul. **onsite tech 2**: the customers with these [things]( do not have internet and only subscribe to basic tv. here he gestures to several of the lines. he lets his hand come to rest on a filtered line. i blink. it is connected directly to the first splitter. **onsite tech 2**: they require much less signal. it is going to take me 5 minutes with my 7/16 wrench and crimps to replace this tip. then i will be on the pole for twenty minutes. then i will come back to your apartment to check your signal again. i am sorry but i am **not** fixing this for you. i simply **can't**. i blink again. twice actually. the tech turns his back on me and starts removing my line from the splitter to replace the tip. i back out the basement door and bolt upstairs. i pull out my wrench set and grab my 7/16. i run back downstairs just as the tech leaves the basement. he doesn't close the door. i wait until he walks out the front gate. inside the basement i find the cabinet is closed but unlocked. quick, quick, quick i am taking my line and switching it with the filtered line on the first splitter. after everything is tight i close the cabinet and run back upstairs. the tech, true to his word, showed up at my door twenty five minutes after this all started. i had already reset my modem and had a 15ms ping to google. success. after testing, my line ran with acceptable numbers. **onsite tech 2**: i am glad that replacing the tip on your line improved the signal to such an extent. i am going to go lock up the cabinet now. and he was gone into the night. i really, honestly, truly wish that this was the last i would have to see him. but it wasn't. no. it can never be simple with comcast. my connection had improved considerably. a vast majority of the time i was receiving my advertised speed. i could download/upload/torrent to my hearts content. the only problem i had was when i would attempt to connect to a server in southern california. you see, anytime between roughly 4pm and 9pm i would have a ping of 200+ms to any server south of san jose. this wouldn't normally be a problem for average web browsing, but i also happen to be a gamer. and for online gamers, latency can be the difference between life and death. how did i know that the problem was in san jose? traceroutes. tons of them. automatically generated every minute, every hour, every day. the issue appeared to be that the peering between comcast and level 3 in san jose consisted of two 56k modems and smoke signals. graphs of average latency times over the course of the day showed two bumps. a small one in the morning as people woke up for coffee and internet and a longer one in the evening when people got off of work and decided it was time for a good wanking. i decided to do comparisons with some friends from around the bay area. apparently comcast routed everything from the entire bay area through that l3 peering arrangement in san jose. this was confirmed by onsite tech 2, the third time i met him. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- week 7 friday. 5pm. cannot ~~play~~ ~~win~~ enjoy any matches due to higher than average pings. 30 minutes of music. **tech 3**: &lt;intro&gt; how can i help you? **me**: i have an issue where when i connect to some servers south of san jose i get high pings and it is difficult to enjoy my games at those pings. it is only during high traffic times and i have the traceroutes that describe the issue. **tech 3**: will you please restart your computer. **me**: look, i know what the issue is. it is not with my computer i can demonstrate that it is a problem with comcast's network. **tech 3**: i am sorry sir, but we must go through these steps to ensure that it is not your equipment. often times restarting your computer will fix many problems. **me**: i know. i have restarted my computer many times. trust me. i have traceroutes that identify the issue. **tech 3**: you have what? **me**: traceroutes. **tech 3**: uhh... i am going to elevate you to tier 2. 15 minutes of music. **tech 4**: &lt;intro&gt; how can i help you? **me**: &lt;explains the situation&gt; **tech 4**: can you please restart your computer. **me**: no. look. i have traceroutes that identify the issue. &lt;explains about san jose&gt; **tech 4**: sir, after reviewing the network status board it does not appear that there are any issues on our network. this is most likely an issue on your end. **me**: look, can i send you the traceroutes? **tech 4**: the what? **me**: &lt;growling&gt; traceroutes. they show the path that your connection travels between your computer and the server you are attempting to reach. **tech 4**: ... i am going to transfer you to another tech. please hold. 30 seconds of music. **tech 5**: &lt;intro&gt; how can i help you? **me**: i have traceroutes that identify a connection between the comcast network and level 3 in san jose as the source of an exceptionally high ping that makes it difficult to play games online. **tech 5**: interesting... i am going to send a tech out to your location to see if it is in relation to your earlier support tickets. **me**: ... i can plainly see that i get a sub 10ms ping to everywhere else in your network before the san jose hop. **tech 5**: how about monday at 10am? **me**: ... really? **tech 5**: yes. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- week 8, monday, 10am. onsite tech 2 shows up and smiles at me. i try to tell him everything that is going on. **onsite tech 2**: let's go down and look at your line again. i am worried he is going to say something about the fact that i moved my line. he opens up the cabinet and smirks. **onsite tech 2**: i *forgot* which one was your line. which one is it? i identify my moved line. he comments on the fact that it seems to be in an advantageous position and shouldn't be the issue. at this point he says he is going to go up on the pole and do some monitoring. for the next two hours his van sits outside the apartment complex. he comes back and informs me that he will be unable to fix the issue at this time because he cannot identify anything other than the fact that the lines in this area are old and need to be replaced. he said that might happen within the next two to ten years. as he leaves, **onsite tech 2**: keep calling. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- for the next two weeks i call every other day and get the run around. they are refusing to offer to send a tech out because the last report identified no issues. i am not willing to pay the eighty dollars to have a tech come out if i request it. every time they insist that the network is operating normally and does not have any issues. finally in the middle of week 11 i get escalated and after what feels like the hundredth time they tell me everything is fine. **me**: the fuck it is. i can prove it isn't. **tech #20 something**: i am going to transfer you. **me**: to who? nobody you transfer me to listens to what i have to say or understands what i am telling ... &lt;immediately music cuts me off&gt; 15 minutes of music later tech 5 answers the phone. **tech 5**: &lt;intro&gt; how can i help you? **me**: &lt;i attempt to explain everything again&gt; **tech 5**: we are going to send out the field tech again. **me**: again? this isn't going to fix it. **tech 5**: i know. **me**: what? **tech 5**: after he is done, call this number ###-####. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- week 12, monday, 4pm. onsite tech #2 shows up. we talk. he goes up on the pole. he sits in his van. he wanders around the neighborhood and checks various other drops. eventually he comes back to my door. **onsite tech 2**: were oversold. **me**: how much? **onsite tech 2**: all of it. **me**: what? **onsite tech 2**: bay area. all of it. six months until the money people will even talk about buying more bandwidth. **me**: six months? **onsite tech 2**: yup. **me**: why, when it impacts everyone? **onsite tech 2**: most people never notice. most people don't care. **me**: what can i do about it? **onsite tech 2**: keep calling. **me**: why? **onsite tech 2**: they only spend money to fix things if there are enough calls logged about an issue. the number tech 5 gave to me turned out to be the number to his line. for the next two months i would call him every week and onsite tech 2 would come out and sit in his van for two to three hours. then one day the call went a little differently. **tech 5**: &lt;intro&gt;. how may i help you. **me**: i am still having the same problem with the high latency out of san jose. **tech 5**: i am **not** going to help you with this. **me**: excuse me? **tech 5**: the network is *working* as it is *intended*. **me**: uh... **tech 5**: we do not officially support 3rd party devices like your router. &lt;he has never brought this up before&gt; **me**: um... why not? &lt;getting suspicious&gt; **tech 5**: 3rd party devices like yours are able to change their mac addresses and we need to know that your mac address will not change to verify that you are the correct customer. &lt;this is obviously bullshit... but why?&gt; **me**: i don't understand, but ok... what should i do about this issue with .. &lt;he cuts me off&gt; **tech 5**: i am **not** going to do anything to address this. the network is working as *intended*. &lt;someone must be listening into the conversation.&gt; **me**: ok. **tech 5**: please call the help line at 1-800-###-#### if your issues persist. &lt;and the line goes dead. not like he hung up, just dead.&gt; 10 to 15 seconds later there is a dial-tone. i check my traceroute logs. just about 30 minutes before my call i see that my connection is no longer being routed through san jose. i have 10-30ms pings to every server i can try. tl;dr isp's are corporations driven by greed but there are always technicians at these institutions who know what they are doing. they know the situation is fucked up. they know the ridiculousness of the problem. sometimes a problem is a problem because of the poor ethics of the people in the suits. sometimes good techs have to work at scummy corporations to feed their families&lt;i intentionally left this out for anonymity purposes&gt;. edit: formatting. sorry, first post to reddit. edit 2: thank you to everyone. a big thank you to the people who gave me reddit gold.this one happened about a month into my first it gig for a major company (was freelance before). i'm visiting the hq from my branch office to meet the rest of the team for the first time and get the full training on the co's systems. on my last night before my flight back home, i get one of those *'you're new, so lets see what you do with a crazy call'* requests from my super. i go upstairs, and there is this lady shouting about how she just can't stand to have other people touching *her* computer. she is having such a meltdown that she's pretty much driven all of her fellow humans &gt;10 yds away, and they are keeping their distance (oh, dear). i attempt to get a description of what happened; from her telling another tech had been to her desk earlier that day and had 'erased all her files'. i look at him (poor guy keeping a safe distance with with all the other refugees) and ask him what he did. apparently he had originally been called because her pc was slow; he had looked around and found the usual monster stash of temporary files, registry errors- you know, the stuff ccleaner knocks out with minimal fuss. he had also noticed that her recycle bin was bloated with some 11 gb worth of files (you probably see where we're going by now). so he, like any tech confronted by that much bloat, emptied it. turns out the lady had been *'saving'* her work by *hitting the delete button*. upon being asked why the hell she thought that was a sound strategy for saving important documents (in nicer language of course), she said "well, it's the easiest way to do it- i only need to hit one button, i know where they end up, and i knew i could always get them back!!!". i started to explain to her that doing that was like parking your car in a scrap yard and then getting miffed when the guys who work there send it the the crusher (in nicer language, of course). i quickly gave up, fished out my handy portable recuva usb, and spent an extra hour and a half recovering files that she could remember, while she insisted on acting like her actions were remotely logical. so this happened back in august, when north and south korea fired a few rockets back and forth. i had been stationed here for 3 weeks when sk put up those giant speakers that play kpop and propaganda, nk got all pissy and shot a few rockets at them and sk retaliated. well, i just so happened to be stationed here when all that kicked off and was working nights, 8pm-8am. not any more. i get the call around 4pm to come in, it's urgent we need all hands on deck to get the general's phones and what not up. okay, normally our day shift would handle it but with the act of aggression everyone and their mother is getting called in and i get tasked to the 3 star's room to set up his iptv in the bunker. "is it up yet?" the colonel asks me. again. and again. and again. "no sir," i'm jamming away at my desk configuring the new switch and scope for his office. everyone is freaking out, it's the apocalypse and he needs his systems up and running now and the colonel is making sure i know that. finally get the switch up and running with the colonel breathing down my neck, rack that bitch in the comm closet, patch everything back to his office, all with mr. nosey right behind asking me when i was going to be finished every step of the way. i finally get everything set up in his office, phones are up, all his different networks are greened up and ready to go, his iptv is live. the man is set. finally, after i finish this i am pouring sweat because it is hot as hell in korea in august, and we are not allowed to have cars while we are stationed here so i had made a nice long walk to work, the three star comes in and sees my sloppy mess and the full bird standing beside me. he takes one look at me and tells me that i look like hell, can't disagree with that, then asks me one question. "so does this mean i can watch football in my office now with the iptv?" i'm a little taken back by that, considering the current events that had taken place. i wasn't used to the tension between the two countries so was a little worried. "uh.. yes sir, should be good to go." "hell yeah, appreciate it!" and that was the first, and only time, i have talked to the three star.big fan of this subreddit! haven't seen a story like this posted, but i'm sure this is a common occurrence in our field. i'll try to keep the company-specific details to a minimum to protect the guilty. about a year prior to this story, $company had created an energy conglomerate of sorts - instead of towns and cities buying power straight from the power company, they'd buy through $company. because they were buying in "bulk", $company would get a discount on all that electron juice, and pass some of that discount onto the towns in the conglomerate. i was the new guy in it, and i had finished all of my assignments, so i went around to different employees asking what i could do or make to make their lives easier. turns out the current it staff was pretty overworked trying to upkeep all the old stuff, so my offer to make new stuff quickly made me a favorite among the employees - well, all but one. the power company didn't like the idea that they were selling the same amount of power, but now at a lower price. they had a tool to check account information (month by month power usage, on and off peak, price per kilowatt hour, etc), but the tool requires you to enter the account numbers one at a time (presumably to slow down anyone like us who wanted to manage multiple accounts). anyway, i started asking one woman if she had any computer troubles, and she started going on and on about how difficult her job was. it boiled down to her keeping an excel sheet of all of the account numbers for every account in every town or city in the conglomerate, and a column for every piece of information the web app would give you. she'd copy the account number into the web app, hit go, then copy each number into the excel sheet. there were hundreds of accounts. it took her 3 months to finish a single month's data retrieval. i took a look at what she was actually doing, and found that when she typed in an account number, the web app would just use php's $_get to craft a url which included that number. i wrote a script that made a url for every account number, then scraped the html for the different pieces of data on the page. i also dealt with various bugs in their system (i had to add a delay, if you checked pages too often it would effectively start blocking you, either to prevent this behavior or because i was ddos'ing their system). anyway, about an hour of programming, then three hours of letting the program run, and i had automated this woman's three month excursion. we had our weekly meeting, and i showed the woman, her boss, and my boss the tool. i presented it while happily smiling in much the same way that a sad person would frown. everyone was excited by the massive drop in workload...except the woman whose job i apparently just automated. it turns out that what i thought was a description of a difficulty was actually her way of "bragging" about the difficulty of her job, like a surgeon might tell you about a recent heart complication that he fixed blindfolded while playing 2048. that was the only thing she did for the company. she had no marketable skills, and spent the last year training herself in the muscle memory of the locations of the copy and paste options were on the right click menus (ctrl+c &amp;amp; ctrl+v would have changed her life as well). she was not pleased. she was even less pleased when she was fired the next week, after her boss had failed to find something else she could do. tldr: i turned quarterly into daily, human into script, happy into sad, and a full salary with benefits into zilch. and i never saw a penny of the money i saved them, because i was dumb.work for a well known it company customer comes in for their appointment with a laptop that's made out of aluminium with a very visible dent by the charging port. &gt; hello, how can i help you today? &gt; right... basically i was using my laptop last night doing some work, went to go plug it in, and after around 10-15 mins, the charging area on the side here started melting on my lap, i had to pull out the charging cable and now it's like this, i know it's out of warranty but i'm sorry, i think it's unacceptable for it to melt on me... *i pause for a moment, look at the machine then back up at him* &gt; it melted? &gt; yes, melted, you can see it here *points to the charging port area where its bent* &gt; right, urm, are you sure? did you go to hospital? *i go onto google and type in "aluminium melting point"* &gt; yes, i'm sure, no i chucked it on the carpet before it touched me so i'm ok, why? *i show him my tablet with the google result of 660.3 °c* &gt; well, just a few things, first in order for it to melt, it'd have to get up to this temperature, but in addition to that, the plastic at the back of your ethernet port which is next to it is untouched and if you chucked it on the carpet, i'm pretty positive your house would have burnt down, are you sure it melted? *customers very young child comes scuttling in with his mum* &gt; oh daddy, has the man said he can fix the computer i dropped? man how i cried with laughter after that appointment..! edit - lol, that blew up hahaback in 2001 i worked the phones for a call-centre that provided outsourced tech-support services for an industry giant in the realm of "american multinational computer technology corporations". my average-handle-time numbers were never very good, and i was constantly being told to bring my call times down from the 20-or-so minute mark to under 16 (as per the service agreement with said corporation). while most of my co-workers had no problem dumping their callers as soon as possible (earning a big pat on the back from the floor managers) i was not able to just push my clients back into the endless cycle of 40+ minute wait times. my first-call resolution rate of 90% or better, however, was always at the top of the chart. nobody gave a rat's ass about that, though. for anyone that has been in my shoes, you'll agree that trying to actually *fix* a problem in under 16 minutes is pretty difficult. add the fact that most customers vent on you for about 10 minutes before you can start to help them and there isn't much that you can do if you are in the business of actually supporting the system. so, i made the decision to ignore my aht (as much as the managers would let me) and just try to fix everything as quickly as i could. there were times when they would just hover and stare at me if they saw that my timer was over. one particular day, i end up on a call with a nice elderly woman. she was 75 and had received her computer as a christmas gift from her son, who had put the service account in her name. what her son neglected to do, however, was get her a warranty that included service to go along with her replacement parts. in scrolling through the log of her ordeal with our "technicians", i find that i am her 16^th call to support in 2 days. she had originally called to ask about error messages that she was receiving and had been taken through driver/app re-installations, system restore, the dreaded 6-call format/re-install (windows me, no less), and finally a motherboard replacement. how she was not filled with rage and fury is still beyond me. instead of the profanity-laced tirade that i had come to expect, muriel was very pleasant. "i just received your parcel and i am ready to go!" it took a moment for it to sink in, but it wasn't long before the realization hit. i had to walk this lady through a motherboard install. while it occurred to me that most of my co-workers would have gone as far as to just dump the call by hitting the release button on their phone, i felt obligated to put an end to this saga. "muriel, we are going to need a phillips screw-driver for this. do you have one handy?" "i have one right here!" she was ready to rock. while she was waiting in the queue, she had managed to unhook all of the external cables and get the case onto her dining room table. i opened my 3^rd extra-large triple-triple of the shift. it was on. she followed every instruction with precision and passion, as if she had been preparing all her life for this moment. i could hear her grunting and occasionally cursing under her breath as her crooked old fingers fumbled for dropped screws in the bottom of the case. i could mark the end of most steps with the signature "plunk" of a card or cable being pried free of its slot. others she would confirm with a simple "ok, got it! what's next?" when the pci cards went back in i would add "make sure it's seated nice and securely!" to her refrain "it's in there!" 45 minutes later, the tower was back under the desk for the first of what i figured would be many attempts at getting the system to fire up. the managers were circling nervously, trying their best to signal me to finish the call. i smiled and waved. "ok muriel, let's try the power button. be sure to let me know what you see on the screen." i listened closely and prepared to count the post beeps. one beep. "what do you see muriel?" "there was some white writing on a black screen but now it says windows me." "that's a great sign! is the light on the floppy drive lit?" in the thousands of times i had re-seated a floppy cable, my success rate at getting it the right side up the first time had to have been less than 10%. "it was for a second, but it's off now." *windows_startup_music.wav* one boot. impossible! i had her look through the device manager for conflicts/"bangs" for which there were none. i had her launch her office applications and open a few of her documents without any issues. play an audio cd? check! i even went as far as to have her test her internet connection (aol dial-up) which required i call her back. no problems there either. i was in awe. we had just completed an entire motherboard replacement with 100% accuracy in 45 minutes. sometimes it would take users 15 minutes to find the my computer icon. "muriel, this has been the single greatest call i have ever been a part of. you can now tell your friends that you have assembled a computer from scratch." she cackled. "i had a lot of fun, but i hope you don't take it the wrong way when i say that i hope to never have to speak to any of you ever again." **tl;dr: i walked an old lady through a motherboard replacement in 45 minutes.** edit: you guys are awesome. i am truly humbled. if i would have known, i would have said "muriel, one day i will post on reddit about this, and technicians world-wide will cheer."during my uni days i felt i needed to have a proper job on the side, particularly one that i wouldn't ashamed of telling people about. up to that point all my jobs had revolved around annoying others, e.g. telemarketing, doing survey's on the street, things like that. now i wanted to do something useful that people would actually appreciate, so i applied for a job at the university's tech support team. i in no way had sufficient skills or experience to deal with tech support issues, but i was hired anyway and learned a lot as i went. there was a professor of one of the linguistics departments, who was infamous for constantly ringing up and get really agitated / condescending about all kinds of things that were supposedly wrong with her computer. of course the first time she called they immediately deferred her to the new guy: me. she was really worked up, and told me i had to "come over immediately!" i asked her what the problem was, and she yelled: "my computer is infected with a virus! it's invading my privacy by showing my password to everybody!" i had no idea what it could be, but i was pretty sure she was not even capable of getting a virus installed (unintentionally or not). so i went over there to see what she was going on about. when i got there, i didn't see anything out of the ordinary on her screen. so i asked her to follow the same steps that caused the issue before, and this was the result: * to quickly get to het university webmail, she had placed a shortcut to the web page on her desktop. * she would double click the shortcut icon, but at such a slow pace that the clicks were registered as two individual clicks instead. * of course the first click caused the shortcut icon to be selected, while the second click made its caption text editable. * now focusing on the her own fingers and ignoring the screen, she assumed the login page had loaded and that she could start typing her password to log into her mail account. * as she typed her password, she would replace the highlighted shortcut caption text with her password and press enter (intended to submit the login form but actually confirming the caption text edit). * and lo, her password was displayed on screen for all to see. she looked at me triumphantly, as if she had just proven a discovery that had somehow slipped by our team. all of a sudden i felt i was going to be alright at this job, despite my lack of experience. edit: spellinga short one that i've just experienced and had to share. i work for a local authority, and our most frequent user issues come from social workers. i didn't have any contact with people from that profession before i took this job but they all just seem to be... stupid. not just computer illiterate, but in general not a very bright bunch. as evidenced by this exchange. &gt; **sw**: hi, i reset my password yesterday but it's not working today. &gt; **me**: that's fine, i can just reset it. ...ok that's done. your new password is just 'password1' that's with a capital p. &gt; **sw**: *scribbling sounds* ok... password...1... with a capital 't'? &gt; **me**: err... no, 'p'. puh, puh. as in 'password'. &gt; **sw**: 't', then? &gt; **me**: ... there is no 't' in 'password' &gt; **sw**: oh yeah, right enough. at first i thought he was joking with me, albeit badly, but he got really worked up at having to repeat himself. *edit* i fail at formatting *edit2* guys i think we all just need to agree that p for password, p for papa and p for pterodactyl are all the same p. also i'm never getting in a pool with any of you! *edit3* as has already been suggested roughly 400 times, he was not german.i man the it help desk for the faculty of medicine in a university. as the buildings we support are fairly spread out, we try to do as much remote support as we can. we therefore have ultravnc as a part of our standard image. this morning $user called up asking to have skype installed on her computer. it was a desktop so she didn't have admin privileges. no biggie. i ask her for her ip address. since most of our users draw a blank when i ask this, i then guide them through checking it by hovering their mouse over the vnc icon in the task bar. our repeat offenders however know the drill and sometimes will give the address to us straight away. great, saves time. i remote in and install skype. while still connected she asks me a question about her webcam. as i'm replying, notepad opens in the remote session. inside notepad the following appears. who is this. what are you doing to my computer. i demand to know who you are and where you are connecting from. turns out my dear friend $user had written down her ip address on to a sticky note three months ago, thinking that it would never change. i had just freaked out some poor staff member by taking control of their mouse and keyboard while they were in the middle of writing their thesis. oops. i quickly found out $user's real ip address, installed skype and ended the call so i could find out who the other staff member was and contact them to explain. i then had to deal half an hour of ranting about how bloody insecure our system is if just anyone can connect at any time, don't we have anything better to do, breach of privacy, etc. etc.whoa, this sub really dies during the weekends! i've mentioned my grandmother in the comments before. i thought that i'd share a short story about her this lazy sunday! my grandmother is 89 yo and looks like a typical sweet old lady. [she is also really small.]( since she is that old she has been around for the entire evolution of modern computing, and is thus naturally very good with computers. why this doesn't seem to apply to other old people is beyond me. a couple of years ago my aunt took grandma to the hospital for a routine checkup. my aunt waited outside the room as grandma was examined by a doctor. after a while a nurse came out of the room and rushed past my aunt, only to return with another doctor a moment later. both disappeared back into the room without a word. just as my aunt started to wonder what was going on, the nurse came rushing out again, fetching yet another doctor. my aunt started to worry, what medical crisis could possibly require three doctors? luckily the nurse didn't close the door properly the last time so my aunt decided to take a peek inside. grandma was sitting on the bed, surrounded by the three doctors who were all taking notes. &gt;grandma: ...don't go for the cheapest models, they break down quickly and the software is harder to use... she was teaching the doctors how to digitalize old picture slides and what scanner to get. at the time grandma was spending a lot of time scanning slides, which she apparently had mentioned to the first doctor. the doctor and her two colleagues all had major collections of picture slides, but had no idea that you now can scan them yourself. they were pretty amazed. edit: since this story got popular i called my aunt to confirm (because i wrote this from memory). apparently the actual quote was even better: &gt;"listen doctor, do you even know what a scanner is?"some days i find myself questioning whether the end justifies the means. if a lie improves the lives of all parties involved is it not, in the end, a good thing? can this deception be forgiven, or is it one of the small degrees by which a man inexplicably slides towards the abyss? &gt; **boss:** i just had $bitchycoworker in my office. did you tell her it would take *a full hour* to install a critical update on her computer? &gt; **me:** words to that effect may have been said, yes. &gt; **boss:** isn't this the update that took *five minutes*, including reboot, on my computer? &gt; **me:** yes. &gt; **boss:** then what are the other 55 minutes for? &gt; *we stared each other down over the last cup of coffee, neither willing to give the other any grounds.* (heh) &gt; **me:** how much is five minutes? &gt; **boss:** almost nothing. but that doesn't answer my question.... &gt; **me:** but it does! five minutes is almost nothing! *and that's the problem.* to you and me, a task that takes five minutes is a good thing. it's done quickly. you show up, get stuff done and bob's your uncle, mum's the word and drop bears are real. but to someone who has spent the last three years convinced her monitor is a touch screen a five minute task is something that can be put off indefinitely. if i tell her it's a five minute job she will keep me from doing it right up until i have to put on my shit-avoidance goggles and dive into flaming mass of excrement. &gt; **boss:** but if you tell her it will take a full hour... &gt; **me:** ... she'll find the time to let me do it because it's important. &gt; **boss:** and she'll be happy because you came in under your estimate. &gt; **me:** exactly! &gt; **boss:** all right, whatever. can you make some more coffee? &gt; **me:** sure, just give me an hour.this is happening right now. client came in, wants a website, have the design pre-made, so we skip the first few steps on the workflow. his design is in photoshop files and our guys are slicing it into html, backends are coding it, etc, etc. everything fine and a few days later we upload it to a test site for the client to approve it. we walked trough some days of ridiculous demands, all coming down to his design being sucky and not really working for him. but since we are the good guys, we are changing things on his demands. the interesting things started the next morning. &gt; **client**: the website is not ok at all! when i view it on my iphone it looks all different! &gt; **my boss**: this is normal - we had to fit the elements somehow to fit smaller resolutions. it is responsive website after all. &gt; **client**: no, i don't want it like that! make it look 1:1 as the provided design! &gt; **my boss**: you understand the design you provided is made for 1920x1080, right? it can't downsize to smaller screens, like on a tablet or on your phone. &gt; **client**: i don't want it downsized! i want it to look 1:1! &gt; **my boss**: ... this can't happen without having the website being unreadable on smaller screens. you wanted us to make a responsive website, right? &gt; **client**: of course i wanted responsive. just don't change anything on it. &gt; **my boss**: what does *responsive* means for you? &gt; **client**: it means i can open the website on my iphone. &gt; **my boss**: you want to open it on your iphone, but how would you view it there? only a small portion of the website will fit your screen! you will have a massive horizontal and vertical scrollbars and the font size will be absolutely tiny! &gt; **client**: yes, like that! all normal websites have scrollbars! i want scrollbars! update: right now my boss just finally fired the client. it went like this: &gt; **client**: the site is not good again! i can view only a portion of it on my screen! **boss**: yes, because your design is 1920px wide and this is the design you approved and wanted to do it exactly 1:1 with frozen elements. **client**: it is not looking good, see for example site x! how are they doing it? **boss**: site x uses narrow 1000px centered design, yours is way bigger than that. you can't have it to render fully on smaller screens. it is technically not possible with the design you approved. **client**: what do you mean 'not possible'? don't tell me it is not possible, i see it done on site x! this went for a couple of minutes then a few unpleasantries were exchanged, stating that we are unprofessional and not a serious company.about 15 years ago, my boss asked me to set up an april fool's joke script to run when people log in to our internal application. it has survived several server migrations, and is still running today, and still getting people who forget about it. the text of the message: general failure - error reading drive /dev/hd00 press enter to continue repair disk: select action:?

&gt;me: what are you doing to login? &gt;user: oh, i got tired of typing in my information so i printed it out as a barcode and put it on my desk. i scan it with the barcode gun on my computer. &gt;me: wow! never would have though of that... this guy’s idea was so awesome i just didn’t have the heart to screw him over just because the rules say. and plus, it’s not like his password is actually *written down*, plus who can read barcode? tl:dr – genius warehouse worker never has to type his password again by printing it out as a barcode. short story time! my gf and i had been dating for awhile, so it was time to do that whole "hey come meet my family so they can judge you" thing. which, to be honest, is still fairly terrifying as an older 20-something. about halfway into dinner, her dad starts complaining about his phone (*damn new technology this... damn $cellphonecompany that... back in my day yadda yadda*)... turns out his touch screen had stopped working - win 8 phone... surprise? - and the company had told him over the phone he was going to have to come in and get it replaced, at the low low cost of 200 bucks... gf mentioned i knew a thing or two about tech (because, as we all know, being the person known for being "techie" automatically gets you shopped out as tech help to family/friends/neighbours/random strangers in a line at the grocery store) and that i should have a look at it... "no problem" says i, of course still trying to make a good first impression... two minutes of google-foo to pull up which keys to press to get his phone to do a soft-reset and it works perfectly! best part - he turns to me and says "son, you can come over and drink my beer and watch hockey on the big screen any time you want". my office had one of its lights out, which made it slightly gloomy. the gloom cast a shadow over half my face as i spoke, i decided that was acceptable. the light stayed broken. the head of marketing had entered my office in dramatic fashion. he’d swung the door wide, jumped through the opening and rushed to the desk. slamming down a mouse and glaring into my relaxed posture with an accusatory stare. i decided i wasn’t a drama fan. &gt;me: that’s a mouse. i decided clear factual statements are the opposite of what a good drama lover would do. they like to stay in the realm of ambiguity. &gt;headmarketing: no................ head of marketing stopped. lengthening out the silence between us. leaving a long pregnant pause. &gt;headmarketing: that’s a *wired* mouse. i picked up the offending accessory and examined it closely. i gave a few tugs at the wire, then smiled broadly. &gt;me: so it is! head of marketing looked confusedly at my actions. i internally reassessed my opinions on the situation, perhaps this could be a comedy yet. &gt;headmarketing: i want a *wireless* mouse. last week when i went up to accounting they’d already received wireless mice. in what world does **accounting** get wireless mice but designers do not? &gt;me: apparently this one... no wonder head of marketing is so dramatic, he thinks he’s a designer! i smiled at the thought of rectifying this obvious oversight. &gt;headmarketing: you can’t constrain *us* with wires! why do accountants, who use keyboards all day get wireless, whilst those of us who actually use our mice get wired? &gt;me: the world is a strange place. accountants, unconstrained by the wires of their mice can work from wherever they want but alas the marketing department, least loved of all the departments, are chained to their desks. slaves to the wired mice they so depend on. &gt;headmarketing: are you?.... are you mocking me? i realized i’d probably gone a little far. trying to hide the smile, i continued. &gt;me: lets just see how long this cord is. i stretched the cord out on the desk. its total length was around 5 feet. &gt;me: so you need wireless mice so you can work... at greater then 5 feet away from the computer? &gt;headmarketing: it’s not so much the distance, as it is the wire! it gets in the way. you can’t expect good designs and clean visuals to come when the artist is continually moving cords. it breaks the flow. it breaks the flow. i looked again closely at the offending wired mouse, it was surprisingly good quality. unlike most mice at work it had a high dpi. replacing this mouse with the low quality wireless junk we had would actually be a downgrade. &gt;me: listen this mouse, it’s better dpi then anything we offer. a higher dpi means... &gt;headmarketing: **you will get me my wireless mouse** not only had head of marketing cut me off, he’d also grabbed the mouse away from me. i watched in shock as he loomed over my desk. &gt;headmarketing: go get me a wireless mouse.... drama, thats clearly all he wanted. i’d tried for comedy, i’d tried for documentary. no. he wanted drama. &gt;me: no. let me explain exactly why i won’t do that. head of marketing grabbed the scissors off my desk and in one quick swoop cut the cord on the mouse in his hand. in his moment of victory he smiled down at me. i sat in my chair, oddly impressed he’d actually just cut a cord in front of me. i decided i’d had enough of drama. i waited. it was a long pause before he spoke again. &gt;headmarketing: *oh no.* looks like i need a new mouse. perhaps you could go get me one. i’d prefer wireless. &gt;me: i’m afraid, as i was trying to explain. we’ve none left. also you just destroyed property in front of me. headmarketing didn’t seemed phased at all by this, he looked like he just wanted to leave. he spotted a very old mouse sitting next to an ancient computer, grabbed it and started walking off. **** about twenty minutes later i got a call. &gt;headmarketing: this mouse doesn’t have the right cord thingy. &gt;me: doesn’t it? that’s weird. i’ll get you a new one. i went searching around the department for the worst mouse. i finally found one. it was an old ball mouse with a usb input. its rollers were as dirty as sin, the entire ball continually stuck at one point or another. even better for reasons no one could fathom, the cord was only 2 feet long. &gt;headmarketing: thanks so much.... head of marketing took stock of the mouse i was attempting to give him. i plugged it into the back of his computer and the mouse only made it half way to where his mouse pad was normally placed. i moved the mouse pad. &gt;headmarketing: what the?! this mouse has a tiny cord! &gt;me: i know! it’s **practically** wireless.my claim to fame comes from a few years ago. i was working 2nd line support at a company making hotel and hospitality software; room bookings databases, point of sale stuff etc. the point of sale (pos) stuff was written in vb and was basically garbage. the pos hardware itself was a pc with a resistive touchscreen and a cash drawer. the cash drawer was always fun to set up, and then setup again when the settings were inevitably lost. we'd connect in over vnc and then send a selection of commands to any com ports on the pc until the drawer popped open. from memory there were 6-8 possible command strings and and 2-4 com ports (2 physical, 1-2 through usb converter if used). needless to say this took some time and we had to be sure someone was nearby when testing, as there was never a response to a command and the drawer could be full of cash. so there i was talking to a fairly reasonable bar manager at lunch time, trying to sort out his pos which suddenly wouldn't open the cash drawer. i did the usual thing of letting him know not to wander off, leaving an open drawer full of cash and to let me know when the drawer opens, send command... nothing send command... nothing send command... nothing send command... nothing ... send command... "urghhhhhhh!" that wasn't usually the response i got when i fixed something. after a few seconds the bar manager told me through gritted teeth that the drawer had popped open, right into his cajones. **tl;dr** i punched someone in the nuts over the internet. living the dream. oh my! gold! thanks kind stranger!my mother, despite being in her mid 60's, is awesome with computers. she's a public librarian, and is often at the wrong end of users' questions. i came home for a quick mother's day visit and she told me this gem: user: i can't copy this highlighted section! this mouse must be broken! mom: just press the control and c keys at the same time. yes, that'll copy it. now hit the control and v keys at the same time. user: v?? why not p? mom: v stands for velcro, so when you paste it, it'll stick. user: ooh ok! that makes sense! tl;dr- my mom is amazing. many years ago, someone decided that all our servers would be named after green things and all our networked printers would be named after movie stars. so we had servers names envy, kiwi, hulk, leaf etc. and printers named bogart, bacall, carey, bronson, eastwood etc. one day i received a call from someone who was upset about the name of the printer in her new office. let's call her crazed new office worker (cnow). &gt; djxiii: it servicedesk, djxiii speaking. &gt; cnow: hello, i'd like to request that the printer in our office receive a proper name. the one it has now is offensive. &gt; djxiii: a networked printer? which office are you in? &gt; cnow: i'm in the academic and career prep offices. i don't know why our printer is named this way. in my old office we had a nicely named printer named after meg ryan. i do a look-up and see that the printer in her new office is named "garland" after judy garland. &gt; djxiii: yes, all our network printers are named after celebrities. do you want the one in your area named after a different celebrity? &gt; cnow: i think they must have missed ours. it's named **garlnad.** i don't know what that is supposed to mean, but i have teenaged sons and i know what nads are! it's definitely inappropriate! &gt; djxiii: i think you are just reading it wrong. the name of the printer is judy garland or just garland for short. &gt; cnow: thank you for you time. *click* i have often wondered if she had dyslexia or if it was just a case of being a bit overwhelmed with the change of office. one of our network guys started using garlnad as his quake handle not long after that. tl:dr user misreads name of printer and thinks it is offensive. edit: great scott! i've earned a nsfw tag! never under-estimate the power of nads! edit2: quote of the day? *wipes a tear* hello again, tfts! so today, i finally had a gratifying moment of putting a customer squarely in his place, and i thought i'd share. sidenote: i work at a large isp that deals mostly with rural american areas. &gt;angryman: i can't connect to anything in my house! your internet doesn't work! this service is awful! hmm... sounds like his wifi isn't working. we've gotta verify that his internet is still up and running at all, and then check the modem's firmware. &gt;uwbw: okay, sir, let's start with this... do you currently have a computer plugged into your modem? &gt;angryman: yes, of course it is! i have a special computer for my special programming! &gt;uwbw: okay, good. so, let's see if we can get to google.com on that computer. &gt;angryman:... &gt;uwbw: sir? are you able to get to goo- &gt;angryman: why the **** do i need to go to google? &gt;uwbw: well, sir, i need to see if it's your wifi going down or your actual internet connection. &gt;angryman: fine... silence reigns for a while as i absentmindedly watch one of the tvs in our center play an old tom and jerry cartoon. after about three minutes of silence, i check in with the guy. &gt;uwbw: sir? are you able to access goo- &gt;angryman: listen punk, i have a degree in programming! i know that my internet isn't working, okay!? i'm not gonna do your dumb troubleshooting, just fix it! &gt;uwbw: sir, with all due respect, i- &gt;angryman: what!? i bet you don't know a thing about computers. do you have a degree in computer programming? huh? do you? &gt;uwbw: yes, sir. &gt;angryman: ...what? &gt;uwbw: yes sir, i do have a degree in computer programming and computer science. &gt;angryman: ... oh. and he shut the hell up after that and let me do my job. yay! edit: wow, this really blew up, huh? thanks for all the support, guys! it's moments like these that make this job for me :p also, for those of you wondering, it's a computer science minor. i just phrased it like that so the guy was firmly put in his place. communication major, for the rest of you wondering.let me state this plainly and clearly for everyone: there is nothing that will derail and destroy a project with a greater efficiency than a project manager. in my 20+ years of doing this sort of thing, i have never found a project manager that can manage a project, and i've found quite a few that can't even manage their own lives. i am 101% convinced that if all the people who's only job is "project manager" were gathered up and put on a small pacific island, then had a nuclear weapon dropped on them, they would survive for two reasons: (1) the only thing to survive a nuclear holocaust would be cockroaches and pm's, and (2) the bomb would never actually detonate due to the project managers delaying the explosion for a few weeks while they try to get a few nuclear weapon smes involved to discuss the explosion with the bomb in a conference call that the bomb was forced to attend, and during that meeting the pm's had some questions that couldn't be answered by anyone on the phone, so they're going to setup another call next tuesday at 11 and send the invite to the people that need to be there to answer those questions, but before the tuesday meeting, the pm's spoke with the question answerers during an email chain containing 112 people and they are now confused by the word "detonating" because they were under the impression that we were going to be "exploding" the bomb and now they need to rewrite the project plan with this new information and they'll attach the plan to a new meeting invite so we can go over the plan to make sure that it's correct, and by the time that meeting starts, the bomb's batteries will have died and it will be rendered useless. the only thing worse than a project manager is a project manager that refuses to do anything about the project being derailed. since *february* i have been working on a project to archive a bunch of data. this requires creating 3 or 4 new nat statements and opening some ports on the firewalls. we have a biweekly meeting on tuesdays and fridays, scheduled for 1 hour, in which we're supposed to discuss the project we're working on. there's two pms involved in this project because we split it into two parts. pm1, we'll call her "pebbles", is a complete moron. before she became a pm, she worked in hr, and this the first project she's managed alone. she's never worked in it and doesn't know anything about it. she's also the person that emailed me this (with 11 people cc'd): &gt;kc, thanks for attending the call today. i have a couple questions that thought would be better answered offline so we didn't make the meeting go over. you said in the call that you needed to "poke a couple holes in the firewall". since you're not onsite, who are you going to get to create the holes and are they going to fill the holes back in after we're done with the project? how long does it take to make the holes, and how long to fill them? are you poking holes so we can run cables, and if so, do i need to get our electrical contractor involved to run the cables for you? since this is a firewall, wouldn't it be a fire hazard to have holes in it? let me know so i can add it to the project plan and meeting minutes i'll be sending out." i shit you not... she really did ask that. pm #2, we'll call him "bamm-bamm", has a very unique skill. he's the only man in the world that can talk for an entire hour and never say anything. his favorite phrase is "so, let me get this straight...," afterwards he will repeat everything the person just said, but he will take 8 minutes to say something like "so, you need to open ports on the firewall before we can move any data." it's not that he talks slow, quite the opposite, he just doesn't say anything of substance. it's hard to describe, but imagine having a gun to your head and the person holding the gun told you that you had to describe how to walk across a room, but you had to speak in your normal cadence and if you repeated yourself or stopped talking in the next 30 minutes, he'd kill you. that what this sounds like... lots of filler words and fluff that add absolutely nothing to the conversation other than to make the 10 minute call last the full 60 minutes scheduled. bamm-bamm has also never worked in it and requires extensive definitions for everything. stuff like "what do you mean 'sftp'? can you explain 'sftp' to me? oh, it's encrypted? how? does the other engineer know how to use the sftp? have you tested this in the lab environment?" anyway, back to the story at hand. this project was supposed to be completed by may 31. now, it appears that it won't be complete until the middle of july. it took me 3 months to get the other side to do the required changes (routing statements, acl rules) for the machines on both sides to communicate. i spent two weeks trying to troubleshoot an issue with the servers not communicating, only to finally get the dba on the other side to share his screen with me while he was trying to connect and saw that he was using our "servername.company.local" name to connect rather than the public ip addresses i gave him. he then stopped because he's never used an ip to connect before and didn't feel comfortable doing it, so he had to wait until someone over there could edit the hosts file on the server so he could use the company.local name rather than the ip. this database admin had no idea what dns was or how it works. when i attempted to contact pebbles and bamm-bamm's boss about how they were destroying this project, she got involved and screwed it up even worse. what is it about large companies that they think they can hire people to do a job they don't know how to do and it will all turn out peachy in the end? why would you hire someone that's never worked in it as an it project manager? would you hire a lifeguard that can't swim? would you hire a blind race car driver? it’s easy to forget in these modern usb days that in simpler days, there was no device detection or auto-configuration. you plugged something into a serial port or parallel port, configured the computer for the same speeds/settings the device was expecting and we were off. ah those simple, glorious days. the serial port was indeed universal before it became the universal serial bus. but one class of device hasn’t forgotten those days - networking equipment. all serious routers, switches and firewalls [come with a 9600 baud rs232 serial port]( for configuring them. this may sound silly to people who grew up with usb as a standard, but by the time you need access to the serial port of a network device, you *really* need it. no drivers, no compatibility, just access. and for something like text-base configuration, it’s perfect. enter the modern age. serial ports on desktop pcs slowly fade into the history books, and that [db9 9-pin adapter]( is all but forgotten .. but not for some. as these started to disappear from laptops, ones that still had a physical serial port became highly sought after. the [prolific usb-to-serial converter]( was around but drivers were lacking and buggy at best; unusable at worst. it was 2010, and i was still clinging desperately to my old work laptop. it had everything i needed - a serial port, a gigabit ethernet port, and wifi, but the battery life was woeful, the case was cracked and it had not been ‘right in some time. the only thing i used it for was when i had to go downstairs to the datacentre to reconfigure something. and today, i needed to reconfigure something. that’s when *it* happened. my laptop lost a battle with a bottle of water, and was permanently dead. then it occured to me; this is really stupid. i kept an entire computer for the sole purpose of being a serial port adapter. how wasteful, and more importantly how ‘not able to be kept in my pocket’. what if i could use my phone as a serial port? it was a tiny *nix computer. i already had a terminal program on it. i searched and googled and searched and googled but no such device existed. that’s when i decided to build my own. my 2g iphone had a 30 pin connector, and i never knew what they were for, so i set about doing some research into what they did, and how people connected things to them. what i found was impressive; that connector had audio in, audio out, usb, firewire, video, three lots of power, and some mysterious ports labelled ‘rx’ and ’tx’. could it be? could the iphone have a serial port already that i could use? i’d been stressing that i’d need to port osx prolific drivers to ios, but could it really be as simple as just wiring them up? [i bought a breakout board]( from an electronics store online and that night, plugged it in, fired up minicom (a terminal emulator) and started messing with it, but no matter what i did, i couldn’t get anything to happen. that’s when [i threw the multimeter on]( - it wasn’t rs232, but it might have been ttl; a low-voltage version of the serial protocol. hell, it was worth a shot. some more research and another trip to the electronics store. i picked up a maxim max3232 chip, which converts ttl to rs232, a bunch of capacitors, and wired it up. [i connected it to the 3.3v power output of the iphone 30 pin, wired up the ground, connected the ‘accessory detect’ pin to ground, and then put the rx and tx on]( [stuffed the whole thing inside a case]( [and plugged it in]( and it worked. holy crap. i had never been so excited in my life. [i was configuring my 1801 home router with my damn phone]( the next day, i wrote a small post on my technical blog, and then posted a link to a network operators group mailing list, to share my discovery, and posted [a wiring diagram of how to do it]( the whole thing blew up like crazy. my article was reposted hundreds of times. it got slashdotted. it got featured in computerworld. people asked me to test it on an ipad, [so i did]( i got contacted by journalists. at this point, i was starting to get a little nervous. this was in no way approved apple hardware, and you had to jailbreak the phone to get access to the serial port (/dev/tty.iap); this was long before the ‘is it legal to jailbreak’ debate was finished, and i knew that apple had denied others use of the serial port for this exact thing. and without knowing it, i’d made worldwide news that it was not only possible, but posted a full set of instructions on how to do it. but as the days and weeks rolled by, and nothing but requests to buy them came in, i started to relax. i learnt pcb design and made schematics. i miniaturised the device to 1/4 its original size. i looked into manufacturing in australia but it was too expensive. i checked out the possibility of getting them made in china but no-one wanted to build the whole thing. it was only pcbs, cases, or assembly; not all three. then *it* happened. a journalist contacted me to ask me what i thought of the security flaws in the iphone. i didn’t really know what he was talking about, so i played it cool for a while until i had to ask him what the eff he was talking about. hackers had discovered a kernel-mode debugger that could be activated at boot time .. using the serial port. my heart leapt into my throat. my not-yet-commercial product that i was still promising to sell could be used to expose major vulnerabilities in the iphone. any and all chance of not getting a cease &amp; desist letter from apple disappeared in an instant. i removed any mention of selling the devices from my site, and rewrote the article as a ‘how to’, then intentionally reversed the tx and rx pins in the schematic to prevent it from working for plausible deniability. i kept my iphone serial port in my bag for years as a useful tool, until i finally got a retina macbook pro which was small and light enough to live there instead, and now that the prolific drivers didn’t suck, i had no need for it anymore. i disassembled the prototype and returned the electronics to my spare parts pile, where they still live today. but for one fleeting moment, i was internet famous; the best *kind* of famous.in a past life i was an avionics technician. i had quite a few interesting experiences; good, bad and otherwise. a few of them i can even share with all of you here. about ten years ago, as a lowly avionic tech, i was told to debrief the pilot (first debrief ever) on the circumstances of a recurring problem with one of their systems. while delving into the how and when of the issue with one of the crew members, the electronic warfare officer ($edub) pulls me aside and to ask me a question. his awkward nervousness was apparent. after about five minutes of beating it around the bush, he asks his question. “i am not sure that my $system is working correctly in offensive mode” he says to me. there is no “offensive mode” on $system. there is a wafer switch with four positions; (off), (stby), (test) and (def). i inform him that there is no offensive mode. that that was the off, as in offline, position and that if the system is not powered on then that position is working as intended. instead of accepting that he is wrong, $edub becomes indignant. he does not believe me. obviously, if there is a (def) position that means defensive mode, then there must also be an offensive mode (off). he then proceeds to confer with the rest of the aircrew. they come to his aide, only to haze him. after another 30+ minutes of disagreement, the senior pilot suggests we go out to another jet and see who is right. they all watch as i go through the power on process which requires i drag a heavy power cord from the generator to the jet, check breakers and finally flip the required switches. no one helps. once fully warmed up we check the systems. we flip the system to (stby) as part of the warm up cycle. ready lights come on. he flips it back to (off), the lights go out. $edub turns to me with a self satisfied look and shouts “see!!!” right in my face. i reply that this is functioning as designed. of course, he won’t accept it. we move to another jet. different jet, same results. at this point, i am tired of hooking up power and shutting down these jets. the aircrew have had their fun. now it is time for me to have mine. i suggest that we look at his operations manual. he didn’t bring his today. i am not surprised. one of the other crew members has one. i look up that system and guess what? (off) powers the system down, as in turns it off. i point this out to him. he complains to my boss about my disrespectful attitude. this story is dedicated to you babycakes the intern. *names have been changed to protect the not-so-innocent* around 2005, i worked for a major computer manufacturer doing consumer technical escalations. when you were so upset about your computer that you wrote to the corporate office, i was one of the people you spoke to. i pretty much had leeway to do whatever it took to resolve the customer's issue, whether it's issuing a refund, sending a new computer, giving away upgrades, etc. however, when it came to purchasing items from the company, we had to go through the normal consumer channels to do so. if we had a problem with our purchases, we also had to go through the same routine as anyone else in order to prevent abuse, like improperly getting upgrades and the like. often times, this meant that you'd be routed to a call center in india. usually, support was fine, but just like anywhere else, sometimes you have a bad egg. i ordered a refurbished pda online because they were on heavy discount. i had always been curious about them, so i figured i'd splurge. i get the device that week, and i'm stoked. until, that is, i try to plug headphones into the device. no sound. the headphone plug actually wiggles in the jack. i shine a flashlight into the jack... there's literally nothing in the jack. either the jack broke, or there wasn't one soldered on in the first place. i was surprised that this got past quality control! so on the phone i go, calling tech support. i get india: &gt;hello, thanks for calling &lt;computerco&gt;, this is "melissa", how can i help you? &gt;&gt;hi, i bought a refurbished pda from you. i receive it, and there's no headphone jack-- there's a hole where one is supposed to be. &gt;mmm-hmm... so you have a problem with sound from the headphones. have you made sure that the device isn't muted? &gt;&gt;yes... it's unmuted, but i don't see how that's going to help the fact that there is no jack on the device at all. &gt;yes sir... mmm... can you please turn the device off, then back on, and see what happens? &gt;&gt;sure. *reboots device* it's back on. there's still no headphone jack. &gt;uh huh... okay, thank you sir. it seems like the settings might be corrupt. i need you to power the device down, and when you turn it on, please hold the button... &gt;&gt;wait, are you telling me to do a hard reset, to bring the device back to factory defaults? how is that supposed to make the headphone jack appear? &gt;mmmhmm... well sir, we won't know until we try. &gt;&gt; ... do you understand what i'm telling you? we can do all we want with the software, but physically, there is no jack to plug headphones into. &gt; ok. so shall we proceed to resetting the device to defaults now? she's not getting this. i ask to speak to her supervisor. she puts me on hold, comes back, and tells me, of course, he's not available. this isn't something you're normally supposed to do, but i pulled up my device's serial number in our internal ticketing program. i see that she has already written up call notes and put a resolution in of "customer had no sound. ensured device was unmuted, settings now correct, call resolved." oh *hell* no. she comes back on the phone and says, &gt;okay sir, if we don't reset the device, we can't troubleshoot any further. is there anything else i can do for you? &gt;&gt;yes, "melissa", or is it *sandra*? i'm a corporate escalations rep. i just looked up this case in the ticketing system and it says you told me to reset my audio settings, that i'm already off the phone, and the issue is resolved. you do realize that falsifying logs is a terminable offense, right? &gt;um... i... uh... &gt;&gt;please put your manager on the phone so that he can set up an exchange for this device. seconds later, someone else is on the phone confirming my address. 2 days later, i have a replacement device that actually has a headphone jack. i know i might get some flak for coming down on a front-line tech so hard, threatening firing for what she did. but, i worked every day dealing with customers who got the same kind of runaround, i just wasn't going to let it stand. *addendum* what makes this especially bad is that per our pda support process, doing a factory reset on the device is something you're supposed to walk the customer through, but then you end the call so that they can finish going through the "first time setup" process. that process takes around 15-20 minutes, doing routine stuff like entering your name, wifi information, etc. once a customer does that, they're supposed to call back. not only would the factory reset not solve my problem, it was obvious that she knew a factory reset would get me off of the phone. a bit over month or so ago we set up a virtualized windows-server for a customer, where they connected over remote desktop services if they needed to interact with the server software running there. everything had ran smoothly ever since the initial setup, but today i received a call from the customer. the customer was really frustrated as they needed something done fast and the ms' own mac client just gave errors about trust issues to the server. not fluent with mac, i still decided to poke around with teamviewer, and soon discovered that my colleague who had set up that specific mac had installed microsoft remote desktop from the app store and left a note for the customer to use that instead of the remote desktop connection, which also was on that computer. turns out the customer had been on a 2 week vacation and had forgotten about it. i demonstrated how to use the correct software over teamviewer and was preparing for the usual closing complaints about lost work time, lost money, difficult it stuff and so forth. then it happened. like a unicorn with rainbow colored spots: &gt; client: "i'm so sorry for wasting your time. i now remember reading the note and using the correct software, but i just had forgotten all about it during my vacation" &gt; me: (long pause, not believing what i hear) &gt; client: "hello?" &gt; me: "uh... umm.. absolutely no problem" &gt; client: "oh, and just bill me for the time, thank you" &gt; me: "okay, thanks and bye" i remember my mother reading me about people apologizing when i was a kid, but honestly this must've been the first time i've actually heard it. i tip my hat to the customer. you were **awesome** today.my mother has, for a long time, been wanting some sort of streaming device for her house. however, her home internet kind of... sucked, so i'd dissuaded her for a while. she's periodically called her isp and had them troubleshoot, and has been told that the highest speed she can get in her area (a fairly popular suburb of the largest city in our state) is 6mbps. they seemed to get things sorted out a bit better, and last time i was there, i ran some speedtests to show she was actually getting about 5-6mbps down, so i mentioned that maybe she could stream video after all. she went to get a chromecast, but couldn't get it set up on wireless downstairs - she said something about the connection not being strong enough. (and really, the connection in that room does suck.) so, she went to buy a wireless extender for that room, and got it set up by herself! then, she bought an appletv, and got that set up by herself too! *seriously - she didn't even call me to find out the ssid and wpa2 key. that information is written on a post-it on her fridge, and she must have remembered where it was.* she's discovered youtube and is planning to set up a netflix account. you go, mom!caller: yeah i've got a new iphone 6 and it's always really hot to the touch. also the battery won't hold a charge. i don't even use it much throughout the day but it's always dead by about 3:00. me: ok, can you go into the battery usage section and tell me what's using up most of your battery? caller: it says home &amp; lock screen has used 55% of my battery over the last 7 days. me: uh ok. that's really weird. do you have any unusual screen savers or anything like that? caller: no, it's brand new. i have only changed a couple of the settings on it. me: like what settings? caller: oh i enabled a security pin and made it so the screen is always on. me: the screen is always on? caller: yeah the screen kept automatically shutting off after 5 minutes so i went in and told it to never shut off. i like to set my phone up on my desk and use it like a clock. me: &lt;sigh&gt;....this story was previously killed by the mods/filter. i am guessing it was because i was ranting. so, no ranting. just a story of a user poking holes in personal email security. ***** i have completed some online training for cloudbasedticketing administration. this was nice as i have been doing it for months, relying on google-foo. for this, hr requests the training. our hr helper creates a list of people to do the training then registers them online. i am told to go see her to provide some details. less than a minute into the conversation: &gt; **hrh:** “and your email address?” &gt; **me:** “fb@ourcompany.com” &gt; **hrh:** “no, your personal email address” &gt; **me:** *(er, ok)* “fb@mysite.com” &gt; **hrh:** “your password?” &gt; **me:** “what password?” &gt; **hrh:** “the password for your personal email address” &gt; **me:** *(wut?)* “i am sure you do not need the password for my personal email account. there is no way i am giving you that.” &gt; **hrh:** “well everybody else has!” &gt; **me:** *(omg)* “and i see you’ve typed them all into your spreadsheet. you just need an initial password. just type password123. that will work, i promise.” later, i get a nice automated email on my personal mobile: welcome #badly-formatted-first-name# blah, blah etc your username is: fb@mysite.com your password is: password123 you will be asked to change your password when you first log into our system. i type a polite email to hrh’s manager explaining hrh’s misunderstanding and requested that the spreadsheet be purged. cc information security (because they needed cheering up). when sharing this story with colleague senior tech, he replies: &gt; **st:** “oh. i did think it was weird that i had to give her my password.” &gt; **me:** “uh? what? you didn’t? you know what, never mind. ” *(pocket of brain cells sacrifice themselves to protect those that are left)* ***** **edit:** my first tfts quote of the day! thank you all! started working at a computer repair shop, there will probably be more stories to come, but here's my first interaction with a crazy lady (cl). i do phone repairs at my work, and some lady brought in a phone with a cracked screen. it wasn't really too big of a crack, just a scratch across the middle, but whatever, it's her money. she comes in with her son (probably around 10) and gives me the phone. here's how the conversation went. cl: can you fix my phone? me: sure, lemme take a look *i run a quick diagnostic, call the store, test the speakers etc. notice her home button doesn't work very well* me: okay, it looks like everything is working fine, but i noticed your home button was acting weird. were you aware of this? cl: yes, it does that me: okay, just wanted to make sure. sign here and i'll get you checked in. the repair will take about a half hour. after she signs i get started. the screens we have come only with the lcd digitizer and glass so i have to transfer the speaker, camera, home button, and flex cables over. about a half hour later she comes back. me: hello, i have your phone right here. i got the screen replaced and it works just fine now! cl: *tries it out* my home button doesn't work, did you break it? me: no, it was like that before the repair, remember we discussed that? cl: no you broke it! me: ma'am, we went over this after i tested the phone out. we do do home button replacements, but we don't have the parts in stock right now. do you want an estimate? cl: no you broke my fucking phone! i spend 100 fucking dollars and this is what i get?! im gonna sue you and take everything you have in this store! me: see right here on this paper you signed where i noted the home button problems under "prior issues". you knew before it was broken, don't try to pin this on us. if you want i can get you an estimate for a new button or you can speak to my manager, but he won't be back until tomorrow. cl: well im not paying for it then. me: okay, okay, i'll take a look at it again *cl hands it to me, looking smug. i put it in display case behind counter and lock it.* me: you can either pay for the screen, or i can take it off and give you your old one back. a business does a service, and in return they get payment, that's how it works. *cl considers her options, then finally says* "fine, take it off" i spend another half hour putting the old screen back on, and call her back. cl: about time you finished, you should know i'm giving you guys a bad review online. me: mhm, you do that. as she walks out i muster up the biggest grin i can manage, and say "have an absolutely wonderful day, miss!" she gives one last scowl and leaves. **edit:** woah, gilded in 5 minutes! thanks, whoever did that!so this tale starts with an irate customer and ends with confusion which i guess could be said of most tech issues. so to go back, a pissed off client of ours calls and explains he is having trouble with an area of our website that he is accessing via his imac. ok. we go through all the usual fixes and still the client is unable to access it. he gets more pissed off. we have a test machine in the office and we try to recreate the issue but cannot. which irriates him even more so we ask him to send us a screenshot so we can see it and verify 1) this guy is actually following our instructions 2) he is actually having the issue as he describes. at this point both the client and us are pissed at the situation and the client reluctantly agrees to send us a screenshot. me: "sir since we can't recreate the issue on our end, i'm going to ask you to send us a screenshot of the screen which you're having problems with. can you do that for us?" client" "*sigh* yes, fine. i'll send you a screenshot" me: "do you need me to walk you through the process?" client: "hardly...." so we wait for the screenshot and it doesn't show up. a couple of days later i receive a piece of mail which i open and after a minute of confusion break into laughter the client's "screenshot" that he sent consisted of a hand-drawn representation of what he was seeing on his screen. he even doodled in the desktop icons(i typed this before remembering i had the screenshot- sorry about the confusion) and wrote me a message outlining the situation. he had used a ruler to draw the borders of the screen.....needless to say i had to call him back to walk him through the process but goddamn it i've never laughed so hard in my life. not to mention the fact that he had to pay for a stamp to mail it to us... *edit** adding screenshot *edit2* holy smoke front page? that's pretty cool. *edit3* gold!? thank you!&gt;me: sorry for your wait, sir. my name is -meatspace name here- how can i help you? &gt;caller: i think there's something wrong with my computer. &gt;me: can you describe what it's doing? &gt;caller: it works just fine for awhile and then the screen turns blue. &gt;me: is your monitor failing? &gt;caller: no, the computer's broke. &gt;me: okay, what happens after the screen turns blue? &gt;caller: some letters flash and it restarts. &gt;me: does it say "an error has occurred and windows has been shut down"? &gt;caller: yeah, do you know what that is? &gt;me: it's called a blue screen of death in laymans terms. there's not-- &gt;caller, yelling: damnit! &gt;me: sir? &gt;caller: my damn daughter and her fancy degree. she told me that's what the problem was because college smarts and i bet her she was wrong. something's wrong with the world when a kid knows more than her parents! &gt;me: *shocked silence* &gt;caller: can i charge you for this? &gt;me: for what? &gt;caller: for making me owe her 10 bucks. &gt;me: ....um, no. &gt;*caller proceeds to hang up, mumbling more about "kids these days."* tl;dr: dude bet his daughter that his computer wasn't bsoding because he thinks something's wrong with kids having college degrees and then asked if he could charge my company the 10 bucks he now owes her for her being right.trouble was brewing at the restaurant. &amp;nbsp; this actually wasn't much of a surprise. trouble was always brewing at the restaurant as a result of the regular operating procedure. procedure which, i once again point out, usually revolved around the owner refusing to spend a penny on anything regardless of how necessary it was. therefore, we also had a couple of instances of promising *future* trouble. ticking time bombs. you know the drill. one of these was our new touch screen point of sale system. this was a very complicated, all singing and all dancing hardware/software solution from a fairly large and well known vendor. which i'd spent an entire panicked sunday (re)setting up from scratch after the owner freaked out on the vendor over cost, fired them before they finished the setup, and then buggered off on vacation to greece without telling anyone... after trashing our old point of sale system. [here's]( a refresher. did i mention the old point of sale system had to be replaced because she'd done exactly the same thing to its vendor and they refused to support us anymore? because i feel like that pattern is an important thing to remember. &gt;"they're just after my money!" she often fumed to no one in particular. "installation contracts, service contracts, updates! it's all a scam!" very little the owner ever said didn't come with an exclamation point at the end of it. &amp;nbsp; speaking of getting ripped off, the key rationale behind replacing our old system was her ironclad belief that money and ingredients were being stolen from the restaurant. the new register system had very comprehensive inventory, ingredient, and employee tracking features that she was convinced (perhaps by enthusiastic salesmen) that the supposed thefts could be solved via software. i pointed out more than once that the constant imbalances in the books probably had more to do with the secretive and byzantine "creative bookkeeping" she used to systematically rip off her employees of owed tips and wages, plus feeble attempts to con her vendors. plus the fact that her maintenance man -- who had a long and colorful history of alcoholism, drug abuse, theft, paranoia, and general untrustworthyness -- also had keys to the building *and* the safe and was the only other person aside from her who ever had unsupervised access to the restaurant. i didn't need a pipe and a magnifying glass to figure out where any stolen money was going, at any rate. the long and short of it was that *everything* was recorded in the system's audit log. we're talking maniacial levels of detail. every individual pizza topping added and removed to every order was tracked. which employee login was being used on which register. what the tender amount the cashier entered was, and how much change they were supposed to give. the length of delay between completing one order and entering another. how much time the operator spent on the credit card screen. i'm surprised she didn't want us to serial number the damn pepperoni. chief among the owner's ridiculous ideas about cash register security was that practically nothing should be able to be done on a register without requiring a manager override. this extended from logical things (like the ability to enter refunds) to absurd things (like the ability of most employees to clock in and out). need to remove a dish from an order before submitting it to the kitchen because a customer changed their mind? manager override. need to add to an order already placed? manager override. want to view your own logged hours? manager override. etc., etc. &amp;nbsp; there were only two users who had manager permissions: the owner, and me. and as soon as she figured out how to do it she revoked my access. this caused a fair few problems because everyone in the restaurant was using my override to, you know, get actual work done. anytime anyone needed to do *anything* they needed either me or the owner. so guess whose initials were all over the audit logs? yours truly. i caught a lot of static because of this. the owner loved her audit logs. she barely knew how to do anything else in the system except set up and change user accounts (e.g. hiring and firing people) and looking at the logs. and printing out the logs and waving them in people's faces while getting angry over imaginary transgressions. another feature of this system the owner loved were the rfid keys. every terminal had a little usb thingy on it with a pair of sockets into which you could plug rfid keyfobs. you could use these in lieu of override passwords (or any employee login), and as long as you had one plugged in any override prompt would be skipped using the credentials of the account associated with the most priveleged key plugged in at the time. the side effect of this that the owner loved the most was that it prevented people from figuring out her password, since she never had to enter it. the main weak link in this plan was the fact that the owner was only around about two days a week, tops. when she left she took her key with her. why would she leave it lying around? anyone could do anything with it, after all. the other weak link in this plan was that she could never remember her password, because she rarely had to enter it. she also changed it frequently, because unsurprisingly her current password got passed around the kitchen with lightning speed whenever anyone figured out what it was. i'll bet a lot of you have already figured out how this story ends. we were engaged in a battle of wills. the restaurant staff just wanted to be able to clock in and out when the owner wasn't around and were complaining to me (since i'd worked magic by setting the system up in the first place) when no one could do anything. the owner's asinine paranoia led to her locking everyone out of everything and she couldn't be made to see how this made doing business very difficult. then the inevitable happened. &amp;nbsp; &gt;"my password doesn't work!" the owner bellowed at me one day. &gt;"where's your key?" i asked from the kitchen. i was trying not to roll my eyes. i really was. &gt;"i can't find it! i think someone stole it," the owner said. &gt;"i find that highly unlikely," i replied. &gt;"fix it!" she ordered. &gt;"can't," i said, sounding more than a little smug. &gt;"what do you mean you can't?" &gt;"i used to be an administrator, just like you. but you changed my account. now i can't change anything. i can't even clock in without your key, remember?" &gt;"that is because everyone was using your account for everything!" &gt;"and that," i said, "was because you locked everyone *else* out of everything." &gt;"they are stealing from me! doctoring orders! changing money! i can't let them do anything in the system!" &gt;"and if you'd left people able to do their own work on their own account, you'd be able to tell who was doing this 'stealing' instead of seeing my initials all the time," i concluded for her. gears were turning very slowly in her head. &gt;"what do we do now?" she said. &gt;"call the vendor," i suggested, and shrugged. damned if i was letting this become my problem again. ultimately the owner called the vendor and after they were done lauging at her they changed some absurd per-incident support fee, reset her password, and mailed her a new keyfob. besides her bellyaching about it for ages, the main implication of this was that payroll was inexplicably "delayed" because she claimed she was locked out of the system for too long. (in reality, i think it was less than 12 hours.) the other upshot of this was that i overheard the owner's new password. this was rapidly getting out of hand. for the next month and a half or so, the restaurant ran like clockwork. the owner had fished her wish, and after changing her password yet again, no one was using it to do nefarious things like clock in and out or add pizzas to orders. she clamped down on user permissions even harder. for about a day at one point you even needed an override to enter in a new order. but employees were clocking in and out effortlessly even when the owner wasn't there. orders were getting written, served, assigned, and delivered. modifications were being made to tickets on demand, and the owner's audit log was filling up with pages and pages of flawlessly executed orders, with ingredients moving in and food moving out in perfect synchronization. meanwhile, my paychecks -- and only *my* paychecks -- were getting increasingly past due. everyone had their pay delayed by about two weeks following the password disaster, but mine was going on two months and still missing. i started job hunting in earnest while living off only my tips. i can only assume that this was a combination of retaliation for not being able to magically solve the owner's password issue (and thus costing her an expensive service call) plus the lingering suspicion that the reason everyone was having such a peachy time with the computer system was somehow my doing. well. &amp;nbsp; &gt;"again with this password!" the owner shrieked. she'd made a rare appearance at the restaurant one night. her office had a little window that overlooked the kitchen, so everyone could hear her yelling. sometimes it was at employees. usually these days it was at the computer. &gt;"get in here!" she ordered me. &gt;"have you finally found my paychecks?" i asked coyly. &gt;"i don't know what you're talking about!" she said evasively. &gt;"sure," i said. &gt;"this thing. does. not. work!" she screamed. &gt;"that's your old key," i pointed out. the one that was "stolen" all those weeks ago. &gt;"no it isn't!" she insisted. &gt;"yes it is," i said. "it's green. the new one is blue. but just put in your password." &gt;"that doesn't work either!" she complained. &gt;"you forgot it again." &gt;"no! i didn't forget! it won't work!" &gt;"call the vendor then," i suggested, and started to walk away. &gt;"absolutely not! that cost me two hundred dollars last time!" &gt;"well," i said tactfully, "i have no idea what you expect me to do about it. tech support is above my pay grade. i set your system up once for free before you locked me out and i'm not touching it again without pay. and considering you haven't paid me my normal hours in two months, i'm not pressing a single button until you settle up for both." she glared at me in silence for a while. &gt;"order up!" came the call from the kitchen. i shrugged and walked away. the next day the owner presented me with a wad of cash contianing about $150. &gt;"here," she said. "your damn money. ridiculous, holding me for ransom. everyone has their hands in my pockets, i see. so fix it." i carefully tallied up the bills before putting them away. &gt;"all right," i said. "but i never promised i could do anything about it. bring it up." she bought up the "change users" screen on one of the cash registers and tried to open her own account. the usual manager override prompt popped up. &gt;"let's try this," i said. carefully, deliberately, i entered a password. 6. 6. 6. the prompt went away. next to me, the owner was rapidly turning crimson, and then purple. i quietly edged out of the room before she exploded. &gt;**"what?!"** she shrieked. the dining room went silent. stunned patrons dropped their forks. "what was **that!?**" &gt;"number of the beast," i said cheerfully, sticking my head 'round the door from the kitchen. &gt;"whose password is that?" she demanded. &gt;"dunno," i said. "presumably the beast himself." &gt;"ridiculous," she spat. "how did you do that?" &gt;"do what?" i said, innocently. she stormed off to her office for the rest of the night. i didn't see her again until closing time. &amp;nbsp; she cornered be just before i walked out the door. &gt;"i want you to take that thing off my comptuer," she demanded. &gt;"and i need you to pay me my back wages," i responded casually. she did not respond. so i went home. &amp;nbsp; the next morning when i walked in the door i was immediately approached by bob, our previously mentioned habitually unreliable maintenance man. he handed me another wad of cash that was roughly equivalent to the amount of my outstanding paychecks. needless to say, the owner was not evident. &gt;"she wants you to fix the computer thingy," he said. &gt;"and where is she?" i asked. bob just shrugged. i tried the owner's cell phone and she picked up before the first ring was finished. &gt;"you got your stupid money, yes?" she asked accusingly. &gt;"yeah, it looks like it's all here," i said. &gt;"are you happy now? now i want that beast thing off my computers!" she barked. &gt;"you do realize it's the sole reason your business has been *functioning* for the last two months, right?" &gt;"i don't care!" she barked. "delete it!" &gt;"i think i'll pass," i said. "as a matter of fact, as of thirty seconds ago i quit. you have your password back, i'll let you take care of it." i had to hold the phone away from my ear with the onlaught of cursing that came down the line after this. &gt;"you are not allowed to quit!" she finally finished. &gt;"i'm not sure you're understanding how at-will employment works," i said. "i was quit when i came in here, and i'm twice as quit now." surely the reference was lost. more invective followed, so i put her on speaker. &gt;"...and you are huge [a-hole], and i hope you rot in hell! you owe me! you can't quit! i *own* you!" i leaned against the soda machine while this was going on, pretending not to pay attention. all work had stopped at the counter. customers were staring. &gt;"uh, who's that?" one of the customers asked. &gt;"the owner," i said. &gt;"oh," he said. and then walked out without ordering. &amp;nbsp; i would like to say that i followed that customer out the door to thunderous applause from the kitchen and waitstaff. company shirt thrown one way, rfid keyfob the other, out the front door with both middle fingers in the air as the music swelled and the camera panned out. roll credits. but, of course, it doesn't happen that way. instead i handed bob a shopping bag full of all my company shirts and my rfid key before quietly leaving out the back door. he caught up with me in the parking lot as i was adjusting my tie. cigarette hanging out of his mouth as usual. &gt;"where the hell are you off to?" he asked. &gt;"work," i said. &gt;"did... did you plan all this?" &gt;"i *always* have a plan," i told him. that was the last day i ever set foot in that place. &amp;nbsp; i still have some friends who work there. every once in a while i ask how things are going at the restaurant. to this day, the beast still roams the computer system. the owner has never deleted him even though technically she could. every time someone needs to clock in, write an order, or add extra pepperoni to a pizza (god forbid) the beast is there, watching over them. making the audit logs look pretty and turning the gears of business. protecting everyone from the owner. bringing up timesheets that have been tampered with when the labor board comes knocking. and, in an extraordinarily circuitous way, ensuring that the system is working as it was originally intended. everyone is happy. well, *almost* everyone.hello you lovely people. standard disclaimer for all of my stories: i am not it. i know how to use google and i enjoy pc gaming. this is sufficient for me to become the default "it" guy for friends, family, and occasionally colleagues. one thing i don't do anymore, for any cost, is support friends of friends or friends of family. or friends of colleagues. you get the idea. i used to support anyone and everyone who would ask for me, and was willing to pay my price (modest and reasonable fee, or a steak dinner). this is a tale of why i stopped that. also, the "no"s in this story are not an exaggeration, it went down on the client's end exactly as depicted. back story: friend of a friend runs a small dry cleaning business. she had been doing her books entirely on her home pc, in excel. for whatever reason, she wanted to start doing her books at her place of work, and thus, she needed a "business computer". enter: me, circa 2004. after listening to her list of needs, i pointed her to a very nice rudimentary hp at best buy that was well within her budget, and did everything she needed it to do (run ms excel). and it even came with a copy of microsoft office (not the trial version, i made sure of that), so it really was ideal for her use. i set everything up for her and transferred files over from her home pc to her new work pc. by which, i mean i moved one 32 kb .xls file via usb. the usb is important. see, she never once mentioned needing internet connection for her work pc, and i never asked. i figured it'd be safer that way, anyways. a week later, i get a call: &gt;owner: "hi, i can't check my emails." &gt;me: "oh, odd, there might be a brief internet outage in your area, you might want to wait 30 minutes or so. if it persists, give your isp a call." (thirty minutes later) &gt;owner: "it's been thirty minutes, my internet still is down, so i called comcast. they're saying they can't find my account information anywhere." &gt;me: "odd, you didn't change providers, did you?" &gt;owner: "no. nothing's changed since you set everything up." (aside: i also set up her home pc about a year prior, with comcast internet, and so i assumed this was all regarding her home pc. also, it's worth noting that her home was 5 minutes away from my home, while her business was a good 40 minute drive) &gt;me: "ok, it'll take me 5 minutes to get there, i'll swing by." &gt;owner: (happily) oh, are you in the area? good!" &gt;me: "...yeah, i'm at home." &gt;owner: "i'm at work." &gt;me: (realizing the miscommunication) "ohhhh, i never set your business computer up with internet because you never mentioned it. if you want internet, you'll have to contact comcast directly." &gt;owner: "no." (tone had grown very chilly) &gt;me: "ok. i can call them and set it up for you. standard rates apply since i'll be the middle man here." &gt;owner: "no." &gt;me: (huh?)"sorry, i didn't get that. what are you saying no to?" &gt;owner: "i'm not paying you again. i paid you once to set up my this computer, and you didn't finish the job." &gt;me: "you paid me to set up your computer. i did exactly that. you never mentioned needing or wanting internet." &gt;owner: "no." &gt;me: "...no to what?" &gt;owner: "no." &gt;me: "....ok, so i'm going to go now." &gt;owner: "no." &gt;me: "good bye." (hangs up) (10 minutes later) &gt;owner: (calls back)"i need internet." &gt;me: "...yeah, i heard you, you need to call comcast." &gt;owner: "no." &gt;me: "ok i'll call comcast for you." &gt;owner: "good." &gt;me: "after you pay me my fee." &gt;owner: "no." &gt;me: "no?" &gt;owner: "no." &gt;me: "no." &gt;owner: "no." &gt;me: "maybe." (by this point, i had stopped being angry, and i was wildly confused and more than a little amused). &gt;owner: "no." &gt;me: "bye." &gt;owner: "no." i hung up on her. 30 minutes later, i kid you not... &gt;owner: "no." &gt;me: "seriously?" &gt;owner: "yes." &gt;me: "yes." &gt;owner: "no." eventually, i tired of this and just blocked her number. never spoke with her after that incident, though our mutual friend later told me that when she becomes extremely angry, she often just repeats "no" like a robot stuck in a loop. so it wasn't just me, then. tl;dr: owner uses toddler mode! it's not very effective... (thanks to /u/politesarcasticthing for the suggestion)hi /r/talesfromtechsupport! i started helping with tech support at my job last week and immediately realized why the company helpdesk is doing everything to be as unreachable as possible. i got a call from a lady at our marketing department saying she had a problem with a browser. &gt;**me** what's the problem? &gt;**marketing lady** i need you to come down here to help &gt;**me** can't you just tell me what's wrong? &gt;**marketing lady** no i need you to come i sigh, put down the phone and make my way over there. to my horror, there it is, on her screen - a shiny internet explorer window, full of *horrendous* toolbars. &gt;**me** so, what's wrong? &gt;**marketing lady** i have ads constantly popping up everywhere despite the fact that i have adblock on &gt;**me** *(internally: there's adblock for ie?)* don't you have firefox installed? it's supposed to be on every computer at this company. &gt;**marketing lady** yeah, but i like internet explorer more. &gt;**me** \**sigh** okay, it might be some kinda adware - have you checked your computer for viruses? &gt;**marketing lady** no, i can't! &gt;*i get the feeling that i don't want to know the answer to my next question.* &gt;**me** why? &gt;**marketing lady** i don't have any antivirus software installed. &gt;**me** what? we have a company-wide licence for \*antivirus software*, who set up your computer? &gt;**marketing lady** no, no, it was installed when i got the computer, but the notifications were annoying me when i tried to install things. dear full-time tech support workers, i salute you for your patience. it truly is superhuman.howdy ~~tfr~~ tfts! so here's the deal, i work for a parking company and their pc's were quite dated, i'm talking made for windows xp dell optiplex pos (not point of sale) systems. well, they didn't have extended service through microsoft and their antivirus eventually ran out. msse doesn't support xp anymore, and the it guy said it would be fine since their behind a firewall. exact. words. anywho, a virus infected one of the desktops. stored itself on the shared drive, infected the crappy server they had and infected the other two desktops on the network. it dude freaks out, starts raging on my bosses and locks down the network after replacing all 3 desktops and nuking the drive. that was a bit overkill, but whatever.. i'm just an attendant. the new desktops (from 2002) come in, dude locks down the network so there's no internet access. this is crappy since our time clock polls every night to a different system in a different part of the city, and we need access to the internet for our event calendar. so, my boss asked dude to come fix it. he did the whole pecking order thing and convinced our upper management that they needed to buy extra stuff. my boss stepped in and said f-that. friday night after work i spent an *hour* configuring their desktops, updating the server and adding the proper addresses in the firewall to let things communicate with the outside world. it guy was pissed and threatened to cancel his contract, his boss bitched him out and gave them a discount and replaced him with a new guy, who appreciated what i did. they even offered me a job! anyways, today i come to work and go into the office to clock in. a fallout anthology collection is sitting on my bosses desk, i ask "who's is that?" my boss has this cheesy grin.. "upper management asked what would be a nice gift, and told me to go buy you something. they wanted to give you a bottle of jack, but i figured this would be cooler for you." i also got a free day of work on my paycheck. edit: [pic of the anthology collection](customer: you guys were the last ones to touch my computer and now it's not working. me: ok, let me check our tickets to see what was done. ok, the last visit we made to your office was 18 months ago. customer: that seems correct. you guys were here, and then it stopped working. me: so this computer has been sitting unused for a year and half? customer: no, i use it every day. ???? me: but you said we were the last people to touch it. customer: your guy was the last one to touch it who knew what he was doing. i don't know what i'm doing, so i really don't count that.*this story takes place during the period known as "last week", in the frozen wastelands of a land known as canada. the hero of our story had been battling a herd of wild rhinoviruses for days and now found himself on the losing side.* my daylight alarm clock graced me with simulated sunlight as it often does. i rolled over and muttered a curse at it, however the only sound that came from my mouth was white noise. crap, i'd completely lost my voice. i was also sick as a dog coated in mucous. definitely one to call in.. well, text. "no problem," my boss replied, "take all the time you need." yay. exactly 23 minutes later i had another message. "i know you're sick but we need you to come in. now." thanks, boss. but i was curious about what precipitated this request, so i said i'd stop by. by the time i showed up the workday had been going for about an hour, or should have been; half the office was at a standstill. my boss pulled me to one side and handed me a list. "everything's broken." she said. i tried to squeak out a question but i couldn't even manage a whisper. instead, i had to resort to semaphore with my majestic eyebrows. *everthing?* i gestured. "yes, everything." she replied without missing a beat. "start with the printer." now, you might think being that sick at work with that much crap hitting the fan is a bad thing--i certainly did--but it's actually liberating. *no one* wants to bother you when you look like something scraped off the hull of a boat. i checked the first item on the list. "printer can't print anymore." *all right, let's have a look.* as i entered the room people fled like oil from dish soap. i looked at the printer and wheezed out a laugh, among other things. someone had accidentally paused it, as evidenced by the blinking "pause" indicator. next on the list. "computer can't print anymore." thankfully pushing resume solved this issue too. "server won't restart." i thought this would have been at the top of the list but whatever, i didn't write it. turns out the ups died an ungraceful death that very morning. and on it went for about two snot-filled hours. somehow nearly every electronic device in the office managed to get sick along with me. my boss came to the same conclusion, so i think it was only half a joke that i'm not allowed to leave anymore. tl;dr: beware the groooove.ok, so the [previous tale]( happened a few weeks ago, and after the awesome response i got from you guys, i called up $friend to get an update. the investigation ended a few days after the charge was reversed, and the investigation found that there was no wrong-doing in the part of the company, but their lawyers suggested a change in their terms of service. the lady later called back, crying, because she took out a bank loan to pay for the server and had no way to pay it back without the profit of the pottery company, which is why she had to reverse the charge. the call was being recorded, and she confessed all that, so the recording was given to the police and the fraud charges were dropped. my friend asked her why she got such a big server, and apparently she thought that 1gb of ram meant that 1 person could access the website at once, so she wanted 250 to be able to get onto it at once. in the end, no real harm was done to the company, beyond legal fees (which were paid by the woman, since she fraudulently declared fraud) and the initial deployment cost of the server. she was, obviously, placed on the no-service list of the company.just want to say i just found this sub and love it. i created a google sheet for our head of principals so that he could track the ordering of it equipment and share it with our in school techs. i wrote a small script that sends any info to another sheet (so the techs only see what they need to) and to sort by column 3, 1, 2 in that order. it works well and i am happy with it. he shares this document with his secretary , who works in our it department. i came in one morning and 7 people were around her desk because she is saying nothing has worked for 30 minutes. no matter what she types it doesn't appear. 7 it people, 1 google sheet. i walk over and look, she has grey cells , and guess what ? she had grey font. 7 it people couldnt see the font colour. ah edit : my first post made it to front page...im geeking out and want to say thanks to all of you. i look forward to enjoying many a tales from the board/u/rawkout1337's story reminded me of my own experience with "please hurry". i don't work in tech support (ready your pitchforks…), i'm a developer. i've had plenty of roles that have involved doing stuff outside by job due to a combination of 'small company' and 'all computer work is the same'. anyway, i was working for a small web dev company that sold software to the public sector. it was all about public engagement, so we had some enthusiastic clients who really wanted to use it and others that didn't really care as long as they were *seen* to care. this particular month, we'd been adding a few features for our first client in a new country, even though it seemed to be one of the box-ticking clients it was a good excuse to get the features ready for the serious users. it got to the day before launch and i was told to put the site live on the internet. i asked for the hosting details and was told that the only decision made was to use aws. so, i start putting together the machines we'll need and i ask about budget. none. there was literally no hosting budget at all, so convinced this client was about the fact it was a box-ticking exercise. i asked if we could ask the client for something in writing about how little traffic they were expecting, and got back "maybe two or three sessions a day. we're only referencing it in one place." so, fine, it's their money, i put it on a small instance and go home. true, i had the next day off, but what could the harm be? it's only going to be mentioned in one place, they're expecting a dozen or so sessions all day, if it's slow we'll bolster it a bit and we'll have data to show to the client that it's needed. the next day, i'm at home watching tv having not long woken up, and i get a call. "get in here, now. fires". sure, i say, i'll hop in the shower and head over to the office, i'll be there in an hour. "not soon enough. skip the shower, we don't mind, we've sent a taxi. get in now." fine. i get in the taxi to go half a mile to the office. the first thing i see when i get in is three people starting ec2 instances as quickly as they could. the hosting budget had been increased by this point to be effectively unlimited. you see, it turns out that the client's session estimate was a little off. they were right, it was only announced in one place, however that one place was a speech. made by the country's head of state. on television. and covered in the morning news on all channels. it all worked out in the end, but it involved working until 4am half-arsing all the performance fixes we could think of until the site was stable enough to turn off the additional instances added during the day. you've never configured varnish until you've done so with representatives of the executive wing of a foreign government shouting "we've got a patient who's bleeding. what are you going to do to stop the bleeding?" at you.hello tfts! never posted here, but my dad told me quite a good story from his days in tech support and i couldn't help but share it. so back in the 80's my dad worked for a company that gave tech support to offices so they wouldn't have to hire a designated it guy. one day he got a call from a client who claimed she lost all of her work at lunch, every day. my dad clearly didn't believe her so he went to the client's office the next day and followed her daily routine. throughout the morning, she did her work and saved it on a floppy disk, all good. then came lunchtime, oh boy. my father said to the client, "o.k, it's lunch, what do you do?" the client then took out the floppy disk, and **pinned it to her filing cabinet using a magnet.** it took him a while to explain to the client that magnets mess up floppy disks, and any kind of computer hardware. edit: this is like 2 months later so not a lot of people will see this, but thanks for all the likes 'n' stuff! my dad wasn't as excited as i was, with an "oh cool" representing his amount of excitement for the support it got. but for me, thanks for all the support and especially anyone who posted a comment, got some good stories and laughs out of them.*i work for a company that is contracted to provide government support. we have many contractors, but government employees outnumber us about 10:1. as such, they feel they can act and treat us any way they like. * i am sitting in the call center about 90 minutes prior to the end of my shift. i get a call from a particularly nasty customer &gt;**rik:** $supportdepartment, how can i help you? &gt;**$customer:** yeah, your ticketing system is broke. &gt;**rik:** give me just a moment, let me take a look at it. *i log in, verify i can submit, resolve, re-assign, and modify tickets. i check the srm, imc, and woc. nothing is remiss.* &gt; **rik:** i can't see any issue on my end, can you tell me the exact error you're seeing? &gt; **$customer:** yeah it's $knownerror &gt; **rik:** ah, i see. i just so happen to know how to fix that. can i remotely access your machine? *he agrees, i do so. i modify some of the ticket details, and do a once-over on the ticket itself. i notice he is requesting three separate actions, and he is trying to assign it directly to a technician, which is against policy.* &gt; **rik:** sir, this will have to be submitted as three tickets. &gt; **$customer:** why? i've always done it like this. &gt; **rik:** you're requesting work on three machines. that is three tickets. in addition, you cannot directly assign it to a technician. that's done on our end. that's the policy. &gt; **$customer:** well i'm not changing how i do it. *i look over to my supervisor, who happens to be in the room. i inform him of the situation. he tells me to enforce the policy, which is to inform the customer that his actions are not permitted and will be cancelled if he submits it.* &gt;**rik:** sir, while you have the ability to assign the ticket to a technician, that technician might not be available. just because he is the one that responds the majority of the time does not mean he will always be available. in order to provide you with quick and consistent service, we assign the tickets to the technicians based on their workload and current taskings. if this ticket is submitted and directly assigned, it will be cancelled. also, this must be submitted as three tickets, or else it will be cancelled as well as an improper submission. *my supervisor is next to me and gives me a thumbs up. i finish the call, disconnect from his machine, and walk over to my supervisor. &gt; **rik:** well that was fun. &gt; **$supervisor:** let me know what happens. chances are he's going to submit it anyways. *i check, and sure enough, that technician has a new ticket assigned. i cancel the ticket, sending the customer an email, cc'd to $supervisor, $shiftlead, and $departmentmanager. i get a call from him about five minutes after, yelling at me for cancelling his ticket. i send him a copy of our policy (which isn't new) and tell him the specific paragraphs that were violated. he hangs up mid-conversation. i then see another ticket assigned to the same tech, from the same person, with the same exact request. this is cancelled and emails are sent again. this happens twice more that shift. the next morning, i arrive at work and see that he waited for me to leave before doing it again. the technician has already begun working on this ticket, so i cannot cancel it.* *i open outlook and find an email from $departmentmanager, with $supervisor and $shiftlead cc'd. the email is a meeting location and time. all four of us arrive at the meeting location, when $departmentmanager suggests going outside for the conversation. we go out to the smoking area where $supervisor and $departmentmanager start smoking. i start vaping, and $shiftlead looks a bit peeved as $shiftlead is the only one that does not partake. i fill in all three of the saga between $customer and myself.* &gt; **$departmentmanager:** well, that explains why he filed a complaint against you. &gt; **rik/$supervisor:** he did what?! &gt; **$departmentmanager:** yep. said you were rude, unprofessional, and obscene. he also said you had a demeaning tone. &gt; **$supervisor:** that's a load of bullshit right there! i was standing right next to him and told him what to say. he was lucky he didn't have to deal with me because i'm tired of his shit. &gt; **$departmentmanager:** and that's why we're out here, in an informal environment. instead of the conference room where i'd write your ass up for that. *we all laugh a little because that week was so stressful, we were all about to crack. finally, it all gets sorted out. $departmentmanager says he will contact $customer's supervisor regarding the issue. $shiftlead leaves, and goes back to work. the three of us still smoke/vape outside for a few more minutes. $supervisor and i discuss ways to prevent the situation from happening in the future. i suggest revoking his ticketing credentials and have him use the srm as normal customers do. i go back to my desk and modify the $customer's account in our ticketing system to reflect the changes. ten minutes later, i get another call* &gt; **rik:** $supportdepartment, how can i help you? &gt; **$customer:** yeah, your ticketing system is broke. &gt; **rik:** what seems to be the issue? &gt; **$customer:** i can't submit tickets, i can only request services. &gt; **rik:** we have recently revoked submission rights from everyone but department heads and technicians. if you submit a service request, a ticket will be generated and routed appropriately. &gt; **$customer:** (very infuriated) who are you to tell me what i can and can't do? give me ticketing rights or i'm going right to your boss. &gt; **rik:** can't do that, sir. if you have a complaint, i suggest contacting your department head or the $supportdepartmentcoordinator. the customer hangs up, and i don't hear anything for another hour. out of the blue, a knock lands on our door. our office is restricted to authorized personnel, enforced by rfid access cards. only technicians have authorization to enter this room, as well as most management. i answer the door with my foot braced against it. the customer attempts to push his way through me and fails. when that occurs, he begins screaming. during his tirade, a few people had stopped to watch. i still have not let him in the office. we then hear a voice that was quite loud, and quite pissed off. &gt; **mysteryvoice:** what is going on here? *he turns, and i poke my head out the door. not two feet away is a very tall, very pissed high ranking official. his uniform instantly gave away who he was. $customer stops mid-sentence and turns white.* &gt; **$official** how about we continue this conversation somewhere more appropriate. my office. five minutes. bring your leadership, i don't care what they are doing. *i find $supervisor and $departmentmanager, interrupt the meeting they are having, and inform them of what occurred. both follow me to $official's office. in that office, we find $official, $officialsecretary, $customer, $customerboss, and a few other people i don't recognize. the conversation gets very brutal, very quickly. $official has to silence everybody, and then he looks at me.* &gt; **$official:** rik, what was that about? *i tell him and stumble over quite a few of my words (i have really bad anxiety i take ativan for), and finally get the whole story out, my body shaking. i feel nauseous and certain i'm going to lose my job. $official dismisses me and my leadership, and we walk outside. we start smoking/vaping, and wait to see the result. fifteen minutes later, $official is standing outside the building, holding it open while two security guards walk $customer outside and to his car. they remove his id, access cards, and give him a box of all of his stuff from his desk.* ever since then, most of the people that work here have begun treating us like people. apparently the government never knew how bad we were being treated, but they put a stop to it after that. this wasn't the first time something like this had happened, but i haven't heard anything close to this happen since then. i did a lot of unpaid it work in high school and was fairly knowledgeable, so when i got to college in 2005 applying to my university's help desk seemed to be a logical choice. since it was my first "professional" interview, i was really nervous about it. before now, i had just worked retail and as a line cook/dishwasher at a local cafe...two jobs basically given to me with no real interview. when i arrived for my interview, it was in one of the it conference rooms...very professional, very business like. the gentleman interviewing me wore a suit and had a stone cold, expressionless face. sitting across from me, after a quick greeting/exchange of names, he started the interview by saying "i'm a user, my computer doesn't work. fix it." he just sat there, staring at me...no computer in sight. i said "well, what exactly is it that you're trying to do that won't work?" "use my computer. it won't work. fix it." he said, still emotionless. "what's displayed on your monitor at the moment?" i asked. "i don't know that that means. my computer isn't working and i can't check my email or grade student assignments. fix it!" i just kind of stared for a moment...kind of in shock at how the interview was going but realizing this was probably a fairly common user interaction. "is...is it plugged in?" i asked, no sure of what else to do with no actual computer in this hypothetical and fairly high stress at this point interview. my interviewer looked at me, grinned mischievously, reached across the table to shake my hand and said "you're hired, you'll do well here," and then got up and walked out. another person came in shortly after and asked me to fill out a w-4. and that's how i got my first "real" it job.my boss runs the it department with... what's stronger than an iron fist? an osmium bear hug? today i found out just how harsh he can be when crossed. phone call comes in. i take it, it's a (relatively speaking) small company calling us. me: "this is jimmy_serrano, how can i help you today?" them: "we lost some data. a surge protector failed and all the disks in an array got fried. we were using your hard disks, model number [redacted]. we'll need [$number] new disks of that model number." me: "sure, we can ship you [$number] new hard disks." i type in the order. them: "do you do data recovery?" boss joins in on the line. "we do in fact do data recovery. the cost is [$cost]." them: "that's too expensive. can you do it for [$lower cost]?" boss: "no. the cost is [$cost]. we will be glad to do it for that price and we will put it as a top priority if you ship us the damaged disks." them: "we really can't afford that." boss: "fine. we'll be happy to ship you [$number] new disks, then." them: "you are being totally unfair! we're a small company, we can't afford to pay [$cost] for data recovery!" boss: "we have to charge [$cost] to cover the time and expense required to recover the data." them: "[expletive] you, you money-grubbing [expletive]!" boss: "as of now, we are terminating your business association with us. we will ship you the replacement disks. i wish you good luck in the future. goodbye."i was tech support for a nation wide hair salon company. hair stylists are not the most tech savvy people. &gt;stylist: hi tech support, some random buttons were accidentally hit on the keyboard and it locked our door. &gt;me: .....i'm sorry can you explain that again. do you mean the computer is locked. like its on the ctr-alt-delete screen. i was thinking the (windows key + l) was hit. &gt;stylist: no, a shampoo bottle was knocked off the shelf and it hit some buttons on the keyboard that made the door shut and lock. we just had it opened. after the bottle fell, the door automatically closed and we heard a click sound like a lock. &gt;me: well i can tell you right now, no combination of keys on your computer is going to physically shut and lock a real door. do you have keys for the door. &gt;stylist: we don't have any keys and there is no keyholes anyways. wait, one of the other stylist said she saw which part of the keyboard the bottle hit and she is going to try dropping the bottle on it again. &gt;me: no don't do that, it's not going to work....... too late she had put the phone down and i could heard the stylists in the background. bam, bam. "no its still locked. try it again." &gt;me: hello?! don't...don't do that. please stop that! bam bam bam bam &gt;me: heelllloooo?! i could still hear them in the background. bam, "hey it worked that time. it's unlocked now!" &gt;stylist: ok, we got it unlocked now, it just took a few tries. &gt;me: that worked!? &gt;stylist: yeah, we're good now thanks! turns out a mop had been placed on the inside corner of the closet and when the shampoo bottle fell, it caused the mop to fall across the back of the door. shutting and holding it in place. dropping the bottle cause the mop to move again. a few years ago i took over a sysadmin job at a highschool because my predecessor was sick and there was no estimate on when he'll come back. (he came back a year later and was fine) the system was in a catastrophic state and i had to re-install most of the servers over the summer and upgrade the 15 year old software that was running the school. this included deleting the old active directory domain and users and basically remodeling the whole school. a few weeks after school started again a senior came to me and said in a kind of angry voice: &gt; "excuse me, when will my domain admin account work again? i can't log on to the new servers!" i thought i misheard him or he meant his local machine or something but he was serious. the old admin had absolutley no technical skills and just learned how to use some systems but he gave selected students **domain admin accounts** so they can manage the system (also the file servers with the teachers files on them) for him and also once a year log onto every computer and install windows updates by hand (yes, once a year) when i told the headmistress about the whole thing she was furious and when the original sysadmin came back he wasn't put in it anymore and i still manage that schoola few weeks ago, one of my users was surprised by a "loud noise" at a job site, and dropped a large container of coffee directly onto/into her laptop's keyboard while the laptop was on. it's been my experience that if *any* liquid is dropped near a laptop it unerringly finds its way into the laptop - it's like a law of nature. it should be noted that i quite literally just deployed this laptop, user had it no more than 3 weeks total. anyway, i called the oem &amp; discovered that our warranty doesn't include adp - accidental damage protection - and i'd have to send it back to them &amp; get a quote for repair. i remembered [reading this]( on tfts some months back, and decided to try it out. i added three large bags of swedish fish to the laptop box (approx $10 total), &amp; shipped it off for repair. i've been expecting an email from the oem about it for a few weeks, but received nothing until yesterday afternoon - the reason for service in the email was marked as "can't power off", even though i explicitly stated that it was a "liquid damage" issue... they replaced the mobo &amp; ram, and updated the bios for basically free (well, three bags of candy). everyone in my group thought this was absolutely hilarious. honestly, i'm surprised that it worked! **tl;dr**: candy makes you dandy! thanks for the gold, friendly redditor!!i work in it security and am rolling out pci-dss compliance at a customers location. we're in the ad/gpo phase where we bring on complex password requirements, screen lock timeouts, etc. i get a call to help a user out who was missed on the list of users at a location to get the new requirements. so of course i call to help him out: &gt;me: hi user, it appears you were missed on the rollout of the new security requirements; i've added you to the security groups. we need to change your password, i'm going to remote in and be there if you need me. sounds good? &gt; user: yep come on in! i remote in. &gt; me: great. now i'm going to need you to log out and log back in so you can choose a new password. user logs out. &gt; me: okay now enter you current password and you should be prompted to change it. &gt; user: actually i don't need to enter a password. i found a way to bypass the password by just clicking the circle with the arrow on it next to the password field. &gt; me: oh really, can you show me how you do this? &gt; user: sure! user clicks the login button with no password and gets the password change prompt. i then realize the user has no password on his account. &gt; user: see, isn't that neat!? good thing you guys are bringing in better security! &gt; me: that's what we are here for sir! now lets get you that new password... so this just happened, literally just happened. i walk into my neighborhood bar, and they had just had a five minute power loss. it looks like everything came back up, except for the pos terminal behind the bar. looking at the case from my barstool, it's a mid-2000's dell desktop. i saunter over to the bartender (friend of mine), and ask in my best john wayne voice, "can i be of assistance, ma'am?" she is on the phone with the manager, trying to get the thing started, and says "sure, go ahead and try." the screen has frozen on a keyboard not detected error, you know, press f1. i've got this. walked into their office, and unplug the first keyboard i see, and walk back out with it. plug it in, f1, and we are in. didn't even need a ps/2 to usb adapter. of course it's xp. everything fires up, but some terminal windows come up with a message of "transaction logs not found". the system reboots. as patrick stewart would say in his best captain picard voice, "damn." ok, i think i've got this. our company, like so many others will milk old computers for as long as they can (seriously, why not?). all our old computers that are not on ups give us hell on loss of power. go into bios settings, and the computer has reverted to 2003. tell the computer it's 2015, and it fires up, no problem. the bar explodes in a standing ovation as drinks are flowing once more, laurels are placed on my head, the mayor (actually in the bar, she's a regular) commands a parade in my honor, and i am told that the bar is buying my drinks tonight. glad i'm not working tomorrow.well, since my last story was (justifiably) taken down, i dug up another one from my memories. two years ago, a teacher at my school who is *super* tech-illiterate needed some help with her ipad. she told me that it wouldn't turn on, so i asked to see it. there were no visible signs of damage. i asked her when it broke, and she told me that it had broken over winter break when she was in hawaii. i asked her if she knew what happened to it, and she said to me: &gt;$teacher: well, i dropped it in the sand on the beach. and? there wasn't a single grain of sand... &gt;skateguy2000: i don't see any sand on it or in it. how did you get the sand out of it? &gt;$teacher: i walked down to the water and rinsed it off, silly! wut. &gt;skateguy2000: you mean, you wiped it off with water or you actually rinsed it in the ocean. &gt;$teacher: i dipped it in the water and rinsed it off. is something wrong with that? &gt;skateguy2000: actually, yes. something is wrong with that. you can't put your electronics in water. she looked at me like she had just witnessed a murder. &gt;skateguy2000: water conducts electricity, and the electronic parts inside the ipad that aren't supposed to touch will make electrical contact, and it will break. &gt;$teacher: but i've washed off my phone and laptop before! i stared at her for a few seconds. then i looked at the ipad. then back at her. &gt;skateguy2000: it's a miracle they survived that. you shouldn't do that in the future. she walked away in silence. sometimes people just need some common sense talked into them. **edit:** holy shit this blew up thank you all so much! **edit 2:** to everyone who keeps talking about distilled and ultrapure water, i know about all that stuff. i just wasn't going to explain all of that to her for fear that she would misunderstand and make the same mistake again because, generally, water is not something you want around (and especially inside) your electronics.hey guys! so, i posted this about two years ago but had to remove it. i'm reposting it again because you liked it so much. a bit of back story, i work at an isp that deals with fixed-wireless and satellite internet to reach rural customers. i do tier 2 support for all 9 platforms that we offer. for those of you not familiar with the technology used here's the breakdown fixed-wireless (fw) technology uses a point-to-multipoint system where our customers have a transeiver on their roof (basically their modem, which is connected to a power over ethernet adapter indoors) that gets a signal from a tower in the area ... essentially just an over glorified router that sends the signal up-to 30km or 20miles away. satellite internet works the same way as your tv satellite but in full-duplex. simple enough? not for some... as you can imagine both of these mediums for providing an internet connection can have a few draw backs, like weather, line of sight and best of all the, the customer tampering with the equipment. this story involves one of the fw systems that we have and a customer that is fairly new to the whole "high speed internet game" &gt;me: "thank you for calling megacorp technical how can i help you" &gt;customer: "yeah we just got megacorp installed today and it won't work" &gt;me: "okay ma'am let's see what we can do, (after looking into her modem i see that it is online and should be working properly) okay ma'am do you connect to the internet wirelessly or by an ethernet cable" &gt;customer: "how can i tell?" &gt;me: "well do you see a small black power supply that says motorola and has a green light? if you follow that cable can you tell me what it's plugged into?" &gt;customer: "it says tp-link" &gt;(so i get the model number and google a picture of it) &gt;me: "okay ma'am that black box with the silver trim and the green lights, it might be warm to the touch... do you see what i'm talking about?" &gt;customer: "oh yes i see it" &gt;me: "perfect i want you to unplug it" &gt;(after asking her to unplug the router she gets up and starts walking, i then hear something fall on the floor... a fork or a knife maybe...i start to get worried) &gt;customer: "okay it's unplugged" &gt;(i look at my screen and can clearly see that our modem still has an ethernet link) &gt;me: "ma'am i still see that the router is plugged in...what did you unplug?" &gt;customer: "it says kenmore!" &gt;(awkward silence...) &gt;me: "umm ma'am did you unplug your blender?" &gt;customer: "no, i unplugged my toaster" &gt;(another awkward silence...) &gt;me:"umm okay...may i ask why?" &gt;customer: "you told me to unplug my black box with the silver trim, green light and it..." &gt;me: "it's warm to the touch yes...(i apparently face-palmed audibly enough that people around me heard and poked their heads up) ummm can i get you back over to where your modem is and out of your kitchen?" tl;dr- asked customer to unplug her router after giving a description and she unplugged her toaster this is my second one today ([tada!]( but they're both fairly short so i figured i could get away with posting another. we got a support request in our ticketing system (pronounced "mailing list") today that i thought was particularly obtuse. &gt;subject: *"how do i get this script to work?"* &gt;body:"i'm trying to use this script: *'path to script here'* but i keep getting this error message. *'unable to run script: have you checked the "preferences: allow scripts to run" setting?'"* my coworker turned around, gave me a look of disbelief, and replied to his email, copy/pasting the end of the error message verbatim as his only response: *"have you checked the 'preferences: allow scripts to run' setting?"* the user's reply? &gt;"wow, that worked! how'd you figure it out so quickly?" tl;dr - reading and breathing at the same time is hard.background: i do inbound technical support for a large company that sells electronic devices including phones and computers. one day i get a call from an elderly woman ($elderly) who has travelled overseas and is currently living on her daughter’s ($daughter) property. $elderly’s phone and tablet have been giving her some error messages when she tries to access the internet. &gt; ot (me): thanks for contacting [large company], my name is oz_town, how can i help you today? &gt; $elderly: hi ot, i have a phone and tablet with me, and i can’t get them to access the internet anymore. would you be able to help me? &gt; ot: sure, give me some background information regarding the issue and i’ll see what i can do.” &gt; $elderly: ok, well up until this morning they worked fine. i was able to access my email account and browse google, but then this morning i get an error “cannot connect to network”. i contacted my wireless carrier back in [overseas country] but they referred me to you guys.” *it’s unlikely her phone/tablet would have been utilising a cellular network, especially with international roaming charges. so fair enough* &gt; ot: hmmm ok, now i’m assuming you’re using a home wifi network to connect these devices to the internet, correct? &gt; $elderly: yes i think so, but it’s weird, because all the other phones and computers are working. my daughter and her kids haven’t had any issues. *it’s extremely unlikely that two devices blew their wifi connections at the same time, so i delve deeper into possible issues with their home network* &gt; ot: [insert generic home network troubleshooting questions here]. *suddenly $daughter’s voice comes over the line.* &gt; $daughter: this is $elderly’s daughter, i’m not sure why you’re insinuating our wifi network is the problem, my mother’s two devices are the only ones having issues. everything else works fine. *sigh* &gt; ot: i understand, but before i go any further i just want to double check a few things. can you bring up a webpage on your phone? &gt; $daughter: i’ve already told you our devices are working, it’s just my mothe…..oh…. what... i’m getting “cannot connect to network as well”. *[prolonged sigh]. at this point most users get the message and see where i’m going with this* &gt; ot: can you turn off your phone's wifi, and try the webpage on cellular data please? *lo and behold, it works on cellular data, but not on wifi.* &gt; $daughter: well now that means three of your devices don’t work, this is ridiculous! it’s clearly an issue with them, because i have multiple computers in the house that still work fine on the same wireless network. i was just on facebook before! &gt; ot: are they connected to your network wirelessly or via an ethernet cable? &gt; $daughter: everything in my house is wireless, that’s why i’ve told you it’s an issue with your hardware! *$daughter had mentioned her computer was a desktop. even in the 21st century, it’s unusual for a desktop to be connected wirelessly, so i obviously did not believe her.* &gt; ot: sure, i believe you. what i would like to do is for you to go to your computer and test a website for me again. *she huffs and begrudgingly walks over to the computer* &gt; $daughter: it works fine! i told you! &gt; ot: so just to be 100% certain, you have not plugged an ethernet cable from your router into the ethernet port on your computer? &gt; $daughter: how many times do i have to tell you? this computer is wireless! the only cables plugged in are for power, the monitor, and keyboard/mouse. &gt; ot: would you be able to double check the back of the computer? just to be sure? &gt; $daughter: this is ridiculous, i’ve said it 5 times, there’s no ethernet cable plugged in! *i make up some bullshit to convince $daughter to check* &gt; ot: ok gotcha, however sometimes a cable can press against the ethernet port, which can cause network issues on other devices connected to the same router. could you have a quick look for me? *cue 10 seconds of shuffling the desktop around* &gt; ot: so what can you see? any cables pressing against it? &gt; $daughter: there’s an ethernet cable plugged in. *and there it is. finally, i am victorious. time to let this user know who is in charge now.* &gt; ot: sorry, *the line cut out for a second*, could you repeat that for me? &gt; $daughter: there is an ethernet cable plugged into the ethernet port. *i could practically hear her grinding her teeth in the background* &gt; ot: so the computer is *not* connected wirelessly? &gt; $daughter: no. unfortunately, as most of you fellow techs know, users will almost never admit they were wrong, and this was the best i could get. finally, i was able to troubleshoot the wifi network, and determine that it wasn’t able to establish a connection to whatever provider she was using for internet. i verified the devices had no hardware issues, then told her to contact said provider for further support. i spent a few years on help desk for an airline before becoming a software dev. i’ll never forget my first call from $pilot. &gt;$me: "thanks for calling help desk, how can i help you?" &gt;$pilot: "you guys keep breaking everything!" &gt;$me: "what's wrong?" &gt;$pilot: "nothing is working! maybe if you did your job this wouldn't happen!" i don’t let people treat me like that but i was more interested in his problem - because if a critical system was down we need to know. he finally calmed down a little. my co-workers started looking at me. &gt;$me: "... so what's not working?" &gt;$pilot: "i can't login to my e-mail. why did you break it?!" &gt;$me: "we didn't break anything. i just pulled up your account. it got locked out due to bad password attempts." &gt;$pilot: "listen! if you want it fixed, just say the word and i'll call my son. he works for microsoft. i’ll have him drive over there so this won’t happen again! he'll get everything fixed for good." &gt;$me: "that's not necessary. all we need to do is change your password." &gt;$pilot: "but my son works for microsoft!" i give him his new password and he promptly hangs up. i find out this user is constantly in trouble with hr for putting down employees, but unions make it difficult to do anything about it. bonus: fast-forward two months. payroll gets new software that only works on windows. $pilot calls in wanting us to install it but only has apple devices and complains about the compatibility. you don’t know how bad i wanted to say “but your son works for microsoft!” tl;dr: user locks out his account due to bad password attempts, blames helpdesk and threatens to send his son over to fix it. i worked tech support abroad, and we had a boss that was something out of the ordinary. we did 1st and 2nd line helpdesk work in our respective native languages. our teamleader, bbbbb (for big bad badass bastard boss), did not speak our language, so he was useless for day-to-day operations, but man, was he ever godsent for handling the internal troubles. the man was in his 40s, fat, short, red-haired and bearded. he was so cynical that he could make vestal virgins cry. he was blunt, honest, straightforward and called bullshit when he saw and heard it. naturally, the management hated him. he had, however, saved their collective arses more than once, and with his complete disregard for their opinions on him, his knowledge and experience, they could not get rid of him. he also had the smoothest silk tounge i have ever seen from a tech guy. small, ugly and fat and balding, he still chatted up the most beautiful girls on account of his tounge and being the most confident bastard ever. i still aspire to be like him (not completely, but in many things) and i learned a lot from him. here are some war stories from the 18 months i spent at that god-forsaken place. **team meeting.** bbbbb brings up a powerpoint presentation with lots of animations, sound, colours and short snippets of text. bbbbb: "whoops, sorry. that was the presentation for management." bbbbb brings up another presentation with lots of text and acronyms. me: "you have a different presentation on the account for management?" bbbbb: "yes, you have to. management is retarded. consider them drooling sheep to be herded in the right direction. and if they get this presentation, they go 'oooh, pretty colours!' and i can get what i want. if i show them your presentation, they'll get bored and annoyed that they don't understand and decide against what i reccomend out of spite." **doorwatcher** collegue: "hey, do you know that your boss is staring at a door?" me: "what?" collegue: "yeah, he has spent at least 10 minutes just staring at a door." me: "really? he must be waiting for someone." collegue: "he's standing a metre away from it, staring at it." me: "i am sure there's some explenation..." collegue: "who knows. ask him when he comes back. anyway, i have work to do. see you." another 15 minutes pass, and then bbbbb shows up. bbbbb: "hi [vonadler]. what's up?" me: "trying to get a hold of customers that wont answer their phones, as usual. what about you?" bbbbb: "i just spent 45 minutes staring at door." me: "what? why?" bbbbb: "i wanted to talk to the manager inside. i knocked, he told me off, saying 'i'm busy!!!", so i waited outside until he came out, pointed at him and said, 'now you're not busy, now we deal with this.' poor guy probably just wanted to use the loo." me: "...". **stealing our own equipment.** we worked 2nd line helpdesk, and as a part of our instructions, we were to have dual screens, one to remote take over the customer's system on, one to have our own systems on (this was standard on all help desks, even 1st line in our native country, but not where we were working now). we got brand new flatscreens to replace our crt screens (in 2005!) with and started fighting about the graphics cards. bbbbb thought we could just open the computers and put in a new one (stationary ones, so it was easy). asset management threatened that we would lose support. we said, hey, we are 2nd line windows support, we can support our own computers. asset management then said we would void any hardware warranty if we opened the computers. so that was that. instead, we purchased silly expensive crappy usb graphics cards (at least 20 times the cost of a basic graphics card capable of having two screens) and stashed them in our lockable drawers, waiting for our second flatscreen. and waited, and waited. after several months, bbbbb went more or less ballistic. new equipment was arriving every week, but we did not get anything of it. instead, it was used to replace old crt screens at the sales department. so, he went after a manager about it. bbbbb: "so when is my team getting their second screens." manager: "well, we have other needs to prioritise right now." bbbbb: "so, you are saying we are not getting them?" manager: "it has worked fine for two months already, has it not? i don't think you really need them." bbbbb: "we have the budget for it." manager: "well, going under budget is a good thing." bbbbb comes back, furious, and hatches a plan. using his silk tounge, he chats up the girl in the reception and gets her to agree to call him before she calls asset management next time there's a delivery. bbbbb: "come on you vikings. time for pillage and plunder. follow me!" me: "what? what are we doing?" bbbbb: "you shame your forefathers - i would have said pillage and they would have had their axes out. we're stealing our second screens, of course." me: "very well." so, we went there, took screens off the pile of delivered equipment and ran back with them. as we are unpacking them, the manager comes running. manager: "what are you doing!?" bbbbb: "installing our second screen." manager: "you have not been assigned this equipment!" bbbbb: "oh, i did not know that. well, we have the budget for it, so you can just order some more screens, right? no harm done." fighting bbbbb over this, when the screens were already in place, he had registered them in the asset management system, they were in operation and we had the budget was too much for management, so we got to keep the screens. **tolling, it tolls for thee.** the country we were working in used the euro, and we all got lots and lots and lots of useless 1 and 2 eurocent copper coins (commonly called brownies) and change everytime we bought something. i managed to use most of mine when i was riding the bus. you could only use 5 eurocent and bigger in the softdrink machine, so the smaller ones were useless, and lots of people assembled large amounts of them. so, for fun and giggles, we started paying roadtolls to each other as we passed each others' desks. basically just dumping whatever brownies you had at hand when you passed, to the curses of the one sitting there. then a poor guy went back home for an extended weekend, came back and found his desk covered in brownies. most of the building had seen them accumulating on his desk, and took the opportunity to dump their change there as well. there were easily 1000-2000 coins on his desk. he sighed and cursed a bit when he got back. then he got a really slow case - some of the users on his account wre local admins, and now and then they would get a case with a computer completely filled with spyware and malware. he told the user to go home after lunch, connected to his computer and started the cleanup. being bored just watching the status bar millimetring its way through the cleanup, he started sorting, piling and pyramiding the coins on his desk. after a while bbbbb passes by, sees on the screen that he is working, nods and keeps walking. after a short while, he returns and points to a small pyramid of coins. bbbbb: "that is one euro, isn't it?" collegue: "yeah, why?" bbbbb throws a 5-euro bill on the desks and proceeds to rake in five piles of coins with a devilish smile. collegue: "nice. but what are you doing with the coins?" bbbbb: "the girls at the cafeteria fucked with me yesterday. i'm going for a coffee." **learning well.** me and bbbbb are part of a documentation group. management recently changed the document standard for no real reason at all, so we need to lift everything we've done to the new format. manually, as they don't provide any kind of automatisation with the new format. bbbbb: "management. i swear to god, if i could see their inbred genepool..." me: "they don't have a genepool. they have a cesspool." bbbbb: "..." me: "what?" bbbbb: "i have taught you well, young padawan." **exactly what we want.** a team meeting discussing the latest ideas of re-organisation from management, trying to mitigate the disaster it would bring. bbbbb: "...alright, then we have a good plan." collegue: "yeah, then we get exactly what we want!" me: "salma hayek covered in honey?" collegue: "no, i..." he goes silent for a second, thinks, and then breaks up in a big smile. "yeah!" bbbbb: "i really like how you think, [vonadler]. let me google that. ooooh." **wow, that is wow** we also had a software distribution team that was over-staffed due to organisational changes. it also continued to work together with the team in the home country for several months, since they had a long notice time. so, there was work for 3 people, and there were 8 persons doing it. one of the guys at our place got bored, got a new job and gave his 4 week's notice. since there were so little work, and the other 3 guys were not fully trained yet (as they got too little work to do to properly train), he and them agreed that he would not do any work for the 4 weeks' notice time. so he installed world of warcraft on his machine and sat there playing for 4 weeks. bbbbb, who knows the situation, walks by and spots the collegue playing wow. bbbbb: "what are you doing?" collegue: "playing wow." bbbbb: "what level are you?" collegue: "32." bbbbb: "haha, i am better than you." he then proceeds to walk off. edit: spelling.years ago i worked for a company that sold staffing software. our product scheduled staff according to predicted need, employee availability and business rules. it was pretty neat; it could store data to a number of formats/targets including a proprietary database format on a local drive. we had one client that chose to use the latter database format while they were in beta testing. i taught all the employees involved in the project how to do everything and things went well at first. one day about halfway through beta their database started getting corrupted frequently but with no discernible pattern. i was at wit's end and the clients' management was starting to doubt our product, so naturally i was worried. (we had great recovery tools and never lost data, but it was a serious pita.) after a lot of back &amp; forth with questions i went back to roots troubleshooting. the client's rep and i had a call in which we walked through a typical day's procedures for data import, validation and running reports. everything she did was 100% correct so i was baffled why we were having problems. until she interrupted me saying *"hold on, the screen is scrambled up."* i replied saying "what do you mean, scrambled up?" she replied, *"oh, well when the elevator goes by the screen gets all mixed up with static."* and oddly enough the data file was corrupted once again. skip to the punch line: they moved my rep's desk next to a large electric elevator and the electromagnetic interference was impacting her computer. i told her to move the pc to a less [electrically] noisy location and, after one more data recovery, there were no more issues. sometimes location is as important in it as it is in real estate.hey tfts, remember my last story about the girl who brought me her monitor instead of the pc? today i had a similar situation. last week i sold a new imac to one of our customers because he didn't want to deal with viruses anymore (bullshit i know). and since he already had a macbook he didn't want me to install it at his home. today he called in furious anger: me: hello this is.... customer: how dare you ripping me off like that? me: good day sir, you don't mind telling me the problem before you scream like a maniac. customer: you know exactly what you did, you ripped me off!!! i have all the right to scream!! (since he didn't bother to tell me his name i looked up his phone number in our customerdatabase and saw that i sold him an imac a week ago) me: if i have to guess there's something wrong with your imac? customer: damn right there's something wrong with my imac. you didn't give me the whole thing!! me: how didn't i send the whole thing? customer: you just gave me the freaking monitor!!! me: have you tried to plug it in and turn it on before? customer goes away from the phone, i hear the typical apple boot sound, and the customer hangs up the phone... tl;dr: customer thought i was ripping him off by just sending the monitor, he ordered an imaca quick story that happened today, this is my second day of my first it job. serving a local high-school, 600+ users, 200+ computers, you get the idea. i was minding my own business, patching in the new office space, when a my work phone called. **user** &gt; "i can't teach like this, nothings working, the screen is black. i need you here now!" **xnikxx** &gt;"sir, what room are you located in?" **user** &gt; "room 34, i need you here now!" **xnikxx** &gt; "and are you talking about the smartboard or the monitor for your pc?" at this point the user hung up, i begrudgingly made my way to the room. by the time (a couple of minutes max) i'd got there, this user had called 4-5 times, each time telling me to hurry up. i walked into the room, saw the board was working just fine, and observed the monitor (which was being mirrored by the smartboard, mind you) had not jug lead connected. at this point the user was already agitated and i didn't really want to make him seem incompetent in front of his class. **xnikxx** &gt; "when did you first notice the issue with the monitor?" **user**&gt; "it started just before i called you, the cable at the back was irritating me, i kept bumping it so i took it out. " i had to explain to a teacher, that it was a power cable, the issue started the moment he unplugged it and somehow he didn't put two and two together. **edit** tried to fix the formatting the best i can, sorry about that. this was from several years back when i was working as roaming tech support for a number of urgent care facilities. management had come up with a brilliant way of ~~extracting a few extra dollars from clients~~ generating more revenue by selling a computer "clean up &amp; maintenance" package. basically this meant i would run updates by hand, use $thatonecleanerutility to clean up temporary files, and if need be, i would open up the case and vacuum out some dust. monday morning. a new client so i decide to hit their office first. new clients just love when it shows up first thing. makes them feel important. the manager at $genericurgentcare thought herself quite tech-savvy. i'm moving from computer to computer, and there were about 17 at this one location, doing my thing. it usually takes me about 5-7 minutes to get everything cleaning and updating before i would move on to the next. $manager would follow me around from computer to computer all the while giving me nfl style commentary tips and play by plays. everything is going swimmingly. the office staff loves me. i'm being charming, chatting with the nurses while working on the computers. *"you can type without looking?? cool."* says $cutefrontdeskgirl. yeah. cool. as i get to the last couple of computers i'm thinking that i just aced this first visit. that's when i hear $manager come stomping down the hall. &gt;**$manager:** "what did you do to my documents?" &gt;**me:** "i'm sorry? i haven't touched any documents." *thinking on my feet i immediately follow that up with,* "let's go take a look at your computer. i'm sure they're still there." we get to her computer, she clacks into the keyboard loudly her four character password. &gt;**$manager:** "i don't know what you did, but you need to fix it. all of my documents are gone." without asking her to move, i reach for the mouse and open the "my documents" folder. there are dozens of files and pictures (mostly of one of those little yip-yip dogs - fitting). i look at the folder confused and then back to the manager. &gt;**me:** "sorry, are these not the documents you're referring to?" &gt;**$manager:** *exasperated sigh* "no. not those documents." she snatches the mouse from me and to my disbelief double clicks on the recycling bin. &gt;**$manager:** "i had dozens of documents in the recycling bin. i need those files!" dumbfounded, i say nothing for probably 20 seconds as i look from her deadpan stare to the computer screen and back. &gt;**me:** "so... you keep your documents in the recycling bin?" &gt;**$manager:** "i'm not an idiot. my normal documents aren't in there. just the ones that we reuse all the time. like the patient sign in forms and things like that." it hits me like a ton of bricks. she thinks that the recycling bin is for "recycled" or "reuse" documents. &gt;**$manager:** "why on earth would you delete my documents?" an hour later and a getdataback later, her documents were back. i moved them into a new folder and spent the next 30 minutes trying to explain to her that the "recycling bin" was for deleting documents. $manager, being tech-savvy as she was, held her ground and adamantly refused to believe me. it wasn't until $cutefrontdeskgirl came over and agreed with me that she finally caved. context: i work at a wireless phone service, and i'm the highest level of tech support. *customer calls in pretty heated* me: "hi, sorry for the long wait, how can i assist you today?" customer: "are you a supervisor? i specifically need to talk to a supervisor in billing support!" me: "no ma'am, i'm in tech support, are you having a technical issue or a billing issue?" customer: "why aren't you a supervisor?!" me: "umm, i guess because i didn't apply?!" at the time my supervisor was listening to the team's calls, and happened to be listening to mine. he almost fell out of his chair laughing. i kinda got in trouble for saying that, but i couldn't resist upon such a ridiculous question. hey kiddos, i'm back with a story that happened recently. it started with a guy who looked like he was maybe in his fifties, but generally pretty nice as he approached the tech support counter. he was with a woman who seemed a lot younger, and they smile and set a new lenovo laptop on the counter, explaining that they want to hook it up to a projector. i tell them that their laptop has an hdmi port so all they'll need to do is grab an hdmi cable which can be found in several places in our store. the man seems confused and pulls out a packaged adaptor, one end usb. &gt;man: "well, we found this. can we use this?" i explain that no, that particular adaptor won't work, it won't transfer over the picture. i explain that the only port for this on his laptop is an hdmi, and if the projector for some reason does not have hmdi, he can get an adaptor to go to vga. at that he nods and says that he wants to use "vgu," that he has to, all the devices he has has these "vgus" and nothing uses hdmi. he wants to know how he can use a "vgu" port on his laptop. &gt;me: "sir, your laptop does not have vga. you can get an adaptor, but it's a lot more efficient to get an hdmi cable." &gt;man: "okay well sweetie, no one uses this "hdmi" in the real world. everywhere has "vgu." i understand you like your high tech stuff, but the world real does not use "hdmi." i literally stared at him as he ranted for the next 5 minutes about the real world not using hdmi. it was condescending enough i stared at him, let him finish, and just said, "okay." that seemed to alert him that maybe he's being a jerk and he apologizes for "lecturing me about it, it's just that really, no one uses hdmi." gee thanks mister, it's a wonder how i got this job. good thing i have smart clients like you to educate me on my job. the entire time, the woman he's with is rolling her eyes as he rants and finally speaks up. &gt;woman: "she's saying this is what is going to work with your computer. this is what you get for buying something new. new things use hdmi. our projector has hdmi, your stuff is old, let's go get a cable." i think i fell in love. regardless, the man stops ranting about "the real world" and is dragged off to go get a cable. **edit: wow. was not expecting the response that i got here, thank you guys! as a note, i understand that a lot of places still use vga. that's fine. what i was pointing out was that he brought his laptop to me to ask how to connect it, and then ranted and raved when my answer used the hdmi port his laptop had (and apparently his projector has as well). while it's fine that some places still utilize vga, it's ignorant to assume hdmi is unused as he was trying to say. hdmi is in the majority of consumer products such as tvs and laptops and is utilized in business devices as well. not everyone has made the switch, but the "real world" does in fact use hdmi.** **also: quote of the day! thank you again! i'm happy to see that me venting about work has been so well received!**used to work at $company who built and maintained all the electronics for $largeretailclient i get a call from one of our field techs one evening. "this is /u/omeletteking may i have your store number?" fieldtech: yeah hi, i'm going to need a new atm sent over to store xyz, this one is shot. "sure i can help with that, which parts were you needing replaced?" fieldtech: no, i can't fix it ... i'm going to need an entire unit. now at this point i'm confused, because the entire system is modular so we can replace broken parts individually 100% of the time - regardless of the issue. "sir, we don't replace entire units, just the parts. i can send you are many parts as you need however, just submit a ticket with the list and i'll get it approved." fieldtech: no this thing is shot, i can't fix it. they need a new one. frustrated i try a new approach. "ok, if you would like i can get someone from level 2 on the line to help you troubleshoot these issues." filedtech: no they can't help me it's shot. just send a new one. by this time i'm pretty irritated, the guy works for our company as a direct hire - he knows the rules ... this isn't a thing. "once again, we are unable to send out a new unit ... but let's start from the beginning. can you describe for me the specific problems you are experiencing so we can diagnose the point of origin." fieldtech: it. is. shot. like six times "wait .... " it suddenly dawns on me "like ... bullet holes?" filedtech: yes! "someone shot up your atm with bullet holes? " suddenly every head within 6 cubes pop up over the divide like muskrats. fieldtech: yes, that's what i've been trying to tell you this whole time! "i'm uh ... going to put you on hold for a second to get manager approval." i put him on hold, bypass the curious faces and walk over to my supervisor to relay the story. "tech 123 is on the phone with a shot atm and wants a replacement" without looking up he waves me off "we don't do that and he knows it - make him fix it." i grin and pause for dramatic effect until he looks up at me. "actual bullet holes" he jumps up and races over to my desk. apparently some drugged up guy swaggered in late one night and couldn't make his card work so he pulled out a pistol and emptied a clip into the atm and left. about half the bullets went wild into the wall and other surrounding machines, which were owned by other providers. my boss had to hold a special meeting with engineering to explain the unusual circumstances since the cops wouldn't let anyone touch the current one while it was considered "evidence". never found out if they caught the guy.thought i should share another story from a few years ago. this one is a happier story though, to lead into the new week with. so a few years ago, we had some political event in the city. because of all the foreign dignitaries and so on, it was decided that the city was essentially on a public holiday for one day only, as parts of the city would be shut down. this meant that we were getting a paid day off, even though we were far away from anywhere affected, so a lot of us were looking forward to it. the friday before the day off (a monday) , some of us were having after work drinks in one of the common areas, and the sales manager asks a serious question: "who is working from tech support over the shut down?" only the city is shutting down. the rest of the country still needs support. a few moments before he said this, i had seen my coworker leave for the day. i also knew my boss and supervisor lived over an hour away, and could already tell that because i lived ten minutes away, i was going to be the likely candidate. my manager immediately decided that this had to be decided now, and i was called into his office to discuss this. he knew i had no plans for the day from an earlier discussion, but wasn't going to screw me over in leave time either. he offered that if i came in, he'd give me two and a half days off in place of my standard day off. we also knew that it would possibly be quite, so he told me flat out to bring in video games, books etc to keep myself entertained. i made the deal, agreed to come in, and even got money to order pizza. so far, the deal was a good one in my mind. on the day i had to work, i enjoyed a five minute drive to work (all green lights, no traffic!), a parking space right out the front, and then sat in a dim office for a few hours, not being sure where the light switches were. i wandered around a few times (i got maybe five calls that day), and was pretty sure i was the only one in the building. i'm basically sitting there, earning a half week free holiday by playing zelda. about midday, the managing director turns up. i realise this when the lights all turn on, and he finds i've been sitting in mood lighting for the past few hours. we chat back and forth a bit, he has come in to catch up on some paperwork, and go about our business. after an hour or so, he starts to get bored and begins wandering around the building, we've only been there a few months if memory serves me right, and he was prone to go exploring. he appears while im becoming the scourge of chickens with a very serious expression. "turelio, i've found something and need your help." ok, what's up? he produces from the other side of the partition a few bags of crisps, "i found these on a shelf in the storage room. they expire a few months from now. if we leave them there, they could go off, and someone could get sick. for the good of the business, we should eat these now." i have no problem with this plan. "also this orange juice." a tray appears with a dozen or so bottles from where the crisps were. i believe i can help with this assignment. "good. i knew i could count on you. i'll do my share as well. remember, if this food is left, in a few months, it could be an oh&amp;s issue." he returns to his office with his own drinks and crisps. for the next few hours, i basically conform to the tech support/gaming stereotype, drinking sugary drinks and eating junk food. every so often he comes to 'check on my progress', offer a fact from under the lid of an orange juice bottle, and generally tell me i'm doing a good job. later that day, he appears with more food and drink, and asks if i want some, as i had said i was catching up with friends that night, and he thinks they can help with this dangerous matter. yes, yes they can. "also, as thanks from the company, have these polo shirts." wait, are you just raiding the marketing stash? "these are for an old promotion, but there is nothing wrong with them. they probably forgot about them." cool. free clothes! as i'm leaving, i stop by his office to say thanks and goodbye. he waves goodbye, and says in the gravest tone "just remember, you may have saved some lives today." i laugh and leave. all is good. a few weeks later, people are sorting out after work drinks, and at some point he must have been asked what happened to the crisps and juice. the first i hear of it is when he leads someone from marketing to my desk, makes me stand up, and says "lives were in danger. this man is a hero.", and leaves with no more explanation. tl;dr. ate junk food, management claimed i saved lives because of it. edit: well this seems to have got a lot of interest! i'm pretty shocked! also, thank you for the gold, doecky!i'm just upstairs on middle management's floor to grab a usb stick when i hear someone cursing. it's the internet product technical director, a weird job description. technically nobody is directly under him but anything that has to do with the internet at our telco falls under his broad purview. i know for a fact he's incredibly well paid. i'm admittedly not his biggest fan. &gt; bytewave: "what's wrong?" &gt; ipd: "i fucking closed a tab with a 10000 words text i was about to send on internal forums! gah! there ought to be a confirmation prompt when you close a tab!" ... &gt; bytewave: "you use firefox, right?" &gt; ipd: "yeah, so?" &gt; bytewave: "please state your full work title." &gt; ipd: "what? you know what i do, hell you know my damn browser, it's been well over a decade since.." &gt; bytewave: "yeah, sure i know. please state your full work title." &gt; ipd: " *sighs* internet product technical director..." &gt; bytewave: "thank you, that was for dramatic effect. now hit ctrl shift t." &gt; ipd: "... oh. yes! but..." &gt; bytewave: "... thank you for calling senior line, your call was very important to you." [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](this literally just happened and it's got me feeling kind of bad. i work over the phone tech support for mobile phones, and had a lady calling in saying she couldn't download anything on her android because she kept getting an "insufficient storage" error. pretty standard, after asking a few questions and remoting into her phone we see it's mostly pics, about 3gb worth on an 8gb phone. easy stuff, let's back them up to google photos since she doesn't have an sd card or a computer. we set up google photos and it's starting the backup. now when a customer is in their photos app or gallery it blurs out their screen for privacy reasons i assume, and i can't see anything their doing even though i'm remoted in. i tell her it can take a little bit to backup especially if she has a lot, etc... suddenly i notice her devices available memory increasing. (it shows this when we're remoted in to the phone) she says "im deleting photos now." i say "we need to wait for the backup to complete." to which she replies... i saw the pics they were all in the photos app." i know it takes longer than that. i reiterated - "we need to make sure they're backed up." her: "i saw them, they're there." oh lord. i knew what happened, and there was a silence on the line and she said "all my photos are gone! they were just there!" cue angry customer who deleted her photos because i "told her to." i hope someone goes back and listens to that call. they'll see i told her to wait multiple times. plus google photos will free up device storage on its own, only removing backed up ones. i told her that too. ugh. just venting now because even though i didn't do it, i still feel really bad that she lost her pictures. :/ edit: corrected a wordaccounting clerks are my favorite people... &gt;me:tarpit technical support, mastadonbob here.. &gt;her: this is largemarge in accounting, i tried to run a trial balance and my computer is locked up. &gt;me: easy fix, marge. there's a known bug in the outrageouslypriced accounting software package. if you click the trial balance button twice, your computer will lock up (100% resource usage). simply reboot your computer and you should be good to go. &gt;her: will you stay on the line while i do this? &gt;me: sure. she reboots her machine reboot #1 &gt;her: okay, here we go i distinctly hear click. click. &gt;her: nope, same issue. &gt;me: did i just hear two clicks? did you click the button twice? &gt;her: no! (whining) can't you just come over here and fix it? we're on the same floor and they have a great coffee machine over in accounting so i agree. reboot #2 &gt;me: okay, here i am, did you reboot your computer again? &gt;her: yes i did. now watch! click....click... &gt;me: you just clicked it twice! &gt;her: (defensively) i wasn't sure if i clicked it! reboot #3. &gt;me: okay, click the button one time now. she clicks....smiles...5 seconds elapse. she clicks again. lockup. &gt;me (incredulous): didn't i just tell you to click the button one time? &gt;her: my husband is in the hospital! *starts crying* i'm not sure what sort of response i was expecting but that was certainly not it! reboot #4 and everything worked. minding my own business on helpdesk, and the phone rings. answer the phone, customer immediately demands to know status of ticket. ask customer for ticket number, customer asks why i dont have it already. explain they're calling us from a phone number not listed on any systems we utilize, most likely their personal cell (which is a big no no.) customer grumbles about stupid cell phone rule, and locates ticket number. i pull up ticket, and see it's assigned to another group on east coast. explain to customer they will need to be connected to other group for status update, as only notes on ticket from staff handling it are unclear as to status. customer refuses to be connected to them. customer hangs up. customer calls back. same routine. customer hangs up again. customer calls back, again. for the sake of my sanity, i tell customer i will contact staff handling their ticket for them, and that i will call them back in 2-3 hours. (i've got a lunch to take, and my own crap to deal with before this moron's disaster to clean up.) customer and i then proceed to have this conversation, verbatim: &gt;user: "okay, well, i'm on the east coast, so do you mean 2-3 east coast hours?" &gt;me: "i mean 2-3 hours. hours are hours." &gt;"right, but i'm on the east coast and you said you're in central time, so you are you talking about central hours or eastern hours?" &gt;"sir it doesn't matter if you're on the east coast or the west coast or in asia, an hour is an hour." &gt;"but i'm on the east coast. it's an hour sooner here." &gt;"sir i mean 2-3 hours, or 120-180 minutes from now." &gt;"that doesn't answer my question!" &gt;"how about this, sir. it's 11:55 am your time right now, right? i'll call you before the clock on your desk says 3:00 pm." &gt;"oh, okay, so 3 east coast hours." *tl;dr: 60 minutes is only an hour if you're not on the east coast.* hi tfts, thought it was about time i shared this little anecdote. about 3 years ago i worked at a national newspaper in the tech support department. my team (of 2) was responsible for 'networks and telephony', which meant our tickets were always related to internet connection issues, or problems with their desk phones. we had an sla (service level agreement) to respond to a ticket within 3 hours, and resolve it within 3 days, which was pretty reasonable considering we received so few tickets in to our queue (thanks to our surprisingly exemplary first line support team). so one day, at around 2pm (while my colleague is trying to get me to go with him to the pub for the remainder of the day) our empty queue receives a ticket. i'm so bored at this point, i snap it up. a journalist (who tech support refer to as 'journos') is unable to make phone calls from her desk phone. so ignoring my colleagues desire for a stiff drink, i jump up, and dash off to the journalists desk to deal with her problem. the second i arrive, she starts yelling at me. doesn't even say hello, or explain her problem. just starts yelling at me (and bear in mind that it's a fully open plan office of over 1000 people) that she "can't make any f***ing phone calls" and "it's an absolute disgrace" etc etc. after a few seconds of this i stopped listening to the specifics of her angry shouting, and eventually cut her off and (calmly) explained "i have an sla to respond within 3 hours. i've arrived within 15 minutes. so, i'm going to go away, and come back in another 2 hours and 45 minutes, and if you've calmed down by then, i'll take a look at your phone" and walked off, leaving her standing by her desk, mouth wide and speechless. it was still a very quiet day, so i returned about an hour later. this time, she didn't say a word, and just gestured towards her phone. at which point, i lean over and plug the ethernet cable back in to it, and the phone boots up as normal. she wheels around, a look of disbelief on her face and says "that's it? it just needed to be plugged in?" to which i respond "well if you'd let me look at it earlier, rather than shouting about it, i could have dealt with it then. (short pause) is there anything else i can help you with?" to which she replies (sheepishly) "no, (awkward pause) thank you". i felt pretty good about closing that ticket. tl;dr shouty journalist just needed to plug her desk phone in.lady brings in a laptop for service, sets it on the front counter. i *start* to open the lid and at least a half dozen roaches immediately crawl out of the vents a quickly start to scatter out everywhere over my front counter. i start tracking down and smashing said roaches and lady hands son the laptop tells him to 'go outside and shake the laptop out' - during which i politely explain that you can't just 'shake them out' of a laptop, and that unfortunately i won't be able to check the laptop in this condition in for service. now let's be logical for a moment, shall we? the way i stay in business is to check in computers for service, so if i'm turning it away there is good reason. the cost of paying to get rid of the roaches would greatly exceed the money we'd make servicing her laptop. plus liability issues if they got in other customer's machines. plus.....roaches. anyway, i do my best to explain politely (several times) that we can't check it in - but she's not having any of it. &gt;"you won't even look at it and tell me what's wrong?" finally she gives up and starts storming out &gt;"...well. we'll never come back here again.....and i've got six family members and i'll make sure they know to never come here. so you just lost six customers..." you know, whenever i hear the "i'll never come here again." line i always have to bite a hole in my lip to keep from saying "promise?" i traveled to iran recently with my dad and sister. i'm british but my dad is iranian and speaks the language (farsi). my sister and i don't speak farsi at all and it means we're usually bored when we're dragged to family friends' houses and everyone speaks farsi. anyway one day we went to a family friend's house for lunch. after eating lunch people were just sitting around talking in farsi for literally hours and i got pretty bored so i went on my phone and searched for a wifi network so i could browse reddit (keep in mind i don't have access to 3g/4g on my british phone, so i need wifi). no wifi networks found so i had to endure more boredom. what i would usually do is find out if a network is available and if so, if they have a password, get my dad to ask them for it politely in farsi. in this case as i couldn't find a network, i just forgot about it and assumed they either didn't have internet access or just had a wired connection with a single pc. anyway later on my sister asks me if they have wifi as she was bored. i told her that i couldn't find any networks. about an hour after that, i told my dad we were really bored and they had no wifi. my dad then insisted on asking the homeowner if we could use their wifi, despite no networks being available. the following conversation took place (with my dad speaking farsi to the homeowner and translating everything i say in english): &gt; **dad**: do you mind if we use your wifi? &gt; **homeowner**: sure, just switch on your bluetooth. &gt; **me**: wait...what? bluetooth? surely you mean wifi? &gt; **homeowner**: no i mean bluetooth, you'll need that to use our wifi i decided to humour him and just switch on my bluetooth. no devices found. i showed homeowner. &gt; **homeowner**: that's strange, let me show you my phone. he then shows me that his phone's wifi is switched off, the bluetooth is switched on and he's paired with another device, which he's using the internet connection of. &gt; **me**: whose device are you connected to? how come you're using that instead of a wifi router? &gt; **homeowner**: i have no idea what you're talking about. my son set it all up for me, he's good with computers. &gt; **me**: ummm...ok. so i investigate further and found their home "wifi" network works like this: - the family don't have broadband or a wifi router at all. - homeowner's son has 3g on his phone and is bluetooth paired with his dad's phone. - security settings on both devices mean neither can be found by other devices (e.g. my iphone) and both devices trust each other. - if homeowner's son's phone moves too far away from his, his phone loses internet as he doesn't have 3g on his own phone. this meant he had no internet if he was at home but his son wasn't at home. their son spoke a tiny bit of english so i spoke to him and he said we had to do the following: - he adds my iphone to his phone's bluetooth trusted devices list. - ask homeowner if it's okay if we unpair his phone and then pair mine (as multiple devices can't be paired to his phone). - pair my phone and use his 3g connection. i then suggested just setting up a hotspot on his phone and then both homeowner and i connect by **actual wifi**. he had no idea what i was talking about. homeowner was also unhappy about unpairing his phone from his son's on the grounds that "we're changing everything". my dad was unable to explain coherently in farsi the benefits of using wifi instead of bluetooth so basically i couldn't use the internet. a new life goal of mine is to learn farsi, go back there and actually help them with this mess. **tldr:** tech illiteracy + language barrier = boredom and frustrationa few requested that i finish the story [here] ( ) i guess i want to let it out, this all happened a while back and i have never really opened up about it. so after the events detailed the previous post, there was an uncomfortable apology from the boss that could be translated as 'technically i have to apologise again, but i will expose you one day'. this was a very stressful workplace. a culture of paranoia coupled with a dismal technical capacity in management, created many 'story worthy events' during the short time i was there. for example: &gt;boss "who is this alpha, why did you have him test our software". &gt;me, explains that alpha testing is "people in our own company providing feedback" &gt;boss "people should not be pointing out problems in our software, it's disrespectful to the company. i want to see all these testers in my office now!" anyway there was a series of baseless accusations some comically funny, others just sad (eg accusing me of stealing the sata cables from a left over motherboard box). the results were always the same, me proved undeniably innocent, and two "apologetic" managers only more determined to justify their persecution of myself. it got quite petty after a while. long hours at a keyboard left me with bad carpel tunnel. cold triggered the pain, and hot water relived it. so i often did the dishes for the company [a chance to relive pain]. management became aware of why i was being so helpful and enforced a new rule that staff were not allowed to use hot water for cleaning dishes [yep, you read that right]. every time the tap was found to be warm (it was inspected regularly) i was accused of breaking company policy and raked over the coals. always another employee would come forward and explain they had used hot water to clean a coffee cup, and i was not at fault. [thanks guys, if your reading this] anyway, denial of hot water not being enough to destry my nerves; out of shear malice management now instituted 16 deg (cel) air con standard. and a table set outside my office held a burning incense thing that management had discovered triggered my hayfever. then came a big problem. the two managers would be away for a fortnight. obviously chaos would rain while the tech nerds happily made free with the companies hot water. so one of the managers sneekly turned of the water tap to thee hot water system before leaving. again technology was not thier strong suite. the water was off, but not the power. so the bloody hot water system exploded the next day. then something really bad happened. australia introduced "enterprise bargaining" [a policy that destroyed many workplace rights]. under the new system i had been forced to become a "sub-contractor" not an employee. then my wages started to be "delayed". i had not been paid in two months, others much longer [one lady 4 months]. in the final days before i quit, we were made to sign contracts stating we would be fired with-out pay (even back pay), if we were found to have broken any law in anyway, even outside of the company. and then the persecution turned ugly. i was brought into a random meeting with the two managers and told that i should not be logging out of my firefox browser before leaving work. i said i did this so other people would not access my e-mail etc. they replied that “protecting myself like this was very suspicious” and i should not do it. i didn't budge on the issue. one day i was rushed out of work and forgot to log out of firefox. i decided to go back in and do so, just in-case. i discovered my favorite two managers at my desk looking at my computer. they demanded to know why i had returned. i said, i want to log my internet browser out. i got a reprimand for "being paranoid and untrusting". after this i had given notice. another firm had made me a good offer and i was due to leave for what would turn out to be an awesome job else where. if i left without being fired for breaking the law however, they would be forced to pay me my back wages, now over $12k. many things were attempted in vain to see if even the flimsiest evidence of wrong doing could be found. i had never broken the law and not done anything unprofessional in the slightest. yet the persecution was now un-relenting. what followed in my final weeks: -a software licence we were using expired. when it failed to start i was accused of "stealing" the licence for myself. -a consultant was hired under pretext of "job handover". his real job to look over my shoulder. -i was being followed into the toilet (no idea why). -boss walked in having seen my car was not in the car-park. shouted loudly, to the whole firm that i was half an hour late and would be made an example off. then saw me in my office, put on his "shit, i will have to make another formal apology" face. then a dim light bulb went of in his head and instead, he told me i "was not allowed to park in other than my allocated spot". i told him i had taken the train today, because my car was in the shop. he stormed away... apology came 6 hrs later. on one of my last days. i was sitting in my office [all offices had plate glass walls] and saw the other manager stomping around the office. she plugged her laptop into every ethernet port trying to do something, got annoyed that something did not work and moved onto the next port. then she found the companies adsl router and plugged into that. she tried whatever it was she was doing and then it worked. she sat at the desk next to the router with her laptop and gave me a very smug look. this was the smuggest "i finally got you" face i had ever seen; and that irritated me. knowing the router was a hub [not a switch] and that all internet traffic was going through it; i quickly acted on a hunch about what i thought was going on. i opened up a browser window and in google typed "please don't spy on what i do on the internet". she startled in pure disbelif. when the shock wore off, she comprehended the situation. i had her, breaking australian law. she was (at that time) not allowed to spy on workers internet usage in this way. but i had no proof, unless she admitted it. so angry as a cat in a tutu, she slammed her laptop shut and stormed into my office. to angry to even speak, she sat down in the desk opposite mine opened hep laptop and just sat glaring at me. and there she remained, for a couple of hours till my lunch break. just sitting, unmoving, unblinking and glaring. as for me, totally un-phased and unstressed. for the first time in my life, i just couldn’t give a f##k any more. edit: since someone asked, i thought i should share [what the last day was like] ( ).back in 2008, 4 years after windows nt 4.0 ran out of support and 11 years after it was released, we could finally convince our customers that we don't intend to continue supporting ie 5 and that all end-users should be upgraded to ie 6 (which was out for 6 years by then). we knew that the site was working mostly ok in ie5, but there was a nasty display glitch. as we have agreed with our customers to not support ie5, we weren't going to fix that glitch. cue the support ticket reporting the display glitch. we told them to upgrade their ie as the minimum version required was a then 6 years old browser. they told us they were running ie6 and still had the issue. i told them to send me a screenshot of the about-dialog box of their ie and, yes, it was showing ie 6, though the design of the dialog box was different from my machine which made me suspicious. i've told them to visit some specially crafted url that was basically listing some request parameters. i told them to scroll to the line that says `user-agent` and to list me what it says there. they responded with `mozilla/4.0 (compatible; msie 5.5; windows nt 4.0)` *busted* and that was the day when that company updated their 4 years-out-of support os to an os that was only 7 years old at the time when this happened (to windows 2000) and of which only 3 later versions already existed at that point (xp, 2003 server, vista) so not only did they lie about the browser version, they also went through the trouble of faking a screenshot of the about box in the vain hope that we might magically fix the issue if we believe they were using a browser that was supported. of course, even if we did believe them, fixing an issue we cannot reproduce is next to impossible.[previous]( i stood with no coffee staring at a computer that wouldn’t boot. could life get any better? the red haired lady stood next to me, coffee cup in hand. &gt;redcheer: that doesn’t look right. &gt;me: it’s broken. &gt;redcheer: nooo! &gt;me: yeah, that drop killed the hard drive i think. the red haired lady beside me did not look happy. she looked like she was on a war path. &gt;redcheer: we’ve got to fix him. i looked around the office, and spotted the famous designer that broke this pc. being a guest it guy, what do you do in these circumstances? as i weighed up telling the boss or just quietly fixing the problem, the red haired lady decided for me. &gt;redcheer: dad, dad! she had called out over the office, carefree walked swiftly over. &gt;carefree: hello again airz! what seems to be the problem, redcheer? &gt;redcheer: my computer’s broken. &gt;carefree: oh dear, airz haven’t you had time to fix these ones yet? i realized he thought the problem was the over heating, but too late to say anything. &gt;redcheer: no, angryf dropped it, now its not working at all. &gt;carefree: oh dear, is it fixable? &gt;me: yeah, just gotta get a new hard drive and pop it in, then re- install everything. should take a day or two. the red haired lady seemed to calm down a lot upon hearing her pc was going to be okay. &gt;redcheer: i’ll go find a hard drive. she raced off, before i’d even gotten a chance to ask if she knew what a hard drive was. carefree looked over at the non working computer. he looked like he was mulling things over. &gt;carefree: angryf, could you come over here a second? angryf rose from his desk and silently made his way over to the broken computer. &gt;carefree: did you accidentally drop this computer? &gt;angryf: well yeah, but i wouldn’t have done if tech-man worked a little faster. &gt;me: what did…? carefree held out his hand for silence. &gt;carefree: you seem pretty upset with our temporary tech. &gt;angryf: he’s pretty bad. couldn't even fix my machine he just tried to replace it. i was about to start defending myself but across the open floor office i saw redcheery opening up the it cupboard and start inspecting things. it was very distracting. &gt;carefree: so he’s made big impression on you. &gt;angryf: a massive negative impression. yes. i was about to open my mouth and defend myself but again, carefree raised his hand for silence. &gt;carefree: whats his name? &gt;angryf: what? &gt;carefree: he’s made such a massive negative impression. what is his name? i looked back over redcheery, she was holding an old power supply, reading the label. i almost missed the look of dismay on angryf’s face. &gt;angryf: i don’t know, but it doesn’t matter. he’s really bad, i think he broke this computer with just incompetence. &gt;me: you dropped… carefree held up his hand again. &gt;carefree: no use playing the blame game with someone so angry airz. he gave me a small smile before turning back to his most famous designer. &gt;carefree: i think perhaps you owe airz an apology for creating so much extra work for him. the designer was getting worked up, you could see it in his eyes. he wasn’t happy. &gt;angryf: no. you know what, no. carefree’s calm exterior just slid away. he looked just plain scary. &gt;carefree: okay, i think you should leave. &gt;angryf: ha! you know you can’t get rid of me. i’m your best designer, you’d lose thousands if i wasn’t here. carefree’s scary demeanor grew bigger. &gt;carefree: do you know how i came to own a design company? it wasn’t by just making the best “financial” decisions. now get out. he pointed to the door. i followed the finger, and saw redcheery holding up a hard drive like she’d found treasure. i smiled, i couldn’t believe she found one. carefree must have seen the smile. he turned away from angryf who was leaving. &gt;carefree: the ability to smile in awkward situations is a rare one. that was pretty rough, lets get a coffee. &gt;me: i think your daughter has found a hard drive… i should probably go install that first. &gt;carefree: don’t be silly, hard drives can wait. you’ve just seen a firing, that must have been tough. i made my way over to the break room. i honestly couldn’t tell which demeanor was scarier, the scary one, or the cover…. &gt;me: i don’t have a cup… carefree smiled for a second i was worried he’d offer his own. &gt;carefree: we do have guests here occasionally. disposable cups, are in the bottom cupboard. &gt;me: huh… i forgot you’d need to offer clients coffee all the time. &gt;carefree: haha, what type of weird place wouldn’t have cups for guests? as i drank down my golden elixir i listened to stories of old from carefree about his startup days. they were fun. i made my way back out to the floor and saw redcheery closing up a computer, screwdriver in hand. &gt;me: oh, you’ve already installed it. &gt;redcheer: yep! gotta learn how to fix my computer. i opened up the case and looked inside, everything was connected and screwed in correctly. &gt;me: nice work, you’ve build a computer before i take it? &gt;redcheer: oh no. i just looked for the thing that said “hard drive” and replaced it. wasn’t too hard. &gt;me: so… you didn’t know what you were doing? &gt;redcheer: i learn by doing! ***** learn by doing works.... who knew? [next](back in the late 90s, i did troubleshooting over the phone for pcs and printers. this was when printers were moving off of dos drivers, and onto those, at the time, really sketchy windows only drivers that were a beast to troubleshoot, and would get jobs stuck in queue quite regularly. one day, i (m'lady) get a call from a gentleman (gent) who can't print. m'lady: thank you for calling hcpb, my name is m'lady how may i assist you? gent: i can't print and need help. m'lady: i can certainly assist you, let me take a look at your account, go ahead and tell me a little more about what's happening. gent: says some vague things about it working earlier and now it won't print. m'lady: sir, that is a very common issue that is typically resolved worth a restart of your computer. i do show you are out of warranty, and to walk you through rebooting your computer, i would have to charge you $25. or you can hang up, restart, and if it doesn't work, you can give us a call back. gent: (he smells a hose and close) there's no way that's it, blah blah blah, i know better. m'lady: sir, i promise you i've seen this hundreds of times. we're open for hours yet (although we didn't have a toll free number), and if it doesn't work, you can call right back. gent doesn't believe me, and i'm going to get scored down if i "accidentally" hang up on him. so, we go through the 5 minutes of taking his credit card information. you know what's coming. . . m'lady : ok sir, click start, shutdown, restart and let me know when the computer is back up. there's no chit chat. he thinks i'm a fucking idiot. the appropriate amount of time goes by. gent: k, is rebooted (sounding smug in my memory) m'lady : pick anything you want, and try and print for me. (printer noises ) gent: i just paid $25 to reboot my computer, didn't i? m'lady : yes sir, you did. (speaking as level as i could). gent: &lt;click&gt;it was about 10pm. the entire building had long since gone home, but i'd stuck around to do some after-hours maintenance on a few routers in the public colo room, where our customers housed all their equipment. when you've been working for 13 hours straight, your brain stops working the way it normally would and tends to get a narrow focus. one thing that's vital for any tech is the three pocket tap. back, right, left - wallet, keys, phone. no matter where you are, you can probably work something out as long as you have them. as i heard the office-to-dc door click closed, i immediately realised i'd been so caught up debugging i'd forgotten to 3pt. please, let them be there. for the love of god, let them be there. they were not there. the awareness of my situation came slowly. no wallet means no access card. okay, i'll call someone. no phone. okay, well i guess i can always just abandon the work and go home. wait, no wallet means no bus. i guess i could always walk, i mean it's far, but .. no keys. it was a rare winter's day that the heavily-stocked datacentre was cold, but dear god was it cold that night and i had no jacket. the trio of ac units hummed merrily, pumping 10 degree air into the room; sleeping on the floor of the datacentre was not an option (although it would become one later - that's a story for another time). wow. i was really stuck. i could use egress buttons to get further /out/ of the facility and gamble on being able to break back in somewhere else but i would only end up stuck further away from the things i so desperately wished i'd remembered. *"alright chhopsky, you can do this. you just have to figure something out. this is what we trained for."* i checked everything. jimmying the door and lock didn't work. the lock was a strike so i couldn't cut power to it either. i tried every technique i could think of to bypass the security. after half an hour, i was starting to wonder whether maybe sleeping on the floor was the best plan after all, and just living with pneumonia. like a bolt of lightning, genius struck. in one particular rack, there was an old cisco 2511. for those lucky enough to have missed these things, a 2511 is an ancient serial router, commonly used for out of band management - stick a dial-up modem on one end, and then 16 serial ports out to routers/switches/servers/whatever. i had a phone line! and i'd been testing ports to identify phone numbers earlier in the week, and by random chance, i'd left the crappy old telecom phone in the rack! i was saved! snapping in the rj11 socket with a relieved grin, i dialled the only number i knew - my home number. my girlfriend at the time (who i'll call pants) picked up, her sweet voice echoing through the crackling line like an innocent cherub. &gt; pants: hello? &gt; chhopsky: oh my god, pants, i'm so happy, i need y &gt; pants: .. hello? &gt; chhopsky: what? hello? pants? can you hear me? &gt; pants: *covering the receiver* yeah i don't know who it is. there's some crackling but no-one's talking &gt; chhopsky: you have got to be kidding me. &gt; pants: guess it's a bad line or a fax machine or something. she hung up. i immediately called back. &gt; chhopsky: hello? pants? hello? &gt; pants: it's doing the thing again .. i don't know i think someone's there? &gt; chhopsky: hello i am here its chhopsky please i am stuck the receiver clicking down was the most gut-wrenching sound of disappoinment i'd ever heard. i realised i'd never actually used this phone to talk, only ever to dial numbers and hit modems. something in it was busted, so no-one was ever going to hear me through it. i tried to get it open to fix it, but without tools (which were also on the other side of the door) it wasn't going anywhere. at this point, ethics kind of went out the window. the one, solitary thing i had in my posession was a 268 key. for those not in the know, the 268 key is a magical key that most racks ship with by default. armed with a tiny piece of metal, i was going to go through every customer's rack until i found something that could help me. i opened every single rack in the room. nothing. no tools, no tape, no zip ties, nothing. i slumped against the back wall of the back row, defeated. that's when i saw it. the most beautiful sight in the world. a brand new touchtone analogue phone, hidden under a waterfall of console cables behind a customer's 2511. i shouted in joy, to no-one in particular, thanked the gods that someone else had been doing the same work that i had, and hastily stole the hell out of it. when i finally got through to pants, i was able to talk her through logging onto my computer, connecting to my work vpn, rdp-ing into the security system, and the incredibly long and drawn-out process of navigating the ancient, awful security software to manually override the lock's default state to open. when that relay clicked, it was like the hills were alive with the sound of metal on metal. i dropped the phone and busted through the door, shivering and ecstatic both at once. i had won. i had beaten the impossible situation. *i had opened a door.* wrapping myself in a jacket, i stood behind the airconditioner heat vents in the plant room for five minutes, then zip-tied my wallet to my belt, and got back to work. these routers weren't going to upgrade themselves..i get a call from a user asking me to reset her password. no problem. i just need to confirm it's in fact her, so call up the security question. "where did you meet [man's name]?" "ann arbor, michigan." "that's not the answer we have on file, ma'am." "that is where i met him." "your hint is `somewhere hot', ma'am." "oh, yeah, i forgot i changed it. after i divorced him, i made the answer *hell*, didn't i?" "yes, you did, ma'am. i'll reset your password now."i am just a humble mostly-tech-illiterate end-user (operations manager at a bank). i read your tales from time to time; it helps me feel better about myself - "at least i'm not that bad". anyway, reading your posts has helped me communicate better with my it department. i used to be super-intimidated communicating with it folks. sometimes i would just live with issues rather than try and resolve them. i actually went 2 or 3 months with a wonky mouse because i figured it was easier than dealing with the help desk. after a month or two of reading this subreddit, i started to become more comfortable submitting help desk tickets. first, i never call, i always submit a ticket. second, i always try re-booting first. third, i don't try to diagnose the problem myself, i just state clearly what the issue is, never just saying "it just doesn't work". if there is an error message, i screen-shot it or repeat it verbatim. lastly, and perhaps most importantly, i never pretend to know more than i do. if i don't understand something, i say so. you guys (most of you) have made it clear that you don't expect us to know your job, just like we don't expect you to know ours. you just expect us to be reasonable, clear, and polite. which is exactly what we expect from you. anyway, sorry if this post doesn't belong here. it's just that i had another pleasant experience with my help desk and felt like saying "thank you!" to all of you. have a nice day!background: i work as an internal helpdesk technician in the corporate offices of a us-based chain of big-box stores. another day, another round of users. this morning starts with a fairly generic ticket to fix some printer settings after a store mucked it up. fixed the printer, but now i need the store to restart it. commence calling the store in 3... 2... 1... &gt; *ring... ring... ring...* now, where the stores are concerned, policy states that it comes first. if someone from it is calling, you pick up the phone because either something is broken or they're giving you updates on something else that was broken; either way, it still affects your bottom line. four minutes of ringing go by... no one has yet picked up the phone. what is a lowly tech supposed to do? whelp, let's see what they're up to. while the phone is still ringing, i've pulled up their security cameras and logged in. we're now at six minutes of ringing. &gt; *ring... ring... ring...* there's a man standing next to the obviously ringing phone on one of the manager computers. judging by his shirt, he's definitely a manager. as i'm watching on the cameras, he turns and looks at the ringing phone (which has caller id, so he can see it's me that's calling) and goes back to his computer. this cannot stand. so i remote into his computer. he's writing an email - it's a very non-important email. one click later and his mouse and keyboard stop taking input. a sly grin slowly stretches across my face as he quickly spirals into despair that he can't type his email. he doesn't take frustration well - grabbing the mouse and slamming it onto the counter, hitting the keyboard... it was actually like watching a toddler. &gt; *open notepad* &gt; "please pick up the phone." &gt; *ring... ring...* hello? tl;dr: i don't know who you are. i don't know what you want. if you are looking for peace and quiet, i can tell you i don't have any. but what i do have are a very particular set of skills, skills i have acquired over a very long career. skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. if you pick up the phone now, that'll be the end of it. i will not look for you, i will not pursue you. but if you don't, i will look for you, i will find you, and i will call you. again. --- previous tales on tfts: [it's a christmas miracle!]( [those guys are worthless. absolutely worthless.](back in july, i was downtown on business, and was just waiting for a cab to get back to the office. it was a beautiful day and all was well in the world - but a panicked man next to me clearly felt otherwise. he seemed angry and frustrated. he kept looking at his phone, then the street signs, then the phone again, then the street signs. looked like he was about to throw the phone in the general direction of a brick wall. he was close enough i could see he was looking at the maps app and that his phone was a nexus 5. &gt; bytewave: "hey, do you need directions to some place? looks like the phone's not being very helpful." &gt; stranger: "yes, oh god yes, i'm soooo late!! there's this restaurant i have to get to for a business lunch, and the phone's all messed up again, and i don't know this city! can you give me directions to this place?" unfortunately, i had no idea where the place he wanted to get to was - there's a ridiculous amount of restaurants around there, no man knows them all. but at a glance, i could tell the maps app was putting him several blocks away - a symptom i was all too familiar with. &gt; bytewave: "i'm sorry, not familiar with the restaurant. but maybe i can help you with the phone, that's kind of my thing. there aren't that many reasons why maps would give you wrong positioning. mind telling me what carrier you're in business with, when you got that nexus 5, whether or not you ever switched sim cards and how long ago you started having this kind of trouble?" he looked at me a little puzzled for a second; of course it's unusual for strangers to try to troubleshoot your phone out on the street - but when i see a problem i can solve easily sometimes i just get into troubleshooting mode. it's hard to leave a problem i can fix unattended. &gt; stranger: "eh at this point, why not. i'm with mildlyevilcable (name i use in my tales for the telco i work at), i got this like.. soon after it was commercially available, no switch of cards and this began a few months back. how will any of that help, though? the antenna inside must just be broken, i'm planning to replace it soon." i smiled, knowing i probably knew already what was wrong with it. &gt; bytewave: "i assure you, i'm going somewhere with this. is there any chance that you had to do a factory reset on that phone a few months back?" &gt; stranger: "ehh... err.. yes. how would you.." &gt; bytewave: "settings, wireless&amp;networks, more..., preferred network type, it'll be set as lte, select 3g instead then do a power cycle. then maps will work fine and you'll get where you need to go. later, you should get your sim card switched to an lte one at any of their stores, it's free." this is a commonplace issue for us at the telco with nexus 5s. when they launched, much of our network was still 3g and we sold them with 3g sim cards. later we went full-blown lte, but thing is, if you do a factory reset on those and it detects our lte network on setup, it'll set it's preferred network type to lte even though there's a 3g sim inside. we replace those sims for lte ones without charge, but most customers don't know about any of this and end up with the wrong network preference. what happens when you select lte with a 3g sim in a n5 phone? precisely what was happening to this guy. the phone still 'works' mostly, but your location data will be all messed up, causing severe issues with apps like maps. your location will show up as far as a half-mile away from where you really are. and there are other consequences, such as delayed connectivity as you exit an elevator or a subway, things like that. all it takes to fix it is either to switch to an lte sim or manually set it back to 3g. in one instance, it's even caused issues for our internal security department which turned out to be unable to execute a police warrant to track a phone properly. the 'known issue' network ticket about that has not been updated in over a year; last entry just says 'on hold pending external input' - aka google isn't in much of a hurry to help our engineering figure out whose fault it is. either way, the stranger complied. &gt; stranger: ... "there's no way. it shows the right place now!! how?!? how could you just guess it just like that?!" &gt; bytewave: "my cab's coming over there. you just stumbled on the right guy at the right time - happy to be able to help. have a good day!" as i was walking towards the cab, he ran after me, reached for my left arm and rammed a bunch of bills into my hand. turns out that *sometimes* you can actually get paid for random acts of tech support. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!]( a long-time client of mine called me with an unusual problem, his energy bill tripled last month (from $90 to $270), and the only new addition to his house is a $30 multi-function printer. i figured it'd definitely be something trivial like heating, as it's been a very cold and wet winter here. i've been called over for far simpler things in the past, but thought i'd pay him a visit as he'd do the same for me if the roles were reversed. i arrive at the gentleman's house and run over the obvious devices with high energy consumption: * space heater? nope, client runs gas. * water heater? nope, client runs gas. * clothing dryer? yes, twice a week for a few hours (~$3 per week in energy costs) * split-system air-con? yes, only twice this month for one hour at a time (~$2 total cost) * tv? yes, but usage patterns match previous months. perplexed, i reluctantly checked out the new printer, as nothing else seems to have changed. there's no way in hell a small ink-jet can account for such high power consumption, without someone noticing excessive heat, a smell, or *something* the printer showed no obvious signs of malfunction; it's the standard cheap-shit orificeworks hp mfc inkjet, with a crappy printer glued to a crappier scanner, inside of which lies an insanely noisy belt drive. it printed normally, and its power supply was cool to the touch. i suspected a mis-reading of the energy meter by the power company, as we're talking *triple* the previous months bill here. i had to be sure though, as i'd look like a complete ass to everyone if i'm wrong. so out comes the trusty ac clamp-meter, and i tell everyone not to turn anything on (or off). i removed the screws to the client's switch-box, calibrate (zero) the clamp-meter, attach it the main circuit breaker feed, and wait for it to stabilize. for those unfamiliar with clamp-meters, they allow you to fairly safely measure real-time power consumption using something called the *hall-effect*. the readings displayed are usually in amps, but you can multiply the reading by the line voltage to get watts, and divide watts by 1000 to get kilowatts (you're usually billed in kilo-watt hours, which is how many kilowatts you consume per hour) based on the client's "normal" bills, i ballpark his ~~hourly~~ consumption at 0.4kilowatts per hour, which works out to a meter reading of 1.7amps. of course, the reading will change depending on whether or not the fridge or other appliances are active, but we're just after a sanity check here. the meter reading finally stabilizes... and we're at an idle reading of 5amps. so i break out the calculator and run some figures: * i have an approximate reading of 5 amps, and a line voltage of 240volts (australia) * 5amps x 240volts = 1200 watts, which is 1.2 kilowatts per hour * 1.2 kilowatts per hour x 24 hours in a day = 28.8 kilowatts per day * 28.8 kilowatts per day x 31 days in july = 892.8 kilowatts * the client is charged at roughly 30 cents per kilo-watt hour, so * 892.8 kilowatts used in july x $0.30 per kilo-watt hour = **$267.84!** jesus christ. we're pretty close to last months bill, it's likely that there wasn't a mis-reading after-all. i ran through the house and verified active devices: one pc, one 32" lcd tv, one large fridge, one bar fridge, and a couple of small led down-lights. i have the same energy provider, and much more running idle at home with half the idle consumption! something is seriously wrong here. with the clamp-meter still attached, i turned off all the auxillary breakers. my idea was to turn the breakers on one by one until i find the circuit that draws an unusual amount of current. i start flicking the breakers on one by one until they're all on, with nothing unusual reported by the meter. i get to the last breaker, and i'm still only at 1amp total current. i ensure all the devices that should be on are on, and they are - except the fridges! they cycle on and off automatically as required. turning their power source off then on won't guarantee that their compressors will restart immediately. so now i'm feeling like a smug git, thinking that it's definitely one of the fridges that are at fault. so i sit there for a good twenty minutes waiting for the "click" of a fridge compressor. i hear two almost concurrent clicks as both the main and bar fridges power up (pretty unusual), and almost trip over myself running outside to get a current reading. ...it's 1.6amps. one point six. the fridges are fine, everything's back to normal. what the hell happened to the five amps i was getting before? try as i might, i could not get the fault to re-appear. devastated, i tell the client that there *was* a fault somewhere, but it disappeared when i reset the breakers. he thanked me, and said some words of encouragement that i can't remember, as i was too busy wallowing in pool of shame and utter defeat. i didn't even charge him for my time. i left his house and went back to work, but secretly hoped that the issue would return and that he'd call me. a month passes, and i get a phone call from the client. i had the biggest shit-eating grin on my face, man. i knew what the call was going to be about, and i started making my way over to his house as soon as i saw his name pop-up on my phone, i didn't even answer yet. his energy bill was still high, but it dropped from $270 to ~$230. i immediately broke out my clamp meter and got to work. lo and behold, the current consumption was almost the same as last time, 4.9amps (we'll call it a 0.1amp measurement inaccuracy) i really didn't want to reset the breakers this time, as i'd risk the problem disappearing again. i also couldn't fit my clamp-meter around the wires of the auxillary breakers to test them one at a time. this left me only one choice: i had to remove and test every actively used power point in the house, hoping that the problem isn't inside the roof cavity or floorspace. i started with all the major appliances. first i unscrewed the appliance's power-point from the wall, then i placed the clamp-meter around the "hot" line, and recorded the current measurement. i did this for the tv, fridges, microwave, pc, air-con, mobile phone charger, inductive oven, even the new bloody printer. i added all the current measurements and so far the consumption is normal, there's still three amps being drawn by *something, somewhere*. i take a break and have a coffee with the client, who asks me how things are going. i explained that the fault still exists somewhere, and that there's an "electrical leak" that i'm trying to find, but it's likely in the roof or floor-space. for some reason the topic then turned to his new ink-jet printer, on how he didn't expect the replacement ink cartridges to be so expensive. i explained that laser printers are generally cheaper in the long-run, and that the up-front cost of the toner just *seems* more expensive. he told me that he actually has a networked laser printer for everyone in the house to use (samsung mono mfc), but it was more convenient for him to use his locally attached ink-jet printer. in fact, he hasn't touched the laser printer a couple of months, and that sometimes he gets a pop-up complaining that it's out of paper when he accidentally prints to it. ... "so this printer, is it plugged in, *now*?" - sure is. "can i see it?" - sure can. there is no way i missed this printer. even if i did, it's a freakin' printer, i mean how the. surely, it's not the problem. surely! it's kept inside a stationary cupboard near the living room, with it's own power-point behind the cupboard. first thing i notice is a funny smell, reminiscent of hot plastic. the top of the printer is hot to the touch, and it's lcd screen is asking someone to load some paper into it. i undo the power point, attach my clamp meter, and sure enough, i measure over 3 amps while the printer is doing nothing but waiting. i am in utter disbelief. i figure the fuser unit is stuck "on", so it's keeping itself warmed up to accelerate printing when the page is finally loaded. i load a few pages into the printer, and it runs through its list of queued jobs. when it's finally completed, the fuser turns off, and the power consumption drops to nearly zero. i check the switchboard outside again, and lo and behold, we're back down to sane readings. i thought back to when i last visited, and realised that i must have cleared the printer queue when i cycled all the power off and on again, which is why the current consumption became normal. later on in the month, the client must've tried to print to the printer again, causing it to turn on it's fuser and wait for paper to be loaded! i'm still in disbelief. of course this is dangerous behaviour for a printer, so i've reached out to samsung for comment... i guess i'll wait to see if i receive a call next month **tl;dr** client's energy bill triples. only new addition to the house is a cheap inkjet printer. suspected many different major appliances, all check out fine. turns out clients old laser printer has been out of paper for two months, and its heater (fuser) was stuck "on" while waiting for replacement paper, drawing ~600kwh per month on its own.i had just left the barber's for my semi-regular shearing. my phone rings as i get in my car. i answer and put it on speaker, and start the engine to run the ac. &gt; me: "this is saberus." &gt; sysadmin in name only (aino): "yes, i have urgent request to check hardware for server *xxx*vm*yyyyy*np, it is down." &gt;me: "this is a vm, and non-prod, says so in the name. this can wait until normal business hours. or you can send the ticket to the vmware team." &gt;aino: "no, it is urgent that the hardware is checked immediately, i have already assigned a severity 1 ticket to your queue. need addressed asap as possible." i rub my face, and try to get to the bottom of this. &gt;me: "so is the host having issues, or just this vm?" &gt;aino: "just the vm." &gt;me: "then there cannot be a hardware issue, or else the host would be the one reporting an issue or purple-screening." &gt;aino: "so when will be onsite to check hardware?" blood pressure starts to rise. &gt;me: "tomorrow when i get in." &gt;aino: "but is urgent, sev 1!" &gt;me: "it is not a sev 1, it is not urgent. non-prod by policy cannot be sev 1, as it is not affecting company profit by being down." &gt;aino: "no, it is sev 1! please report to dc asap today!" %&amp;*@ this... &gt;me: "i will not. i am a contractor and my contract states i am only available monday to friday, xx hour to yy hour, central time. any deviation to this needs to be approved *in advance*, and any ot needs to be pre-approved by management as i bill at private rates for overtime." &gt;aino: "what are private rates?" &gt;me: "my private rate is $60/hr, two hour minimum. if it turns out that what i have already told you is right, and you could have fixed it yourself, or it needs to be addressed by the vmware team, there's an up-charge of triple my normal rate to $180/hr with 2 hours minimum." &gt;aino: "no, is sev 1, urgent, fix now, no private rate. when can be at dc asap?" i start to rage and curse, then: &gt;wife: "babe, are you ok?" i look around, and i'm not in my car... i'm in bed. i sit up and check my phone, no calls since friday evening. i know i have a "wtf happened" look on my face as i look at my wife. &gt;wife: "babe, your were swearing in your sleep, bad dream?" all i can do for a moment is nod. then i tell her what happened. she hugs me and reassures me it's not real. but still, wth, brain? ps: i can only wish to have a contract that let me charge private rates and idiot taxes. but i do have it in my contract that i'm weekdays only, and any ot has to be pre-approved. few years back my team was migrating about 250 users to a new build. in preparation we'd asked each users to label all their computer equipement so the movers would know which offices to move stuff to. the night before the move, i did a walkthrought and found this note attached to one of the screens. &gt;it, please don't forget to setup google at the new office. i can't do my job without it. i added a small message in reply &gt;i will personally see to it that "google" is there. afterward i got a email from the user thanking me for looking out. i work at a nuclear generation station (i'll keep it generic) with a staff of roughly 800 people. a ticket came in stating that the wifi was not working in one of the shops. so it heads down to the shop to find that the wifi is indeed not active down there. upon inspecting the wireless gateway we find that it has been unplugged. the gateway is mounted to the ceiling. someone had to climb up into the ceiling tiles and unplug it. which is exactly what happened. the same guy that put in the ticket about the wifi not working climbed up there and unplugged it because he 'didn't want that thing giving me cancer'. he was under the impression that because it was mounted right above his desk that it shot a focused wireless beam right down on to him and was going to give him cancer. after explaining that it doesn't shoot beams at people we asked him if he uses a cell phone (which you hold right up to your head) and he relied in the affirmative. we also pointed out that he works at a nuclear facility and is worried about getting cancer from a wireless gateway.today while at work my fellow tech support agent threatened me with a remote wipe on my computer. so i shouted (chatted) "do it" and forgot about it. five minutes later our dba comes into my office and starts wiping down my monitor and desktop with a tissue. he looks at me and says "remote wipe complete" and walks away. edit: oh, wow! thanks for the gold!as some of you have noticed, i’m female. i don’t usually catch flak for it, despite having a very mechanical job (and when i do, it’s usually from other women, which just irritates me to no end). i think sewing is such quintessential woman thing to do (despite the fact that probably 25% of my customers are men) that a woman working on sewing machines just doesn’t raise eyebrows. but every once in awhile, there’s that guy. this time, it was mr brown. mrs brown called; her machine was having some electrical problems, she thought, (“running up and down”) her husband had been unable to fix it, could i take a look at it? an appointment was made for her to bring it in. whenever i hear those magic words, i cringe. just like with the plumber, etc, if the husband couldn’t fix it, that generally means i have to undo whatever he did, figure out the real problem, and then fix it. when those words get used i charge by the hour, not the job. the next day, mrs brown, a white-haired old lady with a cane, turned up at the door. mr brown was right behind her carrying the machine. mrs brown’s machine had a knee controller. (the difference between a knee controller and a foot controller is strictly down to user preference. you like what you like, and don’t usually like the other one, but there’s no difference functionally.) mrs brown had had polio as a child, and had braces on both feet/legs, and didn’t have the physical ability to use a foot controller, but did just fine with the knee controller. then she told me not to plug it in until after i’d looked the controller. ok, why not? apparently mr brown’s fix had created enough of an electrical arc that she’d been knocked out of her chair when she’d tried to use it, and it had tripped the breaker and smoked the outlet. so i opened the knee controller, and there were solder burns everywhere. i don’t know what mr brown had done, beside the obvious crossing of something he shouldn’t have, but he had gone back and unsoldered everything, apparently without mrs brown’s knowledge. i plugged it and…nothing. mr brown had killed it. in the meantime, in the background, mr brown is making nearly continuous comments about my gender and likely ability to fix anything, let alone anything as complicated as electricity, and what i should instead be doing-basically, anything at home having to do with dishes, laundry and kids. mrs brown is shooting him increasingly lethal glares, and finally, after a comment about, “how is she supposed to fix it when i couldn’t? she can’t know what she’s doing!” mrs brown, turned around, whacked him-not gently-in the shin with her cane and told him it was his fault they were there at all, and that he should go wait in the car-he’d been quite enough help already, thank you. the expression on his face was comical, but he left. i had a spare knee controller and offered to sell it to her. she agreed, and i checked her machine in for whatever its original issue had been. when i called her three days later to tell her it was done, she told me she’d come get it in a week. “he’s going to hear about this for awhile. silly man *always* thinks he knows better than anyone else, and this time could have been bad. i still have bruises from falling out of the chair-i’m not young, you know-and the electrician is coming tomorrow to check the wiring and replace the outlet in my sewing room. you just hang on to it for a bit, dear, and when his ears are good and burnt off, we’ll come get it.” a week later they came back. mrs brown insisted i go into great detail about what was wrong with it (brushes worn into nothingness, carbon dust everywhere) and how i’d fixed it (new brushes, thorough cleaning), mostly, i think, to demonstrate to mr brown that i did know what i was doing. mr brown said nothing, just waited by the door. i don’t care if you’re friendly or not-businesslike is fine. but if you can’t be that, at least be civil. or quiet-either works for me. good cooks believe in the concept of "mise en place" - having every ingredient and tool out and ready before you start cooking. that way you won't be caught burning your food while scrambling to find something that was missed. that concept also applies to other areas of expertise, such as today's story. recently i had to take over support of an application due to the regular support guy going on vacation. no big deal. i get a request from the application's development team asking me to provision database role x for them, which they need for testing. no problem. i gladly write up the request and send it on its merry way. it takes a day to process and provision. but throughout the day the dev team is hounding me asking for the status. once i submit the thing, it's out of my hands, so i don't have much to tell them. the next day i get invited to a meeting including the project manager, who goes into a big wasteful lecture on how they are now a day behind and why is this late and what can we do to prevent further delays. securing this database role is something the project manager could have had taken care of weeks ago, but due to lack of foresight is suddenly needed immediately. the old saying about lack of planning and emergencies pops into my head as i helpfully suggest that they get me a list of everything that they need set up so i can send all the requests in one batch. the pm then says "i don't have the details; ask the dev team." the dev team says database role x was all they needed. meeting adjourns. i go about my day. so now the dev team has their shiny new database role x and are testing out their code. but there's a problem - their stuff is failing. after they spend some time figuring out why, the dev team comes back to me and says they also need me to request database roles y and z. as soon as possible. and what's the status of the request now? how about now? are we there yet? yo, project manager. i found your problem. you and your dev team ain't got your mise en place! tl;dr: my soufflé is burning. quick! knit me some pot holders! **me:** good morning sir, just a quick call about the phone you've sent in for repair. the problem is that it's using too much data? **customer:** yes, i got a huge bill so they told me to send it for repair. theres no way i used as much as i was charged for! **me:** riiiiiight, you see, this isn't really the sort of thing that *can* be caused by your phone going faulty... did you check your phones data usage in the settings? it's showing that youtube has been used lots on the phone, almost 9gb over the last month. do you use that app much? **customer:** no! i've never even been on that app! **me:** sir, is there anybody *apart* from you who uses the phone? children, maybe? **customer:** no, my kids are good! they don't run me bill up like this! can't you see what's caused this? **me:** ok... the phone can give me quite a detailed overview of how it's been used. it's shown youtube has used 9gb in the foreground. that means it's been used when the screen has been on and you've been looking at that app... **customer:** that's out of the question, i never use youtube! **me:** annnnnd if i go into the youtube app, i can view the search history, and *somebody* has been searching for peppa pig, horrid henry, and a whole load of other kids shows. now, are you *sure* that your kids haven't been using the phone?i work as senior tech support at a telco. not long ago, i got a call from a manager at a department i rarely work with. recoveries, the people who handle unpaid bills. &gt; bytewave: "senior line, bytewave. you may send me your ticket." &gt; recoveries: "no can do, i'm recoveries. i mean, from recoveries, manager for the red team." that's how they call the team that handles 'desperate' recoveries cases where there's no chance we're going to be getting a penny anymore from customers with a huge unpaid bill. typically most of their work is escalating files to credit rating agencies to ensure there's some consequence for bad faith non-payment. &gt; bytewave: "how may i help bring the full wrath of $telco on our non-paying customers today?" &gt; recoveries: "i have a dossier on a customer that has consistently avoided payment or contact with us. she has been disconnected a couple weeks ago. sending you the account number via internal chat. soon after, our staff got info from the data-monitoring tool that her modem was still heavily using the network. internal security even sent them notices for possible piracy. so i figured there had to be something wrong with our disconnect command and sent it up to networks. they said the disconnect was successful on her mac, and that they disabled the tap on the pmd just to be sure - pasted the ticket. but the heavy data usage was still ongoing, so we sent a road tech to physically disconnect the drop from the pmd. they did. but she found a way and is still abusing our service without paying. i've been asked to double-check with tech support first, but if you can't shut this modem down now, we're going to call the cops, have them get a warrant, and physically remove the modem from the premises." .... i let all that sink in with a deep breath. there's no way to somehow keep a modem online once it's mac has been blacklisted via our software, and the notion that work orders had been issued to physically disconnect the drop regardless was hilarious. but that even after the drop was cut, they were thinking about calling law enforcement because they were still seeing data usage... i had few words. it took a few seconds to regain composure. &gt; recoveries: "hello?! can you help? any way to really kill this modem or do we need cops?" &gt; bytewave: "i can help. according to our tools, there are four drops going out of this pmd, with only tap3 servicing the potential you're looking at. according to our files, there is only one device in there, a modem, $mac-address, but..." &gt; recoveries: "yes! like i said. one device, that somehow can't be disabled remotely or physically." &gt; bytewave: "if you'd let me finish. tap3 was disabled via software 6 days ago, and the drop on tap3 was physically removed 3 days ago - but the modem you're looking at stayed online and has recorded heavy network usage, especially upstream, ever since. obviously that's impossible given the line was disconnected at both software and hardware levels. the live tools confirm that there's nothing physically connected to tap 3 right now." &gt; recoveries: "... okay, so how did she jury-rig it past our systems?" oh ffs... &gt; bytewave: "there's nothing physically connected to our network on that tap. and if there was, it would be offline because networks shut it down remotely. the obvious conclusion is that you're looking at readings and history logs from the wrong modem." long silence. &gt; recoveries: "but it's in the file! the billing system would have never allowed this... " &gt; bytewave: ".. unless the mac you're looking at is legitimately provisioned elsewhere in the node. which it is - all we needed to do is to run a simple search. the mac you're looking at is physically as far removed as possible while being in the same node - and the actual modem of the non-paying customer is *definitely* offline - has been disconnected for some time before it even got to the red team. the billing system is full of holes, you guys know that right? why is this the first time anyone at tech support heard about this - there's no prior tickets? the guys at networks will blacklist any mac they're told to and have no time to investigate. we're the ones who should be called first per the procedure to look into this kind of issue before we involve them..." &gt; recoveries: "how is this possible? it's in another file and it still works?!" &gt; bytewave: "yes. and if you look at that file, which i just im'd you. you'll see the paying customer who actually has this modem has been complaining about non-service for... a couple weeks. we'll need to issue a full credit there. and if you look at the file history, you can figure out in eight seconds they used to live together. we sent a road tech out to replace his modem, because nobody could figure out that there's a recoveries block there *because we were never contacted, despite procedure*. this is both a perfect example of why our outdated billing and provisioning systems need to be updated and why inter-department policies should..." &gt; recoveries: "but! what about the lady not paying? can we cut her service or not?!" ... i gave up. obviously her service had been cut since they asked networks to shut down the pmd's tap3. when we sent a guy to disconnect the drop physically we were obviously wasting our time, it had been out for three days. how is that even something i still need to explain? &gt; bytewave: ".. tsss hereby confirms on record that there is no possible way that service currently functions at the address of this non-paying customer. the tap has been shut down by networks and the physical cable is disconnected, i have double confirmation - logs and tickets. no contact with law enforcement needed. your job is done, close the file." &gt; recoveries: "oh! well then. okay, gonna close it. this would be simpler if the system was a bit more intuitive." yes, it would... this would also have been simpler given a touch of common sense. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](so i'm not the best story-teller but this happened last week. i support all our organization's human resources and payroll applications and for some reason the cafeteria credit card machines fall under 'payroll' so naturally i have to troubleshoot four touch screen network machines that ring up tuna-salad sandwiches from time to time. last week we get a call from the 'supervisor of employee food services' and she is frantic. she tell us that the "entire system is down and no one can use the checkout machines." we ask her to reboot the machines and she told us that she "already tried that and everyone he is trying to eat and if you don't hurry everyone is going to starve." okay. so we call the network guys and they assure is that the application is live on the network and is responding. we go down to check the hardware and everything works except right when you press the 'checkout' button. we try using a mouse, we try different ethernet cables, we check the permissions for the machines. nothing. at&amp;t services our network so we ask them to come down and take a look. they are outside the building, on the roof, under the building making sure that everything is wired correctly. we can't figure it out. we have multiple meetings with different it managers trying to troubleshoot this system. one meeting in particular is pushing three hours to come up with a solution for the rest of week (card readers and pen and paper) when the phone rings. its the supervisor from the cafeteria, "hey sorry for the trouble. we figured it out." *long silence* "we forgot to pay the application license bill this month."this phone call actually took ~27 minutes to determine what she was trying to do and what she was looking at. this is the abbreviated version. one magical day, i was the lucky recipient to answer this helpdesk call while working on this particular campus. *i set my beloved coffee down to answer the phone* &gt; client: hello. i need some help, the email server is down. &gt; me: one second, let me check on that. *monitoring never said anything about it being down....* *clickyclicky* &gt; me: well, it looks okay from here, and i just ran some tests against it. what exactly seems to be the problem? &gt; client: well i can't open my email program. outlook, i think it's called. &gt; me: oh, okay. do you get an error message when you click on it? &gt; client: well, it's not even there, the icon is gone. &gt; me: alright, no problem. let's get it back on your desktop from your start menu. &gt; client: is that the button in the corner? it looks like that is gone too! *cover me, i'm going in* &gt; me: okay, let me try to remote in. what's your asset tag number? &gt; client: [xxxxx] &gt; me: i can't get in, can you make sure your network is connected? there should be an icon that shows the 'x' in the tray by the clock. &gt; client: my screen is black, i can't see it. ...her screen isn't on. wait, is the computer on? &gt; me: can i have you check to see if your tower is turned on? do you see a green light? &gt; client: no, its not how it normally looks. i think it's supposed to be green or blue. the round turn on button isn't working. &gt; me: i know you guys have tight desks over there, can you make sure it's plugged in to the wall? &gt; client: hold on a second, let me get a flashlight, it's really dark under my desk. *muffled noises* &gt; client: ugh, it's so dark in here when the power is out.my brain is still recovering from this call i got about 30 minutes ago. i do contract it. a customer called to have a new user set up for e-mail on their phone. i configure the account and e-mail the credentials to their boss with some brief setup instructions. about 30 minutes later i get a call from the customer, explaining that the new employee is attempting to get e-mail working. they've already looked at what's on the screen, and everything appears correct to them. they're using the correct e-mail protocol. so now we move on to the password, and the customer passes the phone to the new employee. "oh hi, yeah i've tried to do this damn thing about 10 times and it just won't work. is there any way we can change my password to something shorter? when he showed it to me i was like 'wow, that's a long password!'" i usually set a 9-12 character random alphanumeric mixed case password, so i'm used to getting complaints, but it's just temporary. they can pick what they want after initial setup, and i never have to know how terrible of a password they chose. so after having them retype the password (very slowly) 3 times, and verifying it works from webmail, i start reading off letter-for-letter what the password should be, making sure letters are capitalized where necessary. we get to the end... "that's it? what about the rest?" "that's the whole password, what do you mean?" "well i've got more here, there's a space, then a bracket thing, and then a lowercase c, a, s...." at this point i realize what's happening. after the password i wrote (case sensitive) so they'd know that it matters. for some bizarre reason, this guy has no idea what this means, and has been typing (case sensitive) at the end of his password the whole time. after correcting that *minor* error, i'm happy to say his e-mail is now working on his phone.i have a story i wanted to share about a data security breach at a large corporation. one particular executive had a malware infection on his computer from which the source could not be determined. the executive’s system was patched up to date, had antivirus and up to date anti-malware protection. web logs were scoured and all attempts made to identify the source of the infection but to no avail. finally after all traditional means of infection were covered; it started looking into other possibilities. they finally asked the executive, “have there been any changes in your life recently”? the executive answer “well yes, i quit smoking two weeks ago and switched to e-cigarettes”. and that was the answer they were looking for, the made in china e-cigarette had malware hard coded into the charger and when plugged into a computer’s usb port the malware phoned home and infected the system. moral of the story is have you ever question the legitimacy of the $5 dollar ebay made in china usb item that you just plugged into your computer? because you should, you damn well should. sincerely, an it guywork for a mid-sized law firm with ~20 lawyers, most of which are average with technology at best. i had to install google earth for an insurance lawyer so that he could view the intersections of a car accident. after showing him the basics of it, he continues on his way and i don't hear from him. later on, as i'm walking past his office, i notice he still has earth open (hours later), but this time he is starring at a blank piece of land. he is also on the phone with a worried look on his face. he waves me inside and asks me why his house isn't on google earth? is it gone? i'm on the phone with my wife right now who is on her way home to make sure there hasn't been an explosion and our home is gone, he says. his house was built in the last year in a very rural area of our city. after explaining that the images he is seeing are not in real time and are, in fact, likely a year or more old he calms down and continues on.hello, tfts. insert long time lurker first time poster here. i work for a company that contracts me as a work from home employee for a major isp. i had thought over my time at this job, i had seen it all. i should have known better. i will be me, customer will be cx. &gt;me: "thank you for calling (isp) wireless gateway support, my name is (me), how can i help you?" &gt;cx: "yes, i'm just calling in to complain that my internet service hasn't been working in several days, and i want this fixed now." &gt;me: "alright ma'am, i'll be glad to help with that. (insert qa points here including getting information for the account) okay, i'm showing that your service has been disconnected due to non-payment, with a past due amount of $xxx.xx(more than $800). would you like to be transferred to billing to get this fixed?" it was at this point i believe i heard a bomb go off on the phone as the customer starts screaming. &gt;cx: "past due amount?! i ain't never got no bill from you guys!" i see that she gets emailed bills, so i'm inclined to ask, &gt;me: "well, ma'am, are you not receiving the bills to your email?" &gt;cx: "yes but i am not paying it until you send me a paper bill! that's the law!!" it turns out the customer had not paid her bill in *four months* because she thought she didn't have to pay emailed bills. welcome to tech support. tl;dr customer decides that money is a fake concept and wants to pay her bill in yelling. edit: holy sh-! i went to bed expecting this to not be a big thing and it freaking blew up! thanks guys! also, some of you have seemed to nail down a possible employer, i'd ask that we keep that anonymous please. thanks!*scene: pc repair shop, i get a phone call from a local business owner who has a reputation for thinking she's cleverer than she is.* &gt; me: hello this is $pcshop, how can i help? &gt; $businessowner: i tried to convert a pdf document to a word document, and now all my pdfs come up as gibberish &gt; me: when you say convert, what did you do exactly? &gt; $businessowner: i right clicked, and pressed open with, and clicked word &gt; me: ok, what i need you to do then, is do those same steps, and instead click "choose default program" &gt; $businessowner: that wont work, because it opens in word &gt; me: it will, because you're changing what it opens with &gt; $businessowner: no, because when i download the document from my email, it gets converted to word &gt; me: trust me, its not actually getting converted, your computer is just a bit confused, go find a pdf and i'll walk you through it &gt; $businessowner:i cant, because they get converted when i download them, the only way to do it is to open it from my email instead of saving, but that gets converted while it downloads &gt; me: well, save it anyway, and i can make it open properly &gt; $businessowner: i cant, it gets converted &gt; me: do me a favour and humour me right. click on it and click open with, and then on choose default program &gt; $businessowner: ok, but it wont work! &gt; me: choose pdf reader &gt; $businessowner: ...... &gt; me: hello? &gt; $businessowner: ...... *click* one of these days, i'll get her to admit she didn't press the right button, so far in the 7 years of being here, this is the 4th victory against her ineptitude. *edit: wtf spelling* tl;dr "what the professional told me cant possibly work! oh look it worked!"the phrase "digging themselves a deeper hole" comes to mind with this story. there was no subtly here, no underhanded tricks, just...pure stupidity, stubbornness, and nonsense from a client. the story prominently features mma (previously featured [here]( ), a badass girl in her mid 20's who is an ex-mma fighter. she now works the front desk here at $deepsouthit. &amp;nbsp; at $deepsouthit we have three divisions. voip, isp, and it services. i work for it services and mma handles all of it services incoming calls and scheduling. she also unofficially acts as our t1 support by virtue of her listening carefully when we explain a problem and, while she has no desire to continue into the it field, has taken the time to let us teach her a lot of stuff we have to deal with so that she can save us time rather than just pushing a call back to our department. i say this purely to show that i have confidence in mma's diagnostic capabilities. if she can't fix it over the phone it's not a basic problem. &amp;nbsp; one issue we run into a lot is that our isp side and it services side gets mixed up a lot...we have it spelled out on our website exactly what each department does. isp has free support for internet related things and generally you only pay for the service and any local networking equipment such as your router, though we are willing to provide one, manage it, and support it for an additional small fee. it by comparison is a contracted or hourly service. if you don't have a monthly contract with us it's $flatfee per hour of service and it is quite a bit of money. people confuse this and get offended that we want to charge them for what they think is an internet issue, but is actually an it issue. &amp;nbsp; in this particular case we had $medicalsupplybusiness call in. they are a fairly well known client of ours. we provide internet to their building as well as their it services. since they do not call us very often they opted to just do our hourly rates whenever we were needed as opposed to a maintenance contract. normally we deal with nicedirector, a middle aged lady whom is at a level with technology that she is our designated power user on site. this week nicedirector was out on vacation, taking advantage of the holiday. instead we had harpy call in. harpy actively tried to avoid us, being one of the ones to insist that whatever systems they had before we arrived (pen and paper) were just fine for their needs. as an aside nicedirector and harpy are both equal rank in the company and are both directly under the owner in terms of what power they wield. &amp;nbsp; harpy called in towards the 9th hour of the day, mma had just prepared her tea, and was at that point where her normally happy-go-lucky attitude was fully cranked up and ready to roll. harpy threw a stick in that engine real quick...i didn't get the first part of the conversation, but overhearing mma from down the hall it sounded like there were a lot of accusations being thrown. she later told me that she had been questioning the quality of service they were receiving. for situations like this in which one of our front desk workers may need help, but not necessarily taking over the call, we have an im client that is all linked together. i ping her on it and let her know i'm about to conference into the call with my phone muted to listen in in case she needed help. she thanked me and the conversation went more or less as follows. &amp;nbsp; from this point forward anything in bold is between myself and mma on our im client. normal text is over the phone. &gt;harpy: "i just don't understand why you people can't keep our connection stable, every computer in this office has been disconnecting randomly all morning!" **me: "ask her if this has been interrupting their connection to their medical program."** &gt;mma: "ma'am have you been losing connection to your medical program as well as the internet? i have a note here saying that you have a medical database program hosted on one of your local servers." &gt;harpy: "yeah whenever we get into the program it kicks us out after a few minutes saying there is an address problem and that the server doesn't exist. that means we can't get out to it!" &gt;mma: "no ma'am that server with the program and database are in your building, we installed it. if it was a problem with the internet you would still be able to access the program." **mma: "just im'd isptech and he says the link to their building couldn't be any better. something else is up."** &gt;mma: "ma'am have y'all done anything today to your network such as add a new device or..." &gt;harpy: "of course not! all we did was add a couple of wireless routers to help put wifi to the rest of the building." **mma: sends me an emoji with an eye twitch going on.** &gt;mma: "ma'am you said a *couple* of wireless routers?" &gt;harpy: "five." &gt;mma: "ok so you put five wireless routers throughout the building...that is more than likely what the problem is." &gt;harpy: "explain. my brother works in it and has a setup like this at his workplace so it should just work." **me: "we quoted them for a set of unifi dishes to give them wifi throughout the entire building and she declined it."** **mma: "f@#$ing figures."** &gt;mma: "well ma'am your brother more than likely configured them to work together like they are. they can do that, but out of the box they have settings enabled that fight one another." &gt;harpy: "well that's stupid, what setting is this, why haven't i heard of it before on my home router or something?" &gt;mma: "it's something called dhcp, it hands out ip addresses over the network to various devices so that-" &gt;harpy: "put it in a way i'll understand it, i don't speak tech." **me: "hurr durr"** &gt;mma: "ok think of it this way...your network is a street in the big city of internet. your street name is the same as your building's ip address. on that street there are buildings with numbers. dhcp decides which number house that is. data is like the mailman bringing you your letters. when you have more than one router on the network doing dhcp it is like a group of people going around the street and changing the building numbers over and over again...the mailman doesn't know where to go." **me: "good analogy."** &gt;harpy: "well the mailman is f***ing stupid." &gt;mma: "...i'm sorry?" &gt;harpy: "if the mailman doesn't know what god damned building he's going to then he's a pretty piss poor mailman and i'd have fired him." &gt;mma: "that's...not...what i meant...look bottom line is either those routers get unplugged or you pay for a tech to come out there and and configure the routers to not fight each other. **mma: "omfg"** &gt;harpy: "let me speak to your manager or someone who knows what the hell they're doing. we're not paying a thing when it's your internet that's messed up!" &gt;mma: "whatever you say ma'am..." **mma: "you want this or should i pass this onto boss?"** **me: "go ahead and pass her to me, if need be i'll elevate it to boss."** &gt;me: after seeing mma mute herself i unmute myself and take over, "this is cyrillus, how can i help you?" &gt;harpy: she proceeds to explain that mma was no help at all and that she needed this problem resolved. i take a moment to finish a trouble ticket i had been closing out instead, &gt;me: "alright ma'am i have her notes here. it says you added five wireless routers unconfigured to your network?" &gt;harpy: "well i mean they're configured, we can get on the wireless...it just doesn't work!" &gt;me: "she also notes that she explained that dhcp should only be handled by one device on the network, that device being your dhcp server in your network room." &gt;harpy: "oh not this bullshit again, look are you a tech?" &gt;me: "i am part of the it team, yes." &gt;harpy: "oh...well...is there anyone above you i can speak with?" &gt;me: "i can pass you on to boss, but he'll tell you the exact same thing. your routers are fighting one another and they need to either have dhcp disabled or disconnected from the network." &gt;harpy: "that isn't what i want to hear, put me through to boss." i transfer her and go about my day... &amp;nbsp; two hours later boss sent me a forwarded email along with mma. on the email it explained, "spoke with her for an hour, she got abusive, and i disconnected their internet service. owner called in, i showed him the call recordings, then got this a few minutes later." it was an email from owner requesting harpy's ad account to be disabled and for a manager who was previously under her to be given the elevated privileges on the network that were normally reserved for harpy, owner, and nicedirector. an hour later there was another email forwarded to me. harpy's replacement and owner had approved of our unifi quote and i am now in the process of organizing getting it set up. &amp;nbsp; i love happy endings.just a bit of fluff for a chuckle: i get in the earliest, i get an hour or so before most staff are in, even the helpdesk, so the occasional call filters through. so i get one this morning, before i even normally get in, and it's from a remote depot user: **depot user:** "oh houston, the whole erp system is down, how long do you think before it's back up?" **me:** "i don't think it's down (i've receive no alerts) how many people are reporting that there is a drama?" **depot user:** "everyone is down, no one can log in" **me :** "shit, right, how many users are there at the moment" **depot user:** "well it's just me at the moment...." *sigh* **technically** all users are down, 1 of 1 is still 100%. ha ha turned out to be a password change she had ignored all week.so i posted a while back that manglement has had a way of listening to the wrong people until things go horribly wrong then they have a 'information gathering meeting' &lt;---renamed to hide facts. so i have been begging for cooling in a server closet for years. i keep getting everything but what i asked for. each time we pay someone to come and do something or make some workaround. but in the end when the door is shut or uhm summer comes the proverbial shit hits the fan. this year finished it. the servers all died. came in and equipment had fried. i had people crawling and running around asking what could be done? could we replace them? what how who why? i went out and surveyed the damage. systems fried and we would be repairing from stored parts. good times and completely preventable. i remind manglement that we need cooling. i point out the amount of money lost and projects now delayed because of this. no one actually paid attention. they just wandered around asking what else could be done. someone not in it suggested moving the equipment from "that hot closet" to a storage room. ding ding ding! we have a winnah! so instead of simply putting cooling in the server closet. we will rewire the building as we need outlets for power, repatch the network panels needed for the room, move the equipment, alarm the storage room along with adding door locks and hey are those winders to the outside right there? yeah.... so instead of simply putting in cooling... we went with the uninformed manglement option. im still wondering what the hell just happened....when i got promoted to tech support's senior staff many years ago, i was given a 1-on-1 class for the new job. i was a little surprised because i had been told there were no classes - those who pass the tough exams are deemed already qualified as far as the telco is concerned. the class was scheduled as 'special training, senior staff'. stephan, one of the old timers sometimes featured in my tales, was the 'teacher'. &gt; stephan: "okay no boring powerpoints for this one. this class is basically where we tell new tsss hires about the things we've been lying to you about since you started working here." he paused a few seconds for dramatic effect, but i knew some things are withheld on purpose so i wasn't too surprised. after explaining the confidentiality rules, he started with rather benign material, like 'secret' phone numbers or undisclosed locations where we operate. once we got to the tech parts, it got more interesting - learned the true reasons behind the worse flaws in our tools and how to work around them. learned about security flaws left live on purpose on the internal network because too many people needed them to work around bugs that there was no budget to fix properly. about thumbdrives with autorun scripts that they used to get admin on their workstations whenever required. minor stuff like that. :p but he really kept the best for the end. the last portion were things that actually could impact customers, about which we were expected to lie not only to them but to most internal employees too. it's one thing to have secrets about our own systems, but maybe another to systematically hand down bs answers *as directed by management* to a customer's queries about our service. this was the worst one... &gt; stephan: "okay, now the password system for email and customers' accounts on the website. ever gotten calls when working frontline from customers complaining being able to access either despite being sure they typed in the wrong password?" &gt; bytewave: "nope. guy next to me got one a few months ago i believe, but it couldn't be replicated easily. he wasn't sure exactly why. tsss said the password was fine and there was no anomaly." &gt; stephan: "that's the typical confusion that let's us get away with the worst password system in the multiverse. the entire system is slated for replacement in 6 fiscal quarters, so with a little luck *maybe* it'll actually happen sometime in the next 5 years." &gt; bytewave: "okay, we advertise that it's not case-sensitive - that's not perfect, but that's still not an explanation for why customers would think they can log in if they noticed they made typos, obviously. what's the secret flaw?" &gt; stephan: "*flaws*. every character after the 8th is discarded and the system does not actually support special characters. it's actually purely alphanumeric." &gt; bytewave: "but... i have special characters in my own password..." he gave me a few seconds to think it over, which i used to mull every call i overheard about this, every bit of relevant hallway gossip. too many frontline techs getting too many weird calls about passwords not working like they should. at that moment i was torn between 'oh, so it all makes sense' and 'please tell me someone got fired for this'. &gt; bytewave: "is the password system green-lighting alternate keys for characters the system doesn't actually support, just to avoid admitting that our passwords are all weak?" &gt; stephan: "first try, congrats. it started many years ago when the internet product director decided announcing publicly that our passwords can only be alphanumeric, non case-sensitive and 8 characters long could be damaging to our brand." previously featured in many of my tales, the ipd is the closest thing i have to a personal nemesis. cloaked in plot armor, despite his countless stupid decisions, he remains not only employed but paid like a vice-president despite utterly screwing up one time out of three. previously featured in tales [like this one]( or [this one]( or [this one]( ... &gt; stephan: "everyone is aware we're not case-sensitive, but what they don't know is that every character past the 8th is ignored, and most importantly that any special character defaults to a 0, which is unfortunately used as the 'wildcard'." that's when the extent of it hit me like a truck. if your password was 'q0w1!!00r4aaa' and you'd type in 'q0w10000' you'd get in just the same as if you typed in 'q0w1?/##'. in fact, if your password was '!"/$%?&amp;*' you'd get in typing '00000000'! case-sensitiveness or a 8 chars limit was one thing. having all special characters default to an alphanumeric wildcard on both ends was absolutely insane. given our [plaintext password offender status]( is well established, stephan was able to use the moment during which i was mesmerized to change a test account's pw to 20 special characters and demonstrate the flaw by showing our internal system saw it as a string of 8 zeros only. the system could never know whether a customer legitimately put a 0 in their password or if it was in fact a special character that had defaulted to 0. for someone trying to log in, of course, special characters were also interpreted as zeros. &gt; stephan: "this is also part of why you can never, ever tell a frontline tech any customer's password. the whole thing would be exposed if they spelled it out to the customer for any reason - even though they shouldn't ever. obviously customers shouldn't know we do plaintext either." &gt; bytewave: "this is crazy! we're all playing along with this? any customer who puts in a complex password is to be unaware what they believe makes their password secure actually weakens it, because the ipd decided it *could damage the brand*?! and somewhere a customer is putting in a 18-chars password, unaware that only the first 8 digits count?" &gt; stephan: "basically. it was signed off on as a temporary solution by systems *and* networks, good while ago. timetables got busted, happens a lot around here, but it'll change. in the meantime, if this gets out, bunch of people will get their email bruteforced as we still don't have a decent lockout solution. we're playing along for now. you can complain about it in team-only meetings or on non-recorded lines with sysadmins - but not to lower management in general, they were not deemed need-to-know. moving right along.." this entire time stephan looked like he was just letting me on a little quirky fun-fact. and that's probably how i'd tell it today too. experience in this job gets you jaded real quick. as for the odd customer who occasionally called us about a typo apparently not preventing them from logging in, they were often people with 9 or 10 chars long passwords - who noticed they mistyped the last letter or that kind of thing and still got in. while a handful of people might have guessed this much, the crazy notion of special characters all defaulting to 0 somehow never got out of house. though it took about 3-4 years, this horrible system did get replaced entirely. otherwise i wouldn't be posting this tale. though we're still plaintext password offenders... [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!]([part 1]( [part 2]( i am testing my workflows, still not exactly sure why it works on the test site, but not on the live site. and the phone rings...i really hate the phone ringing. &gt; me: hello, the is it, what can i help you with today? &gt; hr: hey, its hr, can you come up to my office for a few minutes now? &gt; me: need me to bring supervisor with me? &gt; hr: no, just yourself, we're ready and waiting. *click* *"we're waiting", who is the other person that makes up the we?* i head up the hallway towards hr's office, hoping this isn't going to be something that gets out of control, my control mostly. i knock on his door and i see him sitting behind his desk, with buck sitting across from him. *my phone vibrates a quick macarena* &gt; me: hey man, i thought you were heading out of town for a wedding. &gt; buck: oh i am later today, i had something else to do this morning. &gt; me: oh ok, what's this meeting about? &gt; hr: an exit interview, you need to do the equipment check in for him to sign. a millions thoughts were rushing through my mind, and i didn't know what i could say in front of him. *my phone vibrates again* &gt; me: um ok, is the equipment here? &gt; buck: it's all in my office, do we need to go over and do that now? &gt; me: we can, i need to print off a checklist and i'll come back by shortly, then we can go do the check in for the equipment. &gt; buck: great, i'll be here, i have some other stuff to sign and go over i think. &gt; hr: yep, quite a few things to go over and sign. i'll give you a ring when he is free of the form storm i'm going to hit him with now. i laugh at the 'form storm' comment, wave goodbye, then head back to my desk. i have to stop at supervisors door on my way. *my phone vibrates yet again* &gt; me: bucks doing the exit interview.... &gt; supervisor: really, did you find something and i missed it? &gt; me: no, i think he got another job and just decided to cut the strings suddenly. &gt; supervisor: guess devman got his way after all. heard anything from him? &gt; me: not directly, you getting an alert message from the firewall? *phone goes bzzz bzzz bzzz* he looks over at his email and drills down to a folder, and frowns. &gt; supervisor: yes, content hits on a laptop, it's.... &gt; me: developerpci right? &gt; supervisor: yeah, you got the messages too? &gt; me: no, but that's the pc that i let developer manager take, is it content hits? &gt; supervisor: yes, it's only been four hits, *bzzz bzzz* five hits so far. mostly dating sites, and gun sites, nothing adult *fingerquotes* related. &gt; me: kind of sucks that developer manager is going to try to drag this guy through the dirt. i wonder why he is doing this? &gt; supervisor: i wonder if he was looking for something to screw the guys new job up at this point. odd for buck to suddenly be out of here, think devman knew he was looking already and was trying to figure a way to screw his options? that hadn't occurred to me, and it made as much sense as anything else. &gt; me: that is a good evil plan, it'd never work, but i'll be damned if the common passerby would guess that's whats happening. i hear my desk phone ringing, i wave a quick adios to supervisor and rush over to my desk to grab the phone. &gt; me: it guy here, what do you need help with today? &gt; hr: do you have like a random teleprompter for these greetings? i take a moment to disable the phone notification for emails, digital sticky note on my desktop to turn it back on later. &gt; me: yep, that's what that last server was for, it thinks for me, i just read the words. the silence from the phone concerns me enough that i feel i must explain that it's a joke. &gt; me: that's a joke, i was asked to improve my greetings, i accidentally answered the phone with a joke the other day and it upset someone. &gt; hr: *snort* what was the joke? &gt; me: um you won't think it's funny, but i answered the phone with have you tried turning it off and on again? and then when he said excuse me, i said reboot the computer and call back. he hung up before i noticed it wasn't who i was expecting.... &gt; hr: yeah that's not a good joke. anyways, buck is ready to do the equipment check out. i tab over, send his gear sheet to hr's printer. &gt; me: is your printer spitting out a piece of paper? &gt; hr: why yes it is, do you want me to do the check out? &gt; me: no, just figured it would save some time sending it to source. on my way up now. *** i'm in buck's office once more, and he's initially the lines as i verify the equipment he is returning. &gt; me: so was this a sudden thing, or you been heading out for a while? &gt; buck: well, it was sort of sudden, but not as well. i was looking for work closer to pure development instead of database performance and documentation. and just between us, a change of management. &gt; me: change is good...you have trouble with your management? mine seems ok for the most part. &gt; buck: *laugh* you are a special case, you walk around and management tries to agree with you. i'm not sure what to say to that, so i got back to checking everything off the list. he seems to agree that things are awkward and waits for me to point at a spot to initial. &gt; buck: i didn't mean to insult you, if you took that as an insult. but you don't seem to be an employee most of the time, it's like you are here and everyone else works around you. &gt; buck: don't take me wrong, something needs done, you do it. i've not seen anything except outstanding support from your department. but like yesterday, you told a manager to be quiet and listen, and he did...i'd never do that, even if i was planning on quitting. &gt; me: ok, last line...then sign here. as we were checking things off, i had been loading most of it on a trolley cart. i stand up and offer him a hand to shake, he grabs it and shakes it firmly. &gt; me: sorry, i'm not sure how to respond to what you said, i guess i do tend to just roll over people on some things. don't take my silence as being upset or offended by anything you said, good luck with the travel, wedding, and new job. &gt; buck: um, do i leave now? &gt; me: no, you need to go back over to hr's office, i imagine you have to have a meeting with developer manager before actually leaving. &gt; buck: no, no, i requested he not be involved. &gt; me: ok, well, head back over there, hr can get you signed out for the last time, cut you a check for pay period and your remaining leave. he nodded and headed off down the hallway. i push the cart back to the cold room and head to my desk. i have 27 content alert emails, and an email from developer manager about stopping by to look at something. i forward it to supervisor, and then send him another message that buck's equipment is in the cold room. then i head back to developer land... devman's door is closed when i get there, so i knock, i hear someone moving around inside and the door suddenly opens. developer manager looks both ways then waves me into his office. he has a desk lamp on, and the over heard light is off. &gt; me: can i turn the overhead light on, this is a very uncomfortable situation for me? &gt; devman: sure, sure, you know you didn't do a very good job with this internet history stuff. &gt; me: what do you mean? &gt; devman: well, i found all this dating website stuff, and there is a bunch of gun enthusiast stuff. he's also been looking at personal ads, and not for lawn ornaments. &gt; me: really? show me, i can't believe i missed something yesterday when i did the snoop. &gt; devman: snoop? &gt; me: sorry, we call it a pc snoop inside our circle. &gt; devman: oh, ok, look see last week he was on these sites, and then he went here this week. &gt; me: man, i swear that wasn't there yesterday, i wonder how i missed it. &gt; devman: it's ok man, we're only human. *well, one of us is...* &gt; me: yeah, i guess i need to redo this, but it will have to be on a new pc investigation form, the other one was closed out already. he looks at me, glares really, i can tell he's trying to give me cancer with his mind, then he sighs. &gt; devman: ok, i'll submit another form. can you do the investigation today? &gt; me: sure, as soon as i get the form, can you get it submitted before i get back to my desk? &gt; devman: sure, i'll do it now. he almost pushes the laptop into the floor getting to his keyboard. i watch him typing fiercely at his keyboard, and then he looks up with a grin. &gt; devman: there its submitted, how long will it take? &gt; me: a few hours, schedule a meeting for 3 again? he nods and starts whistling, i turn towards the door. &gt; devman: wait, don't you need this? &gt; me: nope, we have a copy of it back in our area setup already. &gt; devman: oh right, ok, see you at three. i leave and i think he surely will demand i do the snoop on the laptop he's been messing with this morning. i get around the first corner and quicken my pace a little, just knowing he is going to call out my name as he rushes down the hall with the laptop thrust out at me. i get around the second corner and i think i might be in the clear, and hr grabs my arm suddenly from his doorway. &gt; hr: hey, why is there a new pc investigation form for a guy that doesn't work here anymore? &gt; me: developer manager request i take another look in light of what he found this morning. &gt; hr: what did he find? &gt; me: some questionable activity was found on the cloned laptop, i'm going to take at it again to be helpful. i grin and head down the hallway, as i turn the corner i see hr shacking a head hung very low. i zoom past supervisors office, and he hollers out my name. &gt; supervisor: hey troublemaker, come back in here a minute. &gt; me: whats up, i'm mid mischief at the moment. &gt; supervisor: he submitted a request that we take a second look at that machine. what is that about? &gt; me: hey, did you run a report on the content filter? &gt; supervisor: yes, now....what...are....you....up...to...? &gt; me: just doing my job, that's what you pay me for right? &gt; supervisor: you are going to give me grey hair, or make me go bald.... i grin and wave as i head to my office, i detour to the cold room to grab buck's laptop, then i get to my desk. i plug in the forensic thumb drive and run all my reports, he has removed his dropbox, and i don't spend much time working on his file contents. to be honest, i used some of the reports from yesterdays report. i think this one is primarily aimed at someone else, and the three pages of content filter report will be the centerpiece of the meeting. i accept the meeting request and head to lunch, when i get back i send an email to developer manager. i ask him if he found anything else, and letting him know to bring the laptop to the meeting. i know he found something else, because the content filter report is now four pages. right before the meeting i turn the notifications back on for emails on my phone. *** &gt; hr: hello guys, man this is some serious deja vu or what? i nod and offer up a weak grin, supervisor looks at the floor an scratches his head, developer manager is very lively and developer director appears to need a nap. *i could use a nap now that i think about it.* &gt; me: yep, seems pretty familiar, here is a copy of the report of the pc investigation. i hand out four printed summary reports from the form, i've signed the bottom of each cover sheet swearing to its accuracy. devman instantly goes thumbing through the pages looking for something. &gt; hr: well, from the cover sheet summary, you found nothing worthy of noting in the bad column, so that sums this all up? meeting concluded? i grin at him, he's trying to prevent my mischief, he tries to smile back at me. &gt; devman: this isn't right, none of the stuff i found is in this report. where is the dating and gun stuff? &gt; me: i was unable to find anything related to dating or gun site traffic on buck's laptop. developer director has nodded off, at least he isn't snoring. &gt; devman: i showed it to you, you saw it in my office. &gt; me: you did show me something on the laptop in your office, but i was unable to find it on buck's laptop, and the logs for his web activity to do show any non work related traffic. &gt; devman: you didn't take his laptop you left it in my office, you said you had another copy in your area. &gt; me: yes, we have the laptop that was assigned to buck, he turned it in today. &gt; devman: wait, let me show you this stuff. i look at supervisor with a grin as devman opens the laptop and shows that it has indeed visited some dating sites in the past week. he's animated enough about it that he wakes developer director up from his afternoon nap. &gt; director: what is this then? he leans in to look at the laptop, he goes a little pale and then turns red in the face. he is a stickler for internet access abuse in the office, he has a conniption when anyone mention msn messenger. he looks across the table at me. &gt; director: i thought you said you didn't find anything on his laptop? &gt; me: i didn't find anything on buck's laptop. &gt; director: well, this is a copy of his laptop right, if it's on this machine its on his machine right? you just overlooked this on his computer? &gt; me: no, sir, none of this traffic exists on the equipment buck was assigned. director looks around, then focuses on hr. &gt; director: buck has been processed out correct? &gt; hr: yes, he's up in the break room waiting for a meeting with one of the vice presidents before leaving. &gt; devman: wait, processed out, is buck no longer an employee? why wasn't i told? &gt; hr: you were clocked out in a meeting, your phone went to voice mail, and buck requested you not be involved in the exit interview. i notified developer director, and he said to go ahead and process him out. you should have an email about it from me, i don't know if you read it, i've not seen a read receipt yet. &gt; devman: i was busy....with a meeting....on the phone... he looked cornered, without anyone in the room moving at all. he sounded unnerved, but that made sense to me. &gt; director: so why did this traffic not show on his laptop on in the content filter? &gt; me: that traffic wasn't generate until this morning to afternoon, on that laptop. &gt; director: how did buck get this laptop to visit those sites? &gt; devman: buck didn't have this laptop, it's been in my office all morning. and now developer manager looks as if he's swallowed a green egg. &gt; director: wait, you had this laptop all morning, and this traffic magically appeared? &gt; devman: the dates say the traffic was last week. i giggle, from the stares i receive from the others in the room, it sounded as odd to them as it did to me. &gt; me: well, the dates on that laptop do say the traffic happened last week. but the report from the content filter say the traffic happened this morning and early afternoon. &gt; director: how did buck do this? &gt; hr: buck didn't do this, i think it guy is saying that the traffic was generated by the person with the laptop this morning. &gt; devman: then how does the stuff show up as being accessed last week? &gt; me: you changed the system date on the laptop, i bet you didn't change it back. i quickly spin it around and see that it's 5 days short of the proper date. &gt; me: yep, today is not the 24th.... hr stands and ends the original meeting is concluded, and thanks us for attending. developer director is looking at his employee with less than a pleasing look. supervisor is slowly shaking his head and gathering his papers. *** a little after 5pm i am alerted that i have a new email, instantly followed by a second. the first email is letting the staff know that developer buck has chose to follow employment with another company. the second email is a request to report on the activity concerning the cloned laptop, with a note to be sure to include my meeting record ( i know you recorded it - hr) and the content filter report. i'm also supposed to explain how the someone could create internet activity in the past. *** the following monday, there are two messages sent out, one is a notice about developer director is looking to interview people for a management position, and the second is to disable access for developer manager. *** while i was logging, saving the remnants of developer manager i happened to find a im conversation where someone informed devman that buck was interviewing for a management position in development. i decide that devman decided that buck was after his job and wanted dirt to make him look less appealing. i found out that devman ended up working under buck at the other company a month or two later. i don't know if buck was ever informed of the day before his last day or not.ltl, ftp, you know the drill. while i do not work in tech support but build and run networks, i couldn't resist telling you this tale of my stupid colleague that happened just 10 minutes ago. $dc is "dumb colleague", $ic is "informative colleague", $everyone is everyone else in the room i sit in. $ic just got off the phone and this ensued: &gt; **$ic**: guys, don't reboot your computers! &gt; **$everyone**: why not? &gt; **$ic**: the recent update for $softwarepackage is highly buggy. if you reboot after its installation, you won't be able to log on to your pc any more. &gt; **$everyone**: oh, ok, that's shit. better not reboot. &gt; *5 minutes pass* &gt; **$dc**: hm, i can't log on to my computer. &gt; **$ic**: what? did you reboot it? i just told you not to. &gt; **$dc**: yeah. but i wanted to try it. &gt; **$everyone**: why the hell would you want to try that? &gt; **$dc**: well, what else was i supposed to do?? &gt; **$everyone**: how about "not reboot your computer"? which now lead to him having to reinstall his machine. he's just sitting there doing nothing now.so, this is still a story of tech support. changed many details to protect identities. i was working for a small it firm 5/6 years ago, and we had a branch of estate agents that operated a couple of towns away. they recently opened a new branch, so i'm there running cable, setting up pc's and servers, the usual small it stuff. i'm the first one there, the boss opened up for me in order to get as much done before the staff arrived, so bring on 8.45, the staff begin entering. this is a small branch office, only 4/5 desks, the usual small estate agency thing. in comes this young girl, probably 19 or 20. i was a single 23 year old at the time, so of course i noticed her. obviously estate agencies hire good looking girls, yes it's sexist, but that's the way of the world, any edge a company needs to survive. so we introduce ourselves, i smile and shake her hand, she immediately blushes and gets very girly and giggly, so i knew she was interested. but i am a professional, i'd never mess up a career for a lay. after everything that was available was set up, i went on my way. when i got back to my office she emailed me. it was the usual thing of small tech questions, i would be polite and friendly in my responses, but never flirty or inappropriate. as we had a very good relationship with this agency, we would do home visits to the staff members if they had small it issues foc. it was just a small value add, providing they didn't take the piss. the boss knew not to take liberties with it. the girl lived alone, laptop, printer etc. so she gets permission from her boss to get someone round to look at her printer as it was printing lines or jamming paper or something. she only lived around the corner from the new office, so i twinned it with a normal checkup visit to the office. i finish my visit to the office, and ask her if she's ready to look at that printer, so we leave the office and walk to her flat. as soon as we left the office, she asked me if i had a girlfriend. i answered no, asked her why, and she just said "oh....no reason..." and we continued to her flat. funnily enough there was a problem with her printer, under the desk it was, so i was down on my hands and knees sorting it out. some rollers or feeding contraption was loose. i shouted to her "ok, it's done!" and i stood up and turned around, and she was right there in my face, with her shirt buttons seemingly loose. and that kids, is how i met your mother. **tl;dr** point to the doll where she touched you. i consider myself quite professional, but this isn't the only story of similar bootycallness. maybe i'm a whore. spreadsheets are the worst. i’d gotten a call for help late one evening. the lady on the phone was not specific about which particular part of her “computing experience” was broken. with a sigh i grabbed my bag and coat and headed up to her office, hoping to leave quickly. upon entering the department, i noted there was only a single lady left. she was busy clicking and typing at a speed i’d only seen in movies. it was mesmerizing. &gt;fast-click: are you it? &gt;me: yep. whats wrong? fast-click went into a monologue that i could only vaguely fathom. i finally realized what it people must sound like to people with no experience with computers. it was terrifying. fast-click was busy explaining where various pieces of data came from, how they are interconnected with other pieces of data. i felt my head nodding at things i had no idea about, agreeing with things that sounded like i should be agreeing too. &gt;fast-click: ....so, yeah... basically i need a graph of that. fast-click had paused. her eyes looked up into mine expectantly. ... i had nothing. &gt;me: er, not really an it problem per-say. &gt;fast-click: oh. her face looked crushed, it crumpled back to looking at the spreadsheet in vain. her hands were slower now. they seemed to tap the keys hopelessly compared to the ferocious typing i’d seen earlier. my bag felt heavy in my hand, i remembered it was time to leave. i couldn’t. &gt;me: where’s everyone else? does anyone know? &gt;fast-click: unfortunately, they’ve all gone home. i looked at the clock. i couldn’t blame them. &gt;me: maybe leave it till tomorrow, aye? &gt;fast-click: huh? oh. it’s was actually due a few hours ago. don’t worry about it. thanks for coming all the way up here! she attempted a smile, it had a defeated edge to it. my mind was in shock. i had gotten a thank you. an actual thank you. a non-forced full thank you, just for trying. i stood agape for a full minute. in that time fast-click had tabbed out of her spreadsheets and vaguely searched around other documents hoping to find the solution. my mind had been made up, as i swung another chair around next to her desk. sure i didn’t know much about financial modeling, but i knew how to search. &gt;me: okay, what specifically is wrong? &gt;fast-click: oh no, don’t stay. it’s so late. i can figure this out myself, i think... &gt;me: don’t worry, i got this. &gt;fast-click: how much do you know about financial modeling? &gt;me: almost nothing, but the internet...it knows everything. that slight flicker of hope in her eyes had ignited. i smiled. that night i spent a few hours searching various terms, learning which equations to use where. it was the most amount of information i’d ever absorbed in the shortest amount of time. eventually, at a time when normally i’d be asleep it was done. &gt;fast-click: it works! it actually ...... works. **** the next day in it was the largest plate of cupcakes i had ever seen. a mountain of delights stood towering in the break room. a single card was placed on the table in front of it. pantsuit was nearest the tower, and had picked up the card. she decided to read it aloud with a devilish grin. &gt;pantsuit: to airz, thank you so much for going *beyond* my expectations. x i could feel the eyes of my coworkers turning to me in shocked astonishment. &gt;me: err... a voice behind me broke in. &gt;fast-click: enjoy the cupcakes! i turned to see the brightly smiling face of fast-click. i wondered how she looked so fresh, and also how she had time to bake so many cupcakes. i didn’t have time to ask however as fast-click was already leaving. &gt;fast-click: thanks for your help last night, airz. let’s do it again sometime. and with a slight blush, fast-click left the department. people were still standing around in astonishment. &gt;messy: airz, you and that pretty lady... did you?! &gt;me: back to work everyone! i walked over to the mountain of cupcakes and selected one. i tried to decided between the blue or green topping ones. eventually i selected a greenyblue one. ambiguity is fun.long time lurker yadda yadda yadda. so i work for a fairly large company with offices and locations all over montana. recently we made the decision to switch from barcode stickers on assets to a rfid built into a barcode stickers (just in case) we'll one of the offices that we support that also happens to be the farthest away from our location is constantly needing new equipment,and policy is to inventory the entire office since we may not be near there until the next major error. well lo and behold when i get there and replace their main switch (which had a coffee spilt on it...in the locked closet) i got to work on doing inventory. the first computer had no rfid or barcode. thinking this had been an accident of ours by not putting one on. well each and every piece of equipment didn't have our tracking on it. i then went to the manager at the office and he says that he told his employees to take them off because they weren't needed. so after a call to my office i go about reinventorying the office and getting the stickers installed. after sternly talking to manager and telling him to leave them in in head back home. about 4 months later a coworker went up to upgrade the desktops guess what he found? if you guessed that he found that each piece of equipment, furniture and technology was bare he gave me a call to let me know. i went to my boss and let him know. his answer to was for my coworker to not do the upgrades and instead leave them as is. not too bad of an ending, however it got better. about an hour later my boss asks me how i feel about overtime and i go for it. the job was to take 30 iphone 4 phones to that office and switch out with what they have. for the record each and every employee there had a iphone 6s issued by the company. when i showed up and told them what was happening they were beyond pissed. when the manager who was the last one to turn his in asked why they were downgrade i simply said if we can't track what you guys have on site the boss says you get equipment that doesn't cost so much when it goes missing. [previously]( from the annals of $large_american_dsl_provider, i learned how to deal with the terrors that ensue when ups delivers ahead of schedule. this story also happened at the dsl provider. &gt;"thanks for calling support, this is thorssen, can i start off by getting your telephone number so i can look up your account?" &gt;"214-555-3434" even before the screen loaded i knew i was dealing with a texan, and this gentleman was of the good ol' boy variety. these guys are usually pretty cool, and this guy's a bit older-sounding so this will probably go alright. he's already got his account set up, his modem is reporting back great dsl signal, but no lan activity. from this, i'm pretty sure i already know what the answer to my next question is going to be. &gt;"alright, i've got your account up, how can i help you?" &gt;"ah bit you can, boy. ah live in a doublewide, see, and ahs only got the one phone line coming in. it comes intah mah kitchen, see, but mah computah is in mah bedroom. cin y'all help me?" alright, i think i've given you the idea about his accent by now. i'm going to clean it up the rest of the way, but this is what i was up against, here. &gt;"i'm sure that i can, sir. what kind of computer have you got?" &gt;"an old dell i got from walmart. it's pretty old, though, but it does well enough for me." i look at the rather silly excuse for a computer i'm taking the call from. honestly, i think i'd rather have the wally world dell than this pentium 2 driven crapjack piece of crap. &gt;"i'm sure it does just fine. so you don't have a wireless card or antenna for it, do you?" &gt;"no sir i sure don't." &gt;"that's fine, we'll have to find another way then. how far is it from the spot in the kitchen where you've got the dsl modem box to where your computer sits?" &gt;"in a straight line it's only about 5 or 6 feet but it's got to go out to the hallway and back as it is." &gt;"well, that's not too bad, the cable should reach, but you'll want to tape it down so it stays out of the way." &gt;"ugh, i know what you're talking about, and i don't think i want to do that. say, about how wide do you reckon the plug on that ethernet cable is?" &gt;"um... i don't know actually, 3/8ths, 7/16ths of an inch, maybe?" &gt;"yeah, that's what i was thinking too. hold on the line for me thorssen, i'll be right back in a minute or two." i look at the queue. there's no calls waiting... i've got nowhere to be, i'll let the old man do his thing. at this point i figure he's going to go snag a power drill, punch a hole in the wall and as long as i don't hear the sounds of him electrocuting himself on some wires we should be in pretty decent shape. i've got a browser open, and i'm reading news articles online to kill the time when- **bang!** jesus tapdancing christ on a cracker what was that? i look around, was definitely not on my side, it happened over there. &gt;"sir, are you there?" silence. i finally realize i recognize the sound - that was a gunshot! fml... i pull up a new tab and start to search for emergency dispatch for the dallas ft worth area, and while that's running i pull up another tab for our suicide procedures to make sure i've got myself cover- **bang!** again? what the actual f###? oh this is not okay. &gt;"sir! sir! can you hear me, sir! are you alright?!" &gt;"oh i'm alright, sonny don't worry. that was just my .38. you were right by the way, just about 3/8ths of an inch." &gt;"y... your .38 sir?" &gt;"yep. when you told me how big the plug on the cable was i realized i could put a hole in my wall with my pistol. worked like a charm! got it wired up now and the emails are coming in now. you helped me just fine!" he shot holes in the walls of his doublewide trailer home, with a .38 pistol. god save me, for i have been speaking with texans. &gt;"anything else i can do for you tonight?" &gt;"nope, but i know you boys do a survey at the end of calls, so if you'll shoot me on over i'll take the survey and give you a 10!" &gt;"it..." i'm still a little shaken, "it was my pleasure sir, and please hold to be transferred to the survey." -click- still no queue. i need a drink, but i'll settle for a dew out of the breakroom. god be with whichever qa critter has to listen to *that* recording. i don't quite believe it myself... edit: thank you for the gold, kind redditor! in the next chapter, [i strike a blow against communism!](i worked tech support for a #1 rated nationwide sunday morning tv talk show. one morning i got called to the studio because none of the 20 fluorescent lights in the set were working. my meter confirmed that the ballasts had 120v. i was assured that they had worked last week. i scratched my head while the pressure mounted. a dozen people were watching me. then i decided to take one of the bulbs out. the instant i touched it, it started working! i had to touch each lamp briefly, and they all lit up. they thought i had a magic touch. in reality, someone had disconnected the ground wire to the fixtures in order to troubleshoot a microphone buzz, and never reconnected it. some fluorescent lamps need a grounded reflector near them to start. my body capacitance was enough to make it start. just don't tell them that, they think i'm brilliant. happy friday everyone! here's a shorter story, this time for an incident that just occurred earlier today. for those that don't know i provide tech support to a medium-sized hospital. today's tale is courtesy of our hr department. ***** lunch time. the thirty minutes of peace and tranquility that no man or machine can break. the law protects you and watches you as you eat your cheap slop for an unpaid 30 minute period... unless you're it apparently. so while my coworker and i are eating lunch the head hr unionized pencil pusher (we will call her hr lady) comes in with a personal camera and looks at my coworker (we will call him d) while he chews on his sandwich. &gt;**hr lady:** hey i want to get some pictures off this. hr lady waves her camera around. d continues to stare back while chewing. i intercept. &gt;**me:** we're eating lunch right now. &gt;**hr lady:** this will only take a minute! sooo... she begins looking at d again, knowing my position. he continues eating without doing much else to acknowledge her. &gt;**hr lady:** come on guys! &gt;**me:** i'll come help you as soon as i'm done eating, just give me about 10 minutes. even then i would be cutting my break short... *sigh* &gt;**hr lady:** that won't work! &gt;**me:** why not? &gt;**hr lady:** i go to my lunch in 15 minutes! *mental facepalm* &gt;**me:** well we can either go in a few minutes or wait till you get back from lunch. &gt;**hr lady:** you can't interrupt my lunch break, that's against the law! my coworker and i just silently stare at her. i think she finally got the message because she had the good graces to look ashamed before slowly walking out of the room. &amp;nbsp; **tl;dr** i'm union so my lunch break is more important! *blows raspberry*last xmas, i received an email from my company's technical support team to let me know their closed days for xmas holidays as well as wishing me a merry xmas. i thought that was nice, so i replied to the email wishing them a merry xmas in return. next thing i know, i receive an email from them, assigning me a job number #xxxxx for wishing them a merry xmas and informed it would be given a medium priority. funniest present ever, as i was having a shit day until then. i came back from xmas holidays to find a new email from tech support telling me that i would be contacted within 4-10 days to resolve the issue. 3 days later, they sent me an email saying the matter was closed. this occurs back in 2010. summer full of massive rainfall and floods. i arrive at the office at the usual 7:50, check the answerphone and am ready for 8am when the phones go live. no messages left overnight. the first two hours of the day are taken with mundane password resets, locked out of encryption, can't find a file, and so on. after i come back from my break, the head of it (hit) and the manager who's new agency staff (tempman) approach me and ask if i can spare them a moment. i glance towards my boss, who nods, and off i go. &gt;hit: it gives me no pleasure to inform you that as of now, we are suspending you on full pay pending a formal investigation. the bottom falls out of my world. &gt;hit: do you understand? &gt;me: i want my union rep here please. they seem unphased, but hesitate to get up and fetch him from the other side of the it office. five minutes later he's sat next to me and hit repeats what he said to me earlier. &gt;rep: as dpg is a union member and because he's been here for five years, you have to allow him to defend himself here and now. you then get to make the decision for suspension based on that. &gt;hit: the charge is gross professional misconduct *a sackable offense and one where the investigation is done quickly and quietly* on the grounds of he brought tempman and the it department and the council as a whole into disrepute by his actions. rep glances at me, and i shrug my shoulders. to my knowledge, i've done nothing wrong. i've not posted anything on social media, blogs, or the internet in general for ages, and certainly not from work. my only interaction with tempman was to say hi 5 days ago when he started, and to recommend a meeting room to him yesterday. &gt;me: i'll need a little bit more to go on than that. it's extremely vague. &gt;hit: you told tempman that he had to use the main library meeting room for his meeting last night. part way through the meeting, all it in the building was lost and he was made to look a fool. we could have lost out on significant ppp deals because of that. &gt;me: the library meeting room was the only one that fitted his exacting criteria. holding 25 people, projector screen and network point, food services on site, and in a building open at 7pm. i neither caused the network outage or realised that it was going to occur. &gt;tempman: it was planned maintenance, apparently. *he looks smug*. &gt;rep: no it wasn't. there's no planned maintenance until next month. i'm the one who schedules it in. there was a deathly pause. &gt;rep: look, this is starting to sound like a vendetta against dpg. i'll work with him and let's find out why the it failed in that building last night. give us an hour, then make your decision. if you still want to go down the investigation route, then if you can prove any wrongdoing, we'll accept the suspension. if not and you still suspend, dpg is within his rights to go to acas for tribunal, or to sue personally if he feels it's a vendetta. they nod, grudgingly, and we go to work. logs on the switches show that at 7:34 that evening, the connection to the wan dropped. it attempted every 30 seconds for nearly an hour before finally reconnecting at 8:32. we checked the other end of the connection, and got the same message, although the entire wan other than two buildings were connected. &gt;me: what have the library and the depot have in common, network wise? &gt;rep: they're both slow. networks are trying to upgrade the link. &gt;me: why would they both drop within a minute of each other? &gt;rep: pass. i'll find out what link they're using. perhaps it's a faulty circuit. he calls networks, and after a brief conversation, hangs up and turns to me. &gt;rep: google last nights weather for the area, print it out and follow me. i do as he says, and we go back into the meeting room. hit and tempman are joined by hr director (dir). &gt;rep: i want this matter dropped immediately, otherwise we'll lodge a harassment charge. &gt;dir: that's not the way it works. i've been briefed on the situation, and i can't see how you can refute this. &gt;rep: so, no dropping this? &gt;dir: no. &gt;rep: the library connects to the town hall next door to it, by a short-range, line-of-sight transmitter using lasers. it was done that way because of the problem digging a conduit across the road. last night, at round about half past seven, it became foggy. the depot, just around the corner, also lost connection at a similar time. it too, uses a laser. &gt;tempman: what idiot put that system in then? &gt;hit: i did! tempman looks rather shame-faced, then he perks up. &gt;tempman: why didn't you say that the library had this issue, and why didn't you call me and let me know that it was getting foggy? &gt;me: firstly, i only found this out ten minutes ago, secondly, it's never proven an issue in the five years i've worked here, and thirdly, my work stops when i leave here in an afternoon. as you don't pay call-out or overtime, i don't work for free. *i turn to the hr director* how do i lodge a harassment complaint? tl;dr temporary manager attempts to fire me because i cannot control the weather. update: it management asked me to drop harassment complaint in lieu of a slight promotion. i declined. i won the harassment complaint and tempman's 3 month contract was not renewed. during those 3 months, tempman did everything within his powers and within corporate policies and logical reasoning to deny me anything i asked for. it turned out that he and hit were really close friends since university, and that some of the better working practices i had suggested already in documented format, he wanted to introduce and claim credit for. i was treading on his toes. they ended up paying me compensation in the form of double my annual salary, and hit was replaced about a month later after he quit because he "accidentally" knocked an employee down a flight of stairs and broke her arm.5:30 pm yesterday my phone rings. i sigh (for some reason the later in the day the phone rings, the more annoying the call) and answer with my best "i only have three more days before a glorious two-week christmas break" cheer. &gt;"can you help me with my computer or do i need to talk to a tech?" oh. one of *you*. almost 2016 and half my callers still default to believing that the female voice on the phone is a secretary. i assure him i can help, that i am a tech, and - quite literally - the only person here. &gt;"well, i'm having a software problem. how much will it cost?" oh. one of *you*. i attempt to get him to troubleshoot a little bit with me, but the best i can get out of him is his pc is intermittently bluescreening, and he can't tell me when it happens, if there's a pattern to the bsods, any numbers or error information on the bsods, when it started happening, or if it has been happening with more frequency lately. and, of course, the more questions i ask the more annoyed he gets. &gt;"look, i just want to know what it will cost for you to fix it." sigh. &gt;"well, sir, i hate to give a solid quote before i see the system. there can be a lot of different underlying causes to an error like this and without being able to run proper diagnostics, it will be hard to give you a proper price. i will say our minimum fee for most repairs is [price], and the standard fee for repairs with underlying hardware problems is [price + hardware costs]. however -" &gt;"but you just said you don't know what's wrong with it!" &gt;*can't get fired before christmas can't get fired before christmas* "however, we do offer free estimates. if you want to stop by and have me take a look at it, i can give you a much better quote and that part would be free." &gt;"finally. how late are you open tonight?" i glance back at the clock. it is 5:45. i inform him that i close in fifteen minutes. &gt;"great, i'm only five minutes away. i'll stop by and you can tell me how much it'll cost." &gt;*groan* "i could check it in tonight sir, but it'll be tomorrow before i could take a look at it. and, i'll warn you - we're going to be closed next week and the week after, so i may not be able to repair it before the holidays. i am still more than happy to look at it, but those are our hours for the holidays." he didn't bother responding and just hung up. which, sadly, i am used to. i shrugged and started closing. he was back at 10:05 this morning. i know this because he informed me i'd kept him waiting for half an hour. (we open at 10.) he plops a gateway desktop pc on my counter without ceremony and stares at me, soundless save for the complaining about time, as i plug it in. the poor machine whirrs to life sluggishly and eventually deposits me at a vista login screen. i have him log in and start some basic troubleshooting. every question i ask is met with an increasingly annoyed "i'm not sure, it's my kid's pc." of course i can see shadows and hints of the errors in the event viewer and various logs but not the fault itself, meaning that, like i already knew, it's going to have to get the full diagnostic workup to figure out what's wrong with it, even though i suspect that the final diagnosis is going to be "it's old." i pull an intake form out from under the desk and pause before i hand it to him. &gt;"well, there's definitely something wrong with it [*besides being a gateway machine running vista*] but i'm going to need to check it in to find out what. before i do that, i want to remind you that we are going to be closed for the weeks of christmas and new years - after friday we won't be open again until the 4th. it may not be done by friday. if you don't want to leave the computer here that long, i recommend you take it elsewhere. i can give you the names of several other places in the area." &gt;"so you can't fix it? why'd you tell me to drive over here then?" &gt;"i can fix it, it just may be january before it's done. i told you that on the phone last night." &gt; &gt;"well, how much will it cost?" &gt; &gt;"like i said, i have to check it in and properly test it. it's not going to be something quick and easy. also, with a system this old and outdated, it's probably better to just replace it rather than dump a lot of money into fixing it. you can get some nice systems around the holidays, and almost anything is going to be an upgrade over this one." &gt; &gt;"well then why did i bring this down here? you told me you could fix it this morning! what do you mean it'll be january before it's fixed?" i'm trying very hard to care enough to be nice to this jerk. &gt;"because something is very wrong with the computer and i'm not sure what it is yet. because we're closing for the holidays for two weeks and nobody will be here to work on it." &gt; &gt;"well why don't you have a sign up or something?" reddit, i tried. i did. i wanted to be good. but i was standing right in front of the two-foot-high poster with our holiday closure warning on it. there's one pasted in the front window, too, surrounded by blinking christmas lights (and forty pounds of duct tape to hold them on since $boss ran out of masking tape and improvised). it's on our yelp page. it's on our voicemail. i've worked customer service in one form or another since i was 19. i knew what would happen. &gt;i said sarcastically "like this sign?" of course that sparked the explosion. how dare i assume he was stupid! he's just trying to do something nice for his kid for christmas by fixing his pc! i'm the obstinate little [redacted] that's keeping his kid from playing "that apocalypse game" (later determined to be fallout 4) that he just dropped a ton of money on. every statement is punctuated by him leaning across the counter and staring pointedly at me as if i will crumble before the onslaught of his customer fury. eventually, i cut through the tirade. &gt;"sir, i'm sorry. i don't think i can fix your pc. please try a different shop. thank you." it's my "get out of my store" mantra. i merely repeat it until they leave. combined with the fact that my "please don't realize i'm shaking in terror" face apparently looks like a "i'm about to rip your heart out indiana jones style" face, it makes people go away. it didn't work. &gt;"i want you to fix it for me now." what? that always works. i repeat myself several times. he repeats himself several times. we must have sounded like a weird broken recording, or a futurama episode. eventually he stopped, leaned over the counter, and in his best dramatic voice, stage-whispered: &gt;"you. are. ruining. christmas." &gt;"[competitor] is open every day next week except for thursday. geek squad is open every day next week, afaik. [competitor 2] is open until wednesday. best buy and frys both have pcs on sale right now." i was very proud of myself for neither a) running away, or b) laughing at the image of his face all screwed up together as he bent over this poor pc to threaten me. i hope he thought the shaky voice was my barely restrained fury instead of the repressed urge to piss myself. eventually he did leave, threatening to write bad reviews up as he was tearing the assorted cables and cords from the back of the computer. he sat in his car in front of the store for several minutes, presumably attempting to write said bad review, before screeching out of the lot. no sign of the bad review yet. and the nice lady directly after him could troubleshoot to the point where she had *cloned her own hard drive to eliminate the possibility of hardware errors* and merely needed reassurance that reinstalling the os was a valid repair choice. i almost offered her a job on the spot. *edit* for the tale my my nice user, go [here] (the office i work in is a big hub and spoke configuration wan with 9 remote locations across the country. one day while eating my lunch the power goes out. despite my constant protests and demands for multiple battery backups we only had one and the msp who had installed it apparently just bought one at our local computer store and plugged our big vmware cluster into it. so i figured i had about 2 minutes to shut down the whole system gracefully. i sprint into the server room knocking a sales person out of the way and begin the process and just in the nick of time i shut down the last server and watch the lights die on the battery backup. i catch my breath, gather my thoughts, and head back to the breakroom in the now dark office. when i get back to the break room that random sales person is now sitting eating my lunch. for what felt like 5 minutes all i could do was stare at him with as much hate as i could possible muster. his superisor got me lunch and wrote him up for it (sad thing is its not the first time he has done stuff like this, notorious for grabbing a whole pizza when the office brings pizza and eating it at his desk.the next couple of days seemed more irritating than usual with angie taking any opportunity to shadow work from almost any its engineer. for me, there was a notable visit to the desk occupied by the hr tank. angie appeared mere seconds after my arrival as i walked hr tank how to switch off "those stupid red lines under everything i write" in ms word. thinking she was just up there to see hr tank, i mostly ignored her while i explained what those stupid red lines were. when i got done, angie corrected my imminent departure by with "now, ask your customer if there is anything else you can do for her today!" barely time to react, the hr tank rolled herself back in front of the monitor almost steamrolling me out of her path. "actually yes there is! i want to know why i can't change the text on this button here" she bellows, pointing at the start menu. after two tedious hours of this sea creature barely able to muster the muscles in her head to stop dribbling as she spoke, it was finally time for their regular starbucks visit. never have i been subject to the most inane lines of questioning and constant corrections by angie. after taking note that hr tank "really needs a faster computer" i take shelter in the canteen, kept company by the sole remaining cheese and pickle sandwich they had left. did i ever mention, i really do not like pickle? it was either that or starve! i returned to find bhit pacing around the room. his ruffled jacket and red face added to his now urgent stance; the few hairs that seemed strapped to the side of his head for once looking windswept despite their nominal length. he immediately pounced. "margie from legal affairs needs her machine back. are you done with it?" after racking my brains and my ticket list for several minutes, i found his solution. "that was one of the machines removed by you and the third line guys from the meeting room..." and so begins the epic hunt. we first visit the third line guys who profess innocence. our next stop is facilities, who again have no idea what we're on about - the facilities manager takes great pains to point out that they want nothing to do with it and are getting annoyed with being implicated. a two hour whistle-stop tour of the building with mafg in tow shows up nothing, even the it cupboard is untouched. on returning to bhit, angie who is fully tanked on coffee has now just been made aware of the missing machines and is scouring the ticket systems for evidence of my failings. sometimes it pays to be an astute record keeper; on several of the tickets i noted "machine in hands of third line/facilities". angie is her usual helpful self, demanding to know why i informed nobody of these machines' importance or even questioned where they were off to. it's nice to have a policy one moment of facilities looking after the whereabouts of it kit, yet when it goes wrong it goes back to the nearest support monkey! i took great pleasure on relaying the reaction of the facilities manager and also that each machine had been clearly labelled with a ticket number and name! after growing weary of angie's bitchy comments, mafg and i spend the final hour of the day searching out any nook and cranny we come across for either the missing machines or even the facilities guys who did the clear-out. it seemed my inspired plan of doing my job and gaining an ounce of vengeance was quickly backfiring as the day grew dim. on our way to one network riser room, we passed margie from legal affairs. she couldn't help but stop me to ask for progress and relay the updates she'd gotten which amounted to, "apparently you managed to misplace it and still can't find it?" nice one angie, way to pour salt in the wound! we had given up. in a purely flippant move, by pure chance mafg opened the door to a janitor's cupboard. sat behind an industrial-sized bottle of domestos bleach and providing gravitational support for a mop and bucket was our ghost server. it stood almost majestic; it had seen many an its engineer through the worst of conferences and the coldest of late nights. we rescued the discolored hp proliant from this murky cesspit and carried it back to its. we relayed our voyage to bhit, as angie stood stony-faced, glaring disapprovingly at our failure, the ghost server standing as testament to their managerial apathy. bhit saw no alternative; he commanded that margie's machine must be replaced by tomorrow morning, even if we take another one from stock. the other missing machines would have to be queried with the facilities department to determine their location! after clarifying a bend in the rules was ok "just this one time", i duly began the process of getting the ghost server back up and running to image a brand new optiplex from the it cupboard at my desk. i set to work. 8pm rolled around as the drone of people leaving and passing me by grew steadily to silence. i sat illuminated by a single monitor, prepping the optiplex with all manner of legal type software, domain configurations, etc. as i was the only soul left, the auto lights had dimmed most of the office, only to be activated in sequence by the cleaner, almost like a searchlight dancing on the stage, illuminating some actress performing against the backdrop of the hoover motor. after visiting margie's desk and reconnecting her new pc, i fired an email off to bhit and angie. it read: "it's 8:30 and i'm done replacing this machine. surely this is a testament to how ridiculous it has been for support lately. we have asked several times for a permanent out-of-sight build and repair area in order to perform our duties after the one we had been using - and had been in use for several years - was summarily decided to be unsatisfactory! this matter needs resolution immediately". feeling authoritative in myself, i hoped that demonstrating dedication to resolving these matters would help score points with anyone in the chain who mattered. i reached for the monitor switch to sign out for the night. but, as if big brother were watching, outlook's "new mail" balloon popped up with it's accompanying self-important boink. angie's name adorned the balloon like a warning label. i opened it, addressed directly to me, were the ominous words, "we will discuss this tomorrow!" [pt1: a new world order]( ) [pt2: safety first]( [pt3: the it induction from hell]( [pt4: undercurrents]( [pt5: how to make friends and...]( [pt6: marking territories]( [pt7: one friday to rue them all]( [pt8: best laid plans]( [pt9: its one step for man] ( [pt10: ...and one step back for its] (decided to post this tale after the attention this comment i made earlier this week got some attention. sorry for the wot in advance, but here's a tale i have worth mentioning. i stand up for my team. this reminded me of a similar experience. one of my employees had a customer calling in, i happened to be doing a random quality listening. he was complaining about the company, how it was a terrible company, he didn't agree with or how we did anything bla, bla, bla. okay, that's fine. employee tired to empathize, she got cut off, he started cussing at her &gt; $customer "you're f-ing stupid, that's not a solution" she didn't even have a chance to offer a solution. she politely asked him to remain professional and to refrain from cursing (i would've probably ignored it and tried to move on since it was just the first time) then he responded by going off on her even more &gt; $customer , "f-this, f-that, you're stupid, i'll have you fired, bla, bla, bla." this isn't something i ever tolerate, people are human beings, you don't treat people like they're anything less than yourself or how you'd treat your mother/father/family/whatever. while he was still going off, i walked over to her desk, said, "hand me the headset" she looked puzzled as heck, and was like "uhm well. ok." **here's where the fun starts.** "hi this is $aaron1312, i'm a sup with $company, i'll be taking over from here, how can i help you?" he boldly responded, &gt; $customer "oh wth where did $employee go? you people are nuts, stupid, and f-you." i did the polite-assertiveness op (/u/jb_gibson) was referring to, &gt; $aaron1312: "she's no longer available and i'll be helping you." &gt; customer: "where'd she go? i wasn't done with her, put her back on the f-ing phone." &gt;$aaron1312: no sir, i'm not putting her back on the phone **because you're abusing my employees, i will not have that**. now, how can i help you? &gt; customer: f*** this company, i'm done cancel my account at this point i see he's not eligible for retention, *f--- yeah* &gt; $aaron1312 okay i'll get the account closed for you, do you understand that you'll have to re-apply for a new account? &gt; customer f-** you!!! &gt; $aaron1312 i understand, thank you have a nice day. after that, she looked at me with the most blank/dazed/confused stare i'd ever seen and told me thank you, i said "it's my job, don't worry about it, don't let these people get to you."in the late 90's i worked for an it company and we had one of those old hp laserjet printers where the toner would bunch up and it would print half of a page. you'd take the cartridge out, smack it a couple of times and you'd be able to print again for ages. well, we finally ran out of toner and the new cartridge started acting up on about day two. you could feel the toner in there but it would get cranky after an hour or two. it was bad. on about day five which was a friday the boss got pissed. he was one of those guys that went from zero to explosive over a drop of a hat type guys. well just after lunch the toner acted up again. the boss smacked it against the wall a couple times, tried to print and it came out all mucked up. this time he smashed the cartridge against the wall and it exploded. fine black dust just filled the room. covering him in his nice white business shirt, his favorite goofy tie and anything within about ten feet around him. he lost it. screaming and yelling and almost in tears. we all started laughing which made him madder. we were all ordered to leave the office and not come back until monday morning. **tl;dr** napoleon cried while being covered in printer toner. this is from the audit files. i was doing vendor security audits for a bank. most of the time these were quick- show up, go over a questionnaire, ask a few questions and determine the level of risk the vendor presented to the bank. sometimes they revealed bad, bad practices. other times, it was an opportunity to commiserate with a fellow it/is worker. the vendor in question is an outsourced helpdesk vendor. i'm concerned because these guys have fairly serious access in our client's active directory infrastructure. i ask about what they do to prevent compromise. somehow we get to talking about sony and phishing. the director of is has a rare moment of candor: director of is (dis):"we recently did a phishing exercise- we sent 300 employees a phish offering to replace their current dells with macbook airs. that went wrong, fast" me:"how?" dis:"we collected a bunch of credentials and then sent a reminder about how to identify phishing emails" me:"ok, what went wrong?" dis:"i sent the reminder. i had two users who kept asking when they were going to get their new macbooks, even after i called them up to tell them that they responded to a phish" i ranked them fairly secure, especially since anyone who'd admit to this is only telling me what i already know. [previous]( entering the vp’s office, i realized the vp seemed genuinely pleased to see me. i had an erie feeling. &gt;vp: whilst you were away, we had a little… slip- up. &gt;me: what, kind of slip-up? the vp rose from him chair and walked over to the door. &gt;vp: it’s probably easier just to show you. as we made our way down through the building in silence i wondered what could have gone wrong. too many things! eventually we made our way to the delivery dock. i wondered what problem’s with it would have happened in such an it unrelated place. the delivery dock was located underneath one of the buildings, a ramp down from the street led to an underground open area, with a few storage garages located on the side. &gt;vp: airz, do you remember before you left, i told the marketing department they could have an upgrade? i remembered not having the budget for such an upgrade. &gt;me: yes the vp walked over to one of the garages to the side of the delivery dock. he pulled out a key, unlocked the roller door and opened up to a darkened car space. &gt;airz: wha…? i saw about ten boxes lying on the ground, on top of a huge puddle. &gt;vp: see, it turns out. this week had some particularly hard rain, and unfortunately this particular garage managed to collect some of it. looking down at the puddle on the ground, i couldn’t see the floor, it was a fairly deep puddle. &gt;me: a mini flood in a storage garage, more of a building maintenance problem then an it one. vp’s eyes caught mine, his hand twitched. he looked at though he was about to close the garage and leave it. eventually however and with a slightly defeated face, he explained. &gt;vp: remember those pc’s i got for marketing? well they got delivered **late** tuesday, so they needed a place to go. oh darn it. &gt;vp: anyway, one of the boxes managed to block the drain, and we didn’t realize until after it had filled with water. &gt;me: you managed to leave new computers in a pool of water?! &gt;vp: wha?… oh no! wednesday morning i went and got it, however everyone agreed since they were wet they could be dangerous if plugged in. i looked down at the boxes sitting in the middle of the puddle. &gt;me: so… you realized wednesday, and its now monday. you left them here the whole time. how much bigger is the puddle? a look of horror mixed with realization crossed his face. &gt;vp: oh. yeah. a. little? bigger. mostly just deeper. f*** sake. &gt;me: this is mismanagement on a scale i haven’t seen before. you’ve left new computers in a pool of water, for almost a week. &gt;vp: speaking of… it’s been a week, and marketing wants to know how long till the new computers come. i looked down at the puddle of decaying boxes. f%*$ this. &gt;me: i gotta go talk to the big p. &gt;vp: so you’re just going to leave them here? in a puddle? &gt;me: does seem a lot like mismanagement doesn't it? i walked back to the elevators, to make my journey back up to the bigp’s office. **ping** the elevator door opened. &gt;vp: wait up. i’m gonna come too. [next](so preface. this was not an angry cry or frustration cry. i literally cried my eyes out after leaving this job. customer was in his 70's and i'm in my young 20's so i get a ticket for a customer who's internet stopped working on a friday with a note attached saying his wife passed away this morning and he wanted someone to come onsite monday to setup a new router/modem and printer. i was not looking forward to this as it was going to be awkward but a jobs a job. so i get there and it was kind of awkward, got everything setup and working and he asked if i'd like to go get dinner somewhere. (couldn't say no) well we went to dinner and ended up staying and talking for an hour or so about life and he told me about his wife and football and everything under the sun. when i left he gave me the greatest thank you i've ever gotten and started crying. he said it was great to talk to someone and he felt a little bit better. on the drive home i started crying and told everyone in my family how much i love them.long-time lurker, first-time poster, blah blah blah... i hope this is appropriate for this sub, since it's not technically tech support. when i was in college, i had a part-time job in the tutoring office. the way they handle assigning tutors is that you can tutor for any class you got an a or b in, and having good grades at the time + wanting to make more money = i signed up to tutor about 20 different classes. i ended up being assigned to tutor an intro-level foreign language class about 90% of the time, but every once in a while, someone would book me for something else. at my school, there was a computer science gen-ed that was mandatory for everyone to take or test out of that was essentially "how to use microsoft office for people who can't computer good and want to do other stuff good too". every time i checked my schedule and saw someone had booked me for that class i would groan, because it meant an hour a week for the rest of the semester sitting next to someone at a computer and saying "no, open word. the w, click the w. no, double click. click it two times fast. there you go." so on one particular day in the beginning of my senior year, i go to check my schedule and see that not only have i been assigned to tutor this microsoft office class, but the student has booked me for a two-hour block, twice a week. now, tutoring is not a free service. freshmen get one free hour per class, per week, but this guy is doing 4 hours a week. even if he's a freshman and getting one hour free, that's still a good chunk of cash to shell out for tutoring. before i even meet this guy, i'm dreading him. i can't imagine the type of person who needs 4 hours of one-on-one instruction per week, on top of 3 hours of class time, to learn how to use word, excel, and powerpoint. when i do finally meet him, for our first session, my biggest fear was confirmed: he was a "nontraditional student", aka someone not fresh out of high school, aka an old. fantastic, i thought. this is going to be four hours a week of teaching my grandpa how to computer... i introduce myself to him, and another fear i didn't even know i had was confirmed: he had a very thick accent and was struggling with english. that's ok, i told myself, i've worked with esl students before, i can manage... we sat down at a computer in the tutoring center and i was happy to at least notice he seemed excited to learn. he was very friendly and motivated. ok! i thought. this may not be so bad. i instructed him to log on. he didn't know what that meant. i told him to click the "username" box and enter his student id. he didn't know what "click" meant. he didn't know how to use a mouse. he poked at the keyboard experimentally with one finger like it might bite if he wasn't careful. oh no. no no no. this was worse than i thought. very gently, trying not to offend him, since apparently i was going to be seeing a lot of him over the next few months, i asked him if he maybe owned a laptop or tablet he would be more comfortable using, trying to ascertain if he had any computer experience at all. he smiled apologetically and said sorry but no. i groaned internally. but, then he continued. he informed me that he didn't own a computer because in his village at home, they didn't have electricity. he had just arrived in the us a few weeks ago on a refugee visa from war-torn south sudan, where he had spent most of his life migrating from village to village escaping genocidal militia groups, and most recently had lived in a poverty-stricken refugee camp. he hadn't had electricity because he barely had food and shelter, let alone a computer. so he finally manages to get out of sudan, to the us on asylum, enroll in college, and the first class they stick this guy in? intro to microsoft office. and did i mention: international students have to maintain a c average to stay enrolled, so failure was not an option. so, this guy needed to learn how to use a computer from scratch in 6 weeks to pass his midterm, then pass the final too. challenge accepted. i'm proud to say he got a b in the class, kept up his gpa, and went on to major in biology with pre-med aspirations. he learned how to use a computer, and i learned a valuable afterschool special lesson about judging books by their covers. tl;dr - one time i got annoyed with a genocide survivor for being bad at computers edit: holy shit snacks, this blew up and **someone gave me gold!!!!** thank you, you glorious bastard, whoever you are. background: i worked for a company that handled level one helpdesk for multiple companies. i was the manager for a team that handled a larger international company with 1500+ users who varied from unbearably nice to people you'd burn in hell for just so you could have the satisfaction of watching them burn, too. since i've recently changed jobs, i wanted to share a few tales from here. i know there are a few people there who may recognize these, so if you do, keep it to yourself. a while back i was managering and doing manager stuff (reddit probably) when i get it brought to my attention that one of the people on the phone is having trouble with a user so i went over to see what was going on: &gt;jb: hey, what's going on. &gt;tech: (put's user on mute -- this is important) this user is having trouble with (big name pdf program) and trying to upload it. it keeps spitting out an error. &gt;jb: okay? &gt;tech: i keep trying to fix it, but she won't let me have the mouse for long and she keeps telling me no... now's she's talking about me. at this point the tech is a little flustered and upset. she was a nice woman and very sweet, so getting berated by an angry harpy was a little out of her comfort zone. i really hated it when users bad mouthed my techs or gave them grief when they didn't deserve it, but i took a deep breath and told her we'd figure it out. she let the user know i was there and that we were resolving the issue. within twenty seconds she tells me that the user is going off again. i asked her to give me the headset and put it on-- &gt;user: --f_cking it. they are so worthless. she has no idea what she's f_cking doing. stupid moron, i could f_cking do it's job! now this is big, because i'm of the opinion that if you believe this you shouldn't be on the phone with it. ever. so my blood pressure immediately went through the roof and my body started acting before my mind could stop it-- &gt;jb: hey **user**, this is **jb**, i'm the manager. i could hear you talking and just wanted to see what i could help you with. the twenty seconds of silence was pure gold. she then begins to tell me what is going on, what's wrong, and how it needs to be fixed. &gt;jb: i understand. you see, that's *exactly* what **tech** was trying to fix, and this is how it needs to be fixed, but she said that you were uncomfortable with it. &gt; user: well, it worked before. &gt; jb: i believe you, but updates, uptimes, funky bits of code stuck in some cache, ram, *something*, somewhere, can cause things to not always work properly. so, would you like *us* to fix it. &gt; user: sure. we went ahead and fixed it. and -- **surprise** -- it worked. the user hung up and called back a few minutes later about a similar issue with a different document and started giving *another* tech a hard time. her reasoning, while not totally unsound, was that while it worked the previous time, that it wasn't permanent and that the fix needed was more than what we did. so i got back on the phone. &gt;jb: this is **jb**. what's going on now. &gt;user: this is happening again. obviously you didn't fix it and i need it fixed. again, she wasn't entirely wrong -- i should have applied the fix to the pdf printer in the devices and printer options rather than on the individual document, but i had (mistakenly) tried to give her the benefit of the doubt and figured it was just the original document. &gt;jb: obviously, we did fix it. this is because we thought it was an isolated incident. i can apply this globally and you'll be fine. &gt;user: so it will *never* happen again. &gt;jb: look, i understand you're frustrated, be we are *trying* to get this taken care of for you. i can't promise that this will *never* happen again because computer systems and software just doesn't work that way. now, i can apply the fix, and you can get back to work, or we can keep arguing. she let us do the fix and she never called in about that issue again. what was funny was that for a few weeks after that, anytime a tech would put her on mute so they could work on something or ask a question she stop them: &gt;user: please don't put jb on the phone. we didn't have any more problems from her after that. edit: for formatting. edit: gilded? wow! thanks! i worked tech support at my university library as an undergrad. everyone was old and/or didn't know how to use a computer. one time i was on a call, trying to help a user install adobe reader or something (we had just upgraded everyone from xp to win7). &gt; **me**: alright, this should be easy. please open your web browser and- &gt; **superuser**: wait, open what? &gt; **me**: your web browser. &gt; **su**: what's that? *honestly, questions like this didn't surprise me anymore* &gt; **me**: it's what you use to visit websites? &gt; **su**: i don't think i have that. &gt; **me**: uhh, ok, do you see the internet explorer icon on your desktop? &gt; **su**: no. *this was a very recently replaced computer; they all had ie on the taskbar* &gt; **me**: do you see an icon that looks like a blue e with a ring around it? &gt; **su**: uhhhh, no. &gt; **me**: ...i'll be right there. i walked up a couple floors to their office, introduced myself, asked to see their computer. they had 4 or 5 instances of internet explorer already running. yep.it finally happened. they broke in and stole our stuff, everything. part of me is devastated that we lost the new hp towers, but at thr same time i'm happy that they will finally take me seriously when i say that we should back up (background:company started 4 years ago, didn't back up even once. good thing we're just a branch of a bigger company, so the server is located in that country) edit: okay so here is the full story. i work for a multinational company that supplies contruction equipment. this company has branches all over africa and their headquarters are in the country right next to mine. our branch opened in 2012 and we have around 160 employees. i am the sole it guy/technician because they are too cheap to hire another employee or send pcs out for proper repairs. now, i have told management countless times that even though we use an external server for the customer database, it's still important that wr have a backup of all the sales and what-not just in case something goes wrong. they refuse common sense. i give up, mainly because the boss' father owns 50% of the shares in the franchise. so yeah, it bit him in butt. to what actually happened; thugs broke in, stole everything electronic, and the computers were new too :/. naturally, head office blames me for everything because i'm supposed to be a magician. to all those asking, we didn't have an alarm because we were in a secure compound, but it seems like the security guards were in on it.[previous]( meetings with my own it staff. could be fun right? the vp had forced interviews to shake out some ideas from the it floor, i was waiting for the pain. it was coming. fast. i sat down in my office with the company consultant and called in our newest member of the it team, the ex-security guard, itsec. &gt;me: hey itsec, we’re here to talk about it. &gt;con: what ideas do you think could improve it? i looked down at my mug, it was full. i’ll need every drop. &gt;itsec: nothing! it down here is perfect. i took a sip of my coffee. it was so good, i might not need much at all. &gt;con: what about a timer for tickets so people know how long you take, any concerns? &gt;itsec: hundreds. for example, how does anyone tell how complicated a particular set of symptoms are? if a user cannot login for example, it could be one of a hundred things. i smiled, this was turning out better then i’d expected. i looked over at the company consultant, she was scowling. &gt;con: if they can’t login, how do they send you a ticket to start the timer? &gt;me: woah con! calm down, it’s a valid point. con seemed to snap out of her bad mood. she looked over at me and smiled. &gt;con: sorry dear, yes. very good itsec. you can go. &gt;itsec: don’t you want to hear more reasons? i’ve heaps more. &gt;me: yes! love to hear all ….. &gt;con: no! ……… i mean no, your first reason was very convincing. send in solitaire on your way out. i looked down at my coffee. it was still full. delicious coffee. i smiled. itsec was such a new fountain of useful it information, now it was time for the it veterans. reliable veterans. &gt;con: solitaire, hello. we’re here to chat about any it ideas. as i took a sip of my coffee i wondered why i ever thought this was going to be a problem. i started to drift off, i dreamt about a coffee beach. &gt;solitaire: actually yes. i think we need a better metrics system. &gt;con: oh? what do you mean? the coffee taste in my mouth was tasting bitter fast. &gt;solitaire: well, the vp was down here yesterday night. he was wondering who did the most tickets in it. &gt;con: who does do the most tickets? &gt;solitaire: me, naturally but at the moment no one can tell. airz might have those numbers but he doesn’t tell us. coffee was screaming at me to cut this idea down. but it wasn’t instant, so the message arrived too late. &gt;me: i don’t think who does the most tickets has anything to do with it…. &gt;con: airz darling! don’t be silly, we should be encouraging the employees to be proud of the amount of tickets they complete. &gt;me: some tickets take longer then others, and some people enjoy dealing with certain things more then others. i looked over at solitaire, reality slowly hitting home that all the forgotten password tickets that he enjoys taking might take a little less time, then say… anything… literally anything else. &gt;con: perhaps we could add a expected time to each job? &gt;me: sorry, who would add the expected time? &gt;con: you would, you’re the manager. i took another sip of coffee. it didn’t give me much strength. &gt;me: just… no. &gt;con: solitaire, can you go fetch colour-blind and send him in? and airz darling, you’re not looking well. do you need me to look after you? i downed the rest of my coffee. i didn’t expect such a flanking. the vp was pretty crafty, apparently i need to pay him more attention. much more attention. [next](~ cue wibbly wobbly flashback to when i used to work in the it department for a large construction vehicle manufacturer stationed right above the manufacturing plant ~ the warehouse manager comes rushing into the office with fear in his eyes and slams a printout from the part-tracking-system down on the desk. &gt; warehouse manager: we need to find this part on the system now! where is it?! &gt; me: ok... it appears to be in bay 4e according to this. &gt; warehouse manager: it's not there! the system has made a mistake! we have to find it! &gt; me: don't worry parts get moved around sometimes, what does it look like? &gt; warehouse manager: it's an enormous bucket for a front loader. &gt; me: ok have you had a search for it elsewhere? &gt; warehouse manager: we've been searching the warehouse for the past few hours and it's nowhere to be found. the system has to have screwed up, what can we do to find it? &gt; me: well we'll have to audit the warehouse... ~ several weeks pass ~ two full inventory audits reveal nothing and we're coming under fire from upper management for losing such a vital component in our system. we resign ourselves to the mystery of the world's first disappearing digger when... &gt; warehouse worker 1: hey &lt;warehouse worker 2&gt; when did they redo the front yard and make it look all pretty? &gt; warehouse worker 2: firstly i told you to stop calling me that and secondly i think it was when the suits from head office came to visit last year, why? &gt; warehouse worker 1: well... that flower bed next to reception... isn't that made from a huge front loader bucket? tl;dr: went looking for a front loader bucket, turns out it was right under our roses the whole time.i work in a monopolistic internet company. we are the only providers of the service in this country. it sucks and i work here.the pay is great only because the company provides shit packages for high prices. most customers pay 400$ a month for 10mbps a month. since the government owns 49% of the company and has no taxes they use the profits of this company to indirectly subsidise stuff without the need for tax. so yeah high prices. this usually generates with people complaining and paying late. lucky me gets to sit about and go through all the tickets and calls. and the customers we get are very aggressive, so i have built an immunity to this rudeness and kept my cool. until a few days ago... i was answering tickets when my manager directed me to a call. the lady was super nice and a restart to her router along with a change of a dynamic to static address solved her problems. my manager told me to answer the next call since i was already on the line. (i also have the pleasure of having to harass customers about late payments. even a payment 20 minutes late is a fine or the customer is blacklisted. we randomly generate numbers to make sure the customer answers. horrible but company policy and legal.) i was told it was a late payment. the call went like this: m (me) and c (customer) m: hello sir this is xxxx and im here calling regarding your late payments and overdue fees. it appears as though we will be forced to blacklist you and remove certain privileges associated with your account. c: why? my payment was late due to the banks opening late.... m: (i froze, that voice sounded really similar) c: can you make an exception? m: (it was my dad.) umm, ugh well- c: please... m: sure sir. i have decided to not blacklist you and give the exception. i will also remove you from the list of callers and promote you to the xxxx class so that you wont get anymore calls even if the payment was late. (its a privilege for that class) c: thanks xxxxx! m: no problem dad. end. a bit shaken, i let it go and went back to tickets. later that day my manager called me in. he said that from the 60 tickets and 8 calls i had answered, i been fantastic. however from a random inspection of recordings i would be fired. the unluckiest random search (they check 5 tickets). i had broken company policy. and was forced to leave. i also am blacklisted on the company service. forever. at least my dad is happy with his service. but now i need to get a new job... hey guys! inspired by the recent posts about grabbing another person when that other person is you, i thought i'd add my share to it. background: i work in development and tech support for a small telco in denmark. every quote is translated from danish. technicians do not deal with porting numbers (transferring a number from one telco to another) - there's usually a department dedicated to that. in this case my (female) colleague's phone rings. she's our one man porting department these days due to summer. notice: customer is also female. &gt; colleague: $telconname, $colleague speaking, how may i help you? &gt; customer: hello, can i talk to a man, please? &gt; colleague: sure, would you mind telling me what you're calling about so i can pass over the information? &gt; customer: just transfer me please. &gt; colleague: okay, hold on a sec at this point, she turns to me and asks if she can transfer the customer to me as she wants to talk to a male. as i'm not too busy with anything else i say yes. &gt; me: $telconame, /u/xxclementxx speaking. &gt; customer: hello, i have a number that's getting ported over to you guys and i'd like to hear status on that. okay, i can deal with that. usually i just have to tell them the porting date. however, i see a note on the customer talking about some error or a mistake with the system telcos here use for keeping track of porting so it's out of my range of knowledge. &gt; me: i'm sorry, that's not really what i do day to day and as i can see there's something out of the ordinary going on with the porting, i'm going to have to transfer you ba- &gt; customer: can you transfer me over to a man who knows something about that since you don't? why did she even transfer me to you if you don't know anyting about porting? &gt; me: well, ma'am, as a matter of fact our porting department consists of just women and $colleague is the only one in this week. (i almost made a passive aggressive comment about her not telling my colleague what this was about but decided against it.) &gt; customer (in a pissed tone): well, just transfer me back then! i transferred her back to my colleague who answered the question in less than 30 seconds. what a waste of everyone's time. sorry if the formatting isn't on point, i'm working with 3 hours of sleep :pmy firm uses a web based ticketing system for all of our support requests. we've been using this system for years, but just like the rest of you, we still have users who refuse to use it. some of them are vips in the company; bigwigs that can do whatever they want. so when they email one of us individually or use the group email instead of creating a ticket, we just let it slide. others like to think they're as important, but are nowhere near the level where they can disregard long standing company policy and skirt the ticketing system. this is the tale of one such user. aside from not using the ticketing system, my other pet peeve is users who give no description whatsoever of their problem. they just say "broken" or "again" or "fix it." today's email simply said "help" in the subject line and it was sent to two of the four of us on the support team. i make eye contact with my fellow techie who was also lucky enough to receive it and said, "i got this." before we get too far into this story, you should know that this particular user and i get along famously. she's one of our "special users" for sure, but she's a great person and we give each other crap all the time. her office is 3 floors up, and normally i take the elevator. i decided this time to take the stairs. and i ran. i ran as fast as i could. by the time i got to her office, i was out of breath and a little sweaty. she's sitting there filing her nails, looking bored. i reach deep back to my high school days and find my inner actor. me: "oh my god, are you ok?!" her: *blank stare* me: "your email only said "help" so i came as fast as i could! can you breathe alright? did you fall? what's going on??" mind you, i am not being quiet about this, so the commotion starts to attract some attention from her nosy coworkers. chairs swivel and necks crane. she starts getting self conscious as all of her coworkers are now not-so-subtly looking. her: "no, no. umm, my outlook icon disappeared. i found it in the start menu but i need it back on my desktop." me: "but you're ok? it's just about an icon on your desktop?" her: "uh... yeah?" her coworkers start to chuckle quietly. me: *deep breath and sit down at her computer* "oh, well why didn't you say that?" her: "i didn't really know how to describe it." me: "your icon is back on the desktop. if you'd like to avoid throwing us all into a panic next time, please use the ticketing system and maybe try using your big girl words to describe what's going on. i may show up with building security to make sure there isn't a hostage situation or something equally embarrassing. lunch today?" her: *icy daggers stabbing into my face from her eyes* "yeah, sounds good."hello, long time reader, first time poster. i was a tech support engineer for the best part of 8 years before moving into sales. a large chunk of this time was spent working in london as a mobile desktop and server engineer, attending onsite to fix things the 1st and 2nd line remote guys could not. this is one of my more interesting stories from the job. &amp;nbsp; it was just an average cold day in london in december when i got a ticket to go to one of our largest customers locations and pull some cctv footage. this customer was a holdings customer who owned several exclusive bars, cafes and restaurants around london. for some reason this ticket had to be done onsite and not remotely. i arrived onsite and was met by the manager and taken to the basement where the cctv system sat next to kegs of beer and pumping stations. the manager sat over my shoulder and watched as i pulled and played the footage. around 11pm you could clearly see a guy get ejected from the premises by a security guard, then a few minutes later the guy comes back and attacks the security guard with what may or may not have been a bottle. the security guard fights him off and he runs off up the street. &amp;nbsp; the manager seemed troubled by this and walked off in silance. my ticket said i needed to pull the footage and take it back to the companies head quarters and give it to one of the 3 directors. i started to pull the footage onto a usb drive when the manager came back with a plane clothes police officer, who identified himself as a detective of some kind and asked to see the footage. i explained that as i was in the process of pulling the footage i couldn't access play back but if he wanted to hang around for 30 minutes i could show him. he didn't seem to have time for this so he left me his card and asked me to call him when i had the footage. &amp;nbsp; all seemed normal right? i proceeded to return to the company hq with the footage and went to the top floor where the directors can be found. i met one of the directors who shook my hand with a smile and said i had “saved us a tremendous amount of trouble young man, we won’t forget what you have done for us today”. i mean normally this job is pretty thankless at the best of times as we all know so it was appreciated but it did seem……….odd, but hey. praise is great right? &amp;nbsp; shortly after i had left the building and was checking for my next ticket my phone my phone rang. josh, another guy on my team was on the line: &amp;nbsp; ***“hey fielder57. have you just completed ticket #12222? because i'm being sent onsite with instructions to clear the memory on the same cctv system? any ideas why”*** &amp;nbsp; what? why? why would they want us to purge cctv footage while there was an ongoing police investigation? shit this is not good. shit this is stuff that get’s people fired. fuck. josh agreed this was strange. i asked him to hold fire until i could make a phone call. &amp;nbsp; i pulled out the business card the detective had given me earlier and called him. telling him i had given the footage to the director and that we now had orders to purge the cctv system. i asked if he needed anything else. he said thank you, that i had been very helpful and saved him a ‘tremendous amount of trouble’ and hung up. why is everyone so grateful today? &amp;nbsp; that was the end of my involvement. i didn’t find out what happened for another week when i was back in the office. it turned out the bar had been hosting the companies own christmas party the night of the incident. the guy who attacked a bouncer was a senior member of staff at one of the top bars in london. he had got a little out of control thanks to the open bar, got rejected then attacked the bouncer. with london being what it was the company was scared that it would make the newspapers and tarnish the entire company brand. the request to pull the footage was totally legitimate, but the directors planned to bury the footage and have us purge it so prevent their being sufficient evidence for a case to be brought against the staff member and the company. we were about to start the process of destroying evidence, a pretty major crime! &amp;nbsp; josh had been waiting in the basement by the door so he had phone signal waiting on my call back when he heard a police siren outside and a loud commotion. the plain clothes officer had screamed back to the bar with his blue lights on, came into the bar and pushed the manager out of the way and rushed to the basement to stop josh from removing the footage. fortunately josh had not even logged into the system and had the good forward thinking to remove the system from the internet to prevent outside interaction. he then pulled a copy of the footage and gave it to the officer, who thanked him for his assistance and promised he would keep this part of the interaction vague so josh would not get in trouble. &amp;nbsp; the situation was crap. it put me in a tough situation being a 22 year old engineer and having to choose between doing the right thing and keeping things legal or keeping my job being able to pay the bills, fortunately nobody found out about my phone call to the police so the people involved just assumed he got onsite too late and the police got their before he could purge the system. we never found out what happened in the end but there was no blow back between the client and my company and we didn’t get in any trouble, nor did we hear or read anything about it in the papers. unfortunately the people who had organised the whole thing and tried to destroy evidence also got away with it. so in the end nothing happened. &amp;nbsp; tl:dr: manager assaults doorman, senior management tried to bury it. i was the poor engineer stuck in the middle between having to give the footage to the police and keeping my job. several years ago, i was working as a help desk tech for a large, well known bank in the eastern us. now, my desk was comprised of a dwindling number of people (~20 or so) for around 30k bank employees. needless to say, this made for a stressful environment. we had our fair share of idiots, but one woman absolutely wins for hands-down idiocy. on this particular day, high profile vp calls in because she's having issues looking at anything in her email. outlook was and always will be a regular bane of existence, so i went through the basics of verification and settled in for what i thought would be a fairly normal call. god, was i wrong. ***me:*** *so tell me, ma'am, when did this issue start for you?* ***vp:*** *listen, i don't have time to go into a story. i just need you to fix my email. i'm about to finish up a multi-million dollar contract and this has to be fixed. now.* ***me:*** *...alright, allow me to remote in to your system and see what i can see.* so i get into the computer and immediately notice a major red flag: her archive file is way over the size limit. the system is supposed to cap employee .pst files at 500mb. hers was at 1.2gb. sigh. of course it was. her inbox (a 250mb cap) was hovering around 800mb. the kicker, though, was her deleted items. 5gb and change. i just looked at that and whistled. ***me:*** *well, i can tell you exactly what your problem is. you are over your size limit on absolutely everything, and i don't even know how. so what you're going to need to do is create some additional .pst files, and move a substant-* ***vp:*** *young man, what part of 'i don't have time' did you not grasp? i'm not going to do that now. i can't move anything into my archive and i need my email fixed without jumping through your stupid hoops.* ***me:*** *alright, well, the only other thing that i can try to do is clear out space in your main inbox. is that alright?* ***vp:*** *i don't care what you do as long as you get it fixed. jesus christ, why do you people always have to ask questions? do you not know how to do your job?* ***me:*** *ma'am, i just have to verify-* ***vp:*** *fix. it.* fine. so i immediately selected 'deleted files' -&gt; right click -&gt; delete. a shriek of pure terror and anguish flooded out of my headset the likes of which i have never before experienced. i started to ask what the problem was, when she whimpered... ***vp:*** *you..you just deleted all of my most important emails...* ***me:*** *uh, no. i emptied your deleted items folder, which was massively over size.* ***vp:*** *that's where i kept my most important...there were years of vital emails in that folder. i couldn't move them to my stupid archive because my fucking email never works. you just deleted all of my most important emails!!* ***me:*** *you have got to be..why would you put anything important in your deleted items?* ***vp:*** *bring them back. all of them. and then transfer me to your manager. i cannot believe this. i..you...* ***me:*** *i don't have the ability to do that. all of your emails are stored locally. there is no server backup. we would have to send out a tech to run an un-delete tool. the soonest of which can be out later today...* at this point, i am in disbelief and she's just screaming obscenities at me, so i calmly tell her i'm putting her on hold to get my manager. he listens to what just happened, puts his head in his hands, and tells me to just kill him. at least i managed to keep my job (that day).university department has there data on a usb disk plugged into a desktop. shared to the employees... (yes... i know what you are thinking). i have been warning for years about this. they get a new director... the usb disk is starting to fail (disconnects and requires it to be unplugged here and there). i told her it is time to pay for a network share (our university charges for services which is why no one uses them). she agrees... i take the failing usb disk which was around 150 gig of junk. i put it on a temporary server. i create an official network share for them and give them both links. me: "please move your important data from the temp directory to the official one. leave what you don't care about.. this temp server is get wiped in about a month). usb disk gets wiped and destroyed. forward a year. they want something from the temp directory they have not even touched in a year. me: i am sorry that server is long gong as of about about a month ago (which means it has been up for 9-10 months). since i took there usb disk i must have their data and they are pissed at me even though i warned them about it several times. my fault. of course. edit: the usb disk was destroyed because it was failing and we destroy stuff that we no longer need. it is protocol. we have a big hard drive eater and we use it. great discussiona few years ago we got the kids a pc for christmas. i set it up and created accounts for each child with appropriate time restrictions and login times. now, like most kids, they are obsessed with minecraft. i played it a few times, found it beyond boring, and regretted that i spent $20 on it. but i digress. when the kids weren't playing minecraft, they were watching youtube videos of other people playing it. this, of course, led to the inevitable, "i wanna make my own minecraft videos!" so they download a screen recording program and get me to use my admin access to let it install. and every time they want to run it, i have to go upstairs and type in the admin password. fuck this noise. they're getting *just* as tired of it as i am. they whine and complain. "just give us admin access!" hell no. i saw what you did with admin access to the laptop you had been using before you got the pc. i had to reinstall it *4 times* because you managed to load it with viruses. get a different video recording software. they look around, but all of these applications require admin access because of the way they interface with directx. on the product's website, it even says, "you must have local administrator access in order to run the program, there is no way around this." i go searching. surely there must be a better way to do this that doesn't involve giving the children the technological equivalent of a loaded gun! the wisdom of the interwebs remains firm. the program requires local admin access in order to function. the documentation and the product faq both say so. and as we all know, programmers are never wrong. but i'm a unix admin. i find windows to be stupidly restrictive, and there's a paradigm at play here: there's no way to run an application with administrator privileges without typing in the local admin password. unix has this ability. it's called sudo. as in, [sodo make me a sandwich]( i check. there is, in fact, a sudo for windows. it uses a service that runs as the local administrator to spawn off child processes that run with elevated privileges based on rules in an xml file. i edit the file and add the program path and the kids' accounts to the authorized users list. &gt; **me:** login as yourself. &gt; **child #2:** why? &gt; **me:** you want this to work or not? &gt; **child #3:** yes! &gt; **child #2:** i *guess*. but how? the guy who made it said there's no way to make it work without admin! &gt; **me:** because we all know he's the absolute authority on all things computer. i roll my eyes so hard i give myself a headache &gt; **child #2:** it's not going to work. just give me admin! &gt; **me:** just log in, for christsakes! &gt; **child #2:** *huff* fine. he logs in, then *immediately* double-clicks on the icon for the program. predictably, it throws up an error stating that it needs local admin access. &gt; **child #2:** see? now give me admin access! i take the mouse from him, right-click on the icon, and select *run with sudo* there is a moment of dead silence in the room as the program starts up. &gt; **child #2:** *how?* &gt; **child #3:** he's smarter than you, dummy! &gt; **child #2:** shut up! child #2 then proceeds to right-click on firefox and selects *run with sudo*. predictably, it fails with an **access denied** error. &gt; **child #2:** so that's the only thing i can run? &gt; **me:** what, do i look stupid to you? i let you run anything else as admin, and this pc will have more viruses than a ... *really sick person*. i manage to stop myself from saying "$5 hooker" in front of an 11 year old. yay me! &gt; **child #2:** oh. ok. well, thanks. all was right with the world, until he managed to install some kind of spyware that set up a local proxy server to redirect all browser traffic through. when avg removed said spyware, the web browser stopped working. i'm still trying to figure out how he managed to install spyware. edit: formattingvar props = { firsttimeposter:false, longtimelurker:true, lastposturl:"[here]( }; hey guys so it's me again with friend who is a manager at a hosting company. this time, another tale of a guy who wanted out of the company. so this guy had a vps (virtual private server) which is just a tiny vm living on a massive host. also worth mentioning: the company offers clients the option to pay full price for the host if they have a dedicated server and take it away with all their data, and no support after that. so, the guy called in: *guy*: hey, i want to cancel my service. when can i come over and pay for the server and take it home please? *friend*: (finds his info) well sir, it seems that you have a vps, so the server does not really exist physically. if you'd like to cancel you will have to migrate the data off yourself and buy a server elsewhere, though that would be very expensive and likely not worth it. (mind you this guy is paying 12$ a month for 2gb ram and 10gb of ssd.) *guy*: look, i don't care if it is virtual or real or whatever you said, i want the server home so my son can play minecraft with his friends. *friend*: that is unfortunately not possible. (friend could have made him pay 2k+ for a physical host, install a hypervisor and give him the vm, but that would make him no profit, and this guy was difficult enough to deal with.) *guy*: give me the server or i will sue you. *friend*: (secretly hoping it would come to this) since you have threatened legal action, i have no choice but to terminate this call. you will be hearing from our lawyers on legal action moving forward. **click** **tldr:** is this the real life? is this a virtual machine?it finally happened. after nearly a year of working for my school's help desk, i found that user. the magical, mythical user that goes out of their way to do their own research on a problem, and try to fix it on their own before calling us. i got scheduled to go out to her office to troubleshoot a slow computer, and when i got there, she said that it had been running fine all day, but she had an issue with some monitors she got. most desktops on our campus are older dells that have a proprietary video card that needs a splitter to use two monitors, and it only works for dvi. she was given vga cables, and was really confused about how she was supposed to use the dvi splitters we gave her. here's the crazy part. instead of calling and just asking for new cables and us having to spend a crazy amount of time trying to figure out what she needed, she took time to look up video cable types and put in a ticket herself asking for dvi cables instead of vga! she said she pulled up a diagram she found on google, and figured it out using the cables we gave her. so i instantly ran and grabbed her the dvi cables she needed, and helped her set them up around the building the monitors were in, and she even set up two on her own! crawled under the desk and everything, and she didn't even need to. i would've gladly done it all, especially with how nice and helpful she was, and it wasn't even the thing i got sent out on. so now if she ever calls in, i'll gladly go out and help her with whatever she needs. best user ever. edit: i used the wrong form of their, rip in pepperonis.by request, my nice customer. by some perverse universal sense of humor, this took place about twenty minutes or so after the events of :[ "i'm ruining christmas"]( phone rings mid coffee. i regard it warily after my entertaining morning. my polite phone spiel is a little less chipper than normal. &gt;"hi, i have a toshiba laptop. do you work on those?" at least it's a normal question. i answer yes, pleased that $clone had mr. christmas ruiner beat at being a decent human being just on vocal tone, and she'd barely said ten words total to me yet. she asks how long a software fix might take to fix and i ask her to describe the problem. &gt;"well, it boots up okay, but when it gets to windows all you see is a black screen with a cursor. it'll boot up in safe mode all right, but not normally." the reference to safe mode should have tripped me off, but my brain was still calming down. &gt;"ew. that's a tricky one. how long has it been doing this? did it just start today?" i gauge the systems on my desk, trying to anticipate if i should tell her to bring it in, or if it's hopeless to try to repair this before friday. i've seen this error before, and it's usually hopeless once it gets to that state. at least a windows reinstall doesn't take long. &gt;"well, off and on for several months, probably almost a year. it would work fine once you rebooted, but the last few days we haven't been able to get it into windows at all." "months" was my trip. bad hdd, screwed up windows update, minor malware - any combination of those two can set windows into permanent tease mode, and for an error that's been in the system that long it usually has hardware at it's core. i got a few more details about her system and the specifics of the error. &gt;"i'll warn you, it's not good. i would definitely have to have you check it in so that i can run diagnostics on it - this error is commonly a problem with the hardware. i could probably get it done before friday, but no guarantees." i go to load up my "we're closed for the next two weeks" speech when: &gt;"well, i thought that too, so we got a new hard drive and i cloned it over. but it's still doing it - would that mean it's a virus?" i damned near dropped the phone. first i get accused of being somewhere lower than the grinch on the scale of 1 - santa, and now... *now i have a unicorn.* &gt;"you...cloned your own hard drive?" i immediately felt bad, because she got slightly defensive and asked if that was wrong. &gt;"no, no, you don't understand. i was about to ask if you even knew what a hard drive *was*. i was trying to figure out how to explain that 'the thing with all your pictures on it might be damaged'." &gt;"oh! yes, i know what a hard drive is. my husband really was the one that cloned it, i'm not super tech-saavy, but since the error stuck around we weren't sure where to go from here." i explained about drive corruption and bad sectors, and how damage to system files would persist across a cloning due to the nature of both a) bad sectors and b) the imperfect cloning process. &gt;"so can you fix it?" &gt;"i'll be honest, with what you've already told me you've tried, i'd suggest a straight-up reinstall. i can sometimes fix this error, but the system usually doesn't work great afterwards and it's only got about a 50/50 chance of working at all. it's easiest to cut to the chase and just start over." &gt;"oh, sad. i thought it would be that, i was just hoping since some of my programs are annoying to reinstall. i can do a windows reload, i just i just wanted there to be an easier answer." she laughed. i boggled. &gt;"yeah, if you can reinstall your own windows that's going to be the fastest. just don't forget to back up all your data." she laughed again. &gt;"yeah, you only make that mistake once, right?" *once. she said she made that mistake once. i remember this feeling - i'm falling in love.* she asked a few questions about if i had any tips about reinstalling windows, i warned her to make a list of software she had on there first and double-check for finicky drivers. she lamented how bad she was at this again and promised that when she got stuck, she'd call me for help. i almost asked her to send me a resume but i couldn't break a magical creature like that. better for her to stay where she was, protected. safe. untarnished. besides, the pay here is shit. she asked if she owed me anything for the advice. i said no, that while i could have made time for her reinstall, i really was busy and it works out better for me this way. she asked if i was sure. i told her that never, in over a decade and a half that i've been doing this, some professionally, some as the "friend who knows computers", have i ever had someone call me who even *knew* that a hard drive could be cloned (save one dba who doesn't do his own hardware work - but he's special), and it was my *absolute pleasure* to assist a competent user. i still don't think she believed me, but she was grateful for the information and swears she'll call back when she breaks something. a part of me hopes i'll never hear from her again; a part of me sincerely hopes i will. this is years ago when i was a poor ex-student who just got started in it and i forgot the details, but a recent fire drill at my current employer reminded me of it. . the shortest time i ever worked for one employer was one week. i started work on a monday as 'the it guy', meaning that as long as it had *anything* to do with computers, it landed on my desk. technically i was part of the 'it department' but since that consisted of me, the guy i was temporarily replacing (who was hospitalized), and the hr lady who doubled as 'head of it' but did not even know what an ip address was, in practice i was just the only occupant of the it office / service desk who got to jump when a clueless luddite called the servicedesk with an it problem (usually a lost password). thursday, the fire alarm goes off. there's no panic so i expect it was just a drill, even if we were not informed before. now i don't particularly like the idea of becoming a statistic so i decide it was better to be safe than sorry. i locked my pc before i went outside, having just grabbed my coat. cue some joking with the others in the company while we wait for the alarm to stop. my feeling it was a *false alarm* is proven correct when security guy comes outside and tells us we can return. hr lady comes by and proceeds to flip out that i left the desk, because "what if an urgent call cames in?" i point out that there was a fire alarm, but she claims i should've known better and that it is vital that it is manned at all times. i ask her how i was supposed to know it is a drill / false alarm, and she says that doesn't matter, i should've remained at my post. i ask her to point out where i missed in the employee handbook that it was supposed to ignore fire alarms, which of course is not listed there. perhaps a bit confrontational but i firmly believed i was right. the next day i arrive at work and am resolving various tickets for perhaps two hours when hr lady comes by with the security guy, and tells me to pack my stuff. i am fired, and since i'm still in my one month trial period there's nothing i can do about it since we both (me and the company) have the rights to back out for any reason. tldr: i heard a fire alarm and left my desk, and got fired over it.i worked tech support in a 2nd line role for 2 years before i left to pursue my dream as a web developer. i love tech support, and am always willing to help someone out, but i also really enjoy writing code. as it is a small team, my new position entails various roles, but the 97% of the time is working on the company's website. for the first time since starting, i was asked by another member of staff to provide support to a woman who insisted our website was down. call forwarded to me, i did a quick check. the website was not down. &gt; $me: hello tk338 speaking, how can i help you? &gt; $user: hi, yes, i want to place an order on your website but i am unable too &gt; $me: okay, just talk me through what you are doing, i will be happy to help! &gt; $user: well i go to google, type $companyname and its not there &gt; $me: not a problem. in the same place you typed www.google.com if you can just type $companyswebsite it should come up for you. &gt; $user: oh wow! thank you! thank you so much. good bye... *click* after a few frantic searches, i turn to my manager: &gt; $me: boss, we have a problem, we are no longer listed on google...so this happen literally this morning. i was sitting at my desk, happily minding other peoples businesses when i had an alert. the worst kind of alert. "server "name"" is offine, joyous occasion! i immediately called the company to just alert them that their network shares etc will be down whilst i figure out what went wrong when i was made aware that they had "switched the server off and on". my immediate question was how?! because i know full well there was no engineer on site today. the person nonchalantly replied "oh i turned it off at the wall" my shock must have been apparent and i stammered "why did you do that?" he replied "how else was i supposed to? there is no screen?" me "please don't do that again, please just ask us" i hung up the phone and i sit here waiting and praying that the server comes back online because i don't want to have to fit in an already full day with a site visit to repair god knows what may have gone wrong with the server after an improper shutdown **edit: the server has just come back online thankfully** until a few years back, if any employee called internal it at the big telco i work for saying they forget their password, our subcontracted internal-it script-monkeys would ask for your name (which doubles as your username within the network) and then immediately say your password was reset to 'the default': qwerty1234. they'd them ask you to change it yourself to something more secure, as per script, and hang up politely. [my last tale]( and some others explained that our internal it grew so big they started cutting corners, contracted down, and have some terrible policies. but to my team - tech support's senior staff - this one always seemed particularly unacceptable. anyone who knew this, and had their number, could theoretically pose as any employee of the same gender and get access to anyone's account and personal drive through a default password reset. this had been formally reported as utterly unacceptable security several times over a *8 years* period prior to the following conservation, yet nothing had ever been done about it. my colleague at tsss, called frank in many of my tales [such as this one]( had the biggest axe to grind with this particular security issue. we [have many more of those, unfortunately]( but he was personally outraged by this one, having had a personal experience where he was screwed by another company because they were doing the same damn thing. he really wanted it to change, and told me about how he'd get it done since proper channels didn't work. asked me about his scheme. i erred on the side of caution with my advice... &gt; bytewave: "i wouldn't do it this way. 19 out of 20 it works, sure, but calls are recorded, voices are recognizable. someone figures it out and you'll lose your job. we've been here for a damn long time and you like the job despite the crazy, right? can try through proper channels again. it's insane they never fixed it after it's been reported so many times, but i wouldn't stick my neck out to clean after systems' manglement." &gt; frank: "sure i do like this gig, but we've got access to the call monitoring software. can immediately delete the recording, do everything from a test lab." &gt; bytewave: "deleting calls from that software always worked so far, but if someone with a really good suit gets pissed, there are data recovery options. i know we've taken liberties, but your idea is social-engineering your way into upper management's email to prove your point. forget job union security, that's being instantly fired if caught - and there's no arbitrator in this country who will roll that back no matter the grievance. basically, all i'm saying is, it'll probably work but it's your ass - and i'm not sure you should be risking a job you like for them." union staff sometimes think we're invincible because we get away with a lot more than others without being fired, but it's important to keep in mind there are lines you cross at your own peril. frank wanted to, and i couldn't talk him down that day. personally, i was also concerned because we need him around, he's not someone i'd consider expendable - to put it lightly. but he went forward with his gamble. by trying to log into someone else's internal account from the lab a few times with random passwords, he got their account locked and then reached for the lab's phone... &gt; frank - dialing internal it from a test lab: "this is hermann thomas, exec assist to the call centers' veep. i've locked myself out of my account, i didn't see caps lock was on, and i really need to..." &gt; systems: "'herman thomas', login 'herman.thomas', executive assistant for..." &gt; frank: "hermann with two ns, but yes." &gt; sysyems: your internal password is reset to qwerty1234 temporarily, you must immediately change it to something else for security purposes. anything else we can help you with? &gt; frank: "no, that will be all. thank you." frank logged in the 'quality purposes' call monitoring tool and deleted the recording. then he logged into the vice-president's secretary's account using the default password and emailed several people at upper management with multiple scans of evidence this particular security risk had been underlined without results for years, a seven words apology and a smiley face. he didn't look at or touch anything else, even though he was briefly privy to tons of things upper management would likely never want a union employee to see. i at least thought pretending to be one of the executive assistants rather than a vp himself was a nice touch, good way to keep a lower profile while still getting access to their data - but he still risked his job a little recklessly. the next day the veep's secretary couldn't log in his workstation, obviously, and likely called systems who then reset his default password to the default password. that's when he'd have noticed upper management was in an uproar about a 'major security breach'. i don't know how it all played out from there, but very soon after we learned a frontline sales employee who called systems for a password reset was told 'that cannot happen at this time, you'll remain locked out for the rest of the day due to technical issues'. the poor girl freaked thinking she was getting fired for some reason, until her manager told her otherwise. she spent the whole day waiting, not taking a single call, unable to log into her account. upper management had handed down orders that no password resets were to happen until further notice. only three days later they came up with a more secure solution, in line with most of the industry. in the meantime, anyone who knew could have purposely locked themselves out of the network - and would have then been paid to do no work - but very few people ever learned what was actually going on. frank took a rather big risk - but who am i to argue with results? [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](*telephone rings...* me: it. nurse: this computer is broken- it won't work. me: can you explain what you mean by broken? is it on? nurse: it's on, i can't do anything. me: have you tried turning it off and then on again? nurse: *sigh* okay, i turned it off, it's back on and it's the same. me: wait- that was way too fast, you couldn't have turned it off. nurse: i did- you need to make this work. me: i'll be there in a minute. *i arrive and said nurse is still at the computer.* me: can you show me how you turned it off? *nurse reaches forward and powers off the monitor, waits 3 seconds, and powers the monitor back on.* *poorly managing to control my laughter, i hold the power button on the tower, count out loud to 15, and power the machine back on.* me: that's how you power cycle the computer, the power button you were using was for the monitor. nurse: whatever. *nurse logs in and starts working.* this typically happens a couple times a week, nurses and doctors alike. i guess i just expect too much. no one shows up for any it in-services that are given to teach basics.so i wrote a comment about an office move at my previous employer where i was told that air con was not as cost efficient as opening a window. there is a bigger story to it which is really worth sharing. so i joined the company after a long stint with a very well known organisation in the uk. at that job my opinion was largely respected, i was part of some major projects and regularly sat on advisory boards for it within the org. the only thing lacking was the onward progression and after 5 years i had reached a plateau. the interview was good. a strange location but close to home and reasonable pay managing a small team. some tough questions thrown in but nothing i did not know how to handle or hadn't come across in the past. i got offered the role and started after a brief notice period. many platitudes were thrown my way by my director at my leaving party and there was a genuine feeling of loss from everyone in the department in the build up to my last day. i started in the new role and quickly tried to get the lay of the land. i sat with the staff and asked what they do and how they do it. one particular member of staff was prone to working from home to cover sick leave, which i had been told to get a handle on. i changed the "working from home policy" and within two months my entire "team" had attempted to have me fired by "whistleblowing" that i refused to let the team have my password and i was hacking the computers. it ended with the instigator being let go so i was down one member of first line. in short the outgoing it manager was related to the boss and was being moved sideways. the team itself was a ragtag bunch making do with what they had been left with after an it outsourcer had ballsed up the systems years previously. two of the staff had no it experience and had been placed in the department to "keep them from causing trouble". under my management the department transformed. i put in place loads of efficiency changes to get the department doing things right, simple things like wds to deploy pc images and wsus for patches. i got the department new servers and got the systems to be almost automated to the point where the it department mostly did document management, first line support and development. we got to participate in an office move. a seemingly normal thing for most it departments but in our case it was a minefield, especially given that we were being given one month to do it in, including fibre runs for internet (3 month lead time from openreach in the uk). so we get the move done in 6 weeks. on the day the new office opened we had one call about a printer not working. i sent an email stating to our absent boss that it had gone well. i got an email back stating that it was disappointing that the printer issue hadn't been identified in advance. i was gobsmacked. i had been having discussions with a recruiter who was headhunting for a huge once in a lifetime role, and i'd been putting him off for a week because i wasn't confident about one particular area they kept going back to. i called and said i'd go for it. so the interview went well, i had a good chat with the potential new boss and waited. the next day i had a sit down with my firstliner: &gt;fl: hi [ap], i need to let you know i am moving out of the area. i'm going to be handing in my notice. i'm going to use the relocation as a early retirement. &gt;me: wow, that is really good for you! obviously i am really sad that you will be leaving but i hope you enjoy the new home and the retirement. &gt;fl: thanks. i wanted you to know before i sent the letter to hr. so the hr dept is notified and later that day my boss has a brief exchange with her: &gt;boss: i hear you're leaving us fl! &gt;fl: yes. i've bought a new house and am going to do it as an early retirement. &gt;boss: well good luck, we all wish you the best. fl leaves shortly after for the day and i stay behind to discuss the future it first line support. &gt;me: fl retiring is a bit of a shock. &gt;boss: yes but it's a good thing. she's a troublemaker and always has been. it will be good to see her go. &gt;me: [slightly taken aback] ok. so should i get on to the agencies in the morning and put out a vacancy? &gt;boss: let's not. i want to assess how the department copes without one more troublemaker. at this point my brain is screaming. i was already working weekends on supporting the remote sites and was trying to get things running properly - i was close but needed the extra person. i thought about how i could really change everything with a new hire that would be on board with me. i went home and lamented my situation. the offer from the interview hadn't materialised. i spent the next few days contemplating my future and dealing with a rapidly overheating server room. then i got a call. &gt;agent: they want a second interview with you. it'll be with the md and the department director. &gt;me: when are they thinking? &gt;agent: two days from today. &gt;me: it's short notice but i will be there. the interview goes really well. i get the job offer on the train after leaving the interview (i recall reaching home and crying in front of my wife in pure elation) and the letter comes through. i have a chat with my team and tell them i will be leaving. at this point the second line tech states he has taken an offer as well. i realise the enormity of the situation. i go back to my desk and fire off my email to hr. the pa to the boss pulls me aside. &gt;pa: what the bloody hell is going on? &gt;me: excuse me? &gt;pa: have you been planning this? &gt;me: don't be ridiculous. &gt;pa: ok then where is your offer from? &gt;me: [big company]. the salary is x. i would be mad not to take it. &gt;pa: what about tech? where is he going? &gt;me: i don't know. with that the department was left with only the developer/programmer. she quit the next day. we had a meeting as a team with the boss who essentially said he wanted us to keep it to ourselves and not share the knowledge with the other departments before he could announce what the plan was. basically it was outsourced. i sat with the company selected and handed everything over and they complimented me on a good setup saying they had never taken over the it with such ease. this didn't make an impact on my boss though. his pa was instructing hr to advise that i was taking unauthorised breaks and spending too long making phone calls on my mobile. i politely stated that the calls i made were for company support issues and that the breaks were legally protected in a manner which said "f*** off - you are trying to be silly now". i asked (read begged) to be let go early to which my boss wrote back "it's my decision, i'll decide when you go and if you ask again it will be the full 3 months" i rang the new boss and asked if a shitty reference was a show stopper, explaining that the situation was souring rapidly, and he confirmed a reference was not a condition of the offer. i went and made a coffee in the break room with my staff.... i said my goodbyes, wished them luck and got hugs from the female staff. i told them to follow procedure, immediately disable my account and packed my company assets into a envelope which i placed on the hr managers desk. i then got up, swiped out (leaving my pass on the hr desk afterward) and went for a final permanent lunch break.as i've posted earlier, i work tech support for a major american airline, but we also have a lot of international service as well. being based in the states, our default language is english, and most of our international callers have a pretty good command of english. others have dedicated language lines they can all for support as well. but some people fall just in between. enough of a command of english to get by day to day, but when talking over an often grainy connection and using precise, technical terms, there are often barriers. this came about during an attempt to start a remote session. they are calling from somewhere east of the iron curtain, and communicating is not very easy. i'm spelling out the url for him to enter, and like a good airline employee, using the nato phonetic alphabet that pilots use in order to spell it out. after a few failed attempts to navigate to the url, i try to hold his hand and slowly walk him thru the process. i shall name the caller boris. me:"okay, that's r as in romeo, e as in echo, m as in mike, o as in oscar....." boris: why is name so long? romeoechomikeoscartangoecho.airline name.com could be much shorter?" of course, boris was writing out the full names of phonetic alphabet. i advise him of this me:"sir, i'm just using the nato phonetic alphabet that pilots use, don't actually type those words" boris:"nato? i don't want nato spy tools in my internet, get it out, i don't need any of your bull****. (boris is of course fluent at swearing in english. me:"sir, it's just an alphabet, not anything else." boris:"you insult my smarts and my country, i hang up now, figure it out on my own" and he hung up, leaving me to explain to a supervisor the next week why i was "being offensive against his nationality". i explained the details and we had a laugh, and now i just tell people that it's the pilot alphabet. tl;dr, in soviet russia, url types you. i spent at least half an hour trouble shooting a customer's email address over the phone. it was so perplexing. there was no reason that it shouldn't be working. this guy was in his 20's, so i mistakenly gave him the benefit of the doubt and began looking into more complicated issues. everything checked out, so i finally got him to spell letter for letter what he was entering as his username only to find out that he was spelling "at" instead of using @. how does one function in today's society having never used an email address?being one of the more tech savvy people along my friends, one guy came to me to show off his new computer. &gt;him: i got a new gaming computer over the break. intel i3! &gt;me: oh cool, what gpu? &gt;him: gpu?????? it took him a moment but he remembered. with a smile on his face, he told me it has an "intel hd" gpu. my heart broke as i broke the news to him. the classic. last year a coworker/friend died in a horrific car accident. his wife and 2 children were in the car with him when it happened. we (everyone here at the office) promised to support the wife and children in any way we could, and i promised free tech support any time she needed it. she brought her macbook in for work shortly after the accident for support, i cleaned it up and sent her off with a spare external drive so she could do time machine backups of the macbook. ____________________________ *1 year later* two wednesdays ago i received an email from the wife, let's call her sadwife. she explained to me that the family imac had stopped working and asked if i could take a look. i thought back to the macbook and figured she was just mistakenly calling it an imac, so i told her to bring it on in. she brought it in. it was not the macbook. it was an imac, and it was ancient (late 2006 model). she then explained that it **had the entire collection of family pictures, all of her husbands photography projects, their legal documents, their bills, their family video files, etc.** anything and everything that had to do with her now dead husband was on this machine. irreplaceable stuff, and no backups. i plugged the sad white teletubby in and turned it on, and right away got the [folder?]( logo. i pressed my ear to the machine and heard the drive. *chip chip chipchip chip chip chip chiiiiip* not wanting to freak sadwife out i told her to leave it with me for a day or two and i would do what i could, smiling until she left my office. as soon as the door shut the smile disappeared. i shut the machine off and pulled the drive, docked it to a macbook i had on my shelf, and to my relief, the drive appeared. then to my chagrin, the drive disappeared. freezer trick? failed. the drive spun up with no problem, and then just chip chip chipped away, not a damaging sound, but like the arm wasn't receiving instructions from the controller. upon examining the controller i found lots of oxidization. there were still signs of life since it actually tried to appear when i docked it to the macbook on my desk, so i was hopeful. i put on my reading glasses and carefully scraped the contacts clean, revealing shiny new copper underneath the thin film of rust. plugged in, powered on, it appears! then disappears. crud. hopeful that i could still save it i started digging through spare machines hoping to find a matching 160gb wd drive with the same controller. about 5 machines in i found one that looked identical! but it was an 80gb model. the contacts on this one were also oxidized, but not nearly as much, and the 80gb drive worked fine. hope! i took out the soldering iron and moved the ic chip, but noticed there were other components which differed between the two, so i moved those as well. plugged in, turned on, spun up... nothing! &gt;**damn it!** i turned it off and left early for the day as i had to take a day trip out of town the next day. while gone i decided that if needed, i would just send the thing of for data recovery, i even got approval for the cost from itdir. friday morning came and i arrived at the office. sadwife had emailed the day before asking if i had any luck. i bought some time by telling her i was out of the office and still had more work to do. walking into my office, which at this point looked like a transformer (the robot kind) had exploded in it, i looked at the drive in it's dock. i figured, why not? so i clicked the power button on the dock. the thing came to life and started giving healthy drive activity sounds. it appeared on the desktop of the macbook, and this time, it stayed there. &gt;**holy crap!** i have a drive duplicator, but i didn't dare power it off to disconnect it from the mac, so i copied all of her documents, videos, pictures, etc. into a folder on the macbook, then, since it was still alive i grabbed the nearest drive and did a block copy. i put the cloned drive in the imac, put it back together, and powered it up. perfect! i called sadwife to tell her the news: &gt;hi sadwife, this is azonic, you can come get your imac. i have a spare external drive for you to run time machine backups as well. &gt;sadwife: how did it go? was it too much trouble? &gt;me: ...no. no trouble at all. **tl;dr: the husband died, but i resurrected his data.** _______________________________ edit: about 50 spelling and grammar mistakes. yesterday was a 20 hour day. shut up. edit2: gold! god i love the people in this sub. edit 3: i love how mod made the front page quote ask a question that is answered by the title just below it. thanks /u/magicbigfoot, you just made my day.this is my first tfts post, so forgive any errors. i frequent a small coffee shop on my lunch hour, and have helped the owners out a few times with small computer stuff. mostly in exchange for "the cinnamon bun with the *extra* icing" when i go there. haha. anyway, i was there today and there was one guy who was watching videos on his iphone. which is fine, it's open internet and a public coffee house. except when the owner caught my attention when i was headed to the washroom. she made the "psst, come here" nod and i obliged. she whispered to me asking if there's some way to get this guy off the internet because his videos were crazy loud, there were a few kids there, and he was asked before to use headphones, or at least turn it down below the level of the speaker music. he did for a while, but i guess just decided **fuck the world**. so i said "sure, i'll handle it". i use the washroom and return to my seat, sipping on my coffee. i head to the router page (which was a default login, of course) and find a ip address and mac address with the name "roys-phone" attached to it. sure enough it was the only phone other than a few androids, so i restrict it for a minute and see what happens. like magic, his videos stops after 30-45s. *tap, tap, tap* nothing. he looks around, while i'm buried in my coffee, and he tries a few more taps. he checks the wifi password (theres a card on each table with it) and nothing. haha. he left shortly after. once his car pulled out i removed the mac restriction so if he comes back he's ok. she comp'd my coffee and thanked me. this is the closest i've been to a superhero.i work for a big company with a global presence, hundreds of locations. some have onsite it, some don't. the department i work for is called rits. remote it support. if it can be fixed without physical contact, we handle it. my co-worker gets a call - it goes like this. cw: rits - this is co-worker. how can i help you? caller: there's a man in here with a gun, he's tying up the security guard.... cw: is this a joke? what site are you calling from? caller: we are at site#74, this is not a joke. we are being robbed! we need the police! somebody else calls the police. thankfully, nobody was hurt, but there was some property damage. in the post-incident meeting the caller was interviewed asked why she didn't call the police in the first place. because there were, and still are, signs all over the site that say "need help? call rits!" i work for a small university as a computer tech and at the start of each semester 90% of what i do is reset passwords. resetting a password is a relatively painless process so long as the student cooperates. of course this wouldn't be much of a story had there not been one to do otherwise... the day started off well, though i hadn't the chance to eat breakfast that morning. so before the hordes of students arrived i managed to grab a yogurt from the break room and eat it at my desk. the student horde began shortly after and about 5 or 6 students in line was constant. at about mid day, my day stopped going so well. a student arived shouting and pushing her way through the line all the way to my desk. she continued shouting at me demanding to know why her login wasn't working. apparently she needed into her account asap and it was more importantant than the password problems of all other students in line. including the one i had been currently working with. rather than escalate the situation, i calmly asked her to test her login on my computer before resetting it. she looked infuriated that i would dare not take her word for it. though thankfully she calmed down a little and proceeded to type in her credentials. while typing she growled: "if this works, i'm going to flip a lid". she hits enter and it logs in. stunned, she went quiet staring at the screen in disbelief. in order to quickly escalate the situation, without saying a word i slide towards her the lid from my yogurt.screechy and i waited for over an hour, the wait was bad. i thought about if i’d get paid for this, if found guilty. probably not. i eventually mustered enough courage to get some more coffee. screechy followed me over to the tea room. &gt;screechy: so you think anyone else will talk to us? the entire of hr was treating us as if we had the plague. it was rather nice. &gt;me: haha, probably not. still, would you talk to the pair who potentially put a bar through a air - conditioner? &gt;screechy: i mean… could be a good story? i looked down at my coffee. it was free. worked paid for this. was it my last? i took a sip. the head of hr walked into the break room. as she looked at us her face changed to surprise. &gt;headhr: oh, you’re still here. &gt;me: yep… i didn’t know what to say. coffee wasn’t giving me any guidance either. &gt;headhr: arn’t you meant to be getting the server back up? you know… so work can happen. &gt;me: no no, the vp has banned us from the office. he told us to wait up here. &gt;headhr: oh you haven’t heard? &gt;me: heard?… &gt;headhr: well i can’t officially say anything, since i’m head of hr, but you can definitely go back to work now. &gt;me: no. wait. what? &gt;headhr: hurry downstairs and fix these computers, that's all can officially say. as i headed downstairs i wondered what had just happened, my coffee wasn’t giving anything away. upon reaching the it floor i notice techs madly working to get the servers up again. colourblind sees me walk in and rushes over. &gt;colourblind: airz! thank goodness, we’ve restored almost all the services but salesmanager keeps ringing up and saying how slow everything is, can you deal with it. &gt;me: no problem. i walked into my office and picked up the phone to call the sales manager. &gt;me: hey, its airz down in it…. it was at that point that the vp arrived at my office. i just pressed the hangup button. he looked at me rather sheepishly. &gt;vp: sorry…. i was confused. it had been a whirlwind morning. i may have also wanted to milk it. &gt;me: for? &gt;vp: for misreading a few things. &gt;me: you mean, accusing me of sabotage? type things? &gt;vp: we had a er… misunderstanding. for that i apologize. he looked defeated. it was glorious. my coffee was empty. but i was happy. &gt;vp: in compensation for your stressful morning, i think perhaps we should cancel the audit. the department is stressed enough. &gt;me: two auditors in two days. i really know how to get rid of them. &gt;vp: errr…. yes. also you’ll probably need a bigger budget to cover all the lost equipment. &gt;me: we did lose quite a bit. &gt;vp: yes, i think i’ll just get out of your way… over the next day we brought more of the equipment from the heated room online, most of it was working however the budget situation had gone from one extreme to the other, so most of the equipment needed “upgrading”. the office rumor mill was running in overtime about what had happened, however no one would speak to me about it until finally i caught youngsec alone. &gt;me: so youngsec, do you know what happened to the air -conditioner? &gt;youngsec: you didn’t hear? after you and screechy disappeared, the police arrived, and one of the office workers from the building opposite the fan confessed. &gt;me: did he say why he did it? &gt;youngsec: apparently when the silver fan is moving at speed the reflection from the sun was flashing and hitting him in the eyes as he worked. &gt;me: so he decided to destroy it? &gt;youngsec: no no, he didn’t think it would break the thing, just tried to get it to stop flashing. kinda of like when you turn off the fan in the car, the air conditioner still cools, just doesn’t push it out as much. &gt;me: air conditioners need fans… &gt;youngsec: are you sure?…. after i’d found out what had really happened i was quite pleased. i sat down at my computer and picked up my coffee. time to check some emails. &gt;new message &gt;****can we get some more keyboards on level two? we’re running really low again **** &gt;sales manager. i looked down at my coffee. i took a sip. tastes the same. the battle was over, the vp settled down for a few months after that. a few minor fights but nothing really kicked off again until the new security head finally arrived. thank you all for reading :) this is the end of the first vp war. [next]( i didn’t skip too much outside of the occasional story that violated rules 7 or ∅. a friend of mine has also been working in it, and just got hired to do soul crushing data entry. i'm a big security buff so i asked him if his company ever had a security audit done, and if not he should let his boss know i can do it. his boss gave me a call, and we couldn't settle on price. my friend let me know later that day that on the weekend, a different company is coming in for physical security. it coworkers of my friend (and myself) are invited to watch the process from security cameras, and being the security buff that i am, i decided to come in and watch. on saturday around noon, i showed up to find my friend in the security room with the 2 guards for the company watching the cameras. &gt;me: where is everyone? i thought this was going to be a big deal. you don't get to watch pros break in to companies every day. &gt;friend: ya, i brought beer though, we're not sure what time they're coming in. it's supposed to be a surprise i think. &gt;2 guards: *turns around, raises glass of beer, turns back to monitor* after chatting for about an hour, we notice a homeless man hanging around the back door, asking for change and getting in to peoples faces as they leave the building. we don't think much of it at the time. to spoil the surprise, he's stealing rfid information from employee's cards. we're distracted by a well dressed person at the side door that keeps juggling his phone, starbucks, mcdonalds bag, and keyring at one of our doors. he keeps bending down to put things on the ground, mixes the order of how he's holding things, then stands back up in front of the lock. this starts my friend and i talking about what he could be doing, why they chose that get up, why they're pretending to be on the phone, etc. at about 1:15, the homeless man and the well dressed man both leave and get out of view of the cameras. we keep talking and expect a long wait before something else happens, but at about 1:20 the well dressed man comes back to the door he was fiddling with before, and takes out a key. he slips it in to the lock and unlocks the door! security at this point is absolutely floored. to again spoil the surprise, he was doing an [impressioning]( attack. since it and security (and myself) were in on the test, we're not allowed to interfere. we keep our eyes on the monitor and watch that man casually walk to the server room and lift his mcdonalds bag in front of the scanner. the light turns green, and he walks past the authorized zones. the 2 guards are totally speechless, and my friend and i are absolutely amazed. he's one more set of doors away from a 200+ million dollar server room. he lifts his mcdonalds bag in front of the scanner for the last set, but the light turns red. undisturbed, he bends down and turns on the light on his smartphone and points it under the door. then he stands back up, and literally starts pissing in between the doors. &gt;guard a: he did not just do that! &gt;friend: did he just break in to our servers by potentially causing millions of dollars in water damage? the doors open due to the sensors on the other side picking up either the weight or the movement, he casually picks up his phone and walks into the server room. he picks up the phone, calls the boss, and lets him know the penetration test was successful. i guess this is why some auditors want to get paid before they do the test. next time though, i hope they go with the more expensive security auditors, they might not get their servers water damaged. ___________________________________________________________ tl;dr - multi-million dollar security doors that 'conveniently' let people walk out by automatically opening from inside movement can be opened by literally pissing through the crack between the doors. back when i first started doing it work, i was techsupport for xyz bank. easy job, nothing too crazy. the normall "did you try turning the machine on" was half my calls". anyways, one day a branch calls complaining that their fax machine wasn't working (two middle-aged women). after confirming all the cables were connected and the device was on, i tried a test fax. &gt;bank teller1: we're out of paper. can you fax us a few sheets? &gt;me: haha, that's pretty funny. &gt;bank teller1: no really we're out of paper. just send us some. &gt;teller2 in background: i still can't find anymore paper, ask him to fax some more over. &gt;me: ma'am, i'm sorry it doesn't work that way. the fax doesnt send paper, its just a copy. &gt;teller1: no, techsupport has done it before. just fax a blank page. &gt;teller2: wait, can't we just make more paper from the printer? &gt;teller1: i've tried that already too. it's not working either. by this time the bank managers comes in and wants to know whats going on. i hear the tellers explaining everything. &gt;bank manager: well, just have him fax some more. they've done it before. &gt;me:......................... &gt;teller2: i got some paper. i just made copies from the back blank side of an older fax. &gt;me: ......wow....umm...ok. add on: later i found out from some co-workers that the branch was known for not being too tech savvy and at some point my team started messing with them. i promise this story is 100% real. glad everyone liked it. i have dozens of stories like this and i'd be happy to post some more later. thanks again for all the upvotes!!i do tech support for my father's business. he has a single windows server which hosts his databases, file and print shares. there was a big electrical storm the previous night and he shut it down during the storm to make sure it was safe. the next day he turned it back on again. he called me at work to explain that he couldn't access his server after it was turned back on. so he held the power button down for 5 seconds until it powered off, turned it on again, waited and still couldn't access the server. he did this 5 times before calling me. i was audibly annoyed by this point, and explained that his server isn't like a dvd player. you can't just yank the power from it for the fun of it. i opened team viewer and could see their server in my list. i connected to it, and despite the abuse it has been through, it seemed to be working. he said he still couldn't access the file shares despite this, so i connected to his laptop. sure enough, he couldn't. i looked at his wireless adapter, and he was tethered to his mobile phone... wasn't even connected to the right wifi network. to make things worse, there's two other computers in the room and they were working just fine. he killed the power to the business server 5 times, because he was connected to the wrong network. argh!i had a guy come in saying that his laptop keyboard wasn't working because his wife had spilled something on it. he was a real backwoods type. trucker hat, unshaven, camouflage jacket, overalls, and a big plug of dip in his lip. i told him that his keyboard more than likely shorted out and needed a replacement. i pulled his keyboard and saw that there was still quite a bit of moisture underneath it to the point of where the keyboard actually dripped. i towelled it off with paper towels. i had a few concerns so i gave him a call. &gt;q: hi, mr. x, this is q with [computer company]. &gt;x: sure what can i do for you? &gt;q: after removing your keyboard i noticed that there was still quite a bit of moisture underneath it and i wanted to make you aware that there's a possibility it could affect your computer further. &gt;x: like more than the keyboard? &gt;q: yes, sir. &gt;x: dang. i didn't think there was that much in my spit cup. i realized on that day that there is not enough hand sanitizer in the world.here's a tale from awhile back. user walks up to my desk while i'm in the middle of correcting a major configuration error on imaging software that we use for mds while they perform surgery. i'm the only it left in the office at this point. **user:** fhqwghads, i need you to fix my emr. it's not displaying the correct name on a form i'm trying to create. **me (focused intently on my screen):** i'm a tad busy here. go ahead and submit a ticket and i'll get to it later on today. **user:** well it's really important to my workflow that i have the correct name and... (long winded explanation for why her minor form error requires immediate attention from me, with no regard whatsoever for the fact that i'm pointedly ignoring her). **me (still not looking away from my monitor):** uh huh, that's all well and good, but i really am crunched right now, and i really, really need to focus on this project here. just submit a ticket and we'll get it handled asap. user continues to spew b.s. about the issue they're having and basically become a fly in my ear. it goes on for literally around seven and a half minutes (a lifetime if you're trying to focus on something important), and doesn't seem to be winding down. at this point i'm just finishing the configuration, but i decide i've had enough. i've tried twice to politely but firmly let this user know i was occupied, along with the proper protocols for requesting my assistance. i should mention i have a blue tooth headset plugged into my ear. **me:** shhh! (pointing up to the bluetooth) yes, doctor? (pause) oh... oh my god, i'm so sorry. the patient died!? i... i tried to get your images as quickly as i could, i don't-... i was distracted (i make direct eye contact with the user, who at this point has gone white). (another pause, as i look back at my screen) i understand. i'm so, so, so sorry. **user:** (shocked silence) **me:** (shaking it off, and "hanging up" my headset, i look back at the user) well, it looks like my afternoon opened up. what did you you say you needed again? the user made an excuse and hurried away, and from that point always submitted support tickets through the proper channels. **edit** for those who are concerned, yes i did inform the user later that no one *actually* died. as i've written before, i'm currently studying nights on top of my day job. very recently, the classroom lost it's access to the internet. we use tablets, and despite the teacher resetting the modem and router, we were offline. &gt; teacher: "uhm, okay, we'll do without i guess... well, i didn't plan for this, no other material on hand. we'll discuss the material seen so far, and i'll take questions..." why they keep their material on googledocs instead of locally i'll never know, but i already had pulled out my phone and logged on the remote work tools the telco provides me, confirming that the node was down, possibly for up to three hours. so i set up a wifi hotspot. call it a professional deformation, i can't be in a room with no internet and not fix it... &gt; bytewave: "actually, we can be online in seconds. if everyone goes to settings, wifi and pick the first connection top of the list, "_thisworks", you'll have internet." big mistake. this is a polsci class, i forgot one second everyone around me are mere users when it comes to tech. &gt; studenta: "settings? is that in the yellow, green and red circle with a smaller blue circle in it?" &gt; studentb: "why are you lying, the teacher unplugged the router, it can't work." &gt; studentc: "i don't have settings, do you mean airplay and airdrop?" &gt; studentd: "guys, it's actually working. i have..." &gt; studentb: "why are you lying too, it's unplugged!!!" &gt; studente: "why is this broken, it's a brand new tablet! this was 500$!" &gt; studentf: "it says something about blue tooths." *sigh.* &gt; bytewave: "i'm sorry, my instructions were overly confusing. please stay on the uni's wifi. i'll just tether my phone to that computer to use as gateway and bridge the wireless and the ethernet adapters together. it'll be far less trouble this way..." the room looks at me in stupor, with only studentd and the teacher understanding what i was doing - *maybe*. minute or two later, we're back online. &gt; bytewave: "there. just open your browser." *looks at studenta* &gt; bytewave: "just to be on the safe side - i mean the yellow, green and red circle with a smaller blue circle in it." ... [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](so, some things are too good not to share. some things are too good not to share immediately. my colleague just spoke to a user who, as the main part of her job, scans passports and other documents to put on file in a database. simple enough right? wrong. she had called up because in the past she had been scanning in doucments at our mfd printers, opening the resulting pdf on her computer, and printing it with cutepdf to save it where she wanted it to go. however the version we have licensed is a bit out of date, and following an update to acrobat she is no longer able to do this. my colleague had to spend 5 minutes explaining that you don't need to convert a file to a pdf when it's already a pdf. she eventually got it, and said she panicked because she had 'already shredded the paper copies'. &gt; **colleague**: ...you shred the passports?! &gt; **user**: no, the photocopies. she had been photocopying documents, scanning the photocopies at the same machine once they came out, opening the scanned document (a .pdf) and then converting it to a .pdf in a different location. after my colleague finished his explanation i think he actually halved her working day. *edit* formatting[previous]( monday afternoon i had been set with the task of ensuring hr had changed their password to something secure. i was dreading the job. hr personnel seemed to be immune to the usual request. working in hr somehow made then think they were above the … law? i sipped my coffee like mad trying to think of a way to phrase my request. nothing came to mind. after ten minutes of furious sipping, my email was still blank. my head flopped down on my desk. it was useless. the hr manager had told me it would be hard, but this was impossible. a knock at the door made my head look up. it was redcheer. &gt;redcheer: you look… like you’re in trouble. need some help? &gt;me: i have to get hr to change their passwords to something actually secure, and not write them down. its impossible. the red haired lady looked thoughtful for a second, then her eyes lit up brightly. &gt;redcheer: i’ve an idea… wanna try good cop, bad cop? my mouth instinctively made a no shape, but before any sounds could get out, i looked at my blank email… &gt;me: i guess its worth a try. ***** walking upto hr, redcheer insisted she be good cop. arriving at hrsad’s desk, hrsad looked up at redhair with confusion. &gt;redcheer: hello. we’re from it. we where wondering if you’d change your password for login. &gt;hrsad: i already have. that was easy. hrsad smiled at redcheer, he seemed eager to continue the conversation with redcheer. &gt;me: would you mind logging off for a second? hrsad did so but didn’t reply. he was busy trying to think of what to say to redcheer. i looked at the keyboard and typed in penelope5. wrong password. i typed in penelope05. access granted. &gt;me: okay, hrsad we’re gonna need you to make it more secure then penelope05. hrsad looked angry. &gt;hrsad: no. i can remember that password. if i forget it, others can remember too. redcheer mouthed at me “bad cop”. &gt;me: listen you little punk. your computer has access to information bad people wouldn’t mind getting their hands on. &gt;redcheer: if you just change it to something not everyone knows, i’ll be happy. redcheer smiled at him, he looked at us confusedly. &gt;hrsad: but… &gt;me: bank info of every employee, birthdays and performance reviews. all accessible through that password. are you so insane you can’t see how it would be important to secure it? &gt;redcheer: changing it to something only you’ll remember is easy. i opened my mouth to start again but hrsad was too busy staring into redcheers eyes. &gt;hrsad: you’ll help me come up with a secure …? &gt;redcheer: sure. my mind screamed at me to say no, but i was too bored of hrsad. plus its redcheer… who cares if she knows a hr password? ***** as we moved to our second target redcheer gave me a rundown on my performance as bad cop. &gt;redcheer: maybe crank it up a little… maybe to eleven. &gt;me: err… &gt;redcheer: put some real fear into them. we rounded on our second target, who sat at a desk surrounded by purple. &gt;redcheer: hey, we’re from it. can we get you to change your password to something secure? &gt;purplehr: don’t worry. i already have. i smiled until i saw her screen. about four separate posit notes with her ‘new’ password. &gt;me: you’re gonna have to change it again, and not write it down. &gt;purplehr: but, everyone here knows each others password. &gt;me: wha… **why?** i was getting a little angry. i could feel my bad cop building up… &gt;purplehr: it’s easier. &gt;redcheer: maybe just change your password to something no one knows. easy. &gt;purplehr: no. redcheer mouthed "bad cop" again. &gt;me: listen… you. security is your responsibility. if my identity gets stolen and i’m sitting in a police station trying to prove to them i didn’t take out a hundred credit cards will you come and save me? **no**!!! and why i know that? i paused and glared down at her. she looked up at me wide eyed. &gt;me: because you are so lazy you couldn’t even remember 10 characters without telling everyone in the f&amp;$%ing office. so when i’m sitting at that police station and some criminal is off using the credentials stolen from your computer to rack up debts in my name, do you know who i’ll be telling the police to arrest? a second pause to catch my breath. redcheer was smiling, purplehr looked a mix of fear, concern, pain and broken defiance. &gt;me: f@%$ing you. for **giving** the criminal my identity. &gt;redcheer: changing your password is very easy… purplehr just started nodding. she seemed oddly compliant. i smiled as redcheer helped purplehr set her password. ***** walking away redcheer gave me a thumbs up. &gt;redcheer: that was great! can i be bad cop next time? &gt;me: sure… internally however i wasn’t sure. bad cop was out of his cage. [next](warning: the word cpu will be used. there's a doctor who must have the best of the best. i feel like sometimes he scours the net, reads what folks just bought, and goes "dammit, i want that shit too!" my hospital at the time barely had windows 7 images. it wasn't a priority, and you had to justify needing 7. plus, key software that the doctors used were only capable w/xp in our environment, as the hospital was holding off from buying packages that supported 7. this great doctor, who understood everything, but didn't care, once asked me about upgrading his computer. i informed him...your os is xp, so you're capped realistically when it comes to ram. the system won't recognize it, and your programs aren't resource heavy for a win 7 machine w/more ram. he went over my head and demanded, from my super, that he has a machine that has 16gb of ram. no, 32! he wanted 32.....22222222.....22222!!!!! he was on the warpath of obtaining it too, even going as high up as the vp of is. my supervisor, ever so crabby about this, told us all to avoid the doctor for a week if possible, and said she'd handle this. she pulled a desktop off the shelf that was already imaged, and walked it over to him and installed it for him. a week later, the doctor sees me, and he's overjoyed. the new cpu, he said, it's fast! really fast!!!! since he was nearby it, he showed me the specs in the system properties. the ram installed was 3.4gb. he was reading this as 34. he thought my supervisor must have put in a robust 36gb of ram, and the video card was reducing the ram. nobody ever told him about what was really under that chassis, and he never asked my supervisor for anything computer related as long as i was in hardware support (i'm guessing he finally figured out exactly what happened, and his pride prevented him from being angered) to note, there was a hardware support position that was available where you gotta be a paid mule for the doctors and admin....and strong rumor is that the doctor demanded it be created because he wanted someone to build him a computer while he was at home so he could do his work on it. i bet he finally got that 32gb of ram so he could dictate on patients...disclaimer: i'm new to this job, so some information might be faulty. everything in this post really happened though. i work for one of the biggest healthcare software providers in our country. i work at the 2nd/3rd line service center. a few weeks ago we get an email from one of our bigger customers: "our online client dossier system isnt working. please fix." our team gets on it, as far as i understand it, clearing the cache on their server fixed the problem. temporarily. the following 3-4 days we get the same call every day. we try something new every day but end up clearing the cache again and again. until at some point, we get a call again: "we will send over a manager, put together a team and lets fix this shizzle once and for all." so my colleague who's the escalation manager and in charge of communication with the team and with the customer puts together a 7 headed team. mind you, these people cost €120 an hour for our customer. the manager arrives and they get to work. they spend the entire afternoon (10am - 4pm) trying to fix this issue. clearing the cache, changing settings. every time after about 40 minutes the system crashes again. at some point 2 more developers join the fun. in total these 9 people spent ~50 hours on this issue. at the end of the day they give up and try one last resort: "let's just... reset the server..." and guess what. the service is working like a charm and no issues ever since! when i heard my colleague's story i facepalmed and asked: "why did they not do this first and thén looked at other solutions." he replied: "in hindsight that may have been a smart move. yes." we had a good laugh. tl;dr: 9 people spent 50 hours to basically turn it off and back on again. edit for some faq: 1: no the customer did not get charged the (full) amount. they have a service level agreement that says they have a right to a certain amount of service in certain situations. 2: yes there is an underlying problem that needs to be solved and that they are looking at now. but at least the server seems to be stable now. 3: note that the system is hosted on our customer's servers. not our own. the fault most likely lies in their server, not in our service (though nothing conclusive has come from any of the tests yet). most of our customers make use of this service and none of them have experienced any issue like this in the past 5 - 10 years. 4: no, i do not work for epic. no i'm not going to tell you where i do work. ;)[previous]( sitting down, who knew how amazing a real chair is, only when you’ve been sitting on asphalt do you remember. poor chairs, never getting enough credit. the vp sat down behind his desk, he put his hands together. i wasn’t sure if he was going for the evil mastermind look, but he achieved it. the head of hr sat down next to me, after closing the door. &gt;vp: so airz, let us continue. what have you got to say about this pattern of incompetence. &gt;headhr: sorry, what pattern? &gt;vp: i’m fairly sure it hasn’t done any work for almost an entire day. got anything to say about it, airz? &gt;me: i’m still not feeling great, can’t i just use the bathroom? the vp shook his head, he wasn’t letting anything leave his sight. i looked longingly over at the bathroom. &gt;headhr: show me the evidence, while airz goes to the bathroom quickly. the vp opened up the ticket queue, and leaned back in his chair smiling. i got up from my chair staring at my oasis, the bathroom. &gt;vp: you can’t go to that bathroom till you’ve answered why the queue looks like this. i sat back down and looked at the main queue for it. i was expecting to see a mess of tickets. &gt;headhr: three tickets are in the queue? &gt;vp: wait, what? that can’t be right. the head of hr wasn’t wrong. three tickets lay in the queue. only three. &gt;vp: what the hell is going on! people have been complaining… &gt;headhr: people always complain. &gt;vp: oh i know, lets look at the average time of completions for the past day. it’ll be way above normal. the vp opened up the average time charts. errors… errors everywhere. &gt;vp: why isn’t this opening? whats happening? the phone started ringing. the vp was annoyed, put the phone on speaker and screamed hello. &gt;vp: hello! &gt;bigp: why the hell are you screaming? &gt;vp: oh, its you! hello boss. sorry about that. &gt;bigp: what the hell is wrong with you? the president bellowed into the phone, i was fairly sure even other floors could hear him screaming through it. even i looked up from dreaming about the bathroom. &gt;vp: wha? &gt;bigp: a fire drill shuts down the company for two whole hours! &gt;vp: about that… the vp didn’t look much like an evil genius anymore. &gt;bigp: how is it possible that someone could marshal a fire drill for so long anyway? it shouldn’t even take three minutes to get everyone outside. &gt;vp: well yes, but after they are outside…. the president cut the vp off mid sentence. he really wasn’t happy. &gt;bigp: so you agree it only takes three minutes to get outside? well imagine my surprise when someone told me part of the reason that the fire drill took so long was that the fire marshal himself took twenty f%&amp;$ing minutes to get outside. i looked over at the vp’s desk, i saw my coffee i’d left earlier. &gt;vp: but i didn’t know it was coming. &gt;bigp: oh, that fills me with confidence. so the company will be okay in a real fire, just so long as we warn you beforehand that its coming? &gt;vp: i er…. i picked up my coffee cup. i smiled. this was almost fun. &gt;bigp: not only that but i hear it didn’t even have an alarm. &gt;vp: i think they disabled it. &gt;bigp: who the f*%$ would disable a fire alarm? i don’t want health and safety crawling all over this place! how is it you can’t even get the simplest things.…. it was at this point i decided to take a sip of my three hour old coffee. it was cold, but i wanted something to soothe my stomach. mistake. **bleaaaggggg** headhr: arrrrrg! &gt;bigp: what the hell was that sound? &gt;vp: airz just threw up. go to the bathroom, airz. i was still feeling sick but i really wanted to listen to this phone call. &gt;me: i think i’m okay. like you said i can wait till we’ve been through the three ticket long queue. shouldn’t take long. &gt;bigp: why the hell is there a sick it manager in your office? &gt;vp: well…. we were having a discussion… &gt;bigp: oh shut it vp. airz, go to the bathroom, come back when you’re feeling better. i wasn’t happy i couldn’t witness the rest of the conversation. i sat in the bathroom for a minute or two. splashed some water on my face. i started feeling better. i made my way back into the vp’s office. &gt;vp: okay, sorry again boss. &gt;bigp: is that airz i hear coming back? &gt;me: hey president, sorry about that. i looked down at the cold coffee sitting on the vp’s desk. it was surrounded by sick. the smell was bad. i decided against taking another sip. &gt;me: i should probably start cleaning this all up…. &gt;bigp: don’t worry about that. i hear you’ve had a stressful morning. well lucky for you… you’ve won the free week off. &gt;me: i... what? &gt;bigp: one paid week off! you won! congratulations. i was confused. what was happening? &gt;me: oh, thanks? next week off? &gt;bigp: don’t mention it. oh no, not next week, it has to be the week after. however i do need a favour… &gt;me: sure, what do you need? i looked around at the other people in the office. head of hr was currently holding her nose because of the smell of sick. &gt;bigp: don’t worry, we’ll discuss it later. you better get back to those, what was it again… three tickets. go fix them now... i took that as a sign to leave. in my grasp a week off, and not having to clean up sickness. odd that not having to clean up sick counted as a win. still…. win. [next](started a job at help desk a few years ago. i was new, so i expected them to have me do something dumb at first to trick me. boss calls me in his office, he is a bit serious and very business man like. "can you please order us a left handed keyboard?" me: uhm. ha-ha, no. him: ? uh yeah. i need one for another user. me: yeah i'm not an idiot, i'm not gonna fall for that one. him: *looks confused* i never said you were an idiot... and fall for what? i just need you to order us one. please. me: hah yeah okay! a week goes by. my boss calls me in again, and is wondering where the key board is. i told him i'm not an idiot, there is no such thing as a left handed keyboard. he holds up his key board. the number pad was on the opposite side. it was a fucking left handed keyboard. i was embarrassed, ordered it, and ended up leaving short afterwards. edit: edited grammar. also edited out gender pronouns that reveal my gender because i guess it upsets people since it's unnecessary. way back when, i was a l1 for this soul crushing payday loan corp. but whatever, i took their money. i was helpdesk. its aint glamourous and it aint pretty, but its a good start i get a call, “islandlucky @ helpdesk ” “yah, i'm a customer” whut? we don't get customer calls. ever. theres a different number and department for that sort of thing. were the people that you call when the store's server goes down. when the internet isn't working. the few, the brave, the helpdesk. we don't talk to customers il“uhh.... ok” cust “yah, i need to talk to your manager, or ceo” il “may i ask...why?” cust“yah, i want to talk with them about setting up a new program. a program for silver or gold members that don't have to have their cheques vetted” il “okay, thats a great idea, but that is never going to happen.” cust “what! why? the customer is always right!” il “probably, your idea is gold. but, this isn't me. you called the tech support line. i fix monitors, i fix computers, i don't do operations, or idea's. its like asking a car mechanic to do you taxes (a favourite simile of mine) cust “well, then i want to speak with your manager!” il “thats never going to happen. if i put you through to my boss, i'm going to get yelled at. your not a store, or an employee, your not tech support. if i escalated this as a ticket, the lady who i assume was nice enough to give you this number, is going to get yelled at, probably fired. you're not supposed to have this number. this is for $evilcompanystaff tech problems. cust “oh....” il “if you really like your idea, and it seems like an alright idea. but, again i don't know good ideas from the bad. you go back to the store and you ask to speak with the district manager. thats a different kettle of fish, and they like ideas like yours” cust “ok, i'll try that” i never got in trouble for that call. that idea never came about. what i did do was call that same district manager and let them know a csr gave out the helpdesk number (i never said which csr, or even their store) and that maybe the dm should handle this internally. a couple of weeks ago, a friend of mine dual booted windows on his macbook. about a week later, he called me to say that it was running slowly and even though i've been using linux for the past two years i agreed to take a look at it. an inspection revealed quite a bit of adware, but nothing serious. not wanting to make any modifications without his permission, i had the following conversation with him: &gt;me: so, there's a bunch of adware on your computer, but i can clean it up. &gt;him: what? macs don't get adware, spyware, or viruses. &gt;me: it's true that macs are less susceptible to viruses than windows pcs, but the fact that you dual booted with windows means - &gt;him: *cuts me off* macs don't get viruses. what the hell man i thought you were good with computers. the conversation continued in this manner for quite a while. when i realised that it was like banging my head against a brick wall i left, and returned to the safe world of linux. edit: fixed an indentation.so i work at a public library as tech support. i'm currently setting up databases and stuff for them because they are mainly paper based, but i digress. this old guy called the front desk for tech support at around 9am, i had just got in, and said that his mouse wasn't working. so i went all the way up to the third floor and the guy was on the floor using the mouse on the carpet. he didn't understand that you just need to lift the mouse and place it at the centre of the mouse mat to have room to manoeuvre, so he just kept going off the desk until he was on the floor. i didn't laugh because he was clearly very new to computers, but it was pretty hilarious. i had to sit down with him for a few minutes to explain how it worked and to help him send an email. i found the whole thing pretty heart-warming, as cheesy as that sounds.context: i work for a manufacturer, booking in engineer visits. we recently released a product recall and a dedicated phone line to help those customers. unfortunately, that line is currently at maximum saturation, and we have overspill customers calling customer service. late in the afternoon, during a rather busy spell, i get this call: &gt; me: good afternoon, chargeable repairs, how can i help? &gt; customer: hello, i've pressed the wrong option on the phone because i can't get through to ongoing repairs. &gt; me: okay i'm sorry you can't get through, but we don't deal with ongoing calls in this department, we deal with paid for repairs, so i will have to try and transfer you. &gt; customer: that's ridiculous, how come the other line is so busy? &gt; me: because people who can't get through to the recall line are pressing the wrong option to get through to someone. &gt; customer: why are they doing that? they shouldn't be doing that! &gt; me: isn't that what you've just done? &gt; customer: ... *hangs up* i get many calls where they say they've pressed the wrong option, but never had someone who thinks its okay for them but not for anyone else. this tale isn't really about tech support in the computer sense. it's more about engineering support, and a very expensive mistake. i hope it fits in this subreddit - i'm sure someone will let me know if it doesn't! i work on a ship. we travel around the world doing things that a ship does in order to make money for the owner. normally, we can expect to be at sea for at least a month at a time before calling into a port, which is nice actually. being out at sea, miles from anywhere is quite an experience. i've lost track of the number of times i've crossed the equator, or circled the globe. anyhow, one of the bits of kit that we have on board which is very important for the operation of the vessel is the water maker. i'm sure you can imagine, fresh water is important at sea for such essential things as drinking, showering, laundry, cooking, and of course technical water to keep the engines topped off and other such requirements. our water maker is known as a reverse osmosis device. it works by using a high pressure pump to force sea water through a membrane with holes in it that are too small for the salt molecules to pass through. with enough pressure, you get fresh water coming out the other side. the problem is, these membranes are somewhat expensive. for our plant, which is quite small at about 1 tonne/hour, you wouldn't see much change from $75,000. the membranes are somewhat finicky and never identical either. one set will operate at a slightly different pressure to another set, and the pressure will vary throughout their lifetime too - so you need to vary the pressure in operation to get the right flow rate. they also have a very short shelf life, so cannot be stored on board waiting to be fitted. they must be ordered 'fresh' from the manufacturer. my boss, the chief engineer is a complete douche canoe (to borrow a term from reddit). how he got to his position is a complete mystery. endless stupid mistakes, unable to add up simple numbers, and a complete lack of knowledge for his chosen profession. it really is a testament to the rest of the crew that we were able to run the ship quite so effectively while he was "in charge". anyhow, one set of these membranes reached the end of their useful working life. a new set was ordered, arrived on board and was fitted. they worked for about a week before the fresh water rate dropped off to near zero. douche canoe contacts the office and informs them that the new set of membranes are defective. a bit of back and forth with the office and the manufacturer, who won't accept them back as they've been used, and the office eventually very relucantly agree to buy a new set. of course, this new set is now on a rush order, so not only has the price gone up, but they're also being flown on a charter plane to meet the ship at the next port. we're up to over $100k here. this has all happened whilst i'm off the ship on leave, and coincidentally, i join the ship at the next port. i'm caught up on the saga of the membranes and i ask the simple question: &gt;have you tried increasing the pressure? i bring your attention back to the operating condition of these membranes - it changes in service. you need to increase the pressure through the service life to keep the fresh water flowing. &gt;dc: no? why would i do that? the old ones worked perfectly well at this pressure. along with another crew member, i go and look at this plant. the pressure hasn't been increased from the previous membranes setting. it even states in the manual that the pressure settings will vary between sets of membranes. i'm sure you can see where this is going by now. i tweak the pressure knob about half a turn clockwise. the pressure rises from 45 to 50 bar and sweet fresh water starts to flow just as the new set of membranes arrives on board. so these brand new $100,000 membranes go on the shelf, never to be used. after a few months we confirm that they've gone bad and go in the skip.i worked in a small it company of 5 people which ironically there was 2 techs (one which is the **boss** who thinks he knows all but is a dangerous user at best) myself (**the sucker**) and for some reason i have never worked out 3 office girls which all did individual jobs as for some reason one person answering the phone, doing payroll, and making sure invoices are correct and sent out is two difficult for one monkey (sorry semi intelligent person) to perform. &amp;nbsp; i should also mention we are in a very small town of 14000 people max and live about an hour from a town of any decent size and shops with equipment when needed. &amp;nbsp; **lets start this fun story.** &amp;nbsp; it had been a quite week and i had been able to catch up on all my paperwork, couriers had been and had got the last few jobs out the door and was looking at the clock imagining all the things the weekend might hold when i was interrupted by the boss. &amp;nbsp; **boss** - i need you to pop over to our biggest customers location and run a few network cables and when you have finished you can start your weekend. &amp;nbsp; (early finish on a friday before a lovely sunny weekend, this is gonna be awesome. but then my logical side of my brain kicks in, ahh crap what's the catch or what have i not been told about) &amp;nbsp; **me** - sure thing i will just grab my tools and head over, do i need to take anything with me? cables etc.?? **boss** - no no they have everything, txt us when your done and see you monday. **me** - so with a hop in my step and a grin on my face out the door i go for a (i thought simple job before relaxing weekend) &amp;nbsp; should be about here you can all see a ahh crap moment coming. &amp;nbsp; (so i arrive at customers location all of 1k down the road, sign in and make my way to owner.) &amp;nbsp; **me** - i hear you have some network cables to run and you have everything? **owner** - yes... well are you going to do the other things as well or just run the cables? &amp;nbsp; (at this point the hop in my step had gone and a very bad sinking feeling was in the pit of my stomach) &amp;nbsp; **me** - what other things? (hoping for a very simple answer) **owner** - well you know how we asked you last year how we want to expand our business and build a new building? &amp;nbsp; (i now felt sick inside and could start seeing this as not a simple job) &amp;nbsp; **me** - well yes i heard it mentioned but nothing since. **owner** - oohh really we have been discussing this with your boss since then and we have built the new building and want the new server installed, 6 new work stations, phone system, network etc. all connected installed and working for monday when we have our grand opening and he said you can do this weekend. &amp;nbsp; (i'm sure at this point my heart had stopped and i was standing there with the deer in headlights look on my face) &amp;nbsp; **me** - can you say that again, i'm just a bit confused as to what you mean? how do you say you have been discussing this for a year, this is first i've heard about it. this is not a simple 50 hour job in one weekend to get done but a few weeks or months of planning, setting up pcs, configuring server etc. etc. &amp;nbsp; (at this stage i could see the owner confused and a bit worried) &amp;nbsp; **owner** - hang on so your telling me you have not been involved in any of this and have no clue. your boss has been emailing us with the last email at 9am this morning saying you're all set and will be done by sunday night so we can test before we reopen for business monday morning. here look at the emails. &amp;nbsp; (i'm sure at this point a part of me died inside, i know if you were to check my blood pressure it would kill the machine.) &amp;nbsp; **me** - i quickly read the 8 months of email and sure enough there are questions in there and replies of yes i asked (sucker me) and he says nothing needs be done before weekend and he has no issues doing in two days. &amp;nbsp; (for those of you who have done this you can imagine the amount of work to get this up and going. those who haven't imagine running cables, terminating -3 to 4 hours. setting up server 8 hours to install and configure. setting up work stations 2-3 hours each. thing you can see where this is going? &amp;nbsp; **me** - may i use your phone i just need to call boss and get him to come down. **owner** - you ok you don't look to happy? **me** - i'm not sure... (have known the owner for years and am on first name basis but could tell she was worried) **me** - boss the simple network job you told me about is nothing to what the emails you have been talking to them about. **boss** - they mentioned expanding building and they would arrange the hardware and we just go down and set it up, i don't see the issue should only take you a day to plug everything in. **me** - most polite language and tone i could manage, can you please get yourself down here now and discuss this with us. &amp;nbsp; (15 mins pass and boss walks in with coffee in hand and not a care in the world) &amp;nbsp; **me** - so i came here to install network cables as per your request at lunch and arrived here to find a completely different job is required and that you knew about this for a year and signed off on me doing it at 9am this morning. **boss** - ahh is that this weekend, yes well it shouldn't take you long to connect the computers and get everything up and going. (at this point i was trying to think if murder or manslaughter would be a lighter sentence than this hell hole he’s landed me in) **me** - you have know about this, been in discussion with them for 6 months and have told them what machines to order and what they need and have said you asked me and i agreed with the selection of equipment. **boss** - yes well everything i told them to get you have sold to home users and they are reliable and haven't had issues. &amp;nbsp; (who’s alarms are going off at this stage) &amp;nbsp; **me** - yes to home users, single pc who check email, surf the net not in a work environment. **boss** - does that matter? **me** - well i bet you got the stock standard machines? (please say he changed the os) **boss** - yes i just used the previous order and got 6 of the computers. **me** - well did you atleast change from windows xp home to professional for the operating system? **boss** - no i told the supplier that we didn't need os and we would just use a licence from one of the pc's already here. &amp;nbsp; (now i'm thinking murder is the best choice ever) &amp;nbsp; **me** - do you know how illegal that is and the issues it would cause for them on so many levels and for us when microsoft ever did spot inspection? **boss** - well i did it to there office 2003 home and student and installed on all the pcs and just rang microsoft to activate when the automated activation failed. **me** - so you installed a home version ( not designed for business in any form) on 14 plus computers using the same licence key?? **boss** - yes **me - to owner** - how much did he charge you ( she had worried look on face) **owner** - he charged us $1400 ( while looking at invoice) when he had only supplied one key for a version that couldn't be used legally in a business. **me - well owner**, there needs to be a huge change and unfortunately i do not think i can do this for you in the time frame i have been given with the equipment i have been given. **boss** - i don't see what the issue is? you do what i tell you and i want you to do it now... **me** - well if that is your stand i don't think i want to work for you any more especially with the illegal activity you are doing and putting my name on it without my knowledge but still gives me the same issue with microsoft for any legal lawsuits and i will not stand or be thrown under the buss for you. i quit. **boss** - standing in silence looks at owner, i will do your computers this weekend for you and get you working. &amp;nbsp; (owner who had been standing there watching all this unfold realising how screwed over they have been and all the good money they paid out for the illegal work to be carried out speaks up) &amp;nbsp; **owner - boss** you are to leave here, give us all your information, software and any confidential documents you have, your services to our company are now terminated and you will be hearing from our lawyers. **boss** - shocked look on face about to scream at me for causing a huge loss to him. &amp;nbsp; (i'm there listening to this all unfold packing up my gear) &amp;nbsp; **owner to me** - now that you don't work for dumbass boss, we still need all this done and all the other issues in our system done to get us legal, do you want a job?? &amp;nbsp; needless to say i spent the next few months getting the new gear installed, all there illegal software removed which ended up in reloading every pc they had as both windows and office was the same licence on each machine and getting them all running. &amp;nbsp; and that is how i started a true reliable computer support business that i am not ashamed to say i work for. i should also mention a fun fact. if you are to try activate the same licence key for the same product way too many times microsoft system flags it and you get a site audit done. in my time that i rebuilt the whole system from scratch i registered company with the volume licence program microsoft supplies. microsoft came and did their audit and explained what the situation was and why they had the flag and who to go see which i know for a fact they did and it ended in a huge lawsuit which my former company lost for obvious reasons. sometimes things happen for a reason and that friday was a very good day now i look back on it. **hope you all enjoyed.** &amp;nbsp; edit = for all those who notice the bad writting, grammer etc please read the following &amp;nbsp; i was 25 when i could read without sounding out the words and writing started about the same time without doing one letter at a time. i was born with some issues and had speech impediments and dyslexic so learning how to read and write was a mission and i didnt have anyone who was able to teach me. i am trying to get better but obviously whats in my head that makes sense dosnt on paper, so i will focus better on future posts and do better for you guys[previous]( heads of department meetings are always a drain. leeching the life out of middle management until they can't take any more. i sat down at my usual chair, i started waiting for the entire ordeal to be over. the vp's secretary walked in the meeting room, for the refreshment delivery. &gt;vpsec: anyone for tea? the end of this meeting would come sooner with coffee. &gt;me: please. coffee. &gt;vp: airz! i thought you knew we can't have coffee here, not with the head of security and his reactions. the ending couldn't come soon enough. i'd heard all nineteen words the vp had said and already i'd started to see the executive floor window as a potential exit point. &gt;me: i er... the vp’s secretary looked at me, pity in her eyes. at least i think it was pity. &gt;vpsec: tea perhaps? i do make a very dark tea. &gt;me: oh no, its okay. it’s not a tea day. &gt;vpsec: a very dark tea. very dark, almost… roasted. i thought about it, but tea wouldn’t make this meeting go faster. &gt;me: no, thanks though. the vp’s secretary looked very disappointed, but i didn’t dwell on it. the vp stood up to start the meeting. &gt;vp: welcome again to a heads of department meeting, i want to invite our company consultant to take the floor to tell us about our new ideas box for it. &gt;con: thanks vp, so far we’ve very …. interesting …. ideas coming through the ideas box. however i’d like managers to remind everyone that its for it ideas. i started to zone out, apparently my hybrid coffee was amazing. i looked out the office door, i saw the vp’s secretary. &gt;vp: so you’ve got nothing new from the box yet? &gt;con: actually yes! a timer for it, so people know how long it is tickets are taking. the vp’s secretary had made a coffee, she looked over at me and saw me salivating. &gt;vp: oh, a timer for it, excellent. hopefully that’ll be up later this afternoon. reality snapped back to me as i heard another unrealistic deadline. &gt;me: whaaaa? a timer, are you … &gt;con: oh airz, don’t worry dear we aren’t implementing it today. &gt;vp: we’re not? &gt;con: no no, we’ve got to chat to the it staff before hand, see the concerns first. i looked back out the door, the vp’s secretary was just drinking coffee outside the door. it was very distracting. coffee, so close. &gt;vp: so you’re going to interview all the it staff for ideas? &gt;con: couldn’t hurt right? the vp smiled. &gt;vp: idea’s from it staff? couldn’t hurt at all. i looked back at the vp’s secretary, she gave me a worried face and mouthed **it hurts**. taunting me with coffee gave the vp’s secretary a burnt tongue..… right? [next](i'm a longtime reader of tfts, however this is my first time posting. i might post more of some of my experiences later. this story happened a week ago. i work for a semi-big grocery chain which has an all new hip it/dev-department. we have quite a big office in one of the old warehouses, imagine it like a hip tech startup office, we got a slide, fitness equipment, gaming couche (mostly for smash), pullup bars in the elevator (for a future story). there are also a couple of big 4k monitors mounted on in the wall in a 2 (wide) x 3 (high) setup. this displays a map with all the retail locations on it. where you can see some basic info like: if the main and backup connections are working if there has been a error with one of the pin terminals or cash registers. if the local database is in sync with the main server. how many (wifi/bluetooth) devices are in the store (i have no idea how these “beacons” exactly work, we just use that info because it looks cool). the local setup in the stores is as followed, you have the cash registers which communicate with a local server, which synchronizes all the purchases with the main server. this is done because if a location lost connection to the main server all the cash registers couldn’t be used anymore, now the local server just keeps track of the transactions and syncs it when to location comes back online later. the software running on the cash registers is not made by use, and all the cash registers are not managed by us, this is done by the company who makes the cash register software. in this lovely scenario the cash register software needs its own cash register server, which all it does is acts as a translator between their own protocol and the database. $cashregistersoftwarecompany informs us that they are going to push a update to us on the 11th of march, annoyingly this new version has some dependencies on packages on the server that are not available for this version of the distro. the best point would be to re-setup all the servers however due to time constraints it’s decided that we are going to do a distro update. sadly when testing the distro update on one of the test machines (same image) we notice that it hangs on certain parts of the distro update. so i was tasked with writing a script which would fix all these issues it hangs on. i was making some good progress when i push the latest version of the script to our git system. it clearly has in the description of the branch that the script is not finished, not working, and should not be used yet, then i left for holiday. after enjoying my holiday for 2 days my phone starts blowing up. - warning: location a has closed the vpn connection and hasn't reconnected. - warning: location a is not responding on the main connection. - warning: location a is not responding on the backup connection. - warning: location a hasn’t checked in for a sync in 15min. i start getting these messages from about 260 locations, my phone is lagging like crazy, then i get a panic call telling me that all the local servers are offline, and in about 1 hour it’s going to be the busiest moment in all the stores for the week. my coworkers are panicking about the potential loss of profit, and i’m somewhere on top of a mountain wearing full ski gear. to make things worse the it department is running on a skeleton crew because most of us are away for the holiday. the first thing i ask if that it’s maybe a issue with our status system, or the connection in our office. they do not know and will call me back. in the meantime i’m skiing down the mountain like a maniac who wants to test if he can break the world record on skies. i jump in my car, and rush to the hotel as fast as possible. when i’m almost there i get scared by a bright flash, i got flashed by a speed camera(speed cameras in my home country don’t flash anymore). i’m pretty sure this is going to be a lovely picture. when i finally make it to my hotel i grab my macbook and run to the hotel lobby(only place to get wifi). i log in and try to ssh into any of the local servers, but all of them accept the connection, but they they can't get past the login, it’s just hanging on a black screen. i try to access the status page of the beacons where i get a page that returns “null”. in that moment it dawned on me. all the servers were stuck somewhere in cognito, someone ran the distro update. at this point i get called back by a somewhat less stressed coworker, this coworker told me that all the cash registers are still working fine, but all the servers are still not working. i tell him, i suspect that someone ran the distro update. my coworker added our contact at $cashregistersoftwarecompany to our phone call. our contact person told us that they had some time left, and decided to force push a update to all our devices running software from $cashregistersoftwarecompany. we tell them they broke all the local servers, and our contact at $cashregistersoftwarecompany started to worry so he added a tech from $cashregistersoftwarecompany that pushed the update to all our machines. this tech told us that it could in no way be the fault of $cashregistersoftwarecompany because they followed all the instructions, they even ran the latest version of my script to run the distro update. at this point i’m getting really pissed, i ask him if he even read what the title of the repo said. $cashregistersoftwarecompany tech said that he got the script from his boss. so $cashregistersoftwarecompany techs boss gets added to the conference call. all he says it that it’s not his fault and we should have made sure our script worked before they ran the update which was planned for the 11th of march, and he hangs up. at this point $cashregistersoftwarecompany is pointing the blame at us, and are saying they can’t do anything about it anymore, followed by them hanging up the phone. we were lucky that the all the stores were still working locally, it only major inconvenience for our customers was that the stores could not check the stock on other locations, and they could only swap or get a refund at the location they bought it at. at this point another coworker noticed that the server are still checking for new promo media (this is being displayed in store on the tv’s, or discounts that are being broadcasted on the audio system). this runs twice every day (before store opening and closing). lukly the way it’s setup is that all the new promo media that gets downloaded is being placed in a bash script that gets run. so we start working on trying to finish the update script. at this point a lot of other people start getting back at the hotel and the internet connections start randomly losing the connection (closing my vpn and vnc sessions). so i decide to continue to work using my hotspot on my work phone. the way mobile providers work in europe is that as soon as you leave your home country you start roaming, and roaming is expensive as hell (0.25cent / mb) so after about an hour my 4g connection drops, i receive i reached the european safeguard of 60 euro data roaming bill and in order to continue data roaming i need to login into my $telcobussnisssite and flip the switch. the only people with access to $telcobussnisssite are on the billing department and all of them are already gone to home. the hotel wifi has died and is unusable under all the children watching reaction videos and vlogs on youtube. i know that bottom and the top of the mountain there is pritty good wifi. so i drive back there. wifi is working good there, but in order to keep my car warm i need to keep the engine running, and after about an hour a cop shows up at my car asking what the hell i’m doing, in my best german i try to explain that i’m using the wifi, but my german is probably way too bad for him to understand it, i try to explain it in english but he doesn’t understand a word i’m saying. fortunately his colleague was speaking good english and he and his colleague were laughing at my, when he was explaining his colleague in german. so after about another hour the script seems to work on our test setup so i whent back for the hotel while my colleague back at the office was replacing the media update script, with this hacking, barely functioning script. the next day i get out of bed early, in my pyjamas i go to the hotel lobby opened my laptop order some overpriced coffee, and waited staring at the web version of our status wall. after about 15min, after the media updater supposedly had been download the first location comes back online, followed by all other locations, where the last location came back online after about 2 hours. there is a big meeting scheduled with $cashregistersoftwarecompany, about canceling our service with them. sorry for some grammer errors, english is not my native language so a few years back, (1998-2000-ish) my sister decided that she wanted a dvd-rom drive in her computer, so she went and bought one and installed it herself. then i get the call... sis: "hey, i bought a dvd drive for my pc.... i've got it installed but i can't read any discs with it." me: (in my head: "you installed it????") um, ok, tell me what you did. she proceeds to tell me how she disconnected the old cd-rom and reconnected the new dvd-rom and was having trouble since. then i get this: sis: "i see in the instructions it says something about jumper settings, do you think that could be it?" me: "mayyybeee... take the drive out and tell me what the jumper settings are, per the instructions." sis: "well, it looks like they're in the right position, what the manual says is ma." me: (blown away at this point since she properly connected an ide cable...) move the jumper to sl and see if it works. couple of minutes later she tells me it works now. shag me with a pitchfork, my tech-illiterate sister installed a new optical drive and the only thing she got wrong was not setting the ma/sl/cs jumpers correctly. she actually read the fucking manual! *edit*: some background info... she took advantage of a program where she works, whereby employees can receive training in a subject that can be applied in the office. she ended up taking an introduction to computers, maintenance and repair. she and her husband are very money conscious, having raised a large family, and thus when they could fix something themselves, they would. this is the one sister who never calls for tech help. the rest of my siblings are no better than [simple jack]( when it comes to tech. now stop asking if she's single, you sad, desperate users. ;)disclaimer: sadly, i'm unfamiliar with how the company to store process takes place or who are the people my boss talks on the phone with, but the most notorious being $mrred, again, forgive me if i'm making mistakes regarding who is my boss contacting amd, i love them, and this shows how this person was completely in no way someone capable of representing them. remember how i mention a while ago that my boss doesn't get along with an amd sales representative? i only met them once, but $mrred doesn't seem like the best kind of person, in a couple of occasions the processor shipment has gotten damaged on the way, and $mrred certainly wasn't the kindest person all arround but he got the job done, until.... we got the parts shipment today in the morning, quick before signing my co-worker verified the contents of the shipment, they had sent us the wrong shipment, not the series we have to get back in stock. my boss pick up the phone and head to his desk, picking up the phone and calling amd's office (or similar) to complain about the error, again. he put the loudspeaker since the store was empty and as usual, my boss set up the call recorder. &gt;$mrred: hello mister elboss, how may i attend you today? &gt;$elboss: red, the shipment you send it's not correct, you send me *again* the wrong oder. &gt;$mrred: that's not possible, i place the right shipments where they are supposed to go. &gt;$elboss: red, this is the third time this happens since you got in charge of this state, what's going on? you know what, let me talk to your boss. &gt;$mrred: it won't be necessary, i'll just send the right one after you bring me back the shipment i sent. &gt;$elboss: ¿que? no! the conversation got heated, and a minute later... &gt;$elboss: just get me tu boss. &gt;$mrred: you know what!? you can go ---- yourself madref----, i do my job!!! our jaws dropped, including a client that just came in, there was an awkward silence, then we heard $mrred hang up the phone. 30 minutes later we got another call, loudspeaker on. &gt;$redlady: good evening mr. eljefe, we are from amd, we deeply apologize for everything that redguy caused, he is no longer working with us, we're assigning someone new soon to your distribution zone. they were taking for a while, all relaxed and nice, hurray, good. tl;dr: mrred almost make us go green.hi tfts! my tale begins with a small law firm that we found had a dead hdd in their server. as we all know, hdd's die sometimes and this is why we use raid. we go ahead and purchase a new one for them and go install it. it begins rebuilding the raid and seeing that it will take several hours i head back to my office to monitor it remotely. after about 40 mins i notice the server go offline. i think to myself *that cant be good.* and give them a call. the receptionist answers and the following occurs. me = me, r = receptionist &gt;me: hi, i was just in doing some work on your server but it appears to be offline. can you please check that the status lights on the front of it for me? &gt;r: it is off. it was making too much noise so i powered it down. *moment of stunned silence* &gt;me: you turned it off?.... &gt;r: yes, we cant have it making too much noise in the office. we have clients here. &gt;me: and you did not think to call me to let me know it was making lots of noise so that i could fix it? never mind, i am coming over now. so i quickly ilo into the server to see if i can get it back online before i head over and i see that it is not detecting a hdd. i grabbed my kit and went on site. after a quick inspections my fears were confirmed. the raid was dead. they were down for a whole day after that while re rebuilt their raid and recovered from backup. the worst part is that the receptionist tried to blame it on us. i still don't know if/why the server was making more noise and will all the logs gone there is no way for me to find out. tldr: receptionist hard shut down the server while the raid was rebuilding because it was "making too much noise". killed the raid. addendum: to eliminate any confusion as to why she could get into the server room i will clarify. she was the staff member who was selected by the boss there to change the backup tapes. because of this she had keys to the server room.monday morning finally arrived. i slightly congratulated myself that i managed to get through the entire weekend without wasting a single further thought on angie. with no let-up in the weather, the early shift seemed to be of little comfort with the snow beating down as hard as it could. i was, however, brandishing a new set of gloves and a can of ice dissolving fluid. surprisingly, the day went off without a hitch. the snowy weather had landed most of the team off with "colds" and, notably, angie hadn't made it in. myself and mafg managed to pile through a bunch of tickets when balding head of it came in. he asked me if i could attend a meeting later which i obliged. fairly sure this was "the meeting", i began to mentally prepare my defense. i was again pleasantly surprised that this meeting was not one in which my ass would be summarily served, but rather a meeting of several heads brandishing a new project. it seemed that there was to be a conference in the not too distant future and the marketing, sales and product reps had worked hard to secure a vendor for a new medical crm product to replace the aging creaky filemaker based system. they also wanted to work in a complete laptop refresher programme, replacing any laptop over 2 years old. bhit made particular mention of a desktop rollout i performed last year - it was actually my initial 3 months contract, but as i'd proven myself worthy, was taken on full time. my job was to be responsible for managing the physical delivery of the new hardware/software as appropriate. i set to work on the task with glee, querying active directory for a list of machines, users and specs. one thing i always made sure of was to carry on my predecessor's good work in maintaining a super-clean active directory: a place for everything and everything in it's place. every audit we had, although occasionally revealing some discrepancies, everything was up to date and reports were reliable. after collating my results, i determined that 170 odd laptops would require replacement and approximately 250 builds would need to go on across three different hardware types - two already in use in the field and could continue and one for the new laptop specs. as soon as i could get the final signed off software from the vendor, i could go about getting images prepared, qa'd and rope in some of my friendlier reps to pilot the new builds before the big day. my analysis done and sent to bhit, i wrapped up for the day. all thoughts of that coffee swilling stick insect were thoroughly out of mind. my smile was demolished tuesday morning. angie had made it in and was busy setting about the task of undoing anything that looked like progress. the instant i appeared, she demanded my attention in the dungeon. sure enough, this was it. she now required a full explanation as to my actions the previous friday. i say explanation, after my defense of our security access to the it cupboard had been withdrawn was thrown straight back at me for failing to understand proper protocol, she just ripped into yet another starbucks latte-fueled tirade about leaving a vip high and dry for an hour while i blithered about. she then also ripped me a new one, asking what i was doing taking apart a pc in the middle of the office? it seemed that some of the fat finance wenches had ratted me out as well and claimed i'd caused such a loud commotion, they were prevented from working! i wonder if it's the same finance hag that is in her coffee group? this dressing down seemed to last forever, and it did... this was a good 20 minuter! dressing down fully received, i decided to retaliate once more. i mailed our bhit and cc'd the rest of support, questioning why we were no longer permitted access to the it cupboard for equipment, where we should go if angie is not around to give her approval to retrieve gear from the cupboard and, most importantly, where are we supposed to work on machines or hardware? these were things which worked perfectly fine a few weeks ago were now suddenly were not fine. the reply from bhit was as usual fairly impotent and full of noncommittal statements. his response that he was unaware the it cupboard was being used as a build area for hardware came as a shock to us all particularly as he was the one who got the ghost server off the 3rd line team in the first place. he concluded by requesting that we should seek clarification of suitable build areas from our manager, angie. i could see we were going to get nowhere on this path. the water deepened. i held my breath, cited 15 odd tickets in my queue which would require extensive dismantling and imaging time, none of which could occur at my desk and none of which could even happen as the build server with all our images had been thrown in a riser room, which of course none of us could now access anymore. added to that, with the conference project looming, exactly where were we meant to image these machines? and how would i be able to access our build server for the task at hand - my nightly whatsalive script reporting it as the only machine missing in action? as a demonstration of the extent of his ineptitude, instead of formulating a reply, he simply replied to all and inserted angie's email at the top with the words "angie, can you please direct jon6 appropriately? thanks." you can guess the next conversation. "what conference is this and what makes you think you have anything to do with it?" angie demanded. as bhit had truly dumped me in it, i had to relay all about my task for the conference. she would find out anyway, the train was in motion. of course, this was now something new she could micromanage to the nth degree, but not without a scolding first. she first demanded to know why she was never informed. i responded, "bhit had been present in the meeting, too. given my handling of the xp rollout and desktop replacement project last year, this is why bhit and several heads asked for me by name! that said, as it's a major project, i find it difficult to believe that you were not in the loop with this one already?" (whoa... saucer of milk, meeting room 7... could it be score 1 to jon6?) in reality, i already knew that angie was already plotting. if i was a betting man, i'd have said the plan was already made in her mind; she was too sharp to not have planned all the fine details already. all she needed was the time to put it into effect. what the plan was, i have no idea, only the future will tell. but i did know at that moment that this process won't go well. it will either be mired in micro-managementism... or i just won't do it at all. so, i managed to get my digs in that one time, but i now have a fight on my hands. on the one hand, i've made enough of an impression by some heads to have been asked for by name to drive this forward. on the other hand, i had the bitch manager from hell, bent on thrusting her dagger of incompetence into the beating heart of anything resembling efficiency. and there was still no response about where hardware/builds should be taking place. one thing i was sure of... if we're going to play this game, let the games begin! **previous** this happened a year ago right after i started my job at big nameless corporate hospital. i am one of the sysadmins, but i am basically the 'go-to' girl for random tasks such as web development. no one else in the it department knows how build a website or write code, so it defaults to me. normally, i work to support our users and our clients, but in this situation i was the client trying to purchase software from a vendor. my boss had given me the task of upgrading the design of our intranet website. the website allows all the doctors and nurses to log in and view their departmental policies and other work-related information, but it is very basic. my boss decided that we would contract externally with a vendor to set up a company wide pto calendar because he did not want me wasting man hours coding a pto calendar when we could just buy one. i set up a meeting with the vendor and booked a nice conference room so that we could hook up our laptops. i had to fight with one of the nurses over which conference room i was allowed to use, but i was victorious. the day of the meeting rolled around and i headed to the conference room early to set up. i turned on one of our ancient projectors and went to make a pot of coffee in the lobby while the projector warmed up. it was unseasonably warm, so i took some time to appreciate how god awful hot it was outside while i waited for the vendor and my boss to show. a knock on the lobby door signaled the early arrival of the vendor. i opened the door to greet him and to my surprise, he pushed me aside and sat down in the lobby. the vendor was an older gentleman (grey haired and in his 60s, a typical southern gentleman) so i figured that he just didn't notice me and i walked over to introduce myself. "hello, my name is tinyneko and i am the -" "sweetie, would you fetch me a cup of coffee?" "excuse me?" "would you mind grabbing me a cup of coffee? i'm waiting for the web developer to show up for our meeting. it's at 2:00 pm." "absolutely, but i am -" "shhhhh. i won't be able to hear him arriving if you aren't quiet. just be a dear and fetch me the coffee." i didn't know what to say, but i decided to just remain quiet and fetch the coffee. there are certain battles that we pick in life and i wasn't in the mood to fight. i had made the coffee for the meeting, so why not just give him a cup of coffee? i poured him a cup of coffee and handed it to him. "do you have any sugar? who drinks coffee without sugar?" i didn't respond verbally, but i nodded and went to fetch the vendor some sugar from the cafeteria. when i got back, the vendor was missing and the door to the conference room was closed. i figured he had gone to the restroom so i sat down and waited for him to return. fifteen minutes passed and it was 2:15 pm. no sign of the vendor or my boss. i send my boss an email from my phone asking where he is. another fifteen minutes pass and it's now 2:30 pm. i'm pissed off and the vendor is no where to be found. my phone beeps and it's a message from my boss saying that both he and the vendor are *already in the conference room*. i knock on the conference room door and the vendor and my boss are standing around chatting. "tinyneko, where have you been? we were waiting for you! steve, have you met our web developer, tinyneko!" "well, i was setting up for the meeting but then i was informed that the vendor was waiting for the web developer to arrive. since i'm obviously not the web developer, i was locked out of the conference room. silly me, it wouldn't have happened if i just had the coffee supplies prepared!" my boss was confused for a moment, but i watched as he understood. his web developer who was stretched so thin on man hours that we have to contract externally was told to get coffee and an hour of her work hours wasted. his demeanor turned icy and he told the vendor that we would have to reschedule. if you can't guess how this ends, we never signed the contract and i ended up writing the pto calendar anyway.first post in the sub! here goes nothing... i’m a specialized sysadmin at a medical school. at the time of this story, we’ve recently switched to a new website for online learning. the old one is in the last stages of its use for the current semester. but despite our best efforts, professors seem to ignore every memo/announcement/email/broadcast informing them of the move. i get this call: &gt; **$prof:** i can’t see any of my courses for next semester on the site. &gt; **$me:** are you looking on the new website, at [new site]? &gt; **$prof:** yes. i’m on there grading students right now. (i groan inwardly, knowing that students aren’t on the new site yet.) &gt; **$me:** that’s the old one. please go to [new site]. &gt; **$prof:** i just told you, i’m already there! &gt; **$me:** what does your browser show in the address bar? &gt; **$prof:** [old site]! &gt; **$me:** then you’re on the old site. you have to go to [new site] for future semesters. &gt; **$prof:** why wasn’t i told?! &gt; **$me:** it’s been communicated many times through announcements on [old site]. &gt; **$prof:** oh, i don’t read those. &gt; **$me:** there have also been emails to all faculty about it from several different departments. &gt; **$prof:** you can’t just assume that i pay attention to all my emails! you should have called! she didn't understand why we couldn't possibly call every single professor and inform them of the change. this happened several times over the next few weeks. to reiterate: i work at a *medical school*. these are the people training our future doctors. do they just ignore their patients' charts, too? edit: formattingi work for a small software developer as a (female) system support technician. i've worked here for about 3 months, but i have many years support experience in various fields. the call which i am about to record took place this morning. &gt;**me:** $smallsoftwaredeveloper, this is vedagock speaking. how may i help you? &gt;**$manlydude:** hi vedagock, this is $manlydude from $itcompany. one of our customers is reporting a problem with your software and i would like to speak to $malecolleague. &gt;**me:** unfortunately $malecolleague has gone back to school and only works mondays now. i am his replacement though, may i help you instead? &gt;**$manlydude:** hmm no. can i talk to a man instead? &gt;*is this guy for real? please let this be a misunderstanding.* &gt;**me:** excuse me? i am unfortunately the only support staff available at the moment, please tell me what the issue is and i will take a look at it. &gt;**$manlydude:** just have one of your male colleagues call me when they're available, ok? &gt;*what the actual shit? i can't even...* i proceeded to take his name and number and leave a note for one of my colleagues to call him. i wish i could have thought of something smart to say but i am still in shock. this is the first time in all my support years that this has ever happened to me and i needed to vent. i just really hope that this guy doesn't have any female colleagues. edit: formatting. also, the reason is (hopefully) not porn. our software is installed on servers in the healthcare sector, $manlyguy being hired for the day to day it operations would have way bigger problems than me being non-male if porn was the case.about a decade ago, i worked on the support-side of things in the medical software field. one saturday morning, my phone started ringing at the ungodly hour of 5am -- it was my boss, and he stayed on the line just long enough to say these seven magical words: 'data corruption, outdated backups, get here now'. on-call for disaster recovery was something i frequently helped out with, so i cruised on in to the office only to find that it was no ordinary data restore/rebuild job -- my entire group had been called away from their weekend plans, as the hospital in question was one of the largest hospitals we supported ($hospital). somehow, the header structure for *every single active patient account* had been completely corrupted (over 10,000 accounts), and this had a wonderful cascade-of-corruption down into the lower-level structures as well. just to make things simpler for us, their most recent backups were almost sixteen hours out of date -- way too old for us to just restore everything from. $hospital was completely unable to load any of the corrupted accounts, with doctors &amp; nurses having to rely on handwritten paper files for everything. cue *many* frantic, profanity-filled and desperation-fueled hours of us restoring patient information from the outdated backups, then manually rebuilding as much of the missing information as we can from various other sources/indexes/anything we could find. dozens of new "build data x off of indexes y and z" scripts were created that day (some of which are actually still in use to this day). closing on a full 13 hours after the corruption initially hit, and we finally have $hospital back up and running with almost all of the patient data rebuilt. data integrity routines are now coming up clean, but we still have no idea what in the name of dread cthulhu caused the corruption in the first place. hardware guys are reporting every diagnostic tool they have is showing perfect disk health, so it's probably not their fault. all of our attempts to reproduce the corruption in any way possible have come up empty, so it's probably not our fault either. we're completely stumped, tired, and just want to go home and salvage what's left of our weekend at this point - so we leave various trap-on-account-data-write scripts running and tell $hospital that we'll carefully monitor them over the rest of the weekend, but can't do a proper review until regular staff is back in during normal business hours. we all head home at this point, and i spend a while decompressing with my good friend johnnie walker before calling it a night. cue the next morning, and i'm suddenly blasted awake by my phone ringing yet again at 5am. the seven magic words my boss utters this time are 'holy shit it happened again, we're doomed'. so, nursing a *lovely* hangover and muttering threats of death against both bright lights and loud noises, i head in yet again. thankfully, the backups this time were only about an hour old -- and we'd already written all of the needed data-rebuild scripts less than a day ago. the restore and rebuild goes much quicker this time, hindered only by the fact that $hospital is quite literally *screaming* at us, threatening lawsuits re: patient care and safety, etc. anything involving lawyers was (and thankfully still is) outside my pay grade, so company executives on our end are being summoned away from their sunday golf brunch (or whatever it is they do on weekends) and have started arriving in the office purple-faced with rage. meanwhile, we lowly programmers have been given explicit orders to figure out what in the seven hells is going on, and this time nobody gets to go home until we have a cause found and solution in place. there's just one catch -- none of our trap-on-write code is showing data writes from our end. hardware is still reporting all-green, so we're just as stumped as before, except now we have angry executives breathing down our necks. at this point, six hours into day two of corruption hell, i noticed a pair of tickets from $hospital sitting out there (with several requests for updates, of course) -- one for saturday and one for sunday, both saying "hey, we haven't had the daily charges files post for our accounts today". we'd just been ignoring them, as there *was* a minor apocalypse taking our attention, but suddenly the low-watt light bulb over my head finally clicked on. $hospital didn't just use my company's software -- they also used $othervendor to compile a daily file of recurring charges for active accounts, which would then be posted to our system via an interface my company provides. an interface that $othervendor's programmers were notorious for complaining about, saying it was "too slow". i run a quick check, and sure enough the $othervendor-&gt;us daily "active account charges" files exist all the way up until friday morning -- there are no files for saturday and sunday. daily charge files from $othervendor would be filed to every active account? check. time the files are scheduled to post to our system? 4:30am. this was more than enough evidence for us to completely turn off the interface, plus blacklist $othervendor's machines from connecting to our data servers at all. monday morning rolls around, and all is quiet. no 5am emergency call. bliss. i hear my boss give our $othervendor counterparts a call later that morning, and this was the point at which the dinosaur-sized shit *truly* hit the industrial-scale fan. he speaks to them calmly for a few minutes, then puts them on hold, makes a second call, and sits there. barely more than a minute later, *three* of our execs arrive at a dead sprint, close his office door, take $othervendor off hold, and the volume of the call rapidly increases until they could've woken the dead. it took a few days for everything to completely shake out, most of which i wasn't directly involved in (because company lawyers were). it turned out that a programmer at $othercompany (with *extreme* delusions of grandeur) decided our interface was just "too slow", and came up with their own code to try and write their data directly to our data structures. our encrypted data structures. the structures they *explicitly* can only interact with via our interface. and if all of this weren't already bad enough, he actually sent his code directly from $othervendor's inhouse system to the hospital's production environment because "it worked fine" on his system -- when he was using a completely different data model! shockingly enough, $othervendor programmer was immediately terminated (possibly literally, as nobody i know heard of him again), there was a quite successful lawsuit by $hospital against $othervendor, and i took myself off the disaster recovery on-call list as quickly as i could.while working in it in iraq in 2007 i was taken hostage. (see iama: while i was a hostage one of the militia came in and asked if i could sort out his commanders laptop as it was running slow and he could not install the cracked game he had just purchased from the market. not feeling in a particularly helpful frame of mind, what with being chained up and fearing death and all that, i spent a few minutes looking over it and concluded that i could not help. about 15 minutes later the guy returned and asked if i could try again as his commander was giving him some verbal over it. i spent the next hour uninstalling adware and stopping programs from running when windows booted, and did a general cleanup. also managed to get his cracked copy of medal of honour working, which seemed to make everyone happier. feeling somewhat pleased with my achievements, in what only can be described as extreme circumstances, i returned the laptop. the commander left and his subordinate came in to see me. he smacked me over the head with a pistol, causing my head to bleed, explaining that next time he asked me to do something i was to do it the first time around! 2 years, 7 months and 1 day later (or 946 days) i got released. never had a bad day at the office since. i sit in my office surrounded by new equipment. the budget in my hand looking amazing. everything was finally going well. if only i could get rid of security everything would be perfect. i glanced down at my computer. &gt;new urgent message &gt;**** come up to my office to handover the reigns of security to the new hire. **** &gt;the vp i took a sip of my coffee before getting up. who knew today all my wishes would come true? as i walked up to the vp's office i wondered if life got any better. probably not. arriving at the vp's office, the vp's new secretary asked which beverage i would prefer for the meeting. &gt;me: coffee, thanks. &gt;sec: no problems airz, coming right up. i smiled. coffee was on its way, security was leaving. perfect day. the vp arrives at his office and smiles at me. behind him walks a gentleman in a suit. &gt;vp: quite a day, finally passing on the managerial responsibility of security. &gt;me: i'm sure i'll be sad to see it go. i look up at the suited man quizzically. &gt;vp: oh yes, airz. this is security head, he'll be replacing you. &gt;me: security head, nice to meet you. &gt;sechead: i've taken a quick tour of the security arrangements this morning. it seems you're the man who's responsible for the waste of manpower. the vp looked taken aback. &gt;vp: settle down, settle down. airz was covering two busy positions. you'll be able to implement all the security changes you see fit. security head smiled, but i was barely listening. coffee had arrived, it was officially the best day. i took a sip. tasted like heaven. &gt;vp: we're getting sued. i looked down at my coffee. heaven? or hell. i couldn't tell. &gt;vp: the reason you two are meeting today is because the guy who destroyed the air conditioner is now suing the company for wrongful termination. so we need to get our new security expert up to speed on the situation so he can testify. &gt;me: why? he can't testify if he wasn't employed at the time of the incident. &gt;vp: he cant? &gt;me: what would he have to say? &gt;vp: oh... well i'm going to need you to get me a list of all the equipment that was destroyed because of the vandals actions. i took a sip of coffee, and thought about all the equipment that was replaced because it was "badly damaged". this list became much shorter if you took out all the working but needed a convenient excuse to upgrade items. &gt;me: sure... &gt;vp: and your first job as security manager is to find the tapes of the incident. &gt;sechead: tapes of the incident? &gt;vp: from the cameras outside. &gt;sechead: the cameras outside? the new security head looked confused. &gt;sechead: i've done a full inspection of the property this morning, and i can tell you there are no cameras outside. &gt;vp: what's the black camera thing pointing directly at the air conditioner? &gt;sechead: oh, that's a spotlight with no bulb in it. which we do need to fix as a security priority. &gt;vp: so there's no footage of the incident? &gt;sechead: none. &gt;vp: no footage of the aftermath? the err... damage. &gt;sechead: sorry, but no. &gt;vp: mmmm that's terrible news, i thought that was a camera. the vp has said terrible, but he was smiling. the smile was wide. i took a sip of my coffee. heaven had gone. [next]( all the older posts are coming in ebook form, fingers crossed for soon. so many spelling errors. several years ago, i was helping a client set up and install new workstations as the old ones were obsolete and in dire need of an upgrade. it was my very first job and i was expected to answer basic support questions when i met with the user and swapped out their old pc for a brand spanking new one. i was in the middle of hooking up the monitor when another user approached me regarding an odd e-mail he and his coworkers had received only minutes ago. this is pretty much what it looked like: &gt;important!! &gt;please do not shut down your computer today as it will not boot back up again if you do. &gt;/ it it so happened to be april 1 and neither i or my coworkers had heard anything about this. since there was very little information in the email, everyone naturally thought it was a joke, but then people around us started to yell how their computers actually would not boot! oops! turns out the antivirus software had received an update over the night which caused it to flag some system files as malicious and then removed them. it was fixed later the same day, but i can't help but feel that more workstations could have been saved if they had only been more informative or bothered to write "this is not a joke" somewhere in the initial email.this was a fun one. an ex-client of ours (we ended up firing them as a client) is a health center that was very difficult to deal with for several reasons, most of which had to deal with failure to comply to our requests and challenging most every decision we made for their company's it needs. constant fighting over money did not help either. one of the requests that was made by our customer was to provide them with a free printer for signing a contract with my company. we felt that the business that we would gain from a contract would be worth the expense of a new printer for their office, so we complied. we were told that it would need to be color and have the ability to fax and copy. we ended up purchasing a mid-range (~$450) hp laserjet all-in-one printer for their office, and i was tasked with going on-site to set it up. upon arrival and showing our customer the printer, i was scolded and informed that was “not what they asked for”. wait, what? they specifically asked for a "color printer that could make copies and send faxes." this was exactly that! how could it be so wrong? what our customer was expecting was a professional, corporate copier such as a ricoh mp c5500. this would be the first of many miscommunications with this customer, but i learned from an early stage that sometimes, it is absolutely necessary to say no to customers, and to explain why a free ~$6,000 copier was not going to happen. edit: a word.so another story from my (recently) last workplace. this was when i was on leave for studies, and i had agreed to come in and help during weekends for some extra cash. customer [majorisp] had a planned power outtage for rebuilding their power mains during a weekend. being a data and comms center, they of course had two separate power sources with ups, so work was being done one side at a time. i told my supervisor that i'd be glad to help, but that i'd need some prep work with insuring that all servers we were entrusted with were connected to power outlets on the b side. got a mail from my coworker saying that everything was prepped and fine. come work night. i arrive, head up to the office, take a quick look around and see that all our servers are indeed connected up to b side. i grab a coffee and wait for the other departments and the electricians. when they arrive, we make a check list for the activities, and the electricians are let into the mains room, while i stay up in the noc with the other two department techs. about 15 minutes after work start, we hear an omnious "wooooooooouuuuuffffhhhhh..." turning into silence from inside the server room. we rush to the door, only to find that the card reader is dead. it apparently ran on a side power. luckily someone had physical keys to the door, so we could get in anyway. inside, i find to my relief that only one half rack of my servers are down, due to a mislabeled outlet. however, the other techs seem to have failed prep work, so pretty much all the core switches and routers are down. a sudden gut feeling tells me to look on twitter. yup. soccer night. customers cable boxes are down. rage ensuing. we try to get a hold of the electricians, but there is no answer. about two or three attempted calls later, the door to the noc room opens and two rather heavy set police officers enter and start asking us for id's and what the hell we think we're doing. turns out, since the isp offers phone subscriptions through their cable boxes, this was classed as disruption of vital comminuty services, given that nobody could now dial emergency lines. we explain what's going on, and the officers demand to take us down to the electricians. when we arrive, we find that: a. the door to the mains room is locked with a card reader. that runs on a side power. and they didn't have keys. b. there's no phone reception in the basement. c. the electricians had forgotten some tools needed for the work in their truck, and once they had cut power and started splicing the cables, they had no way to connect it back. letting them out to get their tools, power was back up within ten minutes. since my servers had survived the ordeal, i could go home, but i found out some days later that the other techs had spent four hours getting all the customers cable boxes to sync up. i guess what i learned, and hopefully them too, is that prep work is vital. tl;dr: customer does power outtage, brings down vital community services, police arrives. edit: wow, top of the page! thanks guys! :)last week, i went to my boss (whose last name is dotson), to ask for a small raise. basically, what i was asking was for my yearly 4% raise, just early, about 6 months before annual reviews. my company never gives raises, but my wife and i needed to make a little extra to make ends meet, so i thought it wouldn't hurt to ask. in the meeting, my boss was very gracious, but basically said, "i'm sorry, but we might not be even be able to give raises at all this year." to which, i basically said "thanks anyway." on the way out, in a stroke of sheer brilliance, i stuck my head back in his office and said "just don't get cheap on me, dotson. that was hammond's mistake." i have never seen him laugh that hard. he then told me he'd see what he could do about a raise. apparently the cfo (who my boss reports to) is a huge jurassic park fan. like, he has signed scripts, autographed posters, etc. i had no idea. but he thought that was great and was slightly upset he hadn't made some sort of dodgson reference earlier. (in the past week, i've overheard him say "dotson! we have dotson over here!" 3 times) anyways, i was given a 6% raise, and i have lunch with the cfo next week! i work in it, but i understand this is a fairly generic story. hopefully this fits in the "unsolvable problems cracked by sheer genius" category.ok, this story happened a few years back. i'm a sysadmin for a big german company. my wife, who is a tech illiterate, is working for a tour operator and has to do product presentations in her customers offices quite often. one day, after one of these presentations, she tells me, that she thinks something is wrong with her laptop. frequent bluescreens, slower than usual etc. &gt;**wife**:do you think this could be a virus? &gt;**me**: hm. hard to say. could be possible. but since i don't have any administrative rights on your laptop, there's not much i can do. go to your admin next thing tomorrow and let him take care of it. next day in the office i receive a call: &gt;**wife**: honey, i went to &lt;admin&gt;, just like you said, and he said, that it is most probably a virus. but i'm not sure about one detail he mentioned. &gt;**me**: ok. what is it? &gt;**wife**: he said, since i never was online in the customers network, and out network is 100% secured, i might have caught the infection over the vga connection to the projector. is that even possible? &gt;**me**: sweetie, i'll put you on speaker, could you please repeat what he was saying? my colleagues have to hear this... since that time, i'm sure, as long as guys like &lt;admin&gt; exist, i will be able to find a job.at the time i was a project manager in the it department for one of the most prestigious medical school and hospital in the world. we were in the middle of an 18 month project commonly known as the project from hell by everyone in the department. if you are familiar with the health care world, you are aware of seriously they take privacy and encryption. the scope of the project was encrypt and install central management on 10,000 cell phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops that belonged to students, doctors, researchers, etc. and they were also scattered across several locations around the city. i was given 4 temporary techs to complete this daunting tasks. 3 of the 4 were constantly unmotivated, calling out sick, and at times prolonging on the project on purpose because they knew once the project was over they would be out of work. however, one tech (lets call him paul) had an amazing work ethic and was a natural leader of the group. he would double even triple the daily quota on a regular basis. so when he did not show up to work one day unannounced i knew something was wrong. we later found out he had a medical emergency but would be back in the office in a week or two. i welcomed paul back and asked if he was okay. he talked about his emergency with little detail and made it seem like it was nothing more severe than a common cold. it was only a few weeks later that i found out from his direct supervisor that he was placed in the hospital after a heart complication due to him not taking his medication. i decided to take him out to lunch so i could speak to him on a more personal level. and during that lunch he saw me as a friend, which i already considered him to be, and opened up about how he can't afford his medication or to go to the doctor while dealing with several health issues all relating to his heart because not only does he not have health care but is also supporting his sisters 2 kids. the kids father was no where to be found, and his sister was in and out of rehab, so the kids were left to him. wow, i can never complain about my "struggles" ever again. fast forward a month later. it is time to encrypt a high profile doctor's iphone. so of course, i send paul, our best technician. from what i heard from paul later, this doctor, was a "usual". he did not understand why we needed to encrypt the phone, why we need to install central management, and why we needed to "spy" on him. although i was not there, we did not get any complaints, so i am sure paul handled the situation with great customer service as he usually does. fast forward 2 weeks. that very same doctor loses his phone in the back of a taxi, calls it, we were able to wipe the phone within minutes. by the way, when patient data is compromised, the organization can be fined $1 million dollars per patient, and the doctor can lose all their license to practice medicine . fast forward 1 month. paul misses his end of day check in. i just assume, he's working late and i will just speak to him in the morning. get to work the next morning, he is no where to be found. when i spoke to his direct supervisor i find out he had a stroke while he was at work and his in a recovering in a room in that very building. i instantly think about how he has no healthcare and also since he was a temp he will not be getting paid while in the hospital. how was he going to take care of him self and those kids? a couple days go by, paul's supervisor come running to my desk with a huge smile on his face. turns out the doctor who paul helped a few months ago was one of the best heart surgeons in the world. and as soon as he saw paul's name, he insisted on performing the surgery and overseeing his recovery personally. when he found out about his lack of health insurance, the doctor covered all the costs, made a few calls, and had paul hired as a full time employee. this instantly gave him the health insurance he needed and disability pay to help support his niece and nephew. it's been over a year and i am at a new job now, but i still think about paul everyday. whenever i have to deal with a less than ideal client or coworker, i think what would paul do? or, you never know, i might need this person to help me out one day. edit: all this took place a little over a year ago. paul is alive and well today. he still works there and has even been recently promoted!long time reader, first time poster. excuse my english, i'm not a native speaker. so didn't happend to me but to a co-worker of a good friend. &gt; **(l)user:** my my pc doesn't eject the cd probably the drive was stuck or something like that. he decides to take a look at the problem. as he enters the office the (l)user is already waiting for him. with one look at the pc the problem is clear: &gt; **it-guy:** your pc has no cd-drive. where did you put the cd's in? the (l)user looks condused and points at a gap on the monitor. he opend the screen and literaly ten cds fell out of it. the problems of it-support caused by all-in-one pcs... **edit:** wow, what a feedback, thanks guys. this is my first post on reddit (everything before were just comments). probably the most successfull post i'll ever writeclient calls says her second monitor is flickering. i have the onsite office manager check the cables to make sure they are plugged in and tight. response: yes. so i say replace the vga cable. she does. everything is fine. next day same monitor is reported "dead." client calls ceo and vp. at 10pm on saturday night, there's a big blow up resulting in them demanding parrot32 comes out next day to fix. so sunday, as mad as a bat out of hell, i roll out there. i find the monitor's plug to the power cable sitting mostly out of the socket. it looked like someone went to plug it in and then changed their mind at the last second; the prongs were was lined up right, but not pushed in. so i push the plug into the outlet. turn on the resurrected monitor and leave. bill client $120 for time and travel. edit: vga cable, not evgalast month i told a customer she needs to pay for $accountingsoftware tech support before we can transfer her $accountingsoftware onto a different pc (the backup wasn't restoring correctly and google-fu is pretty sparse for this program). she complained that the boss thought it wasn't worth paying to extend support for another year and let it expire, then said she would speak to their accountant who also uses $accountingsoftware to ask if they could fnagle support through them. called them today about another issue. she asked when she could move onto the other pc. i explained we're still waiting for them to get $accountingsoftware support. &gt; "nobody told me we needed that!" haha, yes we did. twice. in person and by email. playing ignorant might work against a big company but not when there's only two of us and we've both told you the same thing!when working as a understaffed small managed service provider, there are a few key rules that you need to follow in order to keep the business running. 1. the large companies are the backbone of your business, do anything you can not to lose them. 2. try to take only business related jobs. personal jobs normally involve endless hours of virus removal with little customer satisfaction when they receive the bill. \**ring ring*\* i look at the caller id, it's larry, the boss of a major client. he's scarily aggressive when he needs something done but generally he's pretty laid back, a bit of a jekyll and hyde. &gt; me: hello this is friendlysorceror. &gt; larry: hey man, i'm giving my old iphone to my daughter. *alarm bells ring in my head* i want her to be on a separate account to the business and i want her to be able to manage it herself, also i want her to have her own email address and apple thingo instead of using mine. i think to myself "you have a daughter?" i've probably had 100 phone calls with him and not once has he mentioned his family which is where my surprise came from. it's a good thing for a 13 year old to learn independence and money/resource management. &gt; me: sure i can do that, i'll need you to go to the shop and get a sim. &gt; *larry goes shopping and calls back a few hours later* &gt; me: ok so we will need to activ... &gt; larry: i'll put her on. &gt; me: no that won't be necess... too late, larry has no time for the struggles of sim activation. i hear him talking to his daughter (ld) to follow the 'nice it guy's" instructions. &gt; *phone crackle followed by silence* &gt; me: hello this is friendlysorcerer how are you? &gt; ld: good. as soon as she speaks i realize that i'm talking to someone who isn't a teenager, or maybe she is and she just sounds really young, i give her the benefit of the doubt. &gt; me: can i get you to go to a computer and open up an internet browser. &gt; ld: can i use my ipad? &gt; me: sure, tap on safari. then enter "url to sim activation" in the big white bar at the top of the screen. &gt; ld: *2 minutes of slow tapping* it dawns on me that i'm going to have to talk a child/teen through activating a sim, reading out a mac address, joining it to the wifi, creating an email account, creating an apple id, adding an email account and setting up icloud. the alarm bells in my head have changed to evacuation sirens. &gt; me: umm, could i speak to your dad? &gt; ld: ok *background chatter* daddy said he is very busy. &gt; me: alright, can i speak to your mum then? &gt; ld: she is not home yet. &gt; me: are they are any adults at home that i can speak to? &gt; ld: just daddy. &gt; me: can you please ask him to call me back when he isn't busy? *click* i hang up and thank my lucky stars that i managed to dodge that situation. not even 1 minute later... \**ring ring*\* larry on the caller id again. &gt; me: hello th.. &gt; larry: i need this sim activated. &gt; me: ok, well i need to go through the activation with an adult. &gt; larry: why? she is perfectly capable of following instructions. &gt; me: she will need parental consent for a lot of the registration forms that we'll need to fill out. &gt; larry: you have my consent. i try and reason with larry in a language he understands. &gt; me: well at this rate it's going to take about 3 hours, with an adult i could do it in about 15-30 minutes. &gt; larry: i don't care just get it done. *phone crackles as he passes it to his daughter* great, my job description is now managed daycare service provider. this is where the real journey begins, spending two hours on the phone giving instructions and asking details from a child is a real reminder for why we have rule #2. i got her to read the information to me as i thought me filling out the form was easier than getting a child to scroll around an ipad screen. 15 excruciating minutes into activating the sim when i said &gt; me: on this next box i will need to enter your date of birth. &gt; ld: 1 9 1 2 2 0 0 5. &gt; me: so you are 9 years old? &gt; ld: *thinking* no i am 13 *background chatter* 1 9 1 2 two-thousand and one. obviously larry had told her that she needed to pretend to be 13. rather than point the finger and go "aha! you're not 13!", and at the risk of being held liable for some fraudulent age thing backfiring on me, i decided to just logout and walk her through logging in to finish the rest of the form on larry's laptop. &gt; me: where it says terms &amp; conditions you will need to click the small white circle next to yes then click next. &gt; ld: i'm clicking it but it's not doing anything. &gt; me: try clicking in the middle of the circle. &gt; ld: *random clicking* it's not working. &gt; me: put the sharp tip of the mouse pointer in the middle of the circle and click. &gt; ld: oh that worked. i started to reminisce on the days when i was a computer nooblet, navigating the world wide web for the first time, sadly all i could recall was static html pages with dark red/blue background colour and black text. i've lost the memory of filling out html forms the first time, but i knew that i, too, needed my hand held when filling out html registration forms. i'd like to think that i would have intuitively known to click the 'next' button once the form was complete, or to click the circle next to 'yes' instead of clicking the text. but realistically it's something that you learn, then forget that you had to learn how to do it. i realized something, since i'm a trained it professional, i am the most suited person to teach this kid about using the internet properly. i'm not running a damn daycare, i am going to run a school! i start dropping some computer knowledge, over the next 10 minutes i teach her about what url/uri's are, what a hyperlinks are, and how to tell if a website it safe. &gt; me: can you please hover over 'next'. &gt; ld: ok. &gt; me: now do you see the text starting with in the big white bar at the top? &gt; ld: yes. &gt; me: what is that text called? &gt; ld: umm, a url? &gt; me: that's right! now what is the text that you're hovering over called. &gt; ld: a hyperlink. &gt; me: great! now is this hyperlink safe to click on? &gt; ld: yes because the stuff before the .com matches. &gt; me: excellent! what will it do when you click on it? &gt; ld: takes me to another web page. &gt; me: perfect! go ahead and click. i kept doing spot tests with her every 15 minutes while we were filling out these forms. when we get to google i teach her about the green ticks that the anti-virus software puts next to some of the url's. 90 minutes and a few snack breaks go by and we are up to creating the apple id and thankfully larry's wife gets home and helps out with the account creation. trying to remember all the little things you need to do when you create it from a parent's account is a real struggle, especially when you are doing the steps super slowly. finally we are done and the phone is set up, i say goodbye to the young lady. &gt; ld: thanks for helping me set up my phone. &gt; me: no problem, remember to browse safely. &gt; ld: yep. *click* i swivel around on my chair and grin at my boss, who is busy juggling calls with multiple isps, man i am having the best day. **tldr**: tried to avoid 3 hours of account creation and configuration, ended up giving a 9 year old a lesson on using the internet. ***** edit: to those first few who read this, sorry for the 20 typos, extra thankyou for the reddit gold donation.i was working a help desk and these poor hvac guys were always having issues. one day this guy called in and i got him three times. found out he's on the roof of a building trying to troubleshoot. after looking into his ticket history the laptop was toast and needed to be replaced but the company didn't want to spring for it. so this was near the end of our 45 min conversation: &gt; me: ok we are going to try one last thing sir, are you near the edge of the building? &gt; him: ayup pretty close... &gt; me: oops &gt; him: wow, the laptop just slipped off the building. damned wind must've taken it out of my hands! &gt; me: i'll put in the order to desk side sir, you have a better day! thankfully the call wasn't on the review list or i'm sure we would've been in deep doo doo. but we both felt better! edit: thanks for all the upvotes and for the kind stranger who gilded it! didn't even realize it was this popular :-)ok, short oldie but goodie tonight! our lone it guy in the late shift, recieving a call from the 3rd inline to be warehouse manager, he's supposedly having problems connecting his usb mouse.......ok, quick one i think, i redirect incoming calls to my cell and off i go. when i get to his office he's mercilessly pounding away on his keyboard and yelling at someone on the phone in croatian, he looks at me and right away screams out that this can't be and the machine we gave him (hp 7990 pushed to the max) is just a giant load of crap....... i tell him it's all good and i'm here to take a look at it, so why not just let me? well he does and i check the connectors, mouse and keyboard cables sit snug in the back connectors so i check the keyboard workings, work, mouse doesn't even light up......hmmm i plug my own admin usb-stick into the front of the machine, works, so the controller seems to be fine, i run a hardware diagnostic on the controller and while i do that, i ask him if there was anything he could think of.......he then tells me, "it was unsually tough to get in" and it dawns on me, but its not possible, is it? well i check the back of the machine again unplug the usb keyboard and then try to unplug the mouse.........its stuck! i quit everything, shut down the computer and unplug everything but the mouse, turn it around and gently massage the plug out of the connector and then i see it: he managed to plug the usb in upside down all the way !!!this is a tale of back when i worked it back in college. my title was ‘student it consultant’. there was ~20 of us that worked on faculty/staff computers. problems from viruses, deployments, imaging, upgrades, new equipment, mac address management, etc. i was assigned a ticket that the main computer that handled all of the printing for the writing, cj, and english departments was not turning on. this machine was the sole computer connected to one of those ‘super all-in-one printer-scanner-copier-fax-18 trays of loading paper-yada-yada’. so it was a high priority ticket as the image on it was custom. if you were wondering, no there was not a backup image to easily replace it (go figure). i walked up to the building and did a quick diagnostic of the machine. no power, no lights, no nothing. i remembering thinking it might be a bad psu or the mobo was shot (it was an older machine and this was becoming a more common problem). unhooked the machine and brought it back to the office where we fixed all the machines that might take some time. i worked on it for maybe an hour, updated the ticket with all the information i could. i had to go to class, so i wouldn’t get back to it for a few hours. after class i went over to the same building as i had to pickup another machine for service. i wasn’t wearing my ‘work uniform’, which was basically a vest with a name badge, but luckily for me, another tech was in the building, so i just walked next to him the entire time. i should note that wearing these vests was a huge deal to the upper it managers. most of the regular staff/faculty didn’t care who you were as long as you could fix the problem. so i grab the computer i need, write a quick note to the user w/ my contact info, letting them know i had taken it. my colleague and i are walking back to the office when a woman yells out to us both. (i used mary in one of my previous posts, so lets call her that) &gt;mary: “excuse me!? are you with it?” &gt;me: “yes, we both are” &gt;mary: “whats your names?” (she grabs a pen and paper and starts briskly walking towards us) &gt;me: “i’m imthejason” &gt;colleague: “i’m hiscolleague” mary looks up very annoyed &gt;mary: “last names!” &gt;me: “uhhh….what?” &gt;mary: “are you both students here?!” &gt;us: “yes……” (note: you have to be a student to work as a “student it consultant”) mary yells out to another staff member next door to come over to her. &gt;mary: “does this look like the guy?” mary points right at me as her friend stares through my soul &gt;mary’s friend: “yeah that’s him from the video!!” so i’m just standing there, holding a computer with the dumbest look on my face wondering what is going on &gt;mary’s friend: “hang on i’ll call the police” &gt;me: “wait what!?!! what is going on!?” mary friend rushes back to her office to call them &gt;mary: “somebody stole our printer computer and my friend says you look like the guy who stole it! campus police is coming here and they have you on video doing it!” (imagine a lot of finger pointing while mary is saying this) (initiate deep breath) &gt;me: “yes...i did take the computer earlier because it is broken. there is an open ticket for it. it’s sitting in the it office being repaired…” &gt;mary: “no!! you are lying! campus police checked with your supervisor in the it department and there is no ticket open for that computer!!” at this point i’m getting very irritated. mostly because this csi-miami-watching-lady is riding on her high horse thinking she just solved the universities biggest crime story of the year &gt;me: “look i can confirm this ticket does exist, let me call my boss” i get him on the phone &gt;me: “boss, did campus security call you about a computer that was stolen earlier today?” &gt;boss: “yeah, there was one stolen that serviced the main printer…” &gt;me: “no, there is an open ticket for that, look at my assigned tickets, the last one” &gt;boss: “oh! yeah i guess there is one. well, i better call campus police about that” &gt;me: “10-4, thanks boss” i look back over to her with the best shit-eating grin i can muster. without missing a step, she starts to lecture me on wearing my work uniform. (now imagine of the most irritated old lady / mad-at-the-world / old-witch sounding voice you can, and that is what she sounded like) &gt;mary: “if you had worn your work vest while you grabbed the machine earlier, this could have been avoided!” &gt;me: “well i’m not sure how you missed it, but the video (in the most sarcastic voice imaginable) “clearly" shows me in my “vest" with my “nametag" on it. maybe if you had watched the video more closely, you would have noticed it and not wasted my time, my bosses time, and the police departments time! i'd like to blame this on oversight, but in the end, no matter which way i cut it, i still feel like a moron. i bet the tech support gentleman is having a good laugh at my expense. so i come home after a long-ass overnight shift at work and plop my tired ass onto the computer chair. weird, skype's not online. in fact, nothing was. it only felt right to do the usual 'turn-off, turn-on, plug, un-plug' ritual. still nothing. "shit, probably because i'm a month behind on paying the bill." so, naturally, i call up the company, pay the bill and have a chat with tech support. apparently not having an online light on your router at all doesn't exactly mean a disconnect - and i fancy myself knowing a little about computers, pft, please - apparently i needed to do a little troubleshooting. this confused me, as i already was pretty sure i did just that. the man over the phone asks if i have a router, as what i described sounded like an ethernet issue. then it hit me. it's been getting cold as shit lately, and i was looking for a socket for a personal heater earlier today before work. i unplugged what resembled a phone charger that was plugged in behind my desk - next to all my computer shit. i haven't a clue why it didn't click in my head at first. "sir, i'm incredibly sorry for wasting your time. i just realized i didn't even have it plugged in."so my friend is a manager at a hosting company which offers basic web hosting, vps and dedicated servers. this one woman bought a 1200 dollar a month server (with 256gb ram and so on) and paid for a whole year in advance. as you may or may not know, dedicated servers offer only the hardware, nothing is done to the host itself. when clients spend so much money, when they call in, they go straight through to a manager. so one day the client, let's call her pillock of the underworld (potu) called in, reaches my friend and was frantic. friend: hello, this is generic hosting company, how can i assist you today? potu: hello? i bought a server from you guys a few days ago and on your website you claimed 2 hour set up but it isn't online yet. friend: no problem, let me check it out for you. so friend checks their crm and find the server is, in fact, up and running. so he goes back on the line. potu: that can't be. i'm going to &lt;insert pottery company name website here&gt;.com and it isn't working. friend: i'm sorry m'am, but you do realise that buying a dedicated server means you get only the host, and nothing on it right? so no website will be created for you. potu: but i filled in the box for what you want the server for (mind you this is just a questionnaire box for customers to fill in optionally) and said it was for my pottery company. friend: that box is only to get feedback from our clients. i'm sorry m'am, you'll have to hire a web developer for that. potu: you don't know what you're doing, i'm going to the bank to cancel the transaction. fuck you, sir, fuck you. friend: m'am, wait... *click* she did, in fact, get the transaction reversed under the claim that the company is fraud and got my friend into a lengthy, expensive investigation. tldr: woman buys metal, expects human baby to be created. not sure if this is the right place for this (so feel free to remove if so, mods). as some background i'm essentially the it guy for my department. i was filled in on a phone call just now. guy who frequently comes into the office but i have no interaction with (let's call him mr analogue) was trying to explain to someone that he'd left something by my desk. &gt;**mr analogue**: i left that box by..that guy's desk &gt;**colleague**: which guy? &gt;**mr analogue**: you know, that **digital** man who sits in the corner. from now on i'm going to insist everyone calls me digital-man™ i actually get the feeling that he doesn't like me considering that my job is slowly making him obsolete. so maybe he sees me as his arch-nemesis. hang on.. am i the baddie? feel free to send fan-fics and illustrations. **edit**: guys it's actually happening. someone in the office just called me digital-man™! **edit 2**: digital-man™ is loving the fan-fics and illustrations! may the great codec bestow great knowledge upon you.[previous]( cif/jif = cleaning product ________ why do tickets always come? don’t people get bored of writing them. i stared down at my computer. new ticket &gt; hey, i need to borrow a mac tomorrow. preferably a laptop. thanks. -marketing lady i took a sip of my coffee. doesn’t sound to hard. as i dreamt about who’d think we’d lend out desktops to users, i was interrupted by color-blind. &gt;color-blind: hey, marketing lady is here. i think you just got a ticket from her. &gt;me: i’m on it. i got up from my desk picked up coffee and walked out to the it area. &gt;me: err… hey marketing lady. &gt;marl: so i need that laptop now. &gt;me: didn’t the email say tomorrow? &gt;marl: i sent that yesterday. i looked down at coffee. i could smell a lie. &gt;me: okay…. i’ll go see what we’ve got in stock now. i looked down at the macintosh’s we had for borrowing. white polycarbonate. &gt;me: here you go. &gt;marl: oh my! its so white and smooth. &gt;me: have fun. i went back to my coffee drinking. _________________ *two hours later.* marketing lady walks back into the office. she doesn’t look happy. &gt;marl: this computer isn’t working. i walked out of my office to come help her. she handed me the laptop. &gt;me: what the…. why is this laptop so slippery. &gt;marl: errr… no idea. i looked down at my coffee again. it smell like lies again! &gt;me: why does it smell terrible? &gt;marl: the vp told me to come get another one… we’re in the middle of a presentation so… can i get another one now? &gt;me: no? the phone rang, it was the vp. &gt;vp: hey airz… sorry about the laptop. can you send marketing lady back up to us? &gt;me: what… happened to the laptop? &gt;vp: haven’t you seen it yet? i looked down at the slippery laptop in my hand. &gt;me: nope. &gt;vp: oh well, nothing too bad. just my pen leaked and i got a blotch on the laptop... &gt;me: so its a blotch of ink? i stared down at the slimy laptop between my fingers &gt;vp: don’t worry airz, i got some milk and cif and cleaned it right off. i don’t think it’ll stain. &gt;me: sorry… milk? &gt;vp: haha yep, white cleaning fluid… worst the could happen.. white stain right? &gt;me: and after you cleaned it, you tried turning it on? &gt;vp: oh god no. it needs drying out. thats why the battery is pulled out. we just need a dry laptop. i looked down at the laptop in my hand. &gt;me: how much…milk and cif did you use? &gt;vp: well if you’re going to clean off a stain, might as well give the whole thing a wipe down right? --------------------- that was the birth of the smelly loaner laptop from hell. [next](so, this just happened. i am eagerly anticipating the response, however i feel compelled to share what has happened so far. back story: a couple weeks ago i was contacted by a friend of an acquaintance of mine who runs a very small business and wants to set up a web site where potential clients can see services, prices, contact information, etc. now, i am a 4th year mechatronic eng student, so although web site design is not my forte - i do have a functional understanding of php/javascript/html and it is semester break so i agree to set this up. i go to meet her, she shows me some drawings of what she wants the site to look like and we agree on a price ($150 pretty sure that is a good deal) $50 to be payed now and $100 upon completion. fast forward to last friday. i'm all finished, website comes online - i call the client and tell her its all up and running, she checks it out, loves it, its exactly what she wants. i give her my account number for her to transfer my payment, she thanks me and the call ends. now this morning (one week later) - payment is still not in so i send an email to see whats going on. the reply: &gt;i have not yet transferred funds. and dont hold your breath. i signed no written agreement and you have no proof that i aggreed to provide payment. let this be a lesson to you. &gt; thanks for the web site. really? took me a couple minutes to process what i had just read. i should be mad - but i'm not. armed with a cheeky grin, a chuckle and putty i ssh in: scp -r /var/www hez@&lt;my servers ip&gt;:/home/hez/company_name rm -rv /var/www/* on out first meeting she said she was getting business cards made up with the web site on it. hopefully she doesn't notice for a while and hands out these cards that point nowhere :p she seems like the kind of person that really wouldn't check. you know - the mentality of once its there its there for good. if she doesn't get back to me in like a week i might redirect somewhere ... inappropriate. tl;dr: pay me by the way, i do expect to be hit by all the reddit flak get it in writing. well i will save you the trouble. i'm an idiot, i know - its all that has been drilled into me for the last 4 years so i should know better. but she seemed so nice i really wasn't expecting it :/ that and i'm really not too bothered, i have been wanting to find an excuse to build a web page just to refresh my knowledge. ________ **update:** so interesting morning. 9am i just received a call, quoting the call verbatim would mostly consist of [expletive deleted] for sfw reasons. but the gist: her: your useless, the site is down already. lucky i didn't pay you i want my deposit back! me: i'm sorry but the site you saw was just a demo site to get your approval. i took it down and it will remain down until i receive payment. *i was going to say until i receive full payment of the $200 that we agreed upon. but that's kind of extortion, she can sink to the level of changing the deal but i'd prefer to take the high road.* her: [some horrible language that i don't have the patience to listen to] i'm paying you this monthly charge to keep the site up now put it back up. me: i'm sorry but that monthly charge is for the web server which hosts the site. i used a billboard analogy, where you pay for the billboard for a period of time, but its up to you what you want to put on there. i think she got it. in hindsight, most billboard companies probably put up the add all in one package deal... but most analogies fail bearing close examination. me: and even if that money was coming to me -*click* a short time later i receive an email: &gt;what is the login to the account that i am paying for?? you dont have the right to keep that from me becaus i am paying it &gt;my son is doing computing at tafe and he copied the site before you took it down so he can rebuild it so there. at this point, i'm thinking whatever - i have had enough. i am compiling a credential inclusive smart-ass reply about how there is no way he has the server-side scripts that give most of the functionality, when i get another call. this time from her son. he is so much more irate, however i really can't hold that against him. i'm sure that he has heard a biased version of the story and i can sympathize. cross my mum and i will rip your head off and leave you in a shallow grave. again, summary of the call. too many [expletive deleted] be readable: him: how dare you refuse to give us the access to a payed account, i should ----ing come over there and kick your ----ng ass you ----! me: wow, settle down i was just replying to the email with all the credentials you need to access the server. she didn't pay me so i took the site down and it will stay that way. him: i do this stuff for a living i am the top of my python class you think you can keep the site down well i have news for you i copied the source before you took it down so i can just put it straight back on there i win ----er! (note i used no punctuation in that sentence, because he didn't. i could picture him turning blue on the other end of the line, also add about 20 expletives in there to get an idea of how long he was talking) me: look you do what you want i don't care, i will send you the credentials and i don't want to hear from you again. all emails will be forwarded to trash and please loose my number.*click* ssh into root account... rm -f /usr/bin/sudo rm -f /bin/su find /bin -not -name "cd" -not -name "ls" -not -name "mount" -not -name "chmod" -type f -exec chmod 000 {} ;\ chmod 000 /bin/chmod passwd -l root petty. yes. unprofessional. yes. but in the heat of the moment, and after hearing what he intends to do (or thinks he can do), there is no professionalism left in this deal. they can call the provider and have the os re-installed after they figure out whats wrong. they can even choose something easier than debian, you know with one of those things ... desktops i think they are called. and compile the email: &gt;username: admin &gt;password: admin &gt;i have forwarded further emails from you to the bin folder. i do not have a call blocking feature on my phone, but i can install one with ease. don't make me. &gt;goodluck. goodbye. and that's it. will it be the end of the story? i hope so. **notes:** no, the password is not really admin. for those who don't know what the commands do. the two commands su and sudo allow non root accounts to run commands as root (the highest admin). the first two lines remove these from the system. (yes i could have done this more elegantly by changing sudoers, but meh) the third command finds all files in the /bin directory aside from cd (for changing directories) and ls (for viewing contents of a directory) and mount (for mounting drives) and then execute the command chmod 000 on each file. this removes all read, write, execute permissions - making them inaccessible. (maybe an expert can tell me, if i chmod 000ed mount, would that cause boot issues?). and the /bin directory, well lets just say the stuff in there is important. the fourth command removes all permissions from the chmod command itself. permissions are gone and aren't coming back :) finally, passwd -l root deactivates the root account. which itself is good practice, in fact the only reason it was activated in the first place is so i could log into it and run these commands. **addendum** i get so many comments saying why are you building websites for $150 well the answer is because its not my business, i wasn't out to make a profit. someone contacted me and wanted some help building a a site. i have the skills at my disposal along with some spare time so i agreed. i was in it to learn and help someone out. it was my intention to refresh my memory and get some experience in a skill remotely relating to my future profession, because let be honest - its a very useful skill to have. as a skint student i just quoted twice my weekly budget. seems fair to me we are both benefiting. turns out i learnt another valuable lesson. cant complain, i got experience in what i planned to and some bonus experience. its like when you finish a quest on some game and the reward is some experience, a little money and a mystery treasure chest that when you open, contains a little bit more experience crystals. *reddit*: umad? *me*: nogiven it's early/late and i can't sleep, this tale seems appropriate. i routinely submit stories that highlight the benefits of the strong union at my telco, and i figure it's time to post one where the work contract might be a bit more controversial. it happened a few months ago. phone rang at 3am. everyone should be asleep but i'm not. i have a sleep issue - a good night for me is about four hours - might seem shocking, but i actually function just fine on that much. as a result, i'm often already up - or still up - at 3am, as i was on that night. &gt; networks' boss: "bytewave? sorry to bug you so late but you're the guy with most seniority who voluntarily approved 24hr overtime for emergencies according to the list and..." &gt; bytewave: "yeah, sure. don't apologize. i did and i was up, plus you know the work contract terms. this call ends with me getting paid five hours at twice my hourly rate even if it lasts five minutes - you're making my night. what's up?" &gt; networks' boss: "switchboard issue. charlie and delta been down for 75 minutes, and even at night that's a problem, the landline queue is red and... &gt; bytewave: "wait, switchboards?! the hell that has to do with me? switchboards are union too, i can't do their job without breaching the work contract, you were supposed to call them fir..." &gt; networks' boss: "i know! the night guy there called in sick, so we called all his colleagues who volunteered for nighttime overtime like you... nobody answered. my guys can't do anything and i figured since senior staff works with switchboards that much and you have access to some tools..." hell of a stretch, i have little experience troubleshooting switchboard issues on my own, even though i work daily with that team... &gt; bytewave: "sure, if you called every volunteer and got no contact it's okay to call down based on the emergency overtime protocols. but while i'll do my best for the next five hours as per the wc, i have zero access to the tools nor much relevant experien..." &gt; networks' boss: "i know you don't! but i can't call anyone else at switchboards - they have to be on the volunteer list, otherwise i can't even offer overtime between 10pm and 7:30am." oh. the guy isn't clueless. he actually figured out the work contract faster that i did, i must have been a bit drowsy! i blushed a bit - it was late, and i didn't expect a manager to get the subtleties without getting hr involved... anyhow, he did the right thing. &gt; bytewave: "... okay, just got it. this call being now recorded, i have your word that emergency overtime protocols will apply to anyone i can get you?" &gt; networks' boss: "yes, obviously... if you can get me one of switchboards' guys i can't call... i'm not just paying your five hours, we're having lunch tomorrow on me..." this is why you want to be on the emergency list - assuming you also don't really get to sleep at night, anyhow. i send a mass text to my contacts at switchboards first, and once that fails, i call my best contact over there. &gt; rodriguez: "zzzz.... da fuck?! it's like 4am, who is this?!" &gt; bytewave: "bytewave. got an hour's work that's going to pay off more than a day's, and i knew you could use the cash. i'll wait if you need some coffee first..." he didn't. he was thrilled - that's the only thing i actually did there; calling the guy who i knew would be all over this even if he hadn't signed off on nighttime ot. once i explained... &gt; rodriguez: "damn. i should sign up for the emergency list. logging in my telework station now ... should be able to fix this quick..." &gt; bytewave: "some people need to sleep at night, but i figured ten hours worth of pay wasn't something you'd pass up, haha. i'll tell networks' manager that you're on it... and that you're having lunch with us tomorrow on his dime. least he can do." [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](work in broadband tech support and a lot of people think we're there to fix their pc. had an old boy on the phone telling me his pc wasn't working. generally i will listen to their problem and offer some advice but tell them there isn't much else i can do due to my support scope. anyway his pc wasn't turning on and he was taking me through the steps he's already taken to try sort it. unplugging, checking cables etc. he them told me that he tried taking the ram out and spraying the contacts with wd40... so that was new.i work for a managed hosting company in the uk, but we work across multiple regions. that's not the focus of the story, however. so within $company, we have a prize. a medal. a badge of honour, as such. it's...a rubber chicken. a bit strange really. i've been part of the company since mid november and am still learning how to do the job(my first job in the industry), along with the weird ceremonies and traditions that come with every workplace. i learned the provenance of the chicken today. $company provides a managed hosting service where we install a rack into your building. customers are then ordered not to touch it, or face the wrath of a void warranty. as we don't go out to the customer site to troubleshoot unless we really have to, we can't tell if the customer has opened the rack or not. not for maybe months on end anyway. what we do (or maybe did), is place a 4" rubber chicken in the rack, strapped to the door. if a customer were to open the rack, a rather confused call to the service desk asking why that particular piece of hardware had been installed would follow. $company used a rubber chicken as a warranty test. the rubber chicken is now a sign of intelligence, integrity, respect, perseverance and humour in a sometimes stressful workplace. and i won one. edit: a lot of people telling me better ways to test for an opened rack. the chicken was discontinued as a reliable source a couple years ago. it was only ever used as an inside joke, as it were. edit 2: to win said chicken, i demonstrated one of the principles above and was recognised by the manglement. one of my contracts (that still brings me nightmares) was at a food production factory. long story short, but i went from new guy to it manager literally overnight. i remember this incident clearly. &gt;ticket: cannot log on to new computer in production area 5. there was the usual blurb about some error messages and how it was working the other day and that it's of the utmost importance (they always are). i send the tech over to the computer and he calls me back after half an hour. &gt;tech: there's something seriously wrong here. i can't log on to it using my domain account on either socket. my laptop won't connect either, but both sockets are patched. i've tried my laptop on a different socket and it works there. &gt;me: can't be the connection as the cable only went in yesterday and it's certified. &gt;tech: can you come and have a look? i don't know anything about cabling. me&gt; i'm on my way. i walked over with my cabling tools and a couple of screwdrivers, and took the socket apart. despite a wiring diagram on the back of the socket, there was not one of the 8 wires in the right place. i re-wired it correctly then headed for the cabinet. in the cabinet room, i found the socket on the patch panel, and checked that. it too was incorrectly wired despite a detailed diagram. i wired that up correctly too and called back the tech. &gt;me: try that computer now. &gt;tech: *after a minute or so* that's better, we have a connection. i've just seen the cabling guys - do you want me to send them to you? &gt;me: yes please. i'm in the cabinet room, send them down here. five minutes later, two young lads arrived in the small room where the network cabinet had been located. &gt;me: i've just had to re-wire a port completely as both ends were incorrectly wired. &gt;cable guy 1: well, we wired it to the standards, so i don't understand why. &gt;me: each socket has a map on the back of it that tells you where each wire goes. how did you not read that? &gt;cable guy 2: those aren't the current standards. they're wrong. &gt;me: i don't have time to disagree with you, so here's what you're going to do. all of the data points that you've put in, need to be re-inspected and terminated according to the little map on the back of the socket and the patch panel. if you can't or won't do that, then i'll find a contractor who can. &gt;cable guy 1: so these are data points and not phone sockets? &gt;me: ... do they **look** like phone sockets? &gt;cable guy 1: well no, but... &gt;me: just get it done how i said please.you do this stuff for long enough, you run into situations like this one i dealt with friday and today. i'm an it consultant. that means i'm good with computers. how good? well, for instance, i installed a phone recently in just under four hours. how did i do it so quickly? so glad you asked. here is my tale of woe. unbox two new follycom speakerphones. hook them up. they get an ip. web interface comes up. look up default password and enter it. it does not work. try the default sip password for this environment in case it pulled itself a config somehow. does not work. try previous firmware version default passwords. does not work. try accessing the advanced config of the phone directly rather than through web interface, does not work. hook up second phone with the included poe injector so it wont connect to the network. attempt to log in with default password. does not work. no other random hail mary passwords work. look up password reset procedure, which suggests two different 4-key combinations to hold during boot to initiate reset. try to find out which combo one applies to this phone. one person says combo a. try combo a. get to a screen that reads 'reset phone configuration' and asks for password, which should be the mac address of the phone. this phone has a 9 key numberpad, so to enter letters you need to tap the numbers multiple times to cycle through the letters, like an old flip phone. best part is that for security the characters are shown as asterisks, so you are cycling through the letters but cannot see them. manual says to enter the letters in lowercase, not capital. finish entering mac address. 'invalid password'. get frustrated and leave for the day. return today. notice there is an additional follycom phone speakerphone installed previously that is working normally (this is unusual because the other phones here are a different brand). look at its configuration. it is apparently accessing a completely different config server than the one used at this location. no one knows who set it up. become very confused. attempt to log into this phone with the default password. does not work. try sip password, does not work. try sip username and password, does not work. try multiple combinations of the above. does not work. attempt to login to the config server it is apparently connecting to. invalid password. no idea what the correct one is. partner in crime shows up. finds a completely random phone password somewhere on the server that neither of us have heard of, which matches a sticker i never noticed on the back of the phone. log into this phone successfully and change the password. still cannot log into the new phones. try the other key combination (combo b) that was suggested during boot to see what it does. end up at a different looking screen that also says 'reset configuration' and prompts for password. enter mac address. it neither accepts nor rejects the password, just goes to the main menu. attempt to log in to advanced config on the phone. does not work. attempt to log in with mac address. does not work. provision a sip extension associated with the mac address of this phone and restart it. try logging in with sip password. does not work. not really surprised, because i wasn't able to configure it to point it to the sip server. find random blog dude online that drove himself nuts because of this exact problem on this exact phone. see that he mentions that it only reset for him when he did the configuration reset with capital letters when entering the mac address, even though (as he reminds the reader) all follycom documentation indicates that it should be done with lowercase letters. reboot the phone holding combo b again and enter the mac address with capital letters. still no acceptance or rejection of the password. try to log in with web interface. invalid password. partner in crime points out that a commenter on aforementioned random blog said that the reset keypad combo only worked for him when he pressed the cancel button halfway through boot process of the phone, then held down the combo during the 10 second countdown shown before it auto-reboots. begin performing this procedure but the auto reboot has already begun when partner in crime finishes explaining it. restart the phone. press cancel halfway. hold down key combo a this time. enter mac address in the interface using capital letters when prompted, not lowercase. accepts password. phone reboots. enter default admin password in web interface. password is accepted. wife picks me up. asks me what i did at work today. have no idea how to respond.another story from my magical job at that now closed dial-up company. ***** i had been at the company now for a year and a half or so (was there slightly over 2 years) and had become good friends with some of our 'regulars' - aka repeat callers. if you have ever worked at a small company and have regulars, you know how it goes. you see their phone number on the caller id and you know who it is and what the problem is before picking up the receiver. some of the regulars were not so nice and were not friends - they were more like enemies to be treated politely so as to get them off the phone as fast as possible with as little stress as possible. one of these repeat enemies - errrr... callers - claimed to be a professor at a local college in it's engineering department and all the time talked about the 'boost in spending' after it got paired with a much larger college near the northern panhandle (if you are from wv, you already know which college it is). he was very snooty, and because he was so smart, had a "doctorate", and taught a 'real discipline', not a 'fake industry like it', that he was better than me and all the other techs. you could hear the disdain in his voice everytime he called. you could tell he thought we were beneath him, and should service his every whim. well, after dealing with him for months, and his disdain over everything - even calling me a liar when i explained to him how noise on the phoneline interfered with the signal - i finally got the "shocker" of a call from him. as an explanation of the "lie" about noise on the lines - being an "engineer", he was too smart to fall for the lies of interference and instead kept telling me how noise on the line wasn't possible because it was against electrical physics properties or some such thing. anyway, he calls in one day, and claims to have a bought a new computer and wants us to walk him through setting up the connection - aka "the only useful damn thing you retards can do". that is an exact quote from that call. after doing the usual steps, and being ready to get him off the phone, i tell him he will have to hang up to then dial-in and try the service. but wait my friends, he is an engineer! he thought ahead! he was on his brand new portable mobility enhancement device! crying inwardly, i went into robot mode and waited as he tried to dial up. 1x. 2x. 3x. by the 4th attempt, it was obvious he was getting no dial-tone. i asked him to double check to make sure the phone cord was connected at the wall and at the computer. he got mad and cussed at me, but then 'confirmed' it was. i even had him unplug/replug both ends until he heard the 'click' just to make sure it was firmly seated. after he tried again, still no dial-tone, i concluded his pc had a bad modem from the factory (it happens, modems were throw-away devices and had terrible failure rates) and as i was starting to suggest this, he cut me off, and stated the following gem of wisdom: ***** "i don't need a modem. this new pc has a universal serial bus port. i just flattened the end of the phone line with a pair of pliers and jammed it into that port. it is universal, so that means it will fit and use anything!" ***** i was stunned. beyond stunned. he was a self proclaimed "engineer and useful member of society" and i was a "useless it retard". yet to hear him admit to purposely mangling and misusing a phone jack and usb port (i have no idea how he fit it in there, even squished with a pair of pliers) just floored me. at this point, i just started laughing. it was all i could do. i laughed hard and long. the more he got mad and yelled and cussed at me, the more i laughed. after a few minutes, i calmed down enough to tell him to take his brand new computer to his it department on campus and have them explain to him why what he did wouldn't work. later that month, he sent a 'strongly worded' letter to us asking us to disconnect him from the service because our dial-up did not work with universal sandwiches - yes, a direct quote from his letter. ***** tl;dr - usb will work with anything, even if it doesn't fit. ***** edit 4 - to the detractors: i can't count that high, so i can't keep track of the upvotes. for everyone else - thank you for the hilarious stories that are similar to this one.so, i volunteer at the local senior center computer lab. today, a lady came in, asking for help with her new cell phone. she says that she can call people just fine, but when other people call her, it doesn't come through. first step is obviously to verify the problem-- i ask her what her cell phone number is, and then call it from my own cell phone. sure enough, her phone doesn't ring, vibrate, or in any way indicate that there's a problem. second step is to make sure that i have the right number, so i call my own cell phone from hers. a different number pops up, which i show her. "$lady: oh, that's my cell phone number!" "$me: then what number was i just calling?" "$lady: my home phone number. do i need to give people my cell phone number instead?" "$me: ...yes, your cell phone uses your cell phone number."promotions to technical support senior staff at my telco (my job) requires both a certain seniority and the ability to pass 5 different exams. each of them is overkill and you need 75% on each, precisely to reduce the impact of seniority in the process. we want to make sure every employee in the department has broad skills. i sometimes grade these exams, but not always. besides that, potentials are normally offered to do the job temporarily - at reduced pay sadly, a kink in the work contract. officially it's so they can get a feel for the job and make sure it suits them, unofficially it's so the rest of the team makes sure they're a good fit. that day there's a prospect named justin sitting right next to me and i'm eavesdropping on his calls a bit. obviously i'm only hearing one side of the conversation, i'm not tapped into his line. &gt; justin: "no, no, he tested with two different computers, there's no way we're telling the customer to see a computer technician until we confirmed the problem is not on our end. that happens way too much, i won't ok it. if need be, we'll send a road tech with a clean laptop to replicate." ... &gt; justin: "no, it's not bull. use the diag tools. three levels down under internet you'll find a logging tool more people should use. yeah, that one. everytime a new mac is plugged in we have records. customers can't lie about their tests. there's three in the last hour in his log, just like he said, his router and two separate computers plugged in straight. none of the three was granted a valid public ip." ... &gt; justin: "no, that's just not possible. these are network logs, entirely on our end. the only way i could see what i'm looking at and the data's wrong is if the customer spoofed macs. but that's not the case because the data usage logging tool shows his issue is real. look at the history over 72 hours, we don't even have handshakes from the modem. i'll edit your ticket and escalate to networks - you need to tell the customer there's a real problem on our end." ... &gt; justin: "yes, i know you already told him it was on his end, but you were wrong. mistakes happen, but it's no reason to just send him into a dead end. humility is part of the job description. i'm also putting him on the recall list, he'll have a follow up about this soon." i was pretty impressed, new guys typically roll over or fail to counter properly in cases like this where their frontline tech is clearly pushing them to a course of action, often to avoid losing face. he stood up like the best of us do, understood every aspect of the problem, explained why thoroughly, taught his agent about tools he should have used, and was more diplomatic than i would have been about the whole thing. i wanted him in. i waited till his ticket was escalated to networks. the problem was related to the [pmd]( and they solved it in short order. the customer had been offline for nearly three days and it was his third call to technical support. so i went to see the guy in charge of grading justin's exams to ask how well he did. &gt; stephan: "eh, not so bad but he failed one. 72% on hardlines. did rate over 90% on internet and mobile." that means he can't have the job. gotta have 75% on all five. &gt; bytewave: "turned in to management and the union already?" &gt; stephan: "no." &gt; bytewave: "grade it again." &gt; stephan: "i do like him too. you sure?" &gt; bytewave: "yes." justin is the newest employee promoted to tsss. looks like he actually got 77% on hardlines. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](the year was 1992 and the details are a little fuzzy. but i walked into the math office at the college i was attending, and their student employee was screaming at the computer, which was beeping back at her. what i eventually determined was this: she was using word perfect. word perfect honored "type-ahead", where you could type keys while the computer was busy, and it would hold them for you and apply them when it was ready. she had gotten herself into some corner and couldn't get out of it. she hit the escape key. the escape key beeped and printed some kind of error message on the screen ("delete something you typed" or something like that) for one second. she did not read the message and hit esc. beep (one second). esc esc esc esc esc beep (one second) beep (one second) esc esc esc esc esc beep (one second) beep (one second) esc esc esc esc esc beep (one second) beep (one second) me: (having read the error message) "can you please stop doing that?" her: "but i need it to stop!" esc esc esc esc esc beep (one second) beep (one second) me: "can you please just stop so i can look at the computer?" her: "but i need it to stop!" esc esc esc esc esc beep (one second) beep (one second) esc esc esc esc esc beep (one second) beep (one second) i walked out. the secretary asked if i fixed it because the beeping is driving her crazy. i told the secretary that if the girl would just stop hitting esc, then sooner or later, it will stop beeping, then she should read the error message and do what it says. but, i told her, i can't get her to stop hitting esc. i wished her good luck and went on my way.[previous]( redcheer, our new tech sat next to me as i picked up the first call of the day. it was the head of accounting. &gt;headac: how do you delete stuff? &gt;me: redcheer, you can take the lead on this call. redcheer looked excited at her first call. &gt;redcheer: okay, just click what you want, then drop it in the trash bin. &gt;headac: i know that. i mean, delete *permanently*. redcheer looked confused. she continued on regardless. &gt;redcheer: right click the trash bin, then empty the trash. it’ll be gone. &gt;headac: no. i mean permanently. i smiled as i realized this was perfect first call for a tech. i took a sip of coffee and sat back in my chair waiting to see how the call pans out. &gt;redcheer: if you do that, it’ll be gone. forever. never to be seen again. &gt;headac: i need to make sure it can never be retrieved. odd i thought, accounts hate things being deleted normally. &gt;redcheer: err… yeah, no one will retrieve it. i think…. &gt;headac: oh god, are you **sure** of anything? listen airz… are you still there? i mumbled yes, as i saw a look of annoyance and anger(?) settling over redcheers face. &gt;headac: can you come up and take a look. please. i agreed to accounts request mostly because i was curious, what type of file did they want to delete? it wasn’t until the stairs that redcheer started talking again, i hadn’t even realized she was following me up to accounting. &gt;redcheer: i learnt a bunch of tech words over the weekend. so, can i take the lead again?… i think i can do this. i looked down and saw a fire in her eyes. &gt;me: ummm okay. getting to the head accountant’s office i was met with a smile, however when the head accountant saw redcheer his face went into frown. redcheer looked down at the computer in front of her. &gt;redcheer: which file needs deleting? the head of accounts selected out the file, i took a look at the file name “**capital expenditure, department fund 2 - year xxxx**” redcheer took the file and dragged it into the bin, then cleared the bin. &gt;headac: no, no i looked online and i found a whole bunch of things saying, you can retrieve files that are deleted like that. they told me i had to write over the file at least 10 times to be safe or something. &gt;redcheer: nope. its gone. wave goodbye. i smirked at the attitude, but the head accountant was technically right… &gt;headac: look, i’ll show you it can come back. the head accountant then opened a recovery program to retrieve the file. before it could complete he continued. &gt;headac: see, it’ll get the file back! i tried to delete it using **lots of tools**, but it always comes back. i had a sinking feeling. “lots of tools” is always a bad expression. &gt;me: what… er… tools specifically? redcheer looked annoyed i was taking over her call again. i however was too busy looking down at the mess of a start bar. 10’s of recovery tools, 100’s of “deletion” tools. &gt;me: please… tell me you didn’t disable the firewall to install all that. &gt;headac: err. &gt;redcheer: don’t worry airz, i got this. redcheer turned the head of accounting to face her. she looked him dead in the eyes. &gt;redcheer: are you insane?! do you know what a worm is? head of accounting looked scared. he shook his head. redcheer was almost shouting at his face. &gt;redcheer: or a malwares? or a hijacking? have you ever thought what could happen with one compromised pc on the network? you could infect everything! now we’re gotta take this pc away. we’re gonna have to wipe it. do you know how much work you’ve just created for us? security reviews, flushing the network, port tracing, shaking out the ip’s, downloading the patch fixes for the switching….. at this point i was fairly sure she was just rambling. i decided the utterly white faced head of accounting probably had enough. &gt;me: okay, thats enough. we’re gonna have to take your pc and scrub it. the head of accounting flopped down on his desk, looked scared. redcheer’s demeanor went back from scary to nice almost instantly. she started packing up his computer for transport, turning off the recovery program. &gt;redcheer: oh, i almost forgot. she smiled down sweetly at the head of accounting. who looked up at her in disbelief. &gt;redcheer: will you need a loaner pc, while we’re fixing this one? &gt;headac: no! no, not if its more work for you. i think i’ve caused enough trouble with the.. tracing of ip’s for patches… or … whatever. redcheer smiled as she left with the tower. i looked down at the visibly shaken head of accounting. &gt;headac: airz, is that your new tech? &gt;me: yeah… &gt;headac: send her up again for all accounting calls. she knows her stuff. ?! [next]( ***** please check out a comic of the first story [here]( :)so, i am here, casually at college, fixing computers, when i receive an alarming call from my friend. "my dad installed windows 10, and my computer is now stuck in a reboot loop!" i immediately knew what this referred to. the old drivers from windows 7 clashed with windows 10. once i had done my computer repairs, i drove to my friend's place. (it's a free service at the college that i am a student at. computer tech students (like me) fix people's computers for free.) so, i started by confirming that the issue is real. it was, so i pulled out my linux thumb drive from my pocket and plugged it in. booted into linux. we then asked his dad if he wanted to save any data that may exist on the computer. he didn't want to, so we continued with formatting the ssd windows 10 was on. we had just finished formatting, when his dad comes and sees linux on the screen. (his dad is a linux-hater.) he promptly unplugs the computer and puts it in his garage. &gt;"don't you &amp;¤%#ing put linux on my son's computer!" i continue explaining the situation, and he ends up kicking me off of the property, and confiscating his computer for a week. and then he starts blaming my friend for breaking the computer even worse. tl;dr i was in the process of fixing friend's computer, friend's dad got angry seeing linux, aborted the reinstallation of win10 and blamed my friend for the computer not having a os. update: i am currently at his place, fixing the computer and finishing my job up. the linux usb drive was still attached (thank god). it's installing windows 10. update 2: the adventure is over. everything works as intended, and i did not end up getting shotgun pellets up my ass. i managed to leave about 3 minutes before his dad came home!hey guys, long time lurker &amp; first time poster here! so i work at a standard $isp and i answer to techsupport calls directly from customers. so this customer calls in because her tv is black and says "no signal", which is usually a clear sign that the tv has the wrong source selected. so i'm trying to guide her to change source. i'm $siv and she will be $cm &gt;$siv: can you try switching source on your tv to hdmi 1? &gt;$cm: i don't have anything named hdmi 1. &gt;$siv: alright, how many hdmi ports does your tv have? &gt;$cm: it doesn't have any hdmi ports at all. &gt;$siv: uh, okey. do you use scart? &gt;$cm: no. i don't use any of that. i use something called hdm12 (hdm-twelve). have you guys never heard of that? *deep, deep sigh.* &gt;$siv: right... can you switch over to hdm11 (hdm-eleven) for me then? &gt;$cm: oh, now it works. thanks! *click* i just don't get customers sometimes. edit: apparently i can't spell customer.that's it, guys. i just got "the call". the one we all dread. the worst part, by far, is that i work in a place of higher education, and this call was from a professor. i work at a state university in video conferencing. being such a large state, and so removed from the rest of the country, we rely heavily on distance education. i get a call from the help desk, they have a customer who is experiencing problems in one of our rooms. they transfer him to me. the instructor tells me that the monitor says "no signal". after determining that he was talking about the *computer* monitor, and not the television used for his video conference, i figure it has to be a cable problem. people can't possibly forget to turn their computer on. that's just something that happens in movies and tv, right? well... &gt; me: "okay, so the first thing i have to ask, is the computer powered on?" &gt; &gt; instructor: "well, i would assume so! i've never had to power it on or off before." oh god. please. &gt; me: "okay, can we try pressing the power button on the computer?" his next line? &gt; instructor: "where is it? all i see is a little box that says 'intel'..." this man is teaching the next generation of great thinkers. *edit: holy crap, 1st on page! you all rock! not bad for my first reddit post...*first post, lurker, blah blah blah details have been changed to protect my job…. **background** i work for a three letter agency as a contractor. i am one of several sys admins working in the operations center / network operations center (we build all the networks, servers, are responsible for all hardware/software, maintain everything, and **do everything**...except for it security. it security is run by another contracting firm that builds (*snicker*), maintains (*bwaahahahaha*), and is responsible for all the security monitoring, av servers, etc on our networks. it is important to note that we have zero access to their servers, security tools, logs, etc. needless to say, we don’t get along….. recently it has gotten worse as the head of it security just came back from what he calls an elite/select/high end/blah/blah security conference and has received many demo programs that will greatly increase our security ( *the last ‘security program’ he put on the network declared our exchange server a mass mailing bot… but i digress*). starts out as a typical day, checking up on our servers, doing tickets, shooting the shit amongst ourselves, and generally just having a good time. **ding** *--email from it security* we’ve been hacked!!! emergency!! critical!!! many viruses have been detected on the network!!!!! *da fuck???* we are, of course, scratching our heads. note that we built the network and it is about as flimsy as a brick shithouse (we hardened the ever living hell outa it). the chances of someone *hacking in* are astronomically small. we send an email to it security and cc our teams and the fed managers asking for more details: eg. what has been hacked/infected, where did this occur, etc (you know, common sense stuff). **ding** --e-mail from it security: we’ve been hacked!!! emergency!! critical!!! **many** viruses have been detected in multiple locations, many systems infected! breach! breach! breach! */sigh apparently details are a foreign concept* at this point my manager is on the phone with 3 different feds who are all screaming and waving their hands around demanding to know how **we** allowed a breach, what **we** are doing to fix it, etc. my manager calmly explains that we are looking into it but need all the records it security has on the incident so we can actually have a starting point. feds grumble, agree and apparently send a peon to the it security room instructing them to send us all the records (they don’t want to stop berating my manager apparently and simply sending an e-mail was for some reason not fast enough…..). 10 minutes pass **ding** --email from it security ccing, well, pretty much every manager in the entire agency: it security will be taking the lead on this. ops does not have the tools (*true*), experience (*wut?*), or knowledge (*lmao*) to handle a security event of this magnitude. ………. after **2 hours** of back and forth btw, us, it security, and what had to be 40 feds up to and including the head of the agency we get 2 screen shots from it security which they say is all the records they have……. at the time we thought they were just holding out on us and playing politics but what the hell, at least we have something to frigging work on. first thing i notice is that only 1 computer (a desktop) is listed as being “infected” and the path of the infected files are on the e:/ **which is the bloody cd-rom drive!!!!!** wondering who the doofus this computer is assigned to i check the logs, find the entry…. and just stare, stunned, at the screen for 30 seconds. i start to laugh. my manager runs over and furiously asks me what’s so funny. i can’t stop laughing and just point to the logs. my manager glances at the logs, does a double take, checks the screenshot from it security, and starts laughing. hilarity ensues as one by one other admins come and look at what i’ve found. the sound attracts one of our main fed managers who storms in demanding to know what exactly we find funny about the current situation! we explain that according to what was sent to us from it security, there is only 1 computer ‘reporting as infected’. that the infected files seem to be on a cd-rom, and that the desktop current assigned user is the **head of it security**. apparently, at the security conference, cd’s with tools and demos of products were handed out to all attendees. one of the tool cd’s included examples of virus coding (not the viruses themselves) as well as some useful networking and security tools. this cd is clearly labeled with: ** warning: not to be placed on a production network** this, of course, was the cd he put into his production desktop right before leaving the room so he missed all the popups warning a virus had been found. when the alerts started appearing he bypassed his desk and went to hover mode behind his minions and never noticed it was his desktop that had ‘hacked and infected the network’. needless to say, their company is currently in the process of being replaced. edit: grammar, spelling wow, thanks for all the up votes and comments! my friend tried to host some minecraft servers on the various computers in his house and his network stopped working. he told me he had set static ips on his computers which is fine. i spent an hour investigating and couldn't find anything wrong. i eventually checked the ipv4 addresses of the computers and found out he had set them all to the same address. tl;dr 10 people in a group with the same name gets confusing.a situation i'm sure is familiar to most of you, the old "fix it on your time, mine is too valuable." a call comes in saying their excel add-in for one of their trading programs isn't working. i remote into his machine, as per usual when someone asks me for help. &gt;$user: what are you doing on my machine!? &gt;me: umm. fixing your issue? &gt;$user: not now! i have too much to do! do it after 4! &gt;me: i would but i leave at 3, so let me know a time that works for you. a few minutes later i get an email saying i can take a look. i jump on, and see the program needs to be updated, no big deal. i take care of the update, and give him a call back to sign in to test it. no answer. i call back a few minutes later. no answer. i call $friend, who sits next to him. &gt;me: is $user there? &gt;$friend: nah, he ran to the gym. what's up? &gt;me: ... tell him to give me a call back when he gets back. **the gym.** i leave a sticky note on his screen to call me when he returns and go about my business. an hour later i receive a call from $user: &gt;$user: is this finished yet? this is taking way too long this is ridiculous! &gt; me: i have been waiting the last 45 minutes for you to get back from the gym. not that you're back lets go ahead and test that plug-in. it works. and it's only 9am.now that we're in the last few weeks leading up to the new semester, we're getting a lot of calls from new students trying to get all of their accounts set up. unfortunately, we're also getting a lot of calls from their overbearing mothers. this is one of those: *older sounding person on the phone* "i can't get logged in. the account name is [username]." *bring up account with a date of birth in 95* "and is this your personal account?" "no, it's my daughter's, obviously." "oh, i see. unfortunately, due to security policy, we have to speak to the user whose name is on the account, so she'll need to call." "but i'm her mother." "i understand, but i can't verify that and even if i could, i still would not be able to talk to you about her account." "that's just stupid. you just don't want to have to do any work. obviously i'm her mother. she gave me her password. now just fix it so i can log in." "again, i apologize that there's not more that i can do for you, but security policy at the university restricts me from resetting her password for someone else. technically, just the suggestion that she's given out her password to other people and the fact that an unknown person is trying to access her account is reason enough for me to lock the account and make her come in and reset it in person, but i'd rather not do that to--" "i don't care! why are you making this so difficult?! you could have reset it by now! just do your damn job, already!" *sigh* "ok, ma'am. one moment." ticka ticka ticka "ok, it's done." "what's done? you're reset the password?" "no ma'am. i've followed our procedure for dealing with possible third party intruders and locked the user's account. i've also put a note on it that she'll need to come in in person to reset it so we can verify her." "you've done what?!" after that, the rest of the call was mostly a lot of colorful swearing. edit: to save future commenters time, ferpa (the us federal regulation that applies here) has been mentioned and explained about a dozen times below. that's probably plenty. anticlimactic update: she came in. "why was my account locked?" "someone was trying to access your account so we locked it for your security." "yeah, that was my mom." "but we have no way to verify that." "oh... ok. well thanks." sorry folks, they can't all be winners.i used to work at a college as a unix admin/web developer. one winter i was bored and took a paper process teachers were using and put it on the web. this process used to take weeks t collate and now had the potential to be automated to a large extent and completed in days. it still required the teachers to log in and verify information. the teachers were not happy about this because they hate change and made up excuses why they couldn't complete it. then i started to get the calls about issues, my favorite was non-existent errors that went something like this ____ teacher: i tried to login but it said i am not authorized to log in me: what was the exact error message teacher: "you are not allowed to use this system" me: it does not say that, please tell me exactly what the error you are looking at says teacher: it does say that how could you possibly know what my screen says, this system is broken and i can't complete my work!! me: i know this because in addition to coding this system...i also coded all the error messages and that is not something i coded teacher: *silence* me: would you like to actually try loging in and let me know if there are any problems teacher: *hangs up* edit: want to thank everyone for the upvotes, far an away the most popular post i have made to reddit, so glad everyone enjoyed it. i will share some more of my tech support stories thank you all and have a great day user: can i also have the locking locking station, so i can secure it at my desk? me: by locking locking station did you mean locking docking station? user: yes. me: i have heard of laptop locks, and laptop docks, so a locking dock for docking locking laptops probably exists but i doubt a locking docking laptop with lock is in stock, so they may have to order it which will take 3-5 extra days. i will include the request for this in your order. user: great.friday afternoon is a fickle beast. it oozes the promise of the weekend, and the only good kind of downtime. on the other hand, it also carries a subtle aura of danger. everyone knows, any time you touch anything on a friday, you drastically increase your chances of having a bad time. i didn’t touch anything that friday. i don’t know what i did to the gods of networking, but i suppose i missed one of the mandatory chicken sacrifices that we’re all so fond of (aside from the mess; nothing gets chicken out, no matter where you file it). the call came in from a friend of a friend, the operator of an online store, who had a dns server that was misbehaving. it was on my way home, so i figured what the hell, i’ll help him out. i left work at 5 on the dot, and drove to their site. if i’d have known what i was about to walk into i would have never taken the call. by the time i got there, the two engineers were frantic. i couldn’t get anyone’s attention at first, but when one of them realised who i was and why i was there, his eyes widened and he stormed towards me. expecting a blast of abuse of some kind, i braced for impact .. then his voice cracked. &gt; server tech: oh, god, thank god you’re here, fuck, everything is fucked, shit, fuck .. his voice trailed off into a whirlwind oblivion of cursing and muttering, when his boss took over the conversation, realising his subordinate was not coping with the situation. &gt; chhopsky: what’s going on? &gt; boss: i’m not going to lie to you - it’s bad. real bad. at first we thought it was just the dns server but more of them have been dropping offline. we don’t know what’s going on and we don’t know how to fix it. &gt; chhopsky: okay, cool - i’ll take a look. when i started to look into it, i became confused. the dns servers were definitely all gone, and the monitoring showed more and more of them going offline. by the time i started to suspect some sort of switch malfunction and put a console on some of the networking gear, it was already too late. i just didn’t know it yet. the switch was functioning perfectly, and while i was throwing *show* commands at it, it rebooted from underneath me. what the hell? confused, i moved over to the routers. they too were working perfectly .. and then they too rebooted out from under me. was my serial cable over-volting the console port? was i causing these reboots? or were the reboots causing intermittent faults? was it bad power that intermittently killed every network device in some way? it could explain a lot. undeterred, i moved onto the firewalls. by the time i got to them, they were already rebooting. i’d missed it again, and i didn’t have any debugs on. but what was causing it? i decided to let it reboot and watch it come back up, when i saw something that no engineer wants to see. &gt; would you like to enter the initial configuration prompt? [yes/no] my heart sank. what the hell? how could it lose it’s config? the start-up configuration was blank. and it’s high-availability cluster partner too, which was feasible if it sync’d a blank config. so, i moved back down the chain. the routers were blank too. &gt; chhopsky: …no no no no no no no no no the switches were blank. the load balancers were blank. everything was blank. the entire network had been factory defaulted. but how could this happen? fortunately, there was a logging server for the network which, amongst other things, captured every command that was run on every device. i got server tech to find it for me, and put a keyboard and monitor on it. &gt; user brad has authenticated with plain-text-password &gt; user brad executed command ‘enable’ &gt; user brad executed command ‘write erase’ &gt; user brad executed command ‘reload’ &gt; user brad has disconnected oh … oh dear. that’s how one deletes the saved configuration of a device, and reboots it, factory defaulting it. &gt; chhopsky: … who is brad? &gt; server tech: he was our last network engineer .. we fired him last week. why do you ask? &gt; chhopsky: did you disable his vpn access? if he wasn’t pale enough already, he was mighty pale now. it turned out they’d had .. concerns, about some of brad’s less-than-ethical behaviour. after one too many ‘incidents’, he was let go. i guess he was one of those guys that just has trouble letting go. i stared blankly at two racks full of equipment, and surveyed the damage. the servers still had their os intact, but he’d deleted everything he had access to, which was a lot. databases were gone. and the network equipment configuration backups were stored in his user account. we had nothing but the machines and their operating systems, and a large stack of equipment. fortunately, they had backups, at their other site, which was 90 minutes drive away. i made the call; the boss was going to the other office to get the backups, and i was going to rebuild the rest from scratch. server tech hosed the servers with clean installs, while i set to work on the floor of the datacentre, figuring out what they had and what i could possibly use it for. by the time the boss returned from the drive, i’d knocked out a plan and server tech had re-installed all the os’s and the services they needed. backups in hand, server tech reloaded the databases and web content while i recabled and rebuilt the network from our design document that we came up with on the back of a piece of scrap paper. i set the firewalls, routers and switches up again, and configured up haproxy on a pair of new boxes for load balancers as the old ones were dead with some sort of firmware issue, most likely brad-related. it was 2am when i finished the network. server tech had finished his part too, but it still wasn’t working. there was one final piece of the puzzle missing; the databases. we were all tired, but we pushed through. red bull was deployed. server tech had ceased to function. in the one lucky break we’d caught all night, server tech had forgotten to edit pg_hba.conf on the postgres databases, leaving them unconfigured and not functioning. a few minutes later, we were back online. it was 2:30am. i’d been there for 9 hours, and at work for 17. i got a taxi home, cursing the name brad to the gods of networking. i prayed to them that brad would pay for his crimes. that somehow, some day, he too would find his fate in the hands of someone else who was not kind to his plans. fortunately, he did. and by a complete and utter twist of miraculous fate, [that person was me]( so i had a customer today that we shall call betty. betty is very nice but also very not good with tech in that 70 something year old who decided to buy a laptop last year kind of way. i do my usual greeting and ask her what she needs help with. she tells me that her laptop has a virus. now understand that the specific brand of laptop that i work on is very resistant to viruses. however many folks, especially older folks, confuse any and all issues with having a virus. so i ask her why she thinks she has s virus and she says because the computer told her it did. someone had shown her out to take a screenshot if she ever got a message she didn't understand and she showed it to me. yep it was an adware pop up. seems betty had been in some video site that said she needed flash so she googled it like a good user but hit the first link which was an adware infested site. she got one of those fake tech support messages. when i asked what she did, she told me that she called and they tried to talk her through giving them access to clean up the computer but she couldn't understand the instructions so she said she'd just go to the store and hung up. when i told her what they were really up to, she said she was never so happy to be stupid. i work as a field service and installation technician for a fairly large, but not top 5, us mso. this story takes place over a year ago at a call about bandwidth usage complaints. after reading the work order comments, seeing that the customer has gone over their bandwidth cap for several months in a row and that they believe the usage problem is our fault, i decided to call her. nothing about bandwidth overages is ever the isp's fault. well, except maybe the limit itself. xd &gt;**$me:** hello, this is xlogisticsx with $cablecompany. i am calling about the trouble call we have scheduled for you today. do you have a moment to answer a few questions? &gt;**$cust:** no, i don't have time. i am very busy. i just want a tech to come here and fix my problem! &gt;**$me:** that's fine. just to verify, your problem is that you keep going over your bandwidth, correct? &gt;**$cust:** yes, and i'm not the one doing it! &gt;**$me:** ok, ma'am. for excessive bandwidth usage, there are only three things, or a combination thereof, that will cause it. first, someone could have obtained your wireless password in some fashion and is using your bandwidth. next, you could have some malicious software on your computer that is using the bandwidth. lastly, someone behind your modem is legitimately using that much data and is just unaware. &gt;**$cust:** i have not used that much data, my computer is fine, and no one has my wireless password! &gt;**$me:** if someone wants it bad enough, it's not impossible to obtain a wireless password without consent. this is especially true if a password is not very secure. &gt;**$cust:** i don't have time for this right now. just send the damn technician! *click* i sit there for a few moments in anger. while i was only 1 minute away in a parking lot, i figured it would be best to sit and calm down for a moment. after regaining my composure, i roll to the house and greet the customer. i enter the home without saying anything unnecessary and proceed to gather my evidence that nothing on our end is wrong. at some point when i spoke, i believe the customer realized that i was the "damn technician." she started to bark up about her issue and how nothing could be her or her equipment's problem. to avoid any conflict, i just say neutral statements and confirm or deny nothing. this seemed to anger the customer as she felt the need to tell me that she was recording our conversation and would report me to my supervisor. after i run my tests and get my evidence and logical arguments in order, i start to explain to the customer that there is no way that someone can tap in to her internet by splicing in to the line outside. the issue has to be one of the ones i told her earlier over the phone. the customer then yells at me more, telling me that she works in the it department for $hospital and that i don't need to patronize her with this information. i don't know how i am going to win this battle. well, i started to speak with the customer about things *other* than the issue while i was "running more tests." she was resistant at first, but eventually started talking and sounding happier. i slowly get back to the issue and she surprisingly doesn't rip my head off. i explain to her that while i don't know the true cause of her issue, it has to be one of the things i told her before. i then mention that she has the ability to track her bandwidth usage with our online account tools. when we delve in to it, we see that every month she only used about 100gb of data or less until three months prior, right when her new neighbors moved in. i help her deduce that they could have sniffed out her password as she was still using the default wep password. i advised she change her password and then monitor her usage via the online tool. turns out one being happy makes them more receptive to ideas they don't like. edit: formatingme: retail i.t. how can i help you? associate: i can’t find my ipod. me: ok…. umm i don’t recall the store having ipods? associate: it’s not a store ipod. it’s mine. it was at the store and now i can’t find it. me: ok… well this is i.t. support for store related issues. i can’t help you with your lost ipod. associate: well i lost it at the store. what’s constitutes a store related issue. me: well… we’re here for any business related i.t. issues with stores. so internet not working, register issues, printer issues, etc. i apologize but losing personal items at the store has nothing to do with i.t. support associate: ok well. our printer is broken. me: what’s wrong with the printer? associate: i don’t know there’s like a jam or something. me: ok well i can help you with that. can you locate the jam? do you see paper or something? associate: i’m looking inside the printer and it looks like something is lodged up in there…. me: is there anyway you can try to fish it out? associate: yeah. i’m trying….. got it! oh hey, it was my ipod! me: glad i can help. so in the past 5 years, i've been aggressively trying to get myself in the it industry. i went back to college full time in a great networking technologies program, but then the wife at the time hung divorce over my head. dropped out of out college to work on relationship, still ended up getting divorced. i felt like my chance at having a professional job in the it industry was gone. i used to day dream about having the chance of being that guy, where the boss called you of a critical issue and needed you in asap. it/networking has always been a passion for me, and i was dedicated to having a job where i wake up and look forward to work. fast forward 5 years. those day dreams became a reality. two months ago, i was very fortunate to have landed a data center admin. position. even though i was not able to finish my degree in networking, i was able to some how make the cut out of the 65 applicants, who probably had better credentials than myself. last weekend was when the day dreaming became real. i was at a friend's house bbq'ing, and it was around 8pm that night when i got the call. boss says "hey quantum_anomaly is there anyway you can come to the data center? i know you're bbq'ing but we've had 3 servers go down since 3am. we're not understanding what the network engineers in corporate are asking, and we need your help." i immediately accept and head into the dc wearing shorts and a tee, along with 6 beers in the belly. i got on the phone conference and got the low down of the issue. in the 2 hours that i worked that evening, i was able to resolve the issue and bring the servers back online that were down since 3am. i went back to the bbq after that late night it encounter and finished my 12 pack of warsteiner dunkel. turns out that my boss's-boss was on the conference call and i scored some hardcore brownie points. the whole team thanked me up and down for helping them restore the servers on a short notice. i left the office that night with a massive smile and a feeling of accomplishment. i got a little teary-eyed too, because i was once told by the ex-wife's parents that i would never be successful in obtaining a professional it career. don't ever let someone or an event prevent you from doing what you love doing. my fear after the divorce was that i would become a depressed old man by not living a wholesomely-fulfilled life, and i refused to let that happen. tl;dr ex-wife wanted a divorce while in college for it career, so i dropped out. wife still left and i still landed the it career i always wanted, even though her parents stated that i would never obtain my dream job.this just happened within the past week and i'm still a little bit in disbelief. i'm not going to embellish this one as i think it's ridiculousness speaks for itself. in this one, there is only me, $user, and the user's boss, $manager. i get a ticket from the help desk for a manager requesting a replacement mouse for a specific employee, $user. the e-mail reads as follows: &gt; $manager: good morning, we are need of a mouse for $user, in the xxxx department. thank you so much. to me, that sounds like she just wants a new mouse, not that there is an issue. however, i don't like to assume too much so i respond with: &gt; shelbon: hi $manager, what is wrong with her current mouse? i figured she'd respond with either that she wants a new/better one or that it's not working. at least that way, i'd have a better idea of what we're talking about. &gt; $manger: $user stated that it's all over the place at times. now, that's still pretty vague but at least now i know it's an actual technical issue. i replied to just let her know to have her employees call the help desk themselves in the future because i've had problems with that since i started working here. $user leaves at 4:00 pm and i stay well past that usually so i waited for her to leave and went and tested the mouse but saw nothing wrong. i sat at her desk and moved the mouse around for about 7-8 minutes, just staring at the cursor move around. there was nothing wrong. i even checked the optical sensor on the bottom to see of a hair or something was stuck there but nope, nothing. so i send her this e-mail: &gt; shelbon: i went by your desk and i played around with the mouse but saw nothing wrong. sometimes small debris or hair can get into the optical sensor on the bottom and cause the issues you described. thinking that she would check again and see that the issue was not happening still and probably say something a long the lines of thanks... or probably just never hear about it again. but i was wrong, here is the e-mail i got from her: &gt; $user: i need the mouse replaced. you playing with it after i left yesterday doesn't compare to using it for hours at a time. it sticks and slows my work flow down. this has been happening on and off for a while now, but really caused me problems yesterday. i need to simply have it replaced or switched out. now if you're thinking that e-mail sounds a little aggressive, you're not alone. in that response, she also copied her bosses boss and the director of our office. they decided to inform her that her response was not professional and from what i could tell, she would get a talking to. she then replies all, which again, includes upper management. &gt; $user: i wasn't trying to be rude nor do i have an attitude. i was simply being direct about the situation. could you please replace my mouse so that i don't keep experiencing these issues. wooooow. i just. wow. now, i should mention that i was not bothered by her at any point during this, i just find it hard to believe that she's so... bold... in e-mails with upper management copied on them. so anyway, i go over to her desk and ask her to show me what it's doing but she could not replicate the issue. she gave me some more information though that made it seem like it's not an issue with the mouse at all, mostly because it seems to happen only in specific programs, according to her. i ask her to just come get when it happens again so i can see the problem and explain that i'll probably know what the issue is as soon as i see it occur. now you may be wondering why i didn't just replace the mouse first to see if that was the issue. normally i would but i have a few reasons. 1. this person has been notorious for requesting replacement equipment in the past when it wasn't necessary. 2. i'm trying to prove a point. 3. i actually only have a few extra mice in stock so i don't want a habit to start where end users thinking they can get replacement mice every time something happens with theirs. she seems to understand what i tell her and she agrees to come get me if/when it happens again. that was first thing, thursday morning. i don't hear anything the rest of the day or on friday either. so about midday on monday, i send her this e-mail: &gt; shelbon: when we last spoke, i requested you come get me if the issue with your mouse happens again. that was thursday morning and i still have not heard back from you which to me, means the issue has not been occurring. is that correct? her response: &gt; $user: no the issue is on going. it does it all day everyday when maneuvering throughout $software. i would be coming to you every single time i tried to do something different in $software which is every few minutes. i have spoken with $manger and she told me to go ahead email you or call every single time it does that but again that would literally be all day. at that rate i literally can't do my job. &gt; shelbon: per our prior conversation, i need to see it when it happens. that is where we left it. please come get me the next time it's happening so i can see the issue. &gt; $user: you are welcome to come whenever you are available. as i said its ongoing. sigh. okay. so i walk over to her desk when i have a few free minutes and of course, it's not happening. i start to explain the same thing again but then it happened. i was able to see what she was talking about. basically, she was using a program not supported by me or my company. it has it's own vendor support that they're supposed to call because it's citrix based and we don't have access to that citrix environment. the issue was that in one specific program, with a very specific window open within it, the cursor would shoot the bottom of the screen if it was moved above that window. but it only happens in that one program and only with that specific window open. clearly not a mouse issue and clearly not something i support. i show her what the issue by being able to reproduce the issue. i then explain that she needs to contact their support. she doesn't seem to get it though so i just walk away, document everything in the ticket and then close it. i also made a point of explaining to her that this is why i don't just replace equipment without first verifying that it needs to be replaced, to which she rolled her eyes.a pristine office is the sign that you’ve conquered all your work. at least that’s what my mother had told me when i was younger. as if in protest of that fact, my office looked messy, not dumping grounds messy but at least forgot to do the dishes messy. so it was with some surprise that i found myself facing an immaculately dressed woman in some distress. &gt;pristine: my phone’s got a virus! pristine’s head whipped around my office in a frenzy, her eyes widened with her increasing gaze. she eventually reached into her handbag and produced a plastic lock bag. it contained a mobile phone. &gt;me: i see... &gt;pristine: i’m very worried about it. i need my phone, i’m expecting a very important call. pristine dropped the plastic bags onto my desk. she refused to take a seat, looking down at it with suspicion. i bundled up the bag from the desk, noting the triple layers of bag used. i opened the first bag. &gt;pristine: what are you doing? &gt;me: getting the phone. pristine eyes were wide, her mouth scrambled words. &gt;pristine: but, the virus! it’ll spread. &gt;me: i’m not entirely sure plastic protects against viruses. pulling the first bag free, i wondered what error this lady was convinced was a virus. perhaps it was a general system message, or an application was trying to install. either way i doubted she could’ve contracted a real phone virus. not on a phone so old. i couldn’t wait to send this lady on her way and go back to avoiding cleaning. &gt;pristine: but that’s what they do in hospitals! &gt;me: ... i’m not sure hospitals deal with many phones. opening the second bag i pulled out the final third bag. one last piece of plastic between the phone and freedom. a strange substance seemed to be in the bag as well. it stuck to all the surfaces of the bag like a fine mist. pristine shrieked with shock when she saw it. &gt;pristine: so as you can see, my son coughed all over my mobile. he’s quite sick. i dropped the bag down in milliseconds. it clattered to my desk with a *thunk*. &gt;me: clean your phone! grabbing a pencil i pushed the package back towards pristine, who seemed to recoil away from it. &gt;pristine: do you have any special cleaning solution? &gt;me: no, just antibacterial wipes. i’ll get you some if you like... before i could launch myself away from the bagged infection pristine had already produced two packets of wipes from her bag. she placed them on the table carefully. &gt;pristine: the problem is... look at the fine print... i picked up one of the wipes and inspected the package carefully. it was just an average packet of wipes, it had the usual warnings and information. &gt;pristine: see, it says it’ll get rid of 99.8% of germs. &gt;me: ahh yes. &gt;pristine: well, my son is quite sick... i just don’t want to take that 0.2% chance. if my head could have hit the desk it would have, however the plastic bag containing the phone effectively repelled my instincts. i pushed the wipes back towards pristine. &gt;pristine: i rang the help line on the back. they couldn’t guarantee it would be effective, they said i should speak to a professional. so... here i am. &gt;me: i think they meant.... medical professional. &gt;pristine: like you said, what would they know about phones!? it was too much, my head hit the desk. back when i was in high school i was *heavily* involved with the technical side of theatre. i did lights, though; i've yet to make sense of the audio side. anyways, halfway through rehearsals of our production of *almost, maine* (great one-act), our theatre tech teacher/technical director got word that some of the freqs we were using for wireless mics had been changed by the fcc a couple of weeks back. i happened to be in the audio booth when he broke the news. the conversation went as follows: (td: technical director, us: us) &gt;td: hey guys, the fcc changed some stuff so we have to use other freqs for our mics. &gt;us: cool, what happened to the freqs we were using? &gt;td: they're being used for other things, now. &gt;us: such as...? &gt;td: dod missile control... he handed us the printed email to show us that he wasn't bullshitting. turns out that for the couple of weeks we were unaware of the change, we had been using for our wireless mics some of the same frequencies that were now being used for defense missile control. when the power went out in the school later that day, we joked that perhaps we had launched a missile at a ga power plant. the funniest part is that as *almost, maine* is set in, well, maine, all of the crew had to dress for winter weather. watching our td come out to the audience, in character, to explain that the power and a/c were out was hilarious. he was pretending to shiver, in a very thick coat, on a very hot georgia summer day. priceless.i just had a guy come in the door with his desktop. "six months", he said. "i have to come here every six months...it was working fine, i had no problems at all...then suddenly, last night...it went back to the old internet. it went back to 7. the icons are all big, everything is gone". i've learned by now to not even try to make sense out of what people are saying about their computers. "ok, lemme check it out &amp; i'll call you". a few minutes ago, i booted it up and it was a plain vanilla installation of windows 7. hmmm....it's activated as well. let's go exploring! i found a "windows.old" folder on his drive, containing all his documents/pics/garbage. did he....did he? omg...did *i*!?!?! i press the eject button on the cdrom and out slides my copy of windows 7, not a bootleg mind you. so this dude sat through six months of 'press any key to boot from cd...' for six months until that fateful moment last night when he hit that key. now, i can understand accidentally pressing the wrong key but going through with a full reinstallation of the operating system is a bit more in depth than just an idle keystroke. at no point during this procedure did his brain ever register 'hey, this doesn't seem right, maybe i shouldn't continue' - nor did this hour &amp; then some long process weigh enough on his mind to where he would mention it to me. yes, i left the cd in the drive. oops.[previous]( witchcraft, that was the *only* possible reason i was smiling as i walked into the office on a monday morning. the brightness of my mood matched perfectly with the charming new brew in my hand. &gt;redcheer: airz! i turned to catch a look of excitement on redcheers face. &gt;me: redcheer, i forgot, its your first day here isn’t it? i hadn’t forgotten. &gt;redcheer: yep! &gt;me: i’ll lead the way, let me introduce you to the troops… as i walked into the office i caught a glimpse of my reflection, a new emotion was registering on my face, was this? happiness? &gt;me:okay, everyone! this is redcheer, she’s our new tech. most of the office turned around, the monday morning frowns of some of our most hardened techs soon turning upside down at the sight of redcheer. &gt;colourblind: urh… hi, i’m colourblind. colourblind's halting introduction aside most of the techs seemed relaxed about the whole affair, except pant suit who was staring daggers. redcheer surveyed the room, utterly ignoring the increasingly nervous colourbind. &gt;redcheer: oh my! is that you… pant suit? colurblind’s complete rejection went unnoticed by the rest of the room, as redcheer excitedly walked over to pantsuit. &gt;redcheer: it’s me, redcheer, remember? &gt;pantsuit: i remember a senior year party. distinctly. colourblind was still standing almost motionless in a mid introduction pose. poor guy seemed broken. &gt;redcheer: that was at your house! i remember, everyone said it was an amazing party. i don’t really remember it. &gt;pantsuit: oh course you don’t. i was grounded for months for that party, after you threw up in the pool. clogged the thing..., my parents were livid. colourblind started to blink again. i was honestly relieved he was still alive, too much paperwork otherwise. &gt;redcheer: sorry about that. it was years ago though. &gt;pantsuit: i missed prom/formal/gradparty because of you! all because you can’t hold a bit of liquor. colourblind looked wreaked, his eyes looked like they were trying to work out what had **just** happened. i was tempted to go pat him on the back, decided against it. &gt;redcheer: i think my drink was spiked. sorry though. &gt;pantsuit: don’t blame it on spiking. just admit you can’t handle your drink. colourblind suddenly snapped back to reality. he started walking over to his desk. &gt;colourblind: drink! yes. don’t mind if i do. he pulled out a large bottle of vodka. pantsuit walked over to colourblind’s desk and grabbed the bottle. &gt;pantsuit: i’ll drink you under the table right now. &gt;redcheer: ha, you’d need way more than that before i’d keel over. at this point itsec pulled out a bottle of the cheapest nastiest high strength alcohol. it was at this point i snapped out of my bubble. &gt;me: woah, woah. what are you doing?! its 9am monday morning! the office collectively looked at what they were doing. people started looking at their feet, like a child scolded. itsec looked particularly saddened, as if i’d killed his life dream. &gt;me: itsec, why do you have this? i held up the bottle of… terrible liquid. itsec shrugged. &gt;itsec: just in case…. &gt;me: just in case what?! when would you ever want to ingest this? itsec looked appropriately apologetic for bringing in such offensively bad liquor. i decided to let him off, this time. an awkward pause settled over the whole office. &gt;redcheer: ahm, yes. so.. i’m redcheer. looking forward to working with you all. &gt;pantsuit: oh airz, i think i **will** train her. i looked between the two women. pantsuit was still clutching a massive bottle of vodka in her hand threateningly. &gt;me: er, no. it’s okay. the other techs in the office then started offering to teach redcheer, as if only then remembering that the position was still open. redcheer started turning them down herself. i took a sip of coffee as i realized everything was going to be okay, &gt;pantsuit: airz is right, drinking now is silly. good thing the company xmas party is this week. lets see if you can hold your drink then. pantsuit looked challengingly at redcheer, who turned and smiled. &gt;redcheer: looking forward to it. or not... [next](i support a software made for writing automotive estimates, and as such i'm used to the average software user being more comfortable under the hood than behind the keyboard. but sometimes, there is that one shining example of a user who understands just enough to be angry. **caller**: i can't believe you have to give me permission to uninstall your program on my own computer! **moi**: i'm sorry? **caller**: your program is telling me i don't have permission. i want it uninstalled and gone. i don't know why i have to call you guys to get permission. so i get remoted in and he has on screen what i suspected: he's trying to uninstall on a non-administrator account. i have them switch to a different windows account and try again. uninstalled like it was nothing. **caller**: i want you to make sure it's gone. every bit of it. i don't want any part on here. so i locate the folders that stay behind after an uninstall and shift-delete them. there's nary a trace of it remaining. **caller**: okay, and if i want to reinstall later, where will my files be that i move back in? **moi**: i'm afraid those were just deleted. is there anything else i can help you with today? *cue ranting that makes me glad we're separated by a phone.* it's the summer of 2000. i'm working at an [ad agency]( i'm working on my antique car and hanging out with my roommate and girlfriend. a middle aged woman who happens to be my neighbor walks over to me after talking to my roommate. i say hello while adjusting an alternator belt. she launches into her issue without preamble: nice older lady:"roommate says you're in computers. know anything about email?" me:"i work with computers when i'm not trying to wrestle with old cars. i know a thing or two about email" nice older lady:"i can't read email from my daughter" me:"i don't understand. if she sends you something, you get it and it's scrambled? or it's blank?" nice older lady (getting frustrated):"no. i can't read email that my daughter sends" me:"what email provider does she use?" this was still when people used aol. i was guessing that there was some strange formatting issue. nice older lady:"i don't know anything about computers" nice older lady (even more frustrated):"she's not sending it to me, she's sending it to some man" me:"i see. that's kind of the way it works. if you're not the intended audience..." not so nice older lady:"but she's involved with a married man. i want to see if she's sleeping with him" me:"have you thought of asking her? you know, like a mother-daughter conversation over tea?" no longer nice older lady:"i figured if you knew computer you'd be able to (mimics typing) just get in and read it" me:"so, you want me to figure out her email address, break into the email server and find out if your daughter is having an affair with a married man" smiling older lady:"yes!" me:"so, you want me to commit a felony to solve a family problem best handled with a conversation" older lady:"i figured it would be easy for you" (mimics typing again). me:"sorry". background: i do inbound technical support for a certain fortune 500 company that manufactures and sells phones, tablets, computers, and software. one day i get a call from a customer who's having issues accessing her account. &gt; ot (me): thanks for contacting [fortune 500 company], my name is oz_town, how may i help you today? &gt; user: my name is user, i'm having some issues with my account, it's not letting me sign in and it's very annoying. *oh good, an easy call* &gt; ot: i can understand that can be frustrating, can i grab the email address you use as your account id so i can pull it up in the system? &gt; user: sure, it's [unintelligible email address]. *at this point it's a bit difficult to hear, as i'm unfortunately sitting next to the loudest advisor in the building who practically screams into his mic, and the line quality isn't the best* &gt; ot: sorry user, what was that one again? the line is a bit rough. if you could spell it for me that would be great. &gt; user: oh sure, it's [almost as unintelligible as last time]. *by this stage most people get the hint to spell their email address phonetically, but not this user!* &gt; ot: i'm really sorry user, i just wasn't able to hear that too well at all. would you be able to spell it phonetically, using the phonetic alphabet? (not sure how much more specific i can get here) *at this point i'm leaning back in my chair, waiting for a "u" for "uniform", or "t" for "tango". instead i hear this ungodly screeching come down the line and blast through my headset...* &gt; user: chhhhhhh hathhhhhhhhh arrrrrrrrrrr gerrrrrrrthhh cooouuuu &gt; ot: ...i...what... &gt; user: barrrrrr driiithh naarrrhhhh *i had no idea what was happening, and sat there in disbelief until the user had stopped “spelling” her email address "phonetically".* &gt; ot: um....was that an email? &gt; user: yes, i spelled it phonetically, just as you asked, did you get it? &gt; ot: phonetically as in, "a" for "alpha", "b" for "bravo" or "c" for "charlie"? &gt; user: [realising she has just fucked up in the most embarrassing way possible] oh... tl;dr the user had confused phonetics for syllables, and was spelling her email address the way a 1st grade student would be asked to pronounce "charlie" e.g. chhh-arrr-leee [previous]( as i stared down at a lady with striped glasses and no name i considered my options. she was asking for a computer, belonging to the head of accounting, should i just… give it to her? seemed easier then arguing. screw it, arguing is sometimes more fun. &gt;me: lets start with who you are, and what you’re doing here. &gt;stripes: my name isn’t important, and i’m here for that computer. &gt;me: you know, i’m not in the habit of just handing out computers to anyone. stripes gave me an exasperated look. she huffed and went looking in her bag. after minutes of searching she finally pulled out some identification cards. &gt;stripes: see i work here! now give me, that computer. now. i looked down at her identification card. it basically said her name, and a photo, with a company logo. &gt;me: yes. so you’ve got a card, what do you want the computer for though? stripes was looking more and more agitated, i had calmed down and hoping to play the long delay game. &gt;stripes: i just need it. so, which one is it? stripes was looking around the department as if expecting to just be able to pick it up. &gt;me: none of these are the one you want, what do you need it for again? &gt;stripes: you’re awfully nosey. just get go and get it. it was at this point i wished i had a coffee, so i could take a long sip and savor the sweet moment in front of me. &gt;me: umm, lets see…. nope. all out of free computers for random office workers today. &gt;stripes: go get it! the anger on stripes face was starting to boil over. &gt;me: not until you tell me why you need it. &gt;stripes: its not your job to know why people need something. its your job to make sure it works when people get it. now go and get the computer. stripes was screaming at this point. the entire it staff was now watching a lady explode. i couldn’t help the smirk forming on my face. &gt;me: no. i’m afraid you’re going to have to leave. now. stripes looked around the room and realized everyone was watching her. &gt;stripes: urh… sorry. sorry everyone. i’m just a little stressed. could ummm, someone go get me the head of accounts computer quickly for me? she smiled at the department, colourblind saw the smile and jumped up. &gt;colourblind: everyone has a bad day once in a while. colourblind smiled nicely back at stripes, his earlier misery ebbing away. &gt;stripes: yeah, just so much stress and well… no need to burden you with it… still it would be nice if you could just get up and grab that computer for me. colourblind as if dazed by a lady actually talking to him, mumbled “sure”, and turned to face where the pc was lying. &gt;me: don’t. move. colourblind looked at me dazed, as if only then realizing what was happening. he had paused with one foot mid air. &gt;me: what do you need the computer for, stripes? stripes looked over at colourblind, who was frozen mid step. she screamed. &gt;stripes: ahhhh! fine. stripes then stormed out of the department in a massive huff. i had half a mind to go after her, and work out to which department she belonged. instead i turned to colourblind. &gt;me: colourblind, you **can** sit. colourblind took his seat however when he sat down he stared at the ground, with his head in his hands. again. [next](tuesday 9.30am switcher was a complicated employee, he’d been flung between different departments often. no manager seemed to be able to keep him as he kept requesting to be transfered. this caused him to be a semi regular down in it, sorting out which account of his needed to be activated. &gt;switcher: hey, i need my password reset. its not working. &gt;me: again? i’d started to become suspicious of switchers ability to remember any passwords. normally i’d try to hammer the issue home, but we had to deal with switcher so often he felt oddly like family. &gt;switcher: i dunno what keeps happening! &gt;me: okay i’ll reset it, just try to make an easy to remember password this time. normally i wouldn’t give out such terrible advice but having reset his password everyday for a week i was growing tired of our daily interactions. &gt;switcher: i always make my password the same, i dunno whats happening. &gt;me: i’ll pretend i didn’t hear that. my laziness on password security had been worn down. i sent off the reset and quickly hung up the phone. hating myself for having my standards lowered so much. ***** tuesday 8pm it was a long day, most of which i spent lamenting it’s poor security standards. i vowed to myself that i’d hammer the next breach in security i saw, if only to feel better about letting the last one go. the phone rang. &gt;me: hello. &gt;???: hello, err my account isn’t accepting my password. &gt;me: you’ll need a password reset. perfect, my mind thought as i prepared myself for the it security lecture of a lifetime. i just waited for the inevitable “i always use the same password” or “why doesn’t xyz123 work as a password”. &gt;me: whats your name? &gt;???: switcher. &gt;me: you’re up late... wait this doesn’t sound like switcher. an impostor! oh i could really scream at someone like that. i opened the thesaurus of insults in my head. &gt;???: you don’t sound like the normal it guy. some of the night it guys had started to arrive at work, upon seeing my office light on they entered. &gt;nightowl: oh airz! do i hear switcher on the phone? i’ve been meaning to email you about that. i’ve changed his password every day for a week. something is wrong with his account. i mouthed “this isn’t the real switcher” at nightowl. &gt;nightowl: yes, its is. all us night guys hang out. i’ve known the guy for years. &gt;me: wait what.... ***** it was the next day that the truth finally arose. switcher1 and switcher2 had the same name. unfortunately when the switcher i knew, who kept hopping between departments got put into his current team, another employee already had an identical account name. instead of creating a new account i had assumed the active account of the server as actually his. it was not. i'd been giving an account to someone who didn't own it. :(i work as a customer facing programmer. most of my communication with customers is through email. when the phone rings that usually means someone either didn't see my email or something fairly complicated is going on. the phone rang today. i recognized the number. i swore under my breath. &gt;me: "companyname$, this is wishful." &gt;customer: "hey wishful. this is customerman$. yeah, i'm still having that issue with the custom project you sent me. it still pops up that message when i tried to send an email." &gt;me: "i sent you an email on the 8th with an updated file. did you install that?" &gt;customer: "yeah... i saw that. i didn't read it. there were too many words and i get leery when i see that." &gt;me: "... okay. i'll take over." at least he was honest? i was working in a call center (tech support for one of those extended warranties), and we got a really odd call. seems that this lady had put her sub sandwich on top of her computer, which warmed it up, and the sandwich went bad. this customer called up demanding a replacement. of course, a computer warranty would never cover something like this, so naturally we resisted. the issue escalated nastily. it turns out, however, the store that sold her the computer also sold refrigerators, and the warranty paperwork they gave her was for such an appliance, and did cover food spoilage. we did end up replacing her lunch but she won't be getting any help with her computer. so she spent over $100 to get a $5 sandwich replaced. td;dr: it doesn't pay to be nasty edit: just to clarify a few points based on the discussion, the $100 was my estimate for the cost of the warranty. the store in question did have separate warranties for the appliances and computers (the computer warranty was very specific as to what was/was not covered)first of all, mods, i want to give you my most sincere apologies for yesterday's post, i was in a rant for what happened, i'm terribly sorry. it was a normal day for the most part at the store, easter holidays so i'm working full-time to earn a bit more cash, we were attending people as usual when a guy in his late 20s came in and ask us to check why his laptop wouldn't turn on, i had to handle it since my co-worker was busy. he places it on the counter and i take a look at it, check the battery first and remove it to make sure the connectors and battery are not damaged, nothing unusual. i open the lid and i felt a weird smell, like cleaning products, the keyboard and screen look somewhat dirt, like if they had spilled soda all over it and cleaned it with some products. &gt;$me: excuse me sir, have you by any chance spilled liquid on it or have you used any cleaning products? &gt;$guy: uh huh, i clean it often. but not so well it seems, i do the normal tests, it wouldn't turn on, i used my charger to give it power (i have the same model) and as i try to operate it, the keys feel a bit sticky, like... *plays the psycho theme* i pay closer attention to the dirt spots, they look like glue, and the screen has drip marks... just like if someone... i realize why it was dirty, and i completely lost it. insults and more came out of me, my boss came in to see why i was yelling like that, i show him my horrible discover, after some nasty words exchange, the guy leaves with his laptop, i head to the restroom, spending little over 10 minutes washing my hands and arms, and my co-worker cleaning the counter. we closed the store as usual and i head home, my boss was kind enough to allow me come in a bit late and relax.a few years back i worked the it helpdesk for a large energy firm in the uk, one of the "big six". all support calls were internal to the company and its subsidiaries. i specialised in support of one of the subsidiaries, often taking over calls from colleagues with limited experience in the subsidiary's systems. i would also take calls to translate (all english, but accents). ---------- i would often rush the call to get a gas engineer back on the road with a working laptop. most fixes involved pushing a fix file to their system or a reboot. this particular day had been brutal, i had just come off of a 30 minute call between our indian 3rd line team and an aberdonian field engineer. the next call was from a glaswegian engineer (ge) ge: my laptop is f**ked me: what seems to be the problem ge: i don't f**king know, i don't know computers me: not a problem, i don't know how to change out a gas meter. so what's happening with the machine? ge: well, i called up earlier and the guy sent a fix, which i did, but it didn't fix it. so i called back and he said i needed to switch it off, then wait five minutes before booting it. me: okay, that sounds right, is the error still there? ge: no, but i've now got this spider web on my screen. me: that sounds strange, can you walk me through what you did? ge: well, i ran the fix, didn't work,then i turned it off and put it on the seat while i had a tea, then i put it on the floor... i knew where this was headed, i cringed in expectation ge: then i booted it me: with your foot? ge: aye, it's booted! i sent him back to the depot (60 mile round trip) for a new machine. **tl;dr** engineer was told to boot his machine, kicked it[previous]( taking a new computer to each techs desk myself was great. everyone was happy to receive an upgrade and continuously thanked me, which in turn made me happy. until… solitaire stood i arrived with his new mac. the frown on his face was small, but growing. &gt;solitaire: i like my current setup. &gt;me: no worries, you can have two computers. solitaire eyed the mac. he didn’t look keen. &gt;solitaire: no… no i don’t want **that** near my stuff. &gt;me: er okay…. well it’s your choice. as i turned to deliver the computer to someone else, solitaire spoke again. &gt;solitaire: so… when’s my upgrade for this coming? i turned a second time and saw him patting on his desktop. &gt;me: this… mac, is the upgrade for that pc. &gt;solitaire: i’ve been looking online and i think **this** would be more my style. he gestured over at his screen which was showing a bunch of parts in a cart along with a gaming case. &gt;me: that looks like a nice computer. &gt;solitaire: cool, can i order it? i tried to give solitaire my best “really” face. &gt;me: no. &gt;solitaire: but, i could get work done quicker if this computer was faster though. at this point in time i was still holding a brand new mac in my hands, which i’d attempted to give him. &gt;me: you can have this mac. or keep your current setup. or both, but you can’t get an entirely **new** pc. solitaires face looked crushed. he wasn’t very happy. i held the mac out, expecting him to give in. &gt;solitaire: no. i don’t want it. childish, i thought. after giving out all the computers i had one spare. i put it in my office. better get rid of the spare mac fast before solitaire changes his mind, but who needs a new computer…. ***** i sat down to consult my coffee over who needed a new computer in the company. “a nice mac like that could buy you lots of goodwill” my coffee whispered. i took a sip of the delicious golden brown liquid. &gt;me: yes, yes it would… but how to get it there? ***** i knocked at the door of the boss of my chosen recipient for the new mac. "come in” the voice said from within the room &gt;me: hello vp! just wondering if **you’d** like an upgrade for your computer. i had brought the mac in question up with me. the vp eyed it and me suspiciously. &gt;vp: upgrade? &gt;me: yep, we’ve a spare computer lying about, and i thought… who could use a mac os and needs an upgrade. the vp looked between me and the computer, as if sensing something wrong. &gt;vp: so. that’s **just** a new computer. &gt;me: yep. we can hook it up to a screen and you’re away. vp’s eyes looked calculating. &gt;vp: whats wrong with my current computer? &gt;me: well, its a little old. this one will be much faster. i smiled, but the vp was busy admiring the mac. &gt;vp: looks like a nice computer, but… i don’t want it, &gt;me: you don’t? &gt;vp: no, i don’t trust er…. it. i shrugged my shoulders and turned to walk out the door. &gt;vp: wait… thats it? no arguing. &gt;me: if you don’t want an upgrade, you don’t want an upgrade. now i’ve got to find someone else who could use a faster computer. any ideas? the vp looked like he was in conflict with himself. i crossed my fingers and hoped this would work. &gt;vp: but.. er.. maybe… give it to my secretary? touchdown. i smiled internally. the vp was sometimes *too* easy. &gt;me: okay. ***** &gt;me: hey vpsec. &gt;vpsec: airz! how’s it going? i shrugged my shoulders and smiled. &gt;me: not bad, not bad. just wondering if you’d like this. i held up the new computer. &gt;vpsec: er… thats quite a nice computer, but are you sure that isn’t for the vp? &gt;me: no, no. my it’s my gift to you. vpsec smiled broadly. &gt;vpsec: wow, this is quite the upgrade. &gt;me: consider it payback. [next](this happened 5 minutes ago: &gt; me: i.t., this is suckmyhdd, how can i help you? &gt; medrec: yes, this is medrec. we are missing our hipaa file from august 2nd and august 36th. &gt; me: uh, you mean august 2nd and august 3rd? &gt; medrec: no, august 2nd and august 36th. &gt; me: ... &gt; medrec: can you recover them for me? &gt; me: no. i can't pull any data from beyond this date. and the august 3rd file hasn't been populated yet. &gt; medrec: no no no no, you aren't listening. i need august 2nd and august 36th. &gt; me: ma'am, open your calendar. &gt; medrec: okay. &gt; me: point to august 36th. &gt; medrec: oh. my. god. &gt; me: yeah, you meant august 1st and august 2nd didn't you. &gt; medrec: it's been a long weekend. absolutely. edit: i said ma'am and fixed it above. as well as i.t. - i was battling a sinus infection during the writing of this and would type between sneezes. also, thanks guys, for putting bohemian rhapsody in my head. ;-)5 years ago i was hired at my current position to help bring the financial institution into the 21st century. my first step was getting them a mobile platform. check. my second was to take them from paper loan files to paperless. i implemented the product one year after being hired and to this day people still don't use it correctly. they use the old way and then scan the paper into the system. which is the hardest way because you can send everything directly into the system without ever printing a piece of paper. but you know, people have to hold their paper. i have given each of the loan officers single page scanners for items that our members bring in, but they use those single page scanners to scan whole entire loan documents. so for the last 4 years the loan officers have been complaining about how slow the paperless process is and how much faster the older process is. my response has always been do it correctly and it will be faster. i have showed them and showed them and showed them how to do it without printing and scanning. and they have all responded for the last 4 years that their way is quicker and that i am not a loan officer so i don't understand. and i can't tell them how to do their job. so comes today. i made a deal with them. i would take on their fastest loan officer and that person could do it their way and i would take a loan and do it my way. if i finished first, they have to learn the way i want them to do it. if their loan officer finishes first, i will never again bring it up and i will get each branch a big multipage scanner. they picked the person who complains the most. the person who gives me the hardest time about how fast she is with the old way and how my scanning paperless is causing more headaches than it is worth. we sat down and they started the clock. i am sure they thought that with me not actually being a loan officer i didn't have the experience. the goal was to get everything into the system and the person who got it done first would win. it started out as a small competition. everyone was watching. she got off to a fast start because she knows the boxes. she can type without even reading what is coming up. i was still busy typing in the data into the system as she started to print. i was just finishing up entry of the information when she started to scan. i hit my button to send everything over into the system and there was stunned silence when i said 'done' and she was in the process of scanning 35 pages still. they didn't believe me at first. they all said i probably didn't do it correctly because she was way ahead of me in the process. i showed them my completed loan in the system and they all went over it with a fine-toothed comb looking for a mistake. telling her to keep going that if i made a mistake she could still win. i had made no mistake. i just didn't have to spend 10 minutes scanning single pages of stuff just to scan it. they can now all shut-up and learn the system like i have been begging them to do for 4 years because i beat their best and i don't even know their job.weekly staff meetings always seemed so pointless. except around budget time, when money was discussed, everyone paid attention. &gt;accounting manager: so airz it says here on your budget allocation form that the amount you want is “more then last year”. &gt;me: that sounds about right. a few of the managers gave incredulous looks to each other. &gt;accounting manager: usually departments give a specific figure... &gt;me: oh, we’re doing that again this year? every year i calculate how much it needs and every year i end up with exactly the same amount regardless of what i calculate. i thought maybe it was some weird prank. the incredulous looks now shifted to ones of wide eyed shock. &gt;accounting manager: i assure you, we look at the numbers we are given very carefully. &gt;me: do you? i mean last year we had a plan to upgrade every department to a new operating system. our budget came back with zero extra funds. &gt;accounting manager: clearly you’re upset about this, but unfortunately we do not have unlimited funds. now can you please just give me the specific number that you’re requesting. i took a pen out of my pocket and wrote out the number that i was normally allocated. i added a few zeros for good measure. i folded this piece of paper in half and pretended to discreetly slide it over the table towards the accounting manager. the accounting manager unfolded the piece of paper and almost baulked. &gt;accounting manager: outrageous! airz, please submit something a little more reasonable. i took back the scrap of paper and wrote down the same amount i received every year. then added a single dollar. the accounting manager smiled. &gt;accounting manager: now this is a number i can work with... i sat back in my chair knowing the meeting was now over for me. i didn’t even bother requesting additional funds to upgrade our crumbling equipment. unlike every other department i’d completely lost faith in the allocation system after last year. seeing the sales department get funding for its third bathroom/break room redesign in four years was the nail in the coffin for me. **** i arrived back in my office with an email already waiting for me. after carefully looking at your records, the budget allocation for it this year will be ... i looked at the figure. it was the same amount i received every year, they didn’t even add the dollar. -.- i decided to type up an email. company wide. **due to lack of funds it can no longer support any company telephones, this bill will now need to be covered by individual departments. this change will come into effect....** the email was rather boring and very formal. it outlined why and how the responsibility changed from the it budget to the budgets of individual departments. it was fun to write. within seconds my office phone began to ring. &gt;accounting manager: airz, whats is this i read about shifting costs on to the departments for company phones? this wasn’t in any of your budget reports. &gt;me: oh, i know. it was in last year’s costings. when i requested more funds to keep paying the contracts. last year you sent an email that said we’d get the funds this year. we did not. i assumed that meant you wanted us to shift those cost onwards. &gt;accounting manager: but!? what? why can’t we just leave it how we’ve always done it. you’ve the same amount of money. i pretended to ponder this for a second. &gt;me: i can’t. my costings this year didn’t include the company telephones, and my costings have already been approved by your department after **careful** examination. the accounting manager sounded stumped on the phone, i could hear him clearly rifling through the forms, trying to find any evidence that i was mistaken. &gt;accounting manager: this is just a small oversight... you should still pay the company phones as normal. &gt;me: oversight? couldn’t be! didn’t you say you carefully went through **all** the numbers? &gt;accounting manager: if the vp was here.... &gt;me: but he isn’t. so you’ve a choice, either *i* get extra funding to pay for all these phones, or *everyone* is going to have to hand in new expenses reports. he hung up. after much deliberation, i got the extra funds. apparently admitting they didn’t actually check my budget forms was too much. instead they bought me off. i was happy. coincidentally this all happened the same week it found the funds to upgrade its own break room. new coffee machine and all. this one's pretty long. if it starts to feel like a bit of a shaggy dog story, i apologize... but it felt that way to me, too. and it starts the way many stories in here do: **i acquired a new client recently.** they weren't satisified with their current it vendor, the company was growing, they wanted to check out their options, etc. a common enough story. i asked them about their specific needs and problems, and they told me about backup paranoia, the server getting "overloaded", and crappy email service. natch. so, i did a site survey. **ah, the old "buzzword bingo virtualization" scenario, i see.** the server was a windows 2012r2 host running a single windows 2012r2 guest under hyper-v - no snapshots, no image based backup, no replication. so, it's a bare metal server, but the old it vendor just ran it virtualized so it isn't technically a bare metal server and they didn't look like a scrub. as far as they knew. gotcha. **their backup paranoia was definitely justified.** there was an el cheapo home-grade nas plugged into the back of the server by way of usb, and a scheduled task in the vm set to run windows backup once daily. it hadn't produced an actual backup in over 9 months. there isn't really much more to say about that. just drink. **the ad interface was visibly slow, and the isp was hosting their email.** just opening windows on the server's desktop was pokey, so that explained the "overloaded" thing - trying to run hyper-v guests on a couple of mediocre-at-best conventional disks isn't likely to impress anybody for performance. and they were running isp-hosted email, so, yep, that's gonna suck all right. so i ask one more question - are you concerned about *off-site* backup? yes, they say, absolutely, that's mandatory going forward. ok, site survey is done, i've got this. **at no point did *anybody* say *anything* about a printer. remember that, please, it's important!** anyway, i write up a proposal and come back onsite to talk to them about it. office365 for the email, problem solved there. i told them about [sanoid]( and how it could solve their remote backup problem as well as their performance issues, and they were on board, contingent on me doing a good job with their office365 transition. their o365 migration goes swimmingly, so now we're golden to proceed. **i give them a good/better/best, and they unhesitatingly shoot for "best".** sweet, i get to set this up right! so, three new sanoid boxes, with fully solid state storage. we're going to have a production vm host, an onsite hourly-replicated hotspare host, and an offsite daily-replicated dr host. *n* hours to migrate all their apps and data from the old hardware to the new, do any hand-holding, etc. **a week or so later, i bring in the new hardware and start setting things up.** new domain controller guest on production. new appserver guest on production. hourly replication to the hotspare. daily replication to the offsite. robocopy all of their data from the old server to the new one, get rid of the shitty batch file in netlogon that was inconsistently mapping their drives and frequently conflicting with memory card readers, lenovo recovery partitions, and god knows what else. replace it with some proper gpo to map their drives consistently. install their industry niche apps, punch holes in the windows firewall that those apps' installers either failed to punch or failed to punch *correctly* (looking at you, sage, get it all in one sock ok?), tested, ran through workstation setups, fixed a few local issues on workstations' problems as they were flushed, got a *new* industry niche app installed, and i'm almost ready to call it a day - everything's up, users are happy, new servers are smoking fast and eliciting happy comments from the users and owners, life is good. **suddenly, an anguished cry from down the hall: "dammit, the printer *still* doesn't work!"** so i head on down to the print room, where a canon ir copier and a user both stare balefully at me. the user demonstrates scanning a document to the network, which should work just fine - the user, who is quite technically competent, had already updated the address book to point to the new vm - and, in fact, it *does* work just fine. the user, frustrated, says "well of *course* it works with you standing here." i grab a piece of paper out of the tray, sketch a hasty smileyface on both sides, and scan again. it works again - but it's a bit weirdly hitchy and slow. the user's frustration increases, but i'm pretty sure i know what's up now. i scan my double-sided smiley-face again, and this time i get a complete failure to connect to the server, and the user says "see?! ... but the new server was supposed to *fix* this!" *(wait, what?)* "ok, what is this thing's ip address?" *that* one stumps the user, so i do my best nick burns your company's computer guy imitation, gently shoulder her aside, and rummage through the canon's blecherous local interface for myself. i knew *exactly* what i was going to find. **the copier tech dhcp'ed the copier to get an ip address, then immediately static'ed it to the address s/he'd gotten by dhcp.** the damn copier techs *always* do this. and it works fine until after the copier tech has left the scene of the crime - but then the dhcp lease expires, and the router marks that address available again. now, the next time some *other* device's lease expires while it's powered off, the router hands it the address the *copier* is squatting on when it powers back on and requests a new one. now you have a copier that randomly works and doesn't work, and a random device elsewhere in the office that *also* randomly works and doesn't work. sure enough, the client's dhcp range starts at .100, and the damn copier is static'ed to .104. so i run to a workstation, ping .99, arp .99, confirm that nothing's on .99, and run back and re-static the copier to .99, and of course it all works, every time and without weird hitchiness or slowness either. go, /u/mercenary_sysadmin, it hero, savior of the print room (and whatever poor random user keeps drawing the loaded chamber in the daily game of dhcp roulette, too). **the final task left that day is setting up a new workstation for the same user who flushed the copier problem.** that went without incident, and she was super happy about her new ssd-and-dual-monitor-equipped machine, so, yay. after that was done, before heading out for the day i spend a few minutes talking to her and to the internal semi-unofficial it czar who is my main point of contact for the company... and they let drop that the entire reason i was brought in, which i had never heard of until that day, was *the mysteriously and randomly non-functional copier*. the copier vendor had told them "their network was overloaded", their old it vendor pointed fingers back at the copier people but couldn't actually figure out what the problem was, so i got brought in to replace the old it vendor and here we were. i was stunned. **they literally just spent 17 grand to change an ip address.** don't get me wrong, obviously they got a *hell* of a lot more out of the deal than that, but *the ip address* was what they actually wanted fixed in the first place. i hesitantly pointed that out to them, but, happily, they had no regrets. "nah - your name is going to be *golden* here for the next few months at least, 'cause *the copier actually works*." **"besides, all that other stuff really needed doing anyway."** and it did - it really really did, i could talk for hours about how much better off they are now - but, *damn.*this, dear reddit, is is a story of justice. a tale of evil clients and knights in shining qa departments. &amp;nbsp; **the setting:** our company runs a set of databases with a light website for managing reports on data, all of which is used as a customer management system for a large number of large clients that want to host websites but don't want to manage a database to sit behind it. **the heroes:** i work as a lowly qa tech in a qa department of about 8. i've been working in this place for about 5 years now and i'm frequently asked to sit in on calls with clients. they trust me enough now to leave me to get on with things and communicate with the client directly if there's anything i want to ask about. my boss is a certified legend with a degree from the college of how to earn respect. the guy lets me get on with my work and takes care of all the business side and interdepartmental politics. great boss. my good friend (who we'll call greg) works as a fairly senior member of the customer support department. greg's got my back and i've got his. if he has something come through that he needs help with or looks serious then i'll help him out. **the villain:** the client's project manager (who we'll imaginatively call... douche) was tasked with being the gateway for all communication with us and was either extremely vague or mathematically incompetent whenever he discussed the requirements for what would be delivered. when paired together, these things often mean that bad things will happen. to make things worse, this guy was intentionally insulting because he could get away with it. after all, he is a paying customer. **the pledge:** the client paid us for a piece of work where we made a custom api which we expose on our soap interface. it was a good feature, and one which our sales representatives had probably been told to try and get a client to fund for quite some time. implementing it was a nightmare because they had added some complex functionality in their requirements document just before they signed it off. all my best attempts to try to resolve inconsistencies and make it work logically fell on deaf ears and eyes that refuse to read emails. one exchange with douche on this topic went thus: &gt;*me:* hi douche, its derp at &lt;company&gt;. just calling abou... &gt;*douche:* oh hi, yeah, the slacker at &lt;company&gt;. hows it going? it should be pointed out that we were slightly behind schedule because there were a number of outstanding issues in the database procedure behind the call, hence why this was obviously my fault. &gt;*me (biting my tongue):* i'm... i'm ok... thanks. just calling about your requirements on the api which you sent throu... &gt;*douche:* oh this again? haven’t you finished that yet? &gt;*me:* well, no. you'll remember that we've delayed it due to some issues with the procedure which you've been infor... &gt;*douche:* oh for the love of.. why is it taking so long? &gt;*me:* that's what i wanted to ask about. requirement 6.5.12 says its supposed to calculate x but lower down it states the maths you want it to use. the problem is that this equation doesn't actually represent that val... &gt;*douche:* look, you're supposed to follow the specification i've written, so just do it! i don't want to hear about this again until its done! the next day my boss tells me that douche complained about me to his account manager, saying that i was being offensive and was questioning his competency. (he can read minds?!?) i then completed this piece of work, ensuring that his specification was followed to every exact instruction. **the turn:** after the best part of 6 months, and the client is about to go live with their site. they've been trying to sort out their own internal testing teams and third parties for such a long time that we ended up completing the work a full 5 months before they were even able to test it, and at this point they were going live in 3 days because that's when their marketing campaign said it would. because of these tight deadlines, they signed it off in our acceptance testing sandbox and we considered the work to be complete. i had all but forgotten that previous conversation with douche. about 3pm friday afternoon, greg from cs calls me up says he's got an issue with douche. greg now knows first hand how douchy douche can be. this is because after our work was completed and promoted to our live system, any issues they had integrating were not development issues, but customer support issues. i make my way over to cs land and this is where things get fun. &gt;*me:* 'sup greg? (sipping my coffee because these usually involve a long conversation about the functionality of features) &gt;*greg:* hey derp.you ever worked on this new api that went up for &lt;client_name&gt;? &gt;*me:* yeah, i did the verification process on it. what do you want to know? &gt;*greg:* the client seems to think it doesn't work. &gt;*me:* it was implemented to the letter. plus other clients have been picking it up and using it since it went out, haven't they? &gt;*greg:* yeah, that's what i thought when i read the documentation. ok, leave it with me and i'll let douche know. i head back to my desk and start pulling out all the documentation i have on this feature because i know exactly what's coming next. after not too long, steve (the account manager for douche) storms into qa and straight into boss' office. there's a lot of shouting and raised voices and eventually i'm called in. &gt;*steve:* would you care to explain this? steve points at an email on boss' screen. i go in for a closer inspection and it's an email from douche claiming that their launch is probably going to be a disaster because the api has “obviously not been tested at all”. i'm surprised steve believes this because he knows me and i've worked on various projects for him in the past. &gt;*me:* i was firmly told my mr douche that i was to implement it to the specification. &gt;*steve:* but the reporting section of the response that comes out is utter nonsense! it doesn't make sense! &gt;*boss:* derp, what did the specification say about this? &gt;*me:* i can grab the documentation from my desk if you like. &gt;*boss:* i think that would be a good idea. i go and fetch the documents and all the eyes in the department are on me, wanting to know what's going on. on the way back, i see boss trying to calm steve down. &gt;*me:* here it is. i slide it across the desk and take a seat. steve and boss scan through it and find where it talks about these reporting figures and wait to be spoken to. steve turns a little pale and boss smiles. &gt;*steve:* but that makes no sense! &gt;*me:* i know. &gt;*steve:* why didn't you raise this with the client? &gt;*me:* i did. i then was accused of insulting the client’s project manager and calling him incompetent. &gt;*boss:* who wrote this specification? &gt;*me:* douche over on their side did. i'm pretty sure you two would have been cc'd on the email when it came across. &gt;*steve:* well what are we going to do? we have to fix this before they go live on sunday! (it's now 3:45 friday afternoon) &gt;*boss:* no chance. we only release new code on monday or tuesday unless it's a priority 1 issue. even then, this is an api that multiple clients are now using and we'll have to be careful not to break their integrations. &gt;*me:* steve, you might want to look at section 21 on that document. steve quickly flicks to this section of the documentation where the final clause states how any modifications to this constitute as a change request and chargeable work. steve is much more calm because he knows his ass is covered. that and i've made him some serious commission from clauses like that in the past. &gt;*steve:* ok, wait there. steve now stands a chance to make a considerable amount of commission. the client wrote the requirements, signed off the requirements, signed off the work in acceptance testing, and have only 32 hours before they launch. they will be willing to pay a significant sum to fund the overtime required from personnel to get this straight. **the prestige:** it's 4:45 and i am considering what i'll spend my weekend doing. boss walks out of his office and comes over to me. &gt;*boss:* can you just join me on a conference call? &gt;*me:* if it's quick. &gt;*boss:* that's up to you really. intrigued, i follow him into his office where i can hear a much more humble sounding douche on the phone, explaining to steve what needs to be done. &gt;*boss:* steve, i have derp here, do you want to explain what the plan is? &gt;*steve:* derp, we really need to get this sorted. you worked on the original feature so you'll know the best way to test this. we're still working on getting someone to develop the change but we'll be willing to pay you triple time this evening and tomorrow to work on this for sunday. we reckon we can do this patch without any impact to our other clients. &gt;*douche:* i really need you to help me out here mate, otherwise it'll really hit the fan over here. i pause and enjoy this brief moment of pure justice. &gt;*me:* i've already made plans for this weekend and... &gt;*douche:* derp, seriously, you have to help me out here. &gt;*me:* i don’t really feel like it. &gt;*douche:* well someone needs to fix this!! &gt;*boss:* it's 5pm on a friday. most staff are on their way home or out the door. sorry steve but it looks like it'll have to wait until next week. douche rages down the phone and, once this torrent of abuse subsides, steve lets me go back to my desk. i'm packing up for the end of the day and my phone rings. &gt;*me:* &lt;company&gt;, derp spea... &gt;*douche:* please, i need you to do this. &gt;*me:* you need to sort this out and calling me won't help you. &gt;*douche:* please, i'm sorry, just help me out. &gt;*me:* you have been extremely rude to me and insulted me whenever we've spoken. your failure to listen to me is the sole reason you're here right now. i did exactly what you asked and you have treated me with contempt every step of the way. i am not helping you. &gt;*douche:* please... he's actually crying. you can hear it in the way his voice is all shaky. so i hang up and leave for my weekend. **the reveal:** monday rolls around and steve introduces me to a new project manager for the client who's organising the fix to the api. &gt;*steve:* so, derp, this is herp. another project manager for &lt;client_name&gt;. &gt;*me:* is douche not working on this project? &gt;*herp:* douche no longer works here. tl;dr: douche pm for client writes spec for api. sproc logic makes no sense, pm thinks he's infallible. qa tech questions logic, gets reported for being insulting. client doesn't test the api, signs it off anyway. it hits the fan, release date is ruined. pm is in deep and pleads for help. qa tech hangs up and enjoys weekend even more.[previous]( i looked down at the three boys who stood in front of me. one stared back defiantly, one was busy day dreaming and the third was busy eyeing redcheer, who was another it staff member. &gt;me: hello… my mind raced to find an appropriate word; kids, youths. too informal. &gt;me: … guys. so welcome to it, i’m airz. today i’ll be assigning you each a mentor. they’ll guide you through your placement here. the boy who’d been busy eyeing redcheer quickly put his hand in the air. his shirt said cumgetsome, so i was already worried about his life choices. &gt;me: er… ya? &gt;badshirt: can i have her as a mentor? badshirt pointed to redcheer. i was torn between his shirt and the eager look in his eye. redcheer however smiled. &gt;redcheer: haha, i’ll take you on. on one condition… &gt;badshirt: name it. anything. &gt;redcheer: go home tonight, change clothes, then cut up that shirt. physically shred it. if you do that, i’ll take you as my sidekick. badshirt seemed torn. he looked down at his shirt longingly. &gt;badshirt: i’ll think about it. that exchange over, i introduced the boys to the other it staff member solitaire, who’d only agreed to take a student on the condition he got to pick which kid. after the introduction, solitaire looked thoughtful. &gt;solitaire: okay, which of you fella’s play computer games? all three of the hands shot into the air. solitaire slightly smiled. &gt;solitaire: who wants to work hard here? two of the hands shot up. the third, the boy initially daydreaming hesitantly rose. &gt;solitaire: you, young mr. hesitant, you’re **my** sidekick. &gt;redcheer: okay badshirt. you’re my sidekick… the two boys walked away with there respective mentor’s. i looked at the final boy, he still seemed defiant but his eyes looked hurt. i smiled down at him. does flattery work on teenage boys? i asked it myself. &gt;me: lucky me. i get the best student. &gt;defiant: the best aren’t left till last. generally. ouch. i decided to recover by changing topics. &gt;me: so what do you know about it? &gt;defiant: more then most. i walked back to my office and gave defiant a seat. he didn’t seem like a happy young man. &gt;me: anything specifically? any programming you’ve picked up or… stories about it you’ve done that you wanna tell? &gt;defiant: programming’s easy. i waited for a follow up but… it never seemed to come. defiant wasn’t much of a talker. apparently. &gt;me: lets get to work then. the ticket queue says there’s a network problem in accounting. lets go up and see. ***** arriving at the problem area i soon saw the problem. a networking cable had come off from the wall socket. i plugged it back in and the accounting computer afflicted starting working as normal. the accountant affected came back from a coffee break to find his machine working, he started thanking me and defiant profusely. &gt;acc: thank you. thank you. you’re so fast. &gt;defiant: what you had here was a standard rj-45 cable kick out. happens a lot as the cables get older, the weaker plastic in the connector snaps and physical connections get hard to maintain. the accountant started looking worried. his eyes darted between me and defiant. &gt;acc: a kick out? whats that? will it keep happening? i opened my mouth to respond but defiant was already talking. &gt;defiant: best course of action. replace the cable if the connector has broken. luckily we’re examined the piece and can confirm it is still in fine shape. if it happens often we occasionally offer supplemental physical attachments to secure the cable, however airz and i have discussed it, and we believe it won’t be necessary in this case. &gt;acc: er… well thank you. so much. as we walked away a million questions swamped my mind. &gt;defiant: so, this is all you do? plug in cables all day? &gt;me: no…. what about you though, all those words to just say “plugged in a cable”. what was that all about? &gt;defiant: meh, fun. meh. a word i’d hear a lot over the next two weeks. ***** as the three boys left the office after the first day, i watched them leave with a smile. &gt;redcheer: had fun today? this fortnight might not be so bad you know. &gt;me: haha, maybe. little did i know one of those three boys was the devil. [next](i am a semi retired, semi burnt out old tech spending my declining years in a small rural town. i service a mixed bag of farmers, small business and domestic clients. the work is varied. the clients are generally pleasant. there are exceptions. a solicitor ran a small legal office, just him and a part time secretary shared a single computer. it died, and naturally there was no backup. when i opened it up it was filthy, it had overheated, and was shutting down randomly, and half the caps where bulging. i replaced the motherboard, dropped in a bigger hard drive, upgraded from xp, and recovered his data from the old drive. i even set up a simple backup using a couple external drives. the solicitor was happy, i had saved his data, and set him up with a much better computer. i invoiced him, and that's when the trouble started. he just didn't pay. no complaints from him, he just ignored the bill. i tried gentle reminders, i tried appealing to his sense of fairness, i tried letters demanding payment. nothing. eight months later the solicitor called, frantic. he had tried to update practice management software he used and had failed. he couldn't tell who owed him, and wouldn't you know i was the only tech within a 200 kilometer radius with any experience with this software. i agreed to help him provided he settle the outstanding invoice in cash before i started working. when i arrived at his office he offered a cheque. i politely declined the offer and waited on his doorstep as went to the bank to withdraw the cash. when he returned i told him that the work would take around two hours to complete and sent him back to the bank to get the payment before i would start work.. the actual job was simple, i rolled the database back to the previous day, upgraded it to the current release, and then the program upgraded without a hitch. the best part was that the process took just over two and a half hours, so at precisely two hours in i stopped work and asked for prepayment for another hour. the solicitor had enough cash on hand to avoid a third trip to the bank. i finished the job, thanked him for the work, and wished him a cheerful good day. tl/dr: solicitor doesn't pay long outstanding bill, but his own incompetence forces him to pay the account. not tech support but i do assist people with logging on to their internet accounts. generally this can be fairly straight forward but it always depends on the user at the other end. received a call from a lady born in the 20's, so pushing 90. she was having trouble logging onto her out website. she had recently purchased a new computer, everything else was set up correctly except for the issue of logging in. when you click login, the login screen appears in a pop-up, but nothing was showing on her screen. she was unable to advise me what browser she was using, so i had her described her toolbars etc. turns out she was using chrome, finally get her through the process, enable pop-up etc, and she is able to log in. she told me at the end of the call that she had sought assistance from her son, who had given up in frustration, been to our retail store, who were unable to help. it took me over 30 minutes to get her there, she didn't lose patience or get stressed and we kept battling away. it was nice to assist someone that appreciated rather than the majority of callers, who don't listen to what you say. tl/dr: chromed an old lady with a pop-up.so a few days ago i get a call from a client who is hysterical. she immediately starts with "ive really screwed up." "whats the problem?" i ask. "i accidentally emailed my computer to a client." at this point, i'm just thinking *oh...honey no.* but i match her level of urgency and get her to remote me in and explain what is happening. after i get connected she shows me the email she sent and it had a zip file attached. "i just wanted to send one file, but when i open it up my whole computer is in there." she claims. she proceeds to double click on the zip file, which opens in explorer and of course, shows her disk drives and network shares on the side. "i double checked and forwarded it to someone else here and they saw my whole computer too" well of course they saw the same thing. everyone has a c drive and they all have the same network folders. i figured out who she forwarded it to so i could explain how wrong they both were and closed the ticket. tldr: woman emails zip file, thinks whole computer got emailed because zip files open in explorer and her sidebar is in explorer.i received a ticket that a user isn't able to access one of the online tools that we have. it runs on java, but because it hasn't been updated, it can't use a version higher than java 7u67. i've dealt with it many times before, i just remove whatever version is installed, install 7u67, and set security permissions. sometimes java updates due to some end users having local admin rights because they are developers or constantly traveling. this guy is a developer. i remotely connected and saw the site not displaying properly, i checked the java settings and they were correct, but the site still gave issues. i logged in with my admin account and opened up programs and features to find a long list of unapproved software on his computer. me: "ok besides java i have to remove a lot of these programs, you should not have skype, the android sdk, these root applications for phones, a bunch of these actually." user is hesitant but says ok, but as soon as i start removing java he begins flipping out, saying i ruined his java sdk environment. all i removed was the 7u80 run time environment. user: "i need these applications! you ruined my install! you abuse your power! i will report you for this!" me: "i didnt ruin anything, i removed the runtime environment, your sdk is not involved with it. the rte is used by the browser." after struggling to let me finish, he flips out again. he tells me he's going to report me for "breaking" his computer. i confirmed the site is working. user: "this is ridiculous, why are you forcing me to use an old version of java for this site? if i knew this i wouldnt have had you change anything. who are you to decide we use this?" me: "i didnt decide anything, these are the rules that are in place, the creator of the internal site did not add support for newer versions of java, this is what you have to use in order to use the site." he starts getting uppity again, claiming it's all my fault and then slams the phone down. i called my manager on his personal cell phone to tell him what happened. after telling him about me "abusing my power": boss: "abusing your power my ass, there are rules in place. he's running loads of unauthorized software. no one says that shit to my team. we'll talk in the morning about this, i'm going to find this user and rip his computer away from him to remove all unauthorized software and his admin rights. i'm going to speak with his manager too" (if anyone wants an update tomorrow, let me know) edit: i didnt tell my boss that skype was installed, that's a security violation here. i can smell justice already. - mini-update: my boss is in meetings but will talk to me about what happened, don't worry guys, i'll get you an update [update]([previous]( gazing across my desk at the company consultant i realize my mid-day coffee is absent. as i get up to retrieve it from the break room i’m interrupted. &gt;con: airz! have you been listening to a single thing i’ve been saying? &gt;me: umm, just getting up to get some coffee. &gt;con: what was i just talking about? &gt;me: do you? want coffee? i looked over at the break room, my mug sitting silently on the shelf. &gt;con: oh errr, you’re so nice, you could tell i was getting thirsty. i smiled, coffee was in my sights. i started to walk over to the break room. &gt;con: you haven’t asked how i take it yet. &gt;me: oh…. &gt;con: obviously we already have a connection, you probably already know. i looked between the milk and sugar. two percent, full, skim, white, raw, sweetener - too many choices. &gt;me: how do you take your coffee? &gt;con: naww come on. trust your instincts. with no help i decided i’d go the middle road. &gt;con: while you’re over there, i might take a quick look at the anonymous ideas box. i smiled. &gt;me: read them out, we can go through it together now. &gt;con: first one says, anything from ac/dc. what the hell is this? &gt;me: pffff… people are weird. read out the next one. i grabbed a glass and poured all the different types of milk together. stirring, naturally so they combined. &gt;con: oh this one says, it should aggregate a list of music that's popular and get people to vote. okay, music? am i missing something? &gt;me: errr… i guess we’re missing something together? i realized how weird that sounded. it didn’t matter, i was too busy combining every type of sugar, to make super sweetened sugar. &gt;con: oh together? &gt;me: try the next idea. &gt;con: please don’t play any rap music, i hate rap music if i had to listen to it i’d probably die. oh and i don’t like country either. i looked up at the shelf that held coffee. instant or … brewed? &gt;con: sounds like people don’t like it when it plays music. &gt;me: yeah, i guess we should write that down? &gt;con: yes! finally some feed back we can use. i decided to be nice. brewed coffee went into the cup, along with the super sugar and hybrid milk. i handed it over to the company consultant. &gt;con: thanks honey, one more email i think. &gt;me: sure. &gt;con: it should have a timer, so we know how long its been from the moment we make a ticket till the moment they arrive at our desk. the company consultant looked down at her coffee. she took a sip. &gt;con: what the **** is this?……………it’s brilliant. i hope she was talking about the coffee. …. please be talking about the coffee.

why does it disappear? it's personal now. our antagonist is determined, she will succeed in opening this attachment one way or another! some minutes of running in loops miss secretary realizes the vital component of this battle for honor. it's the antivirus... &gt;rightclick -&gt; temporarily disable protection already feeling the taste of victory she proceeds to open the attachment. &gt;"cannot open file: it does not appear to be a valid archive" oh my god! &gt;the stupid antivirus broke the email! i better ask the person to send it again! &gt;reply -&gt; such.dodgy@email.wow *oooh, that's cool, email lets me respond directly to the person even though its from facebook! technology is so cool!* &gt;hello, &gt;i have received your message with the attachment, but the antivirus program broke the attachment. could you please send it again to my personal email? personal.email@google.com &gt;regards, &gt;best secretary ever several days pass with no answer. the whole broken attachment business gets forgotten completely and everyone is happy. until today... &gt;her: hello, it guy, can you come take a look at my computer? it doesn't work. &gt;me: sure, lets go take a look. we get to her computer and a *nice warm sight of elliptic curve cryptolocker ransom screen* greets me. (to be precise it was ctb) to disperse the awkward silence she plomps this gem: &gt;her: oh i was thinking of getting coffee with colleagues while you fix this. i immediately start asking questions about backups and if she put them on the hard-drive i gave her. as expected every single answer consisted of either *"no"*, *"uhhh"* or *"i don't know"* she also managed to somehow turn cobain and other backup fail-safes off. obviously everyone wants me to recover the data because there was a lot of important data in there. talking 2 years of documents. i'm pretty sure we're switching to linux soon... tl;dr secretary uses her adamant willpower and idiocy to open attachment that contained a cryptolocker. all files are rekt. this whole thing could be compared to telling a mentally challenged kid to not put his finger in the meat mincer and then getting shouted at because he did anyways.i am one-man it for a small company. i need a file from $hr_lady. "hey, $hr_lady, can you email me this file i need?" "it's actually on the x drive. do you have access to that?" "yeah, i have access to... everything." "really?" "well yeah, i'm the it guy." "not the hr drive! you can't have access to that!" "okay, uh, then i won't give myself access to that."analog cable is dying all over, allowing our cable telco to use the broad spectrum range that once had to be dedicated to uncompressed video feeds to better use. one of the cooler ways we're putting all this (substantial) bandwidth capacity to use was actually suggested by my better half who pushed to set up a test node where we'd dedicate all freed up bandwidth exclusively to expand our internet multiband capabilities. it required new multiband modems able to handle a lot more qams than those we used for years, but we might now actually hold a record on downstream speeds over copper wire thanks to that. it's still just tests and as marketing has other ideas about how to use some of the freed-up qams, it's likely that the new plans we'll ultimately offer won't get as many bands nor reach the same speeds as we're currently testing. but still, it's cool to reach downstream speeds normally available only with fiber over plain old cable. as usual, i ended up on the 'readiness test taskforce' for that project. [i've learned long ago that whenever you're assigned to any sort of special team for something new and untested]( even if it's as simple as doing something we already offer on a greater scale, you get carte blanche on almost everything and given a wide berth by management, so i'm always the first volunteer. this was one of my first calls on the dedicated line set up for issues about it. &gt; bytewave: "hyper-wideband project, you have tsss, bytewave." &gt; jack: "hey this is jack, road tech, hwp install. i have insane packet loss on this install, need your eyes. probably radio frequency issue but my meter isn't being helpful, it's like the line is dead but the modem actually hooks up fine despite the packet loss." &gt; bytewave: "sure, just a sec." ... &gt; bytewave: "got it! the traditional wideband range is all clear which is why you're technically online. but every and each ex-analog frequency is red. the most logical explanation would be that.." &gt; jack: "goddammit. i already checked the panel for this. gimme a minute, i'll find the damn thing." and he puts me on hold, without me even having to explain. i literally had a sigh of contentment. that's another perk of project taskforces; they actually put good techs on them. he instantly knew what i was gonna say. i scoured the customer's file trying to find any evidence that an analog passive filter is installed on grounds but found none. long ago, when analog piracy was rampant and hilariously easy (install a splitter, get your neighbor's cable!) the best way the telco had to limit it was to install analog filters whenever techs noticed such setups. normally, they'd be pretty easy to find and documented, but many years before i started here, documentation standards were less than stellar and/or confined to a system that long went out of production, so we lost track of some. furthermore, though they were designed to be difficult to remove, some crafty (non-)customers found ways around these to keep pirating cable. so old-school techs used to hide the analog filters creatively in certain cases, such as if they believed the customer had tempered with one or bypassed it. minutes later... &gt; jack: "i'm not even mad, this is amazing. the drop coming in here goes through the gutter and this customer's analog filter was hidden in there, rustiest one i've ever seen. wish i knew if he lived here back when this was installed." obviously, by scrambling the frequencies once used for analog, this was the cause of the massive packet loss on 'hyper-wideband'. &gt; bytewave: "lemme just log on recoveries' tools .... annddd that's a yes. we've had the person living there as a paying customer for 16 years, but there's a note about the potential from 24 years ago about analog piracy naming the resident by name, and it's a match. but we won't be able to actually..." &gt; jack: "yeah, i know the drill, we gotta pretend we don't know. anyhow, now we have 0% pl, 8ms, full 'hyper-speed'. thanks for the assist, i'm out." [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](not much of a story, but i recently started a job as the technology guy at a school. this is okay, but for some reason, we allow teachers and other staff to set priority on tickets themselves. this, naturally, leads to practically every ticket being marked as high, or urgent. above that are emergency and critical, which they apparently can't see or no doubt i'd be deluged with emergency and critical tickets about coming down to change printer ink cartridges or something. in any case, i take enormous satisfaction in reassigning most tickets to low or medium.it was a typical spring day in britain: unnaturally cold yet the sun shone with retina-piercing rays. it was the kind of weather where you need a few layers of clothing but with sunglasses as well. in fact, it was on this day i pondered, "when people are cold, they wear shirts, jumpers, cardigans, jackets... why never anything on the legs? why has nobody invented jumpers for legs!?" this eureka moment kept me company all the way to the office that morning, pondering this conundrum! a week had elapsed since the jon6 vs angie showdown. we were playing angie's bluff, abiding her new court rules to the letter and sought permission for every single visit to the it cupboard. sometimes it was a stern and sharp no! other times it was a reluctant yes but only after waving a ticket number in front of her face. such a cupboard-bound session would always be followed up with her dropping in at intervals which appeared to be so very desperately random. the mindset was obvious: we were obviously skiving, shirking responsibilities and up to no good! her grand entrances into the cupboard where the handle was turned even before her security card had finished triggering was as if to catch us in some red act that she could grow fat on! for me, given my near permanent residence there, i devised a rather fun game, trying to estimate when these visits would occur. if i could time it right, i would make a visit to user's desk-side, machine-on-trolley, just in time to pass her in the corridor on her way to the it cupboard so i could nonchalantly whistle a happy tune, just going about my business! i managed to pull this off a few times. she would have her stinking coffee in one hand, handbag poised for another session of studying me as i worked, reprimanding anything she felt like, only to be caught out because i was on my way out! those few times i'd pass her in the corridor like this, her soulless grey eyes would stare straight ahead, shrouded by her forehead wrinkled after many years of just abjectly hating everything, just as if i just didn't exist. this eventually stopped being fun as i would often find she would just sit and wait for my return to the it cupboard, her presence just a grim spectral shadow in the background like a precariously balanced rock perched on a cliff-side as in those cartoons. she would come and go as she pleased, seemingly annoyed in my indifference, occasionally bursting into fits of sharp conceit where i couldn't do right for doing wrong! the sad reality is, it wasn't all fun and games. angie's frequent verbal attacks, accusatory questioning tactics and consistent throwing of spanners in the works made for a very stressful working environment for everyone in the team. there were many occasions where her actions and whims would cause a ticket to go wrong in some fashion, leaving the team to try to pick up the pieces. in one incident, qbg had a traveling sales rep due to see her about a usb hard disk he was having trouble with. she had correctly diagnosed most likely a failure of the actual hard disk and had requested a new usb disk to await his arrival where she would transfer any data he needed. however, one of my tickets was a simple request for a new usb hard disk which i had duly placed on the purchase order list. angie, knowing that qbg had the last usb drive in stock, had mafg complete my ticket using the same usb drive qbg had waiting in her desk drawer! mafg was unaware of qbg's ticket, i was aware of qbg's ticket but not that mafg had been told to go and action mine using qbg's hard disk. when qbg found out, the rep was already at her desk waiting to pick up his new drive. little things like that seemed all too commonplace now. even though angie had caused it, it would just look like our own incompetence, orchestrated by this total bitch! i was particularly reminded of the omen soundbyte, "...turning man against his brother, until man exists no more!" i think what irritated angie was that in the face of this deviousness, i always stood up and appeased customers. in the above case, qbg was close to tears with an angry rep on her hands - this had been agreed between them for at least a week. angie sat happily clicking around touchpaper while the rep blew up. i waded straight in and simply took liability, claiming an administrative oversight. qbg and several others on the team were juniors, they looked to me for mentoring, advice... who was i to leave them in the lurch? i managed to appease this rep by offering to run out to the local pc world and grab one up for him. just one of the many incidents angie seemed to orchestrate! added to that, my held-together-with-tape nokia was suffering frequent call drops. i missed my blackberry. tuesday came - our 40-string epic induction session arrived fresh from birmingham. mafg and i stood by the training room windows as hoards of lads and lasses from "oop north" stepped off the coach. we knew full well that they would be in no mood for sitting straight down for a stuffy it session. it appears that my inspiration to order fresh tea, coffee and bacon rolls for their arrival was a good one! as the delegates stormed the sanctity of the training rooms, armed with smiles and northern accents galore, all lunged hungrily at our offering of breakfast! there was much joy to be had. i couldn't help but notice angie's indomitable presence at the back of the room as she sat, piercing-eyed and miserable, waiting for us to start. one of the new ladies quipped at me in her birmingham accent, "who's that sour-puss at the back?" after explaining she was my manager, she instantly empathized with a cheerful laugh and "blimey, ya poor sod!" mafg and i split the groups into two manageable pieces. i thought that this may throw angie the dilemma of having to balance her disapproving looks between two rooms, closely monitoring and judging our every moves. it seemed, however, she was perfectly happy to sit motionless at the back of my session, at every moment fixating her eyes on me. she would ensure her comments were delivered at every coffee break, which seemed like orders and reprimands over every minor detail. her opportunity for managerial admonishment was stolen from her again; one of the delegate's new laptop had suddenly failed at the start of the session. angie motioned, about to take control and give me a solid dressing down until she was stopped in her tracks when i produced one of the three spare laptops, always prepared in advance just in case such a circumstance ever happened. i swapped the machine over, had the delegate log in and noted the new asset number for changing on ad later. angie's fingers were red as they clutched her coffee cup. she was almost pissed that i hadn't slipped up! yet again, there was no hope of lunch as angie ordered me to go and see hr tank with her "slow" pc. again it turned out hrt had simply decided waiting 10 seconds for a newly inserted cd-rom to spin up was far too slow and was causing her severe heartache - nothing to do with all that cholesterol then? after pulling several late nights the week previous to get laptops finished, phone contracts organised and hardware charged, the whole session went off without a hitch. of course, there were the usual attacks of angie's bitter comments. through it all, i did my best to ignore her and instead maintained a flirtatious joviality with my inductees. about 2pm, angie skulked out of the room. she looked past me as she walked out, as if she had gathered everything she needed to know and was off to put some other part of her devious plan into operation. her departure sparked a brief conversation about what a sour old woman she was and how they could never work for such a wench. i resisted the temptation to spill my guts, break down and tell this group of happy individuals what hell we were going through. i simply chose to leave it as, "yes, she is very difficult!" the afternoon ticked by to its conclusion. eventually the last delegate left the training room, armed with laptop off to make their way in the world. mafg and i sat drinking the last few drops of weak tepid coffee from the cafetiere looking out of the same window where we first saw the delegates arrive. we could see their coach driver perched on one of the front seats, reading a newspaper and drinking from a thermos flask, looking totally relaxed in the world. we sat quietly comparing observations on the delegates we had just met, congratulating ourselves on a job well done. i had left the door open; neither mafg or i noticed angie's skeletal figure appear in the doorway. our discreet musings of the day were cut short with her vociferous shriek, "exactly what is the meaning of this? who gave you permission to sit around, what is this a playground!?" we both startled upright, her voice almost shattered the glass. as we began clearing up equipment, powering down projectors and clearing desks of discarded wrappers, angie unleashed a full force critique of the day. "i don't see why this whole process had to take so long. maybe if you'd had stopped chinwagging, talking rubbish and making jokes, this whole thing could have been a lot quicker!" we knew that no comebacks would have worked with angie. she continued to berate us for another 20 minutes as we cleared the room down. just as we were ready to close up, we couldn't help but notice that another figure had appeared in the room. she was about 20, outfitted in a dress-to-impress suit and couldn't help but exude the fact that she was new to the company. she stood with trepidation and meekly knocked on the door. "excuse me," she said. "is mafg in here?" after acknowledging his presence, she gingerly pirouetted up to mafg and handed him an official looking envelope, his name and address on the front. she left the room just as abruptly as she had arrived, making sure not to make eye contact with anyone, not even to the near-approving look from angie. mafg and i, with a box of bits and projectors in hand, looked perplexed at what had just happened. angie left with the snipe, "i want you both back downstairs in 20 minutes after you've put that stuff away! and i want all your tickets reviewed by the end of the day!" we made our way to the sanctuary of the it cupboard and returned the gear to its rightful shelving space. mafg opened the letter, reading it aloud as his eyes sunk into his cheekbones. there it was. the letter was from hr, garbed with every official looking signature and stamp that you could possibly throw onto such a document. it stated he was to attend a meeting tomorrow with hr, angie and bhit. it also stated "you may choose to have a representative accompany you..." this was it... angie had made her first move in her new game. and it certainly seemed that the first casualty would be one of my closest allies: mafg. this terrible moment was mocked at the sight of the delegates re-boarding their homeward-bound bus. they were escaping the brutality of this situation, off to their lives of freedom and futures to look forward to. a clear contrast to ours, mired in the darkness of some hateful hag who it seemed had only just started! mafg didn't return to its that day; i agreed to do his late shift for him allowing his escape at 4pm to go collect his thoughts. angie had just upped the game. and we felt powerless to do anything about it!

someone else did it while you weren’t here!” angie’s tone was mired in the suggestion that my well-earned week off had proven me negligent, another spit in the face from this diseased rat. roland took his cue as if they were both reading from some psychic score, “yes, i did it. it wasn’t that hard really, just install everything and domain register it.” his simplistic insight into my carefully honed art was if to mock all that i had worked for and write it off as if he had found it unchallenging and inconsequential. “there’s far more than that!” i disputed. “you need to add the office wi-fi, vpn, antivirus, etc…” angie’s retort was sudden and venomous. “it’s been dealt with. roland is doing the builds. you would know that if you had read the revised project plan in your email! you said yourself that junior members need to have training as part of the project! he will consult you as needed!” it seemed roland had been furtively promoted again, this time within the echelons of his own team. i was now roland’s bitch! bhit seemed as if he would have done anything at that moment to disappear into a cloud of smoke as the rest of its still sat motionless with their eyes cemented into their pc screens, pretending not to hear this firework going off around them. my hint at checking roland’s work was again sharply rebutted; angie this time turned her chair to face me, her eyes like stilettos garnished with her down-turned, drawn-on eyebrows. her skeletal pointy chin moved in harmony with her bark as she added finality to this conversation. “you have other things to be getting on with. read the project plan and get back to work. roland will consult you when he needs you!” knowing there was no win here, i returned to my screen, outlook waiting like an obedient dog with 173 unread emails. i looked at bhit with a silent sigh, expecting him to interject in some way. instead he just shuffled away, obviously completely ill-equipped to properly deal with what had just happened. he uttered some empty promise of catching up with me later, but this was drowned out by the sifting sound his suit made as it transported him away. angie had been busy in my absence. an email forwarded to all the major players in this assignment was emblazoned with a send date of 10pm sunday evening – two days after i was last in the office - as if to prove angie’s so-called dedication to the cause. it was a carbon-copy of my well-thought-out and scrupulous project plan, except my involvement in almost every developmental stage had been written out, like a poorly written character in some novelist’s prose. roland’s new found sole-command of the technicalities seemed all too purposeful. angie had painstakingly placed me in the back-end of the entire rollout, promoting our newest arrival, her son, into the most delicate of tasks. the rat had risen to a position of power! i hated what had become of the project. my considerable and enumerated planning had been cast aside like a cheap newspaper as angie lay claim to its proficiencies in her bid to establish herself at the top of the food chain, ensuring that any credit traveling up would end with her. in a last ditch attempt to fight back, i emailed my concerns to bhit. the time scales of the project and angie’s apparent and purposeful transference of my responsibilities meant that the rollout was now very susceptible to failure. i fine-tuned my words for nearly an hour, striking a fine balance of concern without appearing confrontational. finally, after much deliberation, i took an all or nothing stance. i added a personal addendum in which i vented about angie’s disruptive nature within support, her constant criticisms and micromanagement, her fork tongue and angry, terminal attitude; bhit needed to get involved now and reign this beast back in. i couldn’t help but notice roland fawning over one of the new dell laptops, his prize that accompanied his birth right. no expense had been spared on these machines, attested to by the fresh, sleek black appearance. it was now being painted with roland’s clammy, greasy hands, the slimy fingerprints unnaturally obvious underneath the incandescent office lighting. i felt a sense of jealousy, like my obvious experience had been made irrelevant against this vassal creature’s ignorance. silence followed as the email disappeared from my outbox. the feeling i had was that this had either sealed my fate or marked a major turning point for the better. ten minutes went by, still no response from bhit. i sat, eagerly awaiting the outlook balloon which would at least acknowledge bhit’s reading of my plea. instead came the unmistakable sound of bhit timidly rising from his chair, the rustle of his suit seemed signatory as it served to fanfare his escape out of the office towards the main stairs. i was alone, in hell, with angie, her spawn, and several demoralized, broken and burned out its engineers. **previous** [pt1: a new world order]( ) [pt2: safety first]( [pt3: the it induction from hell]( [pt4: undercurrents]( [pt5: how to make friends and...]( [pt6: marking territories]( [pt7: one friday to rue them all]( [pt8: best laid plans]( [pt9: its one step for man]( [pt10: ...and one step back for its]( [pt11: bring home the solider]( [pt12: who needs minor victories...]( [pt13: dawn of a new nightmare]( [pt14: rules of engagement]( [pt15: bring out your dead]( [pt16: the greatest trick the devil ever pulled...](this happened two years ago, but i will never forget this, it was quite a memorable call. for accuracy, this caller was a middle aged, filipino woman from toronto. background: i did tier 2.5 tech support for isp (tier 2 plus direct access to scheduling and talking to the technicians) in canada. this is around 8pm, this woman calls, very upset, her internet hasn't been working properly for 3 months, and she was getting silly issues, all the departments would give her the runaround, nobody would actually sit there solve the issue. the call gets escalated to me, and i see the list of tickets, and her issue was clear, her profile was set too high, and the modem was just not able to hit those frequencies and would constantly drop (dsl), she also seemed to have a bad filter. no biggie really. now, to make this clear, this is the 9th call she puts in to us, and 3 months that she's getting frequent disconnects and constant slow downs. so i get this call, going through the regular process, making sure that everything has been checked before continuing with the fix (procedure), and i could hear the tv and her 5 year old in the back playing (she told me her 5yo daughter was there), and after 10-12 minutes, i hear the woman say spit it out spit it out!!. i asked if everything was ok, and she said, not to worry. i continue. 3 minutes later i hear the little girl say, momy, my stomach, and throat are burning. my mouth feels strange too. again, i was a little worried at this point, as the woman was already emotional with this ordeal of not fixing, she pressed for me to continue with the fix. but this time i asked what happened as her daughter was clearly in trouble, and she said, i shit you not. "she drank some of the bleach i had in a cup over there." then proceeds to tell her daughter to go and try and throw up. me, having done whmis the week before, and having a little common sense, knew that that was not the right thing to do, tell the woman "no! call poison control! you can't make her throw up, you're just going to make it worst!" so she tells her to go drink lots of water. at this point, i'm ready to shit myself, this woman, stressed out cause she kept getting the run around, finally found somebody that seems like he can solve her problem, tried to press forward. at this point i stressed again, "call poison control!! call an ambulance! this is your child!!". and then she said (this is saturday night btw) "we're going to church tomorrow morning, god will take care of her" i fucking lost it. having all her info, i tell her i must terminate the call. i hung up, already having googled poison control for the area, run to the staff room and call poison control. the guy on the other end thought it was a joke, some dude from tech support, calling from 5000km away is freaking out telling him that a customer's child just injested bleach. i give him my name, and all her details, phone number, address.. at this point, i was stressed out, bummed a smoke from a co-worker (i don't smoke, but boys that was a fucking amazing cigarette), and afterwards went back inside, and called the woman again. she's hysterical! crying, freaking out, she thought it was the emergency services again. but no, it was the internet tech support guy, the guy who made the woman realize that she could of lost her daughter. she thanked me, and hung up, as she was waiting on the ambulance. the following thursday i call the woman back, her internet still not working, started crying and telling me how great it was for me to care so much in a time where her thoughts were shadowed by her problems. her daughter ended up being fine, and needed her stomach flushed and stayed in the hospital for a few days as she digested a bit. i solved her problem, and that was that. that there is my most memorable call. tl;dr. called poison control for small child that drank bleach because her mother was too worried about getting her internet finally working again after months of issues. later on i'll post about my second most memorable call if you guys want.. internet tech support, aka suicide prevention line. edit: wow! thanks for all the great comments guys, i really didn't think it was a big deal. i just did what i felt was right, as my parents taught me. if you want to thank somebody thank my parents for giving me good values and common sense. edit 2: as promised, here is the (long) story about the suicide prevention tech support call i had a few months before this. (warning, wall of text) edit 3: thanks to whoever gave me reddit gold! i appreciate it. and thank you everybody, i didn't know this would make the top like that!ever since i was a little boy i wanted to do something in it. fiddled with tech since i was 13 and tried to go after the right degree. school could never hold my intrest but i still managed to get in at an it support helpdesk wich i really like, just not the users. every once in a while you get a good user, the ones that listen and do exactly what you ask. then againt there are users like the following, petrid dish of hate for the customer $pdoh, $sa for senior agent and $me. &gt;$me: speaking with brain at helpdesk, wich abuse would you like to lay on me? *(i can only assume this is what the user heard)* &gt;$pdoh: what did you do to our systems? my pc doesn't work and i can't print anything. &gt;$me: *asking credentials and vital info for our logging system* &gt;$pdoh: you know ful well wich pc this is! you ruined it! &gt;$me: sir, i can't help you if you won't tell me the information i need to log this ticket in the system. &gt;$pdoh: yes you can, you just dont want to fix this! &gt;$me: sir, i would like to help you but if you keep yelling at me i will end this call. *at this point its safe to not i have been at this company for 6 months so i have no idea how to handle rude callers, no protocol in place* &gt;$pdoh: i want to speak to a supervisor! &gt;$me: okay, i will transfer you, please hold on. *also note my supervisor is sitting at the desk next to me with a look of horror on his face as he heard most of the user yell.* &gt;$sa: supervisor helpdesk speaking, what can i do for you? &gt;$pdoh:*sweet as fucking nectar* yes, i would like to file a complaint versus the agent i spoke to, he was very rude all the while i was just trying to get a replacement for my screen since i accidentaly broke it and he would just yell at me. &gt;$sa: sir, these are very serious claims, it may even cost the agent his job. i will surely have a harsh word with my agent but if you want to file a official complaint we wil take this up with hr. &gt;$pdoh: yes, i would like to make an official complaint, i just wanted to work and now i am stuck here with a screen that is barely functioning. &gt;$sa: i will take it up and let you know our following step towards our agent who as you say mistreated you. i also ordered a new screen and it will arrive anything between now and 2 weeks. &gt;$pdoh: thank you so much for your help! i know we can trust the supervisors. this all happened 2 days ago and i had a meeting with my supervisor and our direct boss. we all listened to the tape since every employee signs their contract in wich it states every internal phone call gets recorded, most users dont care and shoudnt but whenever a official complaint is launched it is used. i knew what was coming, my supervisor knew, our boss sat there and coudn't even believe what he was hearing. i am in no problem at all but i got a feeling the user might ge written up or maybe get fired since this is a serious misconduct. where i live the law protects employees very well but i dont think it will protect him from being a lying sob. tl:dr: im paid to work, not to get abused. edit: i can haz formatting i'm still not sure exactly what went wrong here, but this crazy woman called me up to have her boss fired. i'm not talking about her supervisor, by boss i mean the owner of the company. first some background, i have this client that we don't get too many calls from because the company is pretty small, and to keep costs down the owner mandates that you have to know how to use a computer before you're allowed to work on one. so most of the calls we get are for actual computer problems. the whole company is owned by one single man, and he's an okay person, i've talked to him. then yesterday i get a strange call. now this lady who called is, shall we say, expressive. i've tried to recreate they way she says things in order to give you an idea of how it went. despite that i haven't gotten it all in there verbatim, not that i'd want to. **me:** helpdesk, this is wonderweirdo **crazy lady:** this is [crazy lady], i just fired [boss] and i need you to delete all his passwords. **me:** excuse me, you just fired [boss]? **crazy lady:** i haven't told him yet, i want you to kill his passwords so he can't get on the computer or get into the building. **me:** (confused) uh, ma'am, for any termination we need a termination notice to be sent to us by hr, and that may be a tall order for him, he owns the company. **crazy lady:** he doesn't own jack-shit. that useless motherfucker just had my brothers car towed out of the parking lot. his ass is fired, delete his codes now before i come upstairs looking for you. **me:** (sends im to manager to listen in) hold on a second, i can't just delete his access over the phone, besides he's the owner of the company, he signs the paychecks. **crazy lady:** fuck you, pussy motherfucker, you're fired too! get your ass out of here before i come upstairs and fuck you up!" **me:** you do realize this is a recorded line, you may wanna take a deep breath there. **crazy lady:** [lots of profane language and threats] just then my manager signals me to end the call. i just hang up and my manager tells me he's pulling the recording and sending it up. a half hour later i'm just derping on my pc when i catch a call that gets transferred over to me **me:** help desk, this is wonderweirdo **boss:** hi wonderweirdo, this is [boss] over at [client], i was told you got a call from [crazy lady] today and i wanted to hear from you what happened. i explain to him the gist of the conversation and that the recording should be available through my manager. **boss:** i just wanted to let you know that [crazy lady] has been removed from the building. i haven't heard what she said to you yet but she made such a huge scene we had to bring the police in, hr is taking care of the rest. **me:** it's not a problem, i didn't think she was really going to come after me, but it was obvious she was kind of unhinged there. **boss:** yeah, she's in the hands of the police now, she threatened a few more people around here. **me:** she said she was firing you because you had her brothers car towed, how was he involved, did he work there too? **boss:** no, there's been a mystery car parking in our lot for a couple weeks now. no one here seemed to own it, i decided to have it towed from our lot since we don't have enough space as it is. i think that she might have been allowing him to park there so he didn't have to pay for it else where and she just wasn't reporting the car. **me:** reporting the car? wait what did she do there? **boss:** she was the security guard at the front desk? **me:** are you serious? i hope she wasn't armed. **boss:** no, but i'm gonna call that agency about screening their people. **me:** hold on, how did a security guard at the front desk think she can just fire the owner of the company. **boss:** (i could hear him shrug over the phone) i have no idea. **me:** right. well if you need me to do anything else let me know, but i'm pretty sure the recording is on it's way to you already. **boss:** thanks, i'll be in touch. **update update update update** okay, i've done a little digging since i posted this. though this didn't make the news, through certain online sources i was able to find the arrest record. i was tempted to post it but that could have lead to a violation of privacy i'd have been on the hook for. this client is not in the same state as i am, it's all over the phone. i looked up the arrests in the city where the client is and found her. even though she was arrested for disorderly conduct and criminal threatening, those charges were expanded to include possession of crack-cocaine. which explains a great deal. my boss just got a new laptop, and insists on complaining about everything about it.....it's different and therefore must be bad, don't ya know! he calls me into the office to complain that the mouse is "jittery". i use the mouse and it seems to be working perfectly. i take the mouse to my computer, where it once again is working perfectly. so i wipe it down with a wet wipe and make it look as good as new. i put it in a random baggie, walk back into his office and act like i'm installing a brand new mouse. a few minutes later.... me: "how is it working for you now?" him: "much better, thank you...." ------------------------------------------ edit: by popular reqest, a link to [xereeto's placebo troubleshooting panel]( [previous]( monday morning. slightly scared, slightly confused, slightly angry. i look at the ticket queue to calm down. &gt;new ticket &gt;my email isn’t working. -hrsad email, not working. how… vague. i open up the ticket and email the user. &gt;hey hrsad, it’s airz in it can you clarify what’s not working? about a minute later the phone rings, its hrsad. &gt;hrsad: awww, hey. it’s me, hrsad. &gt;airz: oh, umm normally people just reply by email but… i suppose that’s not working? i heard hrsad clicking on things, i don’t really know what he was doing, but it took him a while to reply. &gt;hrsad: wha.. oh yeah i can receive, but not send. can you come up and take a look? i can’t really explain. a walk might calm me down a little, i thought. grabbing a coffee i walked to hr. upon arrival i was ambushed by hrsad, who showed me his mac. it was the apple mail client, it had a exclamation symbol next to one of his three mail accounts. &gt;me: weird. it says you need to re-type your password. the account was a yahoo account. &gt;hrsad: ahh man. i dunno it. try penelope five, that's my normal password. now i’m as casual about passwords as the next it guy, but this was said at full volume in an office. not even a whisper. i took a sip of my coffee to avoid commenting. penelope5 as a password, did not work. &gt;me: nope. we’ll have to recover the account. &gt;hrsad: oh, no. actually hrsnooze was with me when i made the account… maybe she’ll know. hrsad woke his colleague. &gt;hrsad: hey, hrsnooze can you remember my password? for yahoo. &gt;hrsnooze: wasn’t it like, penelope five? at this point i realized security in hr, was atrocious. &gt;me: maybe we should recover the account and change it… to something new. &gt;hrsnooze: yeah hrsad, it’s probably time you changed your password from your ex-girlfriends name… hrsad looked oddly hurt by that comment. &gt;me: lets just go through the security questions…. tears were forming. words were not. &gt;me: errrr…. hello? blank face. a single tear rolled slowly down hrsad’s face. he didn’t even wipe it away. &gt;me: whats your er… mothers madden name? still no wiping. the tear had hit the chin. it was threatening to drop. i tried to think of a way out… **keychain** &gt;me: you know what maybe we can recover your old password through keychain. i clicked onto the keychain icon and on yahoo email as the key i wanted to see. password prompt. i looked up at hrsad. he wasn’t saying a word. the single tear still threatened to drop. i thought about asking him this password... not worth it i decided. **penelope5** i typed in. access granted. i saw the password for yahoo displayed in all its glory. **penelope05** f*$%ing hr. [next]( click [here]( for something extra special.so, some of you may have read my last story, [here.] ( well, here's another one. at this job, i was on the internal helpdesk for a rather large company with over 1,400 employees, over roughly 30 sites. one morning, i'm at work, it's about 10:30am, i'd just come back in from my morning smoke and coffee. i set my phone to *available*, and sit down. instantly, my phone rings, so i answer. &gt; me: "thanks for calling helpdesk, this abra5umente. how may i help you this morning?" &gt; customer: "hi abra5sumente, i hope i've called the right place. i've got a bit of an issue here..." &gt; me: "i'm sure i can help mate, what's the issue?" &gt; customer: "well, it's just this damn bike again." did he just say "bike?" again? he's called before about this? &gt; me: "your... bike, you said?" &gt; customer: "yeah, the damn chain's come off and i've gotten my pant leg stuck in it." so i'm more than slightly confused at this point. this has to be a joke, right? &gt; me: "you want me to help you fix your bike? you are aware this is an *it* helpdesk, not a *general* helpdesk, right?" &gt; customer: "oh, i thought you were here to help us with things." &gt; me: "yeah, we are here to help you when your internet stops working or your printer explodes." there's a moment of silence, when eventually he sighs and asks me, &gt; customer: "so... you're not going to help me?" &gt; me: *i'm sure the exasperation in my voice was more apparent than i had intended* "ugh. i can help you. are you in $town?" &gt; customer: *he sounds absolutely thrilled* "oh really? great! i am in $town, just around the corner from $building. i can't get up to walk to the office." &gt; me: "okay, don't go anywhere (lol) i'll be there in 5 minutes." &gt; customer: "oh god, you're a lifesaver, kid!" i go around to the car park where he is, and it turns out he was an executive on the board. needless to say i helped him up, put his chain back on his bike for him, and sent him on his merry way. he explained to the ceo about why he was late, and he mentioned that i helped him, even though his bike lacks a motherboard. the ceo personally came to shake my hand and gave me a voucher for a free lunch at the bar in town. i really did love that job.first time posting-enjoying all the tales! this is one of mine, although i wasn't working in a "tech support" role i think it will fit :) a few years ago i was on the commissioning team for a $275 million dollar expansion to a large oilseed plant. the place was a beehive, with operations continuing in older parts of the plant while new parts were being brought online, and contractors, operations crew and "head office" commissioning people working alongside each other. being a modern facility, the majority of the pumps (and there were over 100) were electrically driven, with speed control by variable frequency drive (vfd). all of these vfds were tied into the internal control systems, and were networked devices. consequently, in the motor control centre (mcc) where these resided were two network racks. one sunday afternoon, i was in the control room, keeping things running semi-smoothly, when all 9 screens in front of me blanked out, then returned, with all the icons greyed out. outside in the plant, i hear the sounds of every motor spooling down... causing all sorts of mayhem. high level alarms, low level alarms, temperature alarms, boiler alarms, refrigeration alarms (you get the picture). i can't restart anything from the hmi (human-machine interface, ie: computer), so i boogie down to the mcc, and all the vfds are reading offline. i reset one, and it comes back up. i then manually reset all of them, and start bringing things back up. 6 hours later, we're back running. i mention this to management, and they say that the electricians, instrumentation, and it crews will look into it. next set i'm on days, and it happens again- once each day. i'm told that nothing was found, and they're looking for a software glitch. after that, i'm back on nights, and all is quiet. this continues for a few weeks, and a pattern starts to emerge. the plant-wide failures are only happening during the day, specifically when anyone is working in or near the mcc, or the cable trays leading to/from it. i bring this up, and am told "nope, we're sure it's software". fast forward to 2 weeks later, i'm coming back from vacation, talking to the guy i'm relieving. on his way out he casually mentions that they've solved the problem-plant's been stable for a week. turned out it was a badly terminated cat6 in one of the racks... being jiggled by the other cables being moved :) edit: wow! thanks for the upvotes... i'll see what else is lurking in my brain that might be of interest :)[previous]( heads of department meetings are always late in the day. the dread of their arrival ruins even the best of mornings. i get seated in my usual spot, the new secretary walks in. &gt;sec: anyone for tea? &gt;me: coffee please. &gt;sec: sorry, i can't serve coffee in here any more. tea? &gt;me: but you make such nice coffee. &gt;sec: boss's orders i'm afraid. the vp walks into the room, he's looking pleased with himself. probably put his shoes on the right feet this morning. &gt;me: vp, why is no coffee allowed in here? &gt;vp: oh, the smell. i'm afraid the new security manager is allergic to the coffee smell. &gt;me: allergic?! that... doesn't sound possible. &gt;hsec: i'm afraid it's true. every time i smell coffee i get bad flashbacks. &gt;me: i had coffee the other day, you seemed fine. &gt;hsec: oh... no, it was horrible. &gt;vp: we can't be making our head of security feeling uncomfortable can we? anyway on with the meeting, first up airz! i was starting to tune out, something i'd gotten used to in heads of department meetings of late. the mention of my name startled me awake. &gt;me: whaa.. what? &gt;vp: we'll need the budget for security. so it can be passed onto hsec. &gt;me: there's no budget. i just pulled money from it, since i was managing both. &gt;vp: well... we'll have to pull the costs from the last few months, so hsec knows what funds he has to work with. the vp looked down at his meeting notes. it was a blank page. the vp's grin was wide. &gt;vp: also airz, the christmas party is coming up. as you know, every year one of our departments gets to host the event. &gt;me: oh, is it my turn already? &gt;vp: yep, you'll get to plan the entire thing with our events co-ordinator. &gt;me: great... i looked over at the coffee machine. it was turned off at the wall. head of hr was sitting next to me, she'd been much nicer since i'd upgraded all of hr's computers. she tapped me out of dreaming for coffee and whispered in my ear. &gt;headhr: don't worry, i had christmas last year. the events co-ordinator will do everything, just pass it all off. &gt;me: good to know... i looked back over at the coffee machine. at least it wasn't being abused. it had no power though. after the meeting had ended hsec caught up to me in the corridor. &gt;hsec: airz! before the official numbers arrive i'd like to know about how much money i'll have for upgrades etc. &gt;me: upgrades, to... security? &gt;hsec: yeah, usual stuff. a few more cameras, a security car, maybe a few more guards. &gt;me: a car. that's ambitious since we don't have any roads between our buildings. &gt;hsec: yes, but what if we had an offsite emergency? &gt;me: call the police? we don't have to secure the world. &gt;hsec: we need to be prepared for all possibilities. that's why i need to know about what expenditure i'll get. &gt;me: hopefully, probably, something around the 50,000 mark for new expenses. &gt;hsec: oh that'll be plenty for the first month. &gt;me: errr... that was for the year. &gt;hsec: hahaha, good security means less losses elsewhere. &gt;me: well hopefully the vp can get you your money to... minimize losses. &gt;hsec: oh. i thought it was coming from your budget. &gt;me: hahaha, now you're just being silly. i felt a trickle of fear. just a trickle. [next](i've been meaning to post this one for a while now. i work in the tech support department for a small software company. i got a call a few months back that went a little something like this: me: "good afternoon, (software) tech support. this is fiercebrosnan." customer: "hi, something is really messed up. i'm getting an error message and i can't get anything to load in (software)." me: "ok. what does the message say?" the message is something that i've never seen before, and it does not sound good. me: "ok. let me connect in with you, and i'll take a closer look." i connect to his pc, and i see the message sitting there. i start to poke around. me: "when did you start seeing this message? i've never seen this before." customer: "well it really wasn't working right, so i kind of freaked out and started deleting stuff." no, i am not exaggerating. that sentence definitely came out of his mouth. it actually took a few seconds for me to process what he said and start speaking again. me: "...you started deleting stuff?" customer: "yeah." i dive into the folder structure to look for the database files required to run any project in this program and assess the damage. nothing. no files at all. dear god. i immediately head to his recycle bin and see a whole hell of a lot of important files pop up. whew. me: "well it looks like the files you deleted are still all in the recycle bin. there's a lot of stuff in here, and i don't want to try and sort out exactly what needs to be restored and accidentally miss something, so i'm just going to restore everything. is that ok?" customer: "yeah, that's fine." i restore everything. the files are all back where they belong. i launch the program, and everything works the way it should. i probably fixed a few other things on his computer, as well, considering his troubleshooting steps appear to start with "kill it with fire!". tl;dr guy has a software problem and decides the solution is to "freak out and start deleting stuff". i experienced first hand, almost word for word. guiding my mother through some fairly complex ideas regarding ocr of some pdfs of scanned text she's proofreading and correcting. basically she has scans of books, which the ocr has totally failed to read properly (because all ocr sucks), and then she corrects the text it produces, or adjusts the formatting in word. so far so good. she's been working with computers at home and at work for &gt;25 years, so this isn't beyond her capacity. i ask her what sort of file size the pdfs are, in case it's feasible to bulk copy a large number of them to my laptop and maybe do some cleanup of the scans so the ocr has more of a chance of not sucking. this is the good bit. she opens a pdf in word using the "previous documents" menu, opens the "insert image" menu, navigates to where she keeps the pdfs within her folder structure, right clicks a pdf, properties... and reads me the file size. i'm not sure whether to be shocked or surprised, laughing or cringing. she's using the file select menus in word as a file browser. my mother has used the windows operating system since early win 3.1 era, and has no idea what explorer is for. on further questioning, she refused to accept that her method isn't just as valid as my idea of *opening a folder using a program specifically designed for the task*, and was pretty certain that using menus in word was actually better, as it doesn't involve navigating to another program, so this method is much faster. what's worse, is that she may be right.so, i've just taken a call regarding poor wireless signal from a customer. &gt;me: so, what seems to be the problem with your wireless? &gt;user: well, it works when we're in the same room as the router, but as soon as we go outside, it drops. what are you going to do about it? your router is faulty. &gt;me: ok, as it's wireless there are a lot of factors that can cause issues with the signal. could you describe the room that your router is kept in please? &gt;user: well, we're in a converted bank. the computer stuff is kept in the vault. &gt;me: well, that's probably the issue, the walls are most likely reinforced, and are so thick that you can't get a signal through them. &gt;user: *after a minor bout of swearing at me* well, what are you going to do about it??? i want to cancel since you can't provide a service etc etc... she eventually hung up on me still not believing that 4 foot thick steel reinforced concrete walls may be the problem. tl;dr wireless won't work in a with a router in a bank vault also, edit:formattingobligatory long time lurker, first post sentence. many moons ago, i started my tech career for a big box technology retailer ($bbr) in the us which had just recently acquired a small technology support company ($tsc). during my tenure with $tsc i accumulated many stories ranging from comical to downright depressing. if this short is received well, i may begin to recount some of the more memorable ones. this one is about an older gentleman ($cust) who was likely making his first computer purchase ever. i worked for a store very near to one of the largest retirement communities in the state. &gt;geeks: thank you for calling $tsc, this is geeksbsmrt, how can i help you? &gt;cust: hi, i just purchased a new computer from $bbr and had you guys do your thing to set it up. i got it home and have been using it for a few hours. everything was working great, i went to get some dinner, came back, and the damned thing won't turn on. &gt;geeks: i'm sorry to hear that, sir. could you please give me your phone number so i can look up your purchase? pull up customer's purchase in computer system. &gt;geeks: i see you purchased a $mfg laptop, is this correct. &gt;cust: yes. &gt;geeks: great! thank you. let's start with the basics, when you got home, did you remove the laptop and power cord from the box? &gt;cust: just the laptop, it's wireless so it doesn't need a power cord. /headdesk did i hear that correctly?! &gt;geeks: sir, could you please check the box, underneath a small cardboard flap there should be a power cord. &gt;cust: i'll look but your salesman said it was wireless. &gt;geeks: yes sir, it is. may i ask you a question? do you have a cell phone sir? &gt;cust: yes. &gt;geeks: is it wireless? &gt;cust: ah, i get what you're saying. i have the power cord and will plug it in for a while. how long does it take to charge? &gt;geeks: about 4 hours sir.[previous]( i walked into it the next morning feeling good, even our night owl of staff were happy. &gt;owl: really quiet last night… &gt;me: haha, this competition has made tickets pretty scarce. &gt;owl: nah nah, quieter then that. it was amazing! he gave me a broad smile and left for home. i’d never seen him so cheery, maybe i just never saw it before. new perspective on life. i sat down with a coffee and looked down at the ticket queue. zero tickets. perfect. maybe the positive vibes i’m generating is causing everything to go well for once. two coffee’s, zero tickets later i hear a knock at the door. it was solitaire, he didn’t look happy. didn’t matter, i’d soon cheer him up. &gt;sol: we have a problem… &gt;me: don’t be silly, everything is good. come in, take a seat. i’ll grab us some coffees. positive vibes out into the universe, positive vibes would return. &gt;sol: no no. airz. listen we have a serious problem. &gt;me: okay. whats wrong? positive vibes were on the way. just gotta wait for it. &gt;sol: don’t get mad. i waited again for something positive to return. solitaire took it as a sign to continue. &gt;sol: so, ummm remember when itsec explained to you about his 30 second chance before all the tickets got shunted to the main queue? &gt;me: yes… something resembling negativity was slowly creeping back. &gt;sol: well, i ummm set up my own account… like that. so i could have first pick of the tickets. &gt;me: oh. so you want to be excluded from the competition like itsec? maybe this was good? positivity might just work. &gt;sol: well, no. see i was logging onto the same system and taking tickets just like itsec. i was only doing it because … actually that doesn’t matter. &gt;me: so you’ve been skimming tickets before they hit the main queue. &gt;sol: yes, but when you changed the reassignment rules it broke the account, because that account could no longer drop the tickets back into the queue. oh hell. hello negativity my old friend. &gt;me: sooo… &gt;sol: so, since whenever you changed the rules till now that account has taken every ticket and errors when it tries to put them back in the queue. i picked up my coffee. i didn’t even sip it. just held it. &gt;me: how many…. &gt;sol: how many tickets has it got? quite a few. some of the tickets are nearing the 18 hour mark too…. &gt;me: no. how many times should i fire you? i looked over at my computer. **new email** &gt;*what the hell are you doing down in it? peoples tickets are sitting with no fix!* — the vp oh so the vp knows. perfect. ***** [next](had a lady burst into our office yesterday. lady: "there are red crosses over everything!!!" me: "erm ok. can you please tell us what you were doing when it went wrong?" lady: "i don't know there are red crosses over everything" me: "so we can help i need to know what happened, what were you doing when the red crosses came up?" lady: "look i've not got time to explain i need a f***ing computer" (she is known for swearing) at this point she legged it out of the office swearing going on about finding another f***ing computer. i went upstairs and looked at her machine. clear as day "no logon servers are available..." this had one very small red cross in the top right to close the dialogue box. i plugged the network cable in that she'd somehow managed to pull out and it worked fine. i hate the blind panic, come and rescue me approach she used. if she would have just read what it said and phoned us she could have resolved it herself, instantly or i would have popped up. instead she went wandering around trying to find a computer, didn't and then moaned at us for not having fixing her machine. we already had and she didn't appologise for having a go without even testing it before kicking off for the second time. i'm really tempted to put in a complaint about her swearing and general attitude. [previous]( tuesday afternoon. i was two slides into my it security talk and already my patience was wearing very thin. i was death staring “thatguy” to sit down while he searched room for a pen with a “what are going to do about it” smile. luckily the room was saved from badcop by the vp’s secretary, who’d walked into the room carrying a coffee. &gt;vpsec: oh. am i late? sorry. vpsec handed me the coffee and took a seat at the front. silence reigned around the room as i waited for “thatguy” to sit. he was oblivious to the room waiting for him. i took a sip of delicious coffee while waiting for “thatguy”. the vp’s secretary looked increasingly uncomfortable. eventually she looked around the room to see what i was waiting on. &gt;vpsec: **you**. sit down, so we can start. coffee had dissolved my bad mood. so a smile broke out as “thatguy” sheepishly took a seat after being told off be vpsec. &gt;me: it staff will never email you for your password. if you get an email asking for your password from it, or anyone. do not reply. contact it immediately. most of the room was nodding. one hand however had again shot into the air. i took another sip of coffee and ignored it. next slide. &gt;thatguy: what if its an email from your manager? &gt;me: i’ll answer questions at the end. okay, passwords…. i was cut off. &gt;thatguy: what if it asks for your password. you said don’t reply, just contact it. but thats replying though…. i couldn’t believe it. basic instructions failed this guy. badcop was screaming. i tried to drown badcop in coffee, by taking a long sip. &gt;vpsec: does this look like the end of the talk to you? &gt;thatguy: oh i’m *really* sorry…. i’m just confused. the room’s mood shifted. thatguy had been told off by a member of the audience…. &gt;me: if you receive an email with just a link, check with the sender that the link is legitimate. if it has not been sent by them, please contact it. &gt;thatguy: check via reply email or call them? murmurs of “shut **up**” and oh my goodness rippled throughout the audience. an old guy at the back with a orange tie spoke up. &gt;orangetie: questions at the end. geez. &gt;thatguy: oh. right. questions at the end. sorry. i thought since it was a short one… we could just quickly get it done now. orangetie stared “thatguy” down with a scary face. i decided to continue, after sipping coffee. &gt;me: emails with unsolicited attachments should not be opened. if the attachment is an .exe or zip file especially, do not download it. also scan all attachments before downloading. “thatguy”’s hand was in the air. however the entire room was just staring him down. he decided not to speak up. &gt;me: passwords should be different for every single account you have. avoid using the same password twice. &gt;thatguy: i read an article that said using the same password in everything, as long as its secure and only you know it is okay… the room went silent. orangetie looked livid. looking around “thatguy” tried to justify himself. &gt;thatguy: it’s not really… a question... &gt;orangetie: shut. up. thatguy mouthed sorry again to the room and waived his hand as a vague peace symbol. i took a sip of my coffee. empty. huh oh. &gt;me: thatguy is **mistaken**… always use different passwords for every account. anyway onto.. &gt;thatguy: but... i had no coffee left to keep badcop down…. [next]([previous]( control slipping. i clung to my empty cup. &gt;thatguy: but, why not just have one password that's secure? &gt;me: please…. please! either leave your questions till the end or just leave. i was breathing heavily, i straining not to just scream at the guy. &gt;thatguy: i’ll wait. thatguy gave me a smile. i couldn’t tell what type, i was busy trying not to throw something at him. &gt;me: if you suspect someone was watching you type in your password, change it immediately. everyone in the room turned to look thatguy. he sat. no questions. &gt;me: if your computer starts getting popups, or is unusually slow without any programs open. contact it, we’re always happy to take a look even if it turns out nothing is wrong. &gt;thatguy: is it question time now? i was in shock. he was incapable of not talking. thatguy looked around the room at the angry faces. he felt the need to explain himself. &gt;thatguy: airz is talking about preventative maintenance, usually the last topic to be covered. so its question time now…. right? i tried to take a deep breath. &gt;me: no. i’m afraid for you question time will never come. get out. &gt;thatguy: but, i’ve got so many questions…. &gt;me: okay you can come down to it tomorrow, and we’ll have a one on one session. i’ll answer all your questions. &gt;thatguy: sounds good. thatguy was smiling widely. however he remained seated. i waited. &gt;me: ahem. please leave. i gestured over to the door. whilst looking directly at thatguy. &gt;thatguy: i think i’m going to stay… f*^% it. badcop time. &gt;me: **no** you should leave. now. &gt;thatguy: i won’t ask any more questions. i was pissed. the room was silent… &gt;me: get the fr$%k out. i’ll see you tomorrow and we can review the material then. &gt;thatguy: i won’t say a single word, unless you're wrong about something. breaking point. &gt;me: you’re wasting everyones time! not only are you a major security risk with your “same password” strategy but you have the most idiotic questions i’ve ever heard. now unless you get up off your chair and walk out that door right now, i’ll make sure that your remaining time at this company is gratifyingly small. &gt;thatguy: what? i look a deep breath and tried not to scream. luckily orangetie spoke up before i did. &gt;orangetie: airz said if you don’t leave, he’ll make sure you’re fired. thatguy jumped up and walked out the door. upon reaching it he turned and smiled at me. &gt;thatguy: see you tomorrow. walking away the entire room started whispering, looking nervously up at me. were they afraid? &gt;vpsec: f*%# that guy. nervous laughter broke out across the room. i weakly smiled. i continued with my talk. it was good. [next](monday came to see the fruition of my power move. facilities were present and correct at the it cupboard, busy fitting brand new desks and trunking. on completion, mafg and i replaced the ghost server in its rightful setting on top of a 12u comms cabinet, as though a rightful leader was being returned to the throne. there wasn't much time for moonlighting as there was a massive backlog of builds to get through and only a week left until possibly the largest induction session i'd ever run. our birmingham satellite office had a recruitment drive and were busing down 40 delegates the following monday for new gear and it training. it felt good, like we were back in business. i expected some sort of a backlash from angie. obviously i had caught her off-guard and she needed time to regroup and plan her strategy. all i could do was wait for the strike. but for now, we all reveled in our little victory. several laptops were busy building on the build desk as i clicked away making some new ad accounts for my incoming party of inductees. having received sign-off previously from bhit to replace the missing desktops facilities managed to lose with brand new machines, i had them all loaded on a trolley, ready to roll them out. mafg was busying himself with an inventory of mini keyboards and mice, taking stock for an urgent purchase order. we chatted casually as he made his way up and down the isles; it was a full-on powerhouse of progress. our short-lived freedoms stopped dead like a body dropping in the middle of a busy street. the electronic lock trigged and the door opened; angie's familiar musk of coffee and old woman perfume festooned her appearance in the doorway, her scowling face writing a thousand words of bitterness as she surveyed our veritable cave of tech. she said nothing, averting my eyes as i looked expectantly for a few seconds as i greeted her with a "good morning!" expecting some request. after a few seconds of uncomfortable silence, i ignored her again and placed my tickets sheet on top of the trolley and started to wheel out. "just a minute!" she said extending a single boney finger in my direction, her tongue whipping against the top of her dry mouth. "what are you up to in here now?" a rather curious question i would wager, one which i would have thought obvious. after explaining the current goings on, little did i know i was jumping head-first into her trap. it had been barely a morning gone when she had already planned her counter-offensive to the letter. this was the scouting mission, this is where she would sew the roots of her plot. she came straight out with it: "where are the tickets for these 40 laptops you're supposedly building?" supposedly building? tickets for induction users? never heard of such a thing! mafg appeared from behind the racking as if to leap to my defense. "we generally don't log them for inductions. we usually get a fair number of requests for new machines, so we just use an ad container to build the machine and move them to live when we're rolling them out." shit... mafg really knows how to put his foot in it sometimes... "what is ad?" angie demanded. i could feel the life force draining out of me as angie realized yet another scope for micromanagement. "why don't i have access to it?" her stern face looking like we had cheated her out of some mythical prize, the lines on her forehead scrunched together. realizing his mistake, mafg kept quiet as i tried to work around it. "we don't generally hand out that sort of access out. if someone didn't know what they were doing, they could cause a lot of damage and the potential mess that can occur. only mafg and i have access to it in 2nd line as we're the only ones who administer accounts!" ok, it wasn't the best work-around i could have said, but there, it's been said now! angie threw around some more micro-managerial criticisms before taking her leave. she also left me in no uncertain terms that she expected to see active tickets for each and every machine i was building for inductees before the end of the day. an hour out of my life for no purpose! sigh... angie's final email that day made her feelings on the it cupboard clear; no engineer was to be in the cupboard without a ticket evidencing their need to be in there and not without the express permission of angie first. another typifying trait of angie's hardline stance against ingenuity: control a person's ability to conduct themselves and create the illusion of importance by demanding constant permission seeking! the clever bitch had laid the foundations for her new play, there was a new ball to throw out on to the court! tickets for every machine, permission from angie to use the it cupboard! and what would she do with her new-found knowledge of ad's existence? i contemplated these things as i drove home, sat in the traffic jam from hell. as i drew up on the accident, the gaggle of other motorists gawping at the overturned 4x4 which littered the inside lane of the motorway seemed to exemplify the futility of each day's passing as firefighters scuttled around the wreckage, feverishly confronting the mass of metal as if finally overpowering a once vastly-stronger enemy. as i passed the scene, sure enough, the traffic started moving at it's prescribed 10mph over the speed limit. it was as if we had all just escaped some fatal consequence and were now running away for dear life. for me, tomorrow was another day; another opportunity to dance in this fascicle struggle, conceived and birthed through the actions of this shriveled character whose aroma seemed to besmirch even the most jovial memory. **previous** [pt1: a new world order]( ) [pt2: safety first]( [pt3: the it induction from hell]( [pt4: undercurrents]( [pt5: how to make friends and...]( [pt6: marking territories]( [pt7: one friday to rue them all]( [pt8: best laid plans]( [pt9: its one step for man]( [pt10: ...and one step back for its]( [pt11: bring home the solider]( [pt12: who needs minor victories...]( [previous]( drip, drip, drip. i contemplated what i’d done in life to deserve this, on the one hand, i was soaking wet and getting cold in an office with everyone too busy to talk to me. on the other hand, i was getting paid stupid money for literally no work. my mind ran in circles debating whether this place was a curse or a blessing. carefree eventually saw me shivering in clothes that couldn’t be more wet. &gt;carefree: airz, i got you this. carefree held up a jumpsuit, it was bright orange. he handed it to me. i put on the jumpsuit, and smiled to myself. without the cold, and with someone at least partially talking to me, this place wasn’t too bad. i left the bathroom and found carefree waiting for me. &gt;carefree: oh orange… doesn’t really suit you. he smiled at me. i looked down at the jumpsuit, then smiled back. &gt;me: its dry…. that's all that matters. &gt;carefree: now you’re wearing clothes that can, get a little dirty, could you do me a favor? &gt;me: haha, sending me to do your dirty work? i was bored enough, i’d literally jump at an opportunity to do something. &gt;carefree: haha, okay we’ve got the network cupboard right? we walked over to the network cupboard, i was expecting carnage…. it was unexpectedly really tidy. &gt;carefree: see this switch, well i want to know where these wires connect too. &gt;me: sure, thing. i followed the switch cords, they all lead to the patch panel above, the patch panel had labels. empty labels. &gt;me: errr. okay it seems someone hasn’t filled in the labels, when they installed the patch panel. &gt;carefree: yeah… so how do you work out where they go? i looked at the back of the patch panel, all the cords went straight into the roof. &gt;me: simple, just find all the ports on walls in the office, then unplug everything one by one. process of elimination really. &gt;carefree: sorry, you misunderstand, there are these ten cables in this switch that go into the roof, and end near rooms, but never got put into actual points. i want to know where in the wall those cords are, so we can cut into the wall and put in the wall plate thingy. i realized pretty soon that he wanted me to go into the roof cavity and chase cords. &gt;me: haha, its probably quicker to just unplug them and lay new cords. &gt;carefree: mmm, they’re already up there though. just gotta find about where in the walls. i looked up at the roof tiles. i decided i should at least look at the roof cavity. i pushed up one of the roof tiles. each of the roof tiles was held up by a metal structure that was tied to the cement slab above. the cavity was actually quite big, about a meter and a half tall. &gt;me: mmm, i can’t actually see where those cords go specially. carefree said he’d leave me too it. i went to the nearest phone and called the tech that was on vacation. &gt;tech: hey airz, did you get the isp to come and fix the internet? i realized i never updated him on that situation. didn’t matter. &gt;me: oh… yeah. hey, off topic, the cat5 that goes into the roof, any chance you know where those cords go? &gt;tech: hahaha, carefree wants to put in the ports for the wall huh? &gt;me: yeah, something like that. &gt;tech: has he tried to get you to wear the orange jumpsuit yet? i looked down at my orange garments, did he plan this… &gt;me: actually i’m already wearing them. &gt;tech: haha, rookie error. he’d never make you actually go into the roof in you own clothes. now you’ll have to go into the roof. &gt;me: that metal frame holding up the roof tiles will never support my weight. &gt;tech: oh what ever you do… don’t step on the roof tiles, just walk on tops of the walls, i’ve been up there a few times, the walls can support you. &gt;me: errr…. &gt;tech: just remember. don’t step on the roof tiles, they can’t take any weight at all. i hung up the phone. resigned myself to my fate of climbing in the roof. i thought about being bored, this was the opposite of that. i didn’t know which was better. at least i was warm. i set a ladder against the wall next to the switch. i grabbed some masking tape, a marker pen, some paper and prepared myself. carefree caught me half way up the ladder as i was marking in the roof which cords needed to be found. i put a little masking tape tag on the ones that i needed to follow. &gt;carefree: all ready to go up? i just got a call from our tech. he said to remember, just walk on the walls. &gt;me: yep… i better get started. i got myself into the roof cavity, and balanced myself on the wall below me. i started following cables. first cable i followed dropped down between two walls. i realized i had no idea where i was. i cracked open a roof tile next to me, and looked down at the office below. it was one of the meeting rooms, i figured i’d have to get fairly close to the cable to find it in the cavity. so i opened up the roof tile some more and places some tape on the wall, exactly where the cable dropped down. second cable i followed, it ended in an office. its occupant looked rather confused about a man in the roof, marking the wall with masking tape. oddly, he still didn’t say a single thing about it. third cable i followed it, opened up the tile in the roof and looked down at the room below. the red haired lady looked up from her desk, straight at me. i realized at this point, i was in the roof, opening a tile into a room i’d just been expressly told to “go. away” from. i waited for the scream.... [next](hello tfts! it has been a while since i posted. i hope this new tale from the backwoods tech will entertain you all! ***** there i was minding my own business when i got the call. &gt;cx - hello? is this tollhouse? &gt;me - yes. what's up? &gt;cx - my laptop caught fire when i was trying to overclock the bluray player. can you recover my files? *mind explodes at this point* &gt;me - wait, what? say that again? i wanted to make sure i wasn't mishearing what was being said. &gt;cx - my bluray player was skipping and lagging, so i tried to overclock it. &gt;me - *sigh* ok, wait a moment. before we even get to file recovery, i just have to know; how? &gt;cx - i looked up a pinout guide on google and found where the power leads on my bluray drive in my laptop were because i remembered that you told me that it takes a little extra power when overclocking to make things faster. so i carefully soldered in extra power from an old power-adapter i had laying around that wasn't being used. &gt;me - wait wait wait. you did what?!?! you said it caught fire. how did it catch fire? &gt;cx - well, i was watching a movie when it started stuttering and slowing down again. i plugged in the power-adapter while the movie was running, thinking it would speed it up, and boy did it! it sounded like a little drill and then i heard a 'pop' sound and started smelling smoke. i opened up the drive, and my disc had shattered and smoke started pouring out. it got really hot, then i saw a small flame coming out from my keyboard! i unplugged it really fast and then dumped it in the bathtub to put it out! at this point, all i could do was sit there, listening over the phone to this description get worse and worse. i truly knew that nothing i would do could fix this situation, as i expected the hdd in the laptop to be ruined. after getting the details and getting the laptop delivered, it was even worse than expected. there was a wire hanging out from the bluray drive (thus confirming at least that part of the story). there were still pieces of glittery bluray plastic here and there. the keyboard was burned, but not completely melted through. i managed to get into the laptop without destroying things worse, and found what i thought - though not quite the way i thought it. i called up the customer to give them the bad news: &gt;me - sorry to let you know, but i can't recover anything. if there was sensitive information that you truly need, you can take the drive to a data-recovery site, but it will be pretty expensive. &gt;cx - why can't you get it? you got it before when the drive wouldn't even spin! &gt;me - that is because there is a 1 time trick you can use to make a locked up drive spin again until you turn it off. it won't ever work after that. i can't fix this. this is beyond sticking a hard drive in a freezer for a couple of hours. your drive connector melted off. i can't connect it to any of my equipment, so i can't retrieve the data. "overclocking" your bluray drive destroyed your harddrive. i'm sorry. &gt;cx - oh well. nothing too important was on that drive. guess next time i'll ask for help before overclocking the drive. maybe you could overclock it properly next time? *mental face/palm*my first job was at a mom-and-pop style (not really, it had ~50 employees, but it was run that badly) coding body shop. people brought ideas and money to us and we'd turn them into programs or websites, or they'd bring us the code that some other company (or relative) had ~~hacked together~~ excreted and we'd try to make it actually work. i spent 8 years there, which in retrospect was about 7 years too many - here's one of the first experiences that should've been my cue to leave... this particular story occurs ~6 months after i began working there. even though i was a newbie i'd proven i knew what i was doing, so i got moved onto a more challenging project. "challenging" is probably not the right way to describe it; "a horrible mess" would be more accurate. this was a delphi 7 application that had been cobbled together by various companies before us (that should have been the first warning) - the end result was that something which should have been simple, like adding a top-level menu (no functionality) to the main window, took an entire day. the ide crashed a lot because of the weird things the project was doing. but i would've been fine, if it weren't for the client. this client was very... *focused* on his application's success. he was convinced that the issues he'd had with previous companies were entirely their fault. to ensure that his barely-there specifications were implemented to his satisfaction, he would come and sit with us devs while we coded the feature. as in, he would watch us, and tell us what we were doing wrong, and complain we were being slow, and talk on his cellphone, and type on his laptop. basically our office was his office... and our management were okay with this because he ~~was paying~~ had signed a contract saying he would pay a lot of money. of course, us devs didn't have any say in this matter, but we eventually adjusted to the new normal. now, my standard morning routine is probably very similar to yours, in that i don't start work the moment i walk in the door; i spend my first 15 minutes to an hour checking my email and some websites (news and webcomics). there was a prohibition from management not to use the internet too much because we had a data cap (another story for another time) but generally just after you'd arrived, or just before you were gonna leave, was seen as okay. on one particular morning, this client arrived early while i was still reading webcomics. i didn't know he was there because i was listening to music, and i didn't know he had sat in silence, watching me read webcomics, for maybe 5 minutes before he went to complain to management. the first i knew about it was when i was called into the financial manager's office and chewed out for "wasting the client's time" and "being dishonest". the reason for this was the fact that clients were billed, not hourly, but in 15-minute intervals. every day us devs were expected to capture our working time accurately and precisely into an application that was used to bill the customers at the end of the month. that took all the responsibility for billing off management and placed it on the devs. it also meant that clients could see a detailed breakdown of what us devs had allegedly been doing. this client made the accusation that because i wasn't working for 5 minutes, i was obviously billing him for the time and therefore the company was in breach of contract. the financial manager who chewed me out for this - without asking me for the facts beforehand - was one of the most useless s\*\*tstains i've ever had the displeasure of working with. he was also a bat-f\*\*k crazy hollow moon, lizard people, conspiracy theorist. (this may or may not have something to do with the fact that the company was rarely more than barely profitable.) he consistently took clients' sides against us devs because he couldn't say "no" to the guys paying the bills. he wanted to fire me for upsetting the client and "lying", but fortunately calmer heads prevailed and i was kept on, although quickly transferred to another project. this incident was a tipping point in the company's relationship with this client; there were a lot of other things going on behind the scenes that i had no knowledge of. the end result was that a decision was taken to fire the client, but before this could be done he sued my employer. they settled out of court for what i later found out was about 5 years' worth of my salary at the time. what did the client do next? found another unsuspecting software company, ended up suing them for a far larger amount, and won. we later found out that suing was this client's modus operandi: he would pick a small software company, promise them buckets of cash, get them to sign a very specific contract, dump his crappy code on them, then interfere to ensure that they breached their contract and get his money back and more. it seems that in my case he decided that sooner was better than later, which was fortunate because if he had waited until we inevitably missed a deadline, he would've been able to sue for a far larger amount than my employer have been able to afford. (and he almost certainly would've won because i reside in a country where, at the time, laws still had to be written to cater for software.) tl;dr i got my employer sued by pissing off a client, turned out that i actually helped the company dodge a much larger lawsuit, hence the company survivedmy attempts at garnering moral support from my girlfriend had failed. after recounting the day's events, she thought my overreaction was simply the male chauvinist in me speaking out against a woman who was just struggling in a man's world and in her eyes doing it well! arriving for work, i had three video conferences to get set up planned for exactly the same start times. after working diligently to get them set up, i finally set off for the ground floor, the home of it support. this time, having grown smart of angie's disposition for anyone drinking coffee, i swung by the kitchen first. oh yes, angie's still on form today. i sit at my desk and fire up my machine. angie glares at me, whatever i'm learning to ignore it. "anything to say?" she sniped? ok, i wasn't quite expecting it to be that open-ended... "no?" came my reply, accompanied with my best "what's going on 'ere then" look. off we go to her meeting room which appears to have become her favorite place to dress down her troops. half expecting an array of torture weapons to now adorn the walls, she slammed the door behind us. "why were you late?" she demanded. confused, i informed her i wasn't late; i was in fact 15 minutes early! i had arrived at 8:45 to get the video conferences set up for 9:00, despite the fact that my shift wasn't actually due to start till 9:00 anyway. however, due to a slight technical issue whereby sound from the american side of the video conference had failed, i was working with a counterpart to resolve the issue, thus arriving at my desk at 10:20. i'm sure you can imagine how well my explanation was received. i may as well have made up a story about having to perform a few impromptu acts of lion taming after some had escaped from the zoo and found their way into the building, trapping me for 20 minutes. it would have been just as well listened to. she then proceeded to have me calculate with her on the white board that, if i was 20 minutes late every day, how much i would effectively cost the company over the course of a year, which worked out to approximately 12 working days. she then demanded to know why i felt it was ok to cost the company12 days and what was i going to do to make amends? despite offering to refer her to ticket numbers requesting video conference set up, evidence of my keycard accessing the building 15 minutes before my shift, the end result was i was 20 minutes late for work, it'd be added on at the end of the day and that was the end of it. she then demanded, "i called your work mobile. why do you not have your work mobile?" aha - one i can win :) "you had me give it away to a new starter in monday's it induction!". angie demanded to know why i hadn't ordered another one from vodafone. sadly, vodafone have already distributed our contracted quota of blackberry smartphones, the nokias we have are basically junk and don't integrate with email - kinda crucial for our work - and until the new starter feels like swapping back my blackberry for a rubbish nokia, i would be without. not a very likely scenario as you can imagine! sadly, no... i didn't win. ordered to retrieve an old nokia and new sim card, she demanded to know if other members of 2nd line were also similarly furnished. i knew where this was headed; no more blackberries for anyone! we'd all be on the rubbish parts-bin nokias by the end of the day! this made me wonder about the subject of the rat. on the one hand, given i had now inadvertently ratted my team twice now, frogmarched into cul-de-sacs of inevitable verbal doom by her spitefully clever wordplay, i just wondered if the rat was indeed all of us who, at various times, had fallen foul of her twisted bent nature. but no. someone showed her how to use a printer; someone retrieved ticket logs from touchpaper; someone put her onto the it cupboard... the thought bothered me. an urgent call awaited my attention when i got back, coffee now cold and bitter to the taste. it seemed a pa had a non-functioning pc. rushing up to the scene, it seemed that someone had attempted to help the pa out prior to her calling support. the 18 year old work experience kid they had up there diagnosed a ram problem and tried to reseat it. however, this had failed to do the job and the pa remained with a beeping machine. after trying a few rudimentary things, it was apparent that there was no quick fix. i unplugged and picked it up, promising to return moments later with one of our spare stock machines by way of a temporary fix. not ideal, but at least she could get to her profile data (we used roaming profiles) and use standard services. a b-line made for the it cupboard, i found my card failed to open the door. i tried again, no luck. defeated, i made my way back to the desk, pa's machine in hand. i returned with mafg whose card also failed to unlock the door. the reason became clear upon our return to its. one of our number who had hit a similar problem had found out that angie had also demanded our access be removed from the it cupboard. from now on, access was to be via facilities and only after her approval! great! especially useful as angie had already left the office with her drinking group to experiment with yet another of starbucks' many offerings. running around like a madman trying to find anyone from facilities who wasn't already changing a light bulb or driving a fork-lift and was willing to bend the rules slightly. a few 3rd liners tried their access cards to find that they too were now ostracized from our precious bounty. our actions were similarly stunted when pleading our case towards balding it head who simply responded that he supported angie's decision and that undeployed hardware was technically responsibility of facilities! ok, maybe technically, but this is stupid! 30 minutes later, still no angie, still no facilities. the pa's umpteenth attempt to get news on her machine came through from helpdesk closely followed by a call from he dept head, demanding to know why we were stopping his pa from working. ok, nothing for it, lets see what we can do with her machine! already receiving glares from three fat finance ladies as i begin tearing the side off her machine, we set to work. after various tests, mafg and i agree that the power supply sounds like the culprit. kicking my machine off as they're the same model, i can only think to try mine. 15 minutes later, armed only with a knife stained with old jam which had been liberated from the canteen at some point and found in someone's drawer, i managed to remove psu screws from my machine's psu and the pas machine. a quick hodge-podge to exchange the pa's psu, we hastily hook back up the cables. a quick power on test reveals the glorious windows xp boot screen, problem solved. we shut it down carefully, reattach the bits and pieces and i make for the elevator leaving my own machine stranded on my desk like a recently-sacrificed chicken, the murder weapon with most of the jam scraped left adjacent. i've reattached pa lady's machine, but it's all too late. her boss is chewing me out over there now being an hour lost of her time. despite my best attempts to calm the situation down, citing a problem with security access, he vows to email my manager immediately, going so far as to demand names! pa lady thanks me anyway for my efforts in as an apologetic way as she can. the day plays itself out to conclusion. it takes me until the afternoon to find anyone from facilities to let me into the it cupboard. i retrieve a power supply for my own machine and reattach it in the same caveman like style as it had been withdrawn. angie passes my desk as i finish up, pointed at the knife and demanded "what is that?". i got 1/3rd of the way into the first sentence of explaining its role in reattaching a new power supply when she snapped "take it back to the canteen right now!" i spent the rest of the day on desk visits, guiding users around various windows issues, doing a desk move and i finish the day up with mentoring a guy on the virtues of active directory. i knew i had an angie moan coming. i was expecting it at any minute. but, to my surprise, angie left for the day... what... no come back? no dragging into the meeting room of doom for another lesson in stupid? that pa's boss was very definite about laying the smackdown? where is it? driving home, it bothered me that angie had said nothing about this complaint. had she realized she was wrong? no... i dismissed that very quickly! total bitches like that are never wrong in their eyes! it usually means that people like me failed to understand properly and need a shouting at to get it through my thick skull! but where was the backlash. i was stopped at lights watching a mother scold her child as they crossed the road. this made me realize. it was all just another spiteful orchestration by angie. she knew that i knew there was a complaint. she knew i'd be expecting her to smack me down over it. but what she knew and what i didn't think of until now, was that there was no sense on doing this on a friday. it's the weekend after all! she wants this exact situation... she wants me wondering what sort of smackdown awaits me monday morning - and she wants me to think about this all weekend, just anything to make sure the stress builds up. oh angie... clever! very clever! previous entries: **note** **this is my first tfts story, i am not too great with formatting so please do forgive me if it looks awful and it is an eyesore.** so a little bit of backround, i am a 14 year old kid who is fairly decent with computers, unfortunately my mother thinks it is okay to tell everyone and their mother about this, so of course she brings home 2-3 computers every week for me to fix for free as a favor to her friends. i have asked her multiple times to not do this, but she shrugs it off, i don't really mind that much but it is still a little annoying. anyways, about 3 days ago she came home with this windows xp machine with matching monitor, mouse, and keyboard, and a phone, i am kinda confused why the she put a office phone in there, but whatever. my mom says to call her friend to ask her what she wants me to do with it, i call her and she says she just wants some "important medical documents" off the computer and to put it on her flash drive, i tell her that i can do that and i will call her when i am finished. now this came off a little odd to me because i wondered why she couldn't just simply copy and paste these files herself, i shrug it off and boot the machine. when i see what is on the login screen i literally say out loud "what the fuck?" on the login screen there is a cisco anyconnect vpn, and a domain login for a very large medical insurance company, also in the corner a little box saying it is completely unlawful to login without being a member of this company etc etc now i am pretty sure it is completely illegal to even try to login in to this thing without violating hippa laws. so i call her. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ anon:her me: me &gt; me:"hey i was just wondering why it is asking for login credentials for a vpn and insert large medical insurance company here domain?" &gt; anon: "oh that it is jus--" &gt; me: "is this your computer?" &gt; anon: "umm, kind of, i work for this company and i just wanted some copies of the medical documents for (insert some person's name here)" &gt; me: "umm i am pretty sure what you're asking me to do is completely illegal, if you didn't already know even copying these files for personal use goes against hippa laws. also it is completely illegal for me to even try and log on to this computer. please come pick it up and bring it back to your office." ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ she then says very fast and worried: okay, okay, okay. i will come right now to pick it up, sorry for bothering you. right now i am extremely confused as to why she wanted me to do something like that, and also why she sent me this computer in the first place, she could have done this by herself. she is lucky i didn't try to contact the company about this, i am trying to figure out what she was up to. this happened at a web hosting company which also offers domain name registration service. incessant woman (is) calls in: "i'm dissatisfied with your web hosting" me: "oh? i'm sorry to hear that. was there something you were trying to get your website to do that i could help with?" (we offer many free scripts and often help customers with their setup and use). is: "no, i just want a refund. " me: "i'm afraid there's nothing to refund, our hosting services are provided free of charge" is: "i paid you $25" me: "that was for the domain name registration for 1 year. hosting is a different service. " is: "give me back my money!" me: "i can't give you back money for that service since we didn't take any money from you for that service" is: "can you refund the domain name purchase?" me: "no. domain name registrations are strictly non-refundable since once a name is registered, that registration can not be reversed. we make it very clear during the signup process that all fees for domain registrations are non-refundable" is: "i still want you to refund me for whatever part of my $25 the web hosting is worth" me (getting annoyed): "ok, done". is: "you refunded me?" me: "yes. since the hosting is valued at $0, i have just given you $0" * click *[previous]( i looked down at the laptop on the ground. i pinched my nose and tried not to scream. &gt;me: so tell me again, how did this happen? &gt;defiant: this lady here was carrying the personal computer from its position on the desk, to a place closer to the physical connection for the internet, which while in transit the device became dislodged from her grip. said device then came upon the influence of gravity, and accelerated downwards. upon connection with the ground the momentum of the device had its energy dissipated into the device itself which has alas led to the current situation. the lady in question looked furious at that response. her eyes were wild, she was angry. &gt;fury: it did not become *dislodged*. you pushed me. &gt;defiant: we had no contact, i was all the way over here! how could i have even touched you... my eyes fell fixed on the laptop on the ground. its screen was defiantly broken, a crack across palm rest spoke of even more damage. i picked it up off the floor. &gt;me: so… i spoke slowly and stared down at the boy and angry lady in front of me. i tried to draw out my words. &gt;me: between the two of you, you’ve smashed up a laptop…. &gt;fury: it wasn’t…. i held up my hand for silence and continued slowly. &gt;me: then… after completely destroying the device, you’ve had a shouting match for five minutes, leaving the computer on the floor. &gt;defiant: i don’t think this is a fair representation of…. my stare honed in on defiant until his mouth stopped moving. &gt;me: and finally instead of apologising sincerely to the person that now has to clean up this whole mess, you attempt to start a second shouting match? is that a fair representation….? i waited for the apologies to come streaming in. my ears eagerly anticipating “i’m sorry”. &gt;fury: he. pushed. me. fury looked angrily at defiant. i started to wonder who was really the child here. &gt;defiant: i did n….. i mean… i’m sorry. airz. i shouldn’t have been shouting. &gt;me: get this computer down to it, defiant. and you, fury. get back to work. fury seemed incensed. &gt;fury: he pushed me, so i broke my computer and you’re not even going to punish him? i smiled and walked away. ***** back in it defiant held the broken computer in one hand. a fearful look in his eyes. &gt;defiant: sorry. again. that was unprofessional. i was honestly surprised. it was the first time he’d not used long winded ways of saying things. &gt;me: as punishment. fix that computer, in your hand. &gt;defiant: with… what parts? i pointed to the scraps bin, where computers went to die. &gt;defiant: but… none of them are even the same model… i smiled at him. &gt;me: you’ll make it work. it’s a challenge. ***** a few hours later i checked up on defiant. he’d managed to find a screen to retro fit into the computer. &gt;me: how did you go? defiant held up a working computer. he looked exhausted. &gt;defiant: it’s all blurry on startup, but it works when you hit the desktop. &gt;me: good enough. did you have fun? defiant eyes glazed over in a slightly sinister way. &gt;defiant: that was hell. literally hell. i smiled at defiant as i threw the laptop he’d handed me into the scraps bin. &gt;me: welcome to it. [next]([previous]( i had been called up to to the executive floor to drop off a list for the company lawyer on the it loses incurred from the destruction of the air conditioner. lawyers come in two categories; good and dangerous. i wondered which type of lawyer our company would use. as i arrived at the meeting room i was surprised to also see the vp sitting at the table next to a well dressed man. &gt;vp: airz, come in. &gt;me: yes, i’m just here to drop off this list of equipment. the vp took a look at this list i passed across the table. the list wasn’t very long…. &gt;vp: sit down, lets get you some coffee. the vp summoned a secretary to get me a coffee. &gt;vp: now this list, it isn’t … everything you replaced is it? &gt;me: what do you mean? a coffee arrived. &gt;vp: in the last few months, much more equipment was replaced then just these items… the vp gestured down to the list. &gt;me: for upgrades and general maintenance, sure. &gt;vp: wouldn’t you say those items needed replacing sooner as a direct result of damage they sustained from the event? i looked over at the lawyer, he was staring out the window. &gt;me: no? equipment just needs replacing occasionally. &gt;vp: see, the longer this list is airz… the better it would be for everyone. &gt;me: hahaha i for one am glad he didn’t destroy any more equipment. the lawyer finally decided to join in the conversation. &gt;law: maybe you should take a long think about this… &gt;airz: sorry? &gt;law: well a few months is a long time, perhaps you missed some items off this list. &gt;airz: no, i think i got everything. law sits back in his chair and gives a nod to the vp. &gt;vp: airz, no one would know… if you did accidentally er… forget some things. &gt;law: yes! no one would know if forgotten items where added now. &gt;me: forgotten items…. i looked down at my coffee. real coffee doesn’t do perjury. this was real coffee. &gt;vp: anything you can think of? i sat back in my chair. i smiled. &gt;me: no, no. that list is complete. &gt;law: ahh, well i think that concludes this meeting. &gt;vp: no no, i don’t think he’s gotten the message. airz, if you just…. &gt;law: i’m going to stop you there vp. &gt;vp: wha… the lawyer gave me a quick look up and down. &gt;law: trust me, this one… he isn’t a… follower. the vp looked livid, he stared at me. coffee told me not to blink. when the vp spoke his voice was filled with rage. &gt;vp: everyone, here……. everyone is a follower…. the room just went silent after that. i took a sip of my coffee. it urged me to break the silence. &gt;me: not the big boss though right? i looked down at my coffee. mistake. [next](i walked into the office tuesday morning, brandishing a starbucks latte with a ginger shot. it was my little way of celebrating my minor victory of no customers waiting to tear my face off for lack of machines. ok, there was a little part of me happy about getting just a little win over angie. my mind was already on the task of prepping up some laptops for the next round of inductees due in a few weeks. at this rate, i may even get time to reimage my own machine as it badly needed it. into the office i go, exchanging light pleasantries with the security guards. now, i'm not sure why i didn't expect it. i thought the battle was won, this round was done and dusted and, more importantly, the meeting room booked for the week. mafg looked at me in sympathy as a crowd rallied around meeting room 6. bhit, with two facilities guys and several third line guys were gathered in what seemed to be some sort of epic teardown, akin to one of those american cop shows exercising a search warrant. i walked straight up to own my actions, nonchalantly still brandishing my victory coffee. bhit seemed to ignore me at first, issuing orders to some of the third liners unplugging my gear. turning his attentions to me, his usually weak and ineffectual voice had now transformed into an authoritative bark as he demanded, "i don't know what you're playing it, but this is not on! you cannot turn a meeting room into a comms room." add in more bleating with health and safety concerns, my explanation of complete lack of build space and subsequent apathy by both him and angie was why i took matters into my own hands, rather than annoy several customers still waiting on machines. i was ordered back to my desk. the thirdline monkeys tore down my man-cave which i had lovingly pieced together in as temporary and easily mobile a fashion i could. the familiar green t-shirt clad facilities guys wheeled away my contraband as i watched, the rest of my now tepid coffee disappearing down my throat as evocatively as my victory. as it would seem, this would eventually serve to complicate matters wholly as the customer machines which had been imaged or were waiting for imaging were taken off to some mystical third-line hole where i was unable to get at them. in fact, as it would later transpire, i would never see those desktops ever again. all the while, angie sat with her back to me, presumably trying to get to grips with touchpaper. i knew she was everything to do with it, but at the same time, it was only bhit and facilities people up there. my answers were provided moments later when bhit came for another chat, telling me in no uncertain terms that booking a meeting room to perform it work was totally out of bounds. right at that moment, fat finance bint appeared by his side. she was aching to get her say in too! suddenly, this was making sense! in her finely tuned ultra-moralistic vocal tone that could have only been honed over an extensive career of patronizing anyone who crossed her path, she pleaded with me that my actions were selfish and wrong; "you can't just take over meeting rooms, we need those rooms all the time for legal purposes! you can't just take one, they aren't there for you to just "use" as you please!" her rising inflection that completed every sentence drove through my skull like rusty nails on a blackboard. amazing! in the time i've been there, i don't think i've ever seen finance use one of the meeting rooms once. in fact, there were eight of them and two were used as archive storage and not locked either! most of the rooms sat unused day in, day out. but now i see the path of treachery. angie didn't like the fact she'd lost; fat finance bint complained on her behalf to her manager; he called his people; they called their people; they eventually called bhit who immediately agreed with his higher ups. i threw down the gauntlet. "we used to build all the time in the it cupboard. that was suddenly disallowed. we cannot build at our desks, we cannot use any of the server rooms as there's no space and now when i book a meeting room through the proper channels to get some work done, this is suddenly out of bounds. exactly how are we supposed to do our jobs". i followed this up by fervently clicking through several open tickets, pointing out several tickets requiring build time. bhit stood mute, as impotent as ever. he didn't have the answers or the means to get them. he just simply retorted, "well this is the first i've heard of any problems! you need to communicate with your manager more!" how can it be this difficult to just do your damned job? that day i happened to lunch with one of the third line guys. i relayed to him our tales of woe following angie's arrival. he was almost stunned. he did mention how he's been unable to access the it cupboard for a while but when he was 2nd line, the it cupboard was always the build area. nevertheless, i had to admit defeat. i'd already made so many positive impressions up the ladder, being cited as a troublemaker was not something that would have been useful. i returned to my desk to the first of many emails from a customer, dutifully cc'ing their managers in a typical passive-aggressive style: "where is my machine? you took it three days ago and i'm still having to use the spare laptop you gave me?" it seemed i was now more behind. work was piling up, inter-team tensions were getting high and all the while, angie sat and clicked around various tickets not saying a word. fearing a further reprisal, i took finger to keyboard and again demanded angie and bhit work out where our build areas should be. as the afternoon grew darker, i carried on desk visits, refusing to take any more machines away. angie rose from her desk at 5pm and in an unnatural tone, just said "night all!". she had managed to win the entire battle without lifting a finger, nearly vindicated in her arrogant yet chanty swansong. clearly, this beast of hell was more learned than me in the art of war - and it seemed she held all the cards too! was there to be no retribution for this? **previous** [pt1: a new world order]( ) [pt2: safety first]( [pt3: the it induction from hell]( [pt4: undercurrents]( [pt5: how to make friends and...]( [pt6: marking territories]( [pt7: one friday to rue them all]( [pt8: best laid plans]( [pt9: its one step for man] ( so got a call this morning from a "family member" i never, ever hear from. i'm not even sure how she got my number, probably passed on by someone else. &gt; fm: hey scott! i think i got a virus on my computer since i kept getting popups about tojan this, tojan that. i click ignored on the popups since i didn't know if i should "guarantee" them or "delete" them. i'm pretty sure the guarantee on this computer has expired. &gt; me: ok, well trojan definitely sounds like a virus but that could have been internet popups, are you sure it came from your antivirus? &gt; fm: well i don't know what antivirus is but these are given to us by the company so i don't know anything about them. &gt; me: wait wait, are you calling from work? &gt; fm: well yes, our home computer is working fine. &gt; me: have you called your it department? they really should be the one looking at this &gt; fm: no, aren't you family? can't you just get on my computer and clean it out for me. &gt; me: maybe i could but it's really not for me to put my hands in. the it department should really look at it, they will know what to do and can likely give you a replacement if it needs to be completely cleaned out. it would be risky and likely against policy for me to do any work on them. i also don't think the it department would appreciate me invoicing them for it. &gt; fm: invoicing!?! but your family! it only takes a minute of your time, i thought you would be willing to help out, i heard so many good things about you... i guess they were wrong. &gt; me: listen, like anyone else, i can't spend my days fixing everyone's work problems, especially if they have it people fully capable of doing the work (which they're paid to do). if it was your home computer, maybe, but this is really not something i'm comfortable working on &gt; fm: you should have just told me you didn't know how to fix it instead of making up excuses, i'm just going to call [other family member good with computers] and he'll fix it &gt; me: that's not what i ... &gt; fm: *click* you just can't get through some of them... ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯so, this is probably going to be a long one (twss) so to set the stage, i inherited my environment from the previous it that left without so much as even the wifi password, so there's settings that i didn't set or check as i believed he was a strong administrator. so we have a user, let's call him bob. i haven't liked bob since the day that i started working at my job as a sysadmin. he hovers around people's desk waiting for them to say something first even if he has something to say, sometimes for up to 20 minutes if you simply ignore him. we have quite a lot running on a single server, with the unfortunate bit of it controlling printing, file management, our day to day programs on the network, our documentation, and for the most part, it's pretty accessible to most users to be able to modify documents since they need to be able to create work instructions and whatnot. so bob is one of my people i support that is a problem person to begin with. his outlook somehow magically breaks, he is required by his manager to be able to install programs for his job, and with that comes your casual spyware and whatnot that i constantly have to wipe his butt about. this later will haunt me. so monday i am sitting at my desk, and one of the managers tells me that the president of the company can't access his files. this is a very big deal so it takes top priority. i go to his files to see that all of his files are ending in .micro for the file extensions, so say a spreadsheet was spreadsheet.xls.micro now. i didn't know much about why it happened, so simply renaming the file to remove the added extension showed a garbled mess. this is when i realized that the files are being encrypted. i checked out his pc, and it's entirely clean, not even the simplest issue with his pc for what i can find. as i'm checking this pc, more people are reporting the issue. i send out an immediate email saying that they need to save any files locally as i'm pulling the plug on the server to start checking things out, and with a huge outcry from users, i assure them this is a last resort option. the server, like the president's computer, was absolutely clean, but tons of the files were encrypted. we take a look at the timestamp for when the first file became encrypted and started getting the dhcp timestamps for who got a new ip at this time in case it was a rogue computer that was connected to our network that was causing the issues, and it just so happened that we had a list of 40 or so pcs that grabbed a new ip during a 5 minute period. my supervisor and i start checking every last pc on the list, and a lot of them showed no issue, and a handful of them showed encrypted files. i start checking for malware, and happened to miss the one that had the malware on it, so we start disconnecting all pcs on the list to stop the bleeding and start copying my backup to the drives effected by the encryption. we spend about 14 hours after this point (after already working roughly 6 hours that day) getting things back to normal, and notice that another drive was being encrypted on top of the ones we had fixed, and it's a department drive. we see who all has access to both drives and then start checking pcs the next day with our server pulled back off the network, and low and behold, bob is on the list. bob comes to my desk first thing in the morning, complaining that his "piece of junk" computer ($1,300 thinkpad from 2015) doesn't boot anymore. we also noticed that whatever pc was doing the encryption has stopped. **red flag** mind you, this user tried blaming me for his pc issues after working on his pc, as if i don't know what i'm doing. i try to start his laptop up, and the thing won't even act like it's loading windows. just splash screen, black screen, splash screen, etc. i take out his hdd and toss it onto a dock, and i immediately get a call from my hq saying that my protection software is lighting up like a christmas tree. this is our guy. he's complaining about not having the ability to do his work, and i'm working with hq to get things back online. before i reimage the machine though, they wanted a full log of all the bad things from his hdd scan, and it was quite a bit. essentially, his pc was so bad that it encrypted everything but the os, and something else came in and destroyed the boot loader. we are now finally back to "normal" with tons of permissions redone (properly this time) and backing up everything again like a madman. we are going to be discussing his fate with my supervisor, manager, him, and his manager today. also, his laptop feels like the back was sanded with a high grit sandpaper. now, given everything through the time i've been here, i wanted it to not be him. i was hoping for the one redeeming factor of believing it was him and seeing someone else fall, but it had to be bob. **tl:dr** user who is "bad with computers" encrypts nearly my entire server, taking most of our company offline for the entire duration it took from pulling the plug to getting the server back online where users can work. probably going to use this as the final excuse of why we need a redundant server. edit: one detail i forgot to put in is that he installed a trial mcafee because he believed it was going to be better than our installed protection, which caused our protection to go dormant as he defaulted it to the expired av from over a year ago. ok. so years ago, i used to work for a company made business software. the software we created made a ridiculously complex task merely complex and companies all over the world use it to save them big bucks in the cost of doing business. i was the qa test lead for the as/400 platform in addition to our other platforms on our flagship product. we covered a wide variety of platforms, but the as/400 was our largest base and the assignment to that platform demanded zero mistakes. so, we had just completed testing and shipping a software update that was not only sorely needed for the fixes in it but also for the mandatory compliance updates it held, without which the clients would figuratively be dead in the water after the deadline. the day before the deadline, i get a call from one of my friends who is a platform programmer for this product on the as/400. "bgg- we have a client that can't install add-on #2 to flagshipware 3.0. did you test it?" of course i tested it! my job depended on that getting rolled out and ready to go! "user says it installs everything but the add-on #2 and he is dead in the water. can you check it out? customer service is trying to fix it with him on the phone." this is not a new user, either. this is their senior operator for our product and he knows shit from shin-ola. i'm screwed. now, my office was on the 2nd floor and the server room is on the 4th. since i had to manually load the cd's in the optical drive and initiate the install from the terminal emulator at my desk, i ended up running up and down the stairs numerous times to run a clean install of the product which meant one trip for the main program and one trip for each of the add-ons. i wiped the machine, re-installed the product, add-on #1 and add-on #2 with no problem. in between runs upstairs (frantic runs, i might add) as i pondered what i would be carrying my things out in when they fired me, cs and the platform specialists blew up my phone with questions. i did this 3 times, running up and down the stairs, completely soaked in sweat and regretting how long it had been since i had done any real cardio. on my last trip up, as i shot through the hallway on the 4th floor to the server room to try and break it again, my best buddy dave the platform specialist is standing in the hallway with cup of coffee in hand, laughing his ass off at me with actual tears streaming down his face. "this isn't funny, asshole! i'm going to lose my job if i can't figure this out." "it's hilarious" says dave, "cs just called me and they figured out what the problem was." "my god, what was it? i can't recreate it!" "cs happened to dig around in their account while they were trying to solve it. client couldn't install it because they didn't purchase add-on #2. they've never had it and had no reason to install it!" fortunately, the client was on the west coast and we were on the east, or i'd be writing this story from prison as a convicted murderer right now. edited punctuation errori have a feeling way too many of us have experienced this situation. corporate policy dictates that users cannot get upgraded hardware. replacements are same as. common sense does not apply. one site that i was supporting made the decision to upgrade from xp to 7. user calls with a complaint of a poor performing pc. apps were taking forever to load. other apps were crashing randomly. the best course of action was clearly to re image the device after i brought the machine to our cave, i looked at the specs. it was a dell optiplex 745 with 256mb ram. i brought it to the attention of the team lead who instantly screams at me, "how many times do i have to tell you? no upgrades! that'll run fine on 256mb!" "uh, rodent, win 7's minimum spec calls for at least 2gb. in fact, it recommends 4." "just re image it as is!" so i do what i am told to do and naturally the customer is upset because of how slow the machine is running, but, there is nothing i can do. the customer, rightfully so, starts making a stink about his new issues. next thing i know, i'm being called into the office. "why did you re image his machine with windows 7?" "i was doing what you told me to do." "don't tell me what i told you to do!" i don't work there any more.[previous]( frozen i waited like the last biscuit in a packet knowing my fate. i was about to be assaulted by the mouth of a human, and i couldn't do anything about it. i knew it was coming. i waited. the red haired lady looked up at me, our eyes locked. this is it. her mouth opened. i waited for the crushing. &gt;redcheer: airz! i was just about to come get you. perfect timing, always know where you’re wanted aye? &gt;me: i … wha? i slowly came to the realization that i wasn’t actually a biscuit, i was escaping the trap fate had laid out for me. no screaming for me today. &gt;redcheer: so, i finished installing windows, and i copied all my files over to this computer. redcheer then turned the screen around, so i could see it from my position lying in the roof. the computer however was off, so my diagnostic talents were slightly … lacking. &gt;me: okay… &gt;redcheer: but none of the programs are working properly, so i looked it up on the internet. i looked down at the computer, it hit me that i was doing tech support from the ceiling. it was oddly fun. &gt;me: that’ll be the registry probably. &gt;redcheer: that's what the internet said too. they said i need a registry editor… uh oh. &gt;redcheer: but the internet said it should only be used by people who knew what they where doing. &gt;me: huh. &gt;redcheer: so, i was about to come get you. you can show me how you guys get these registries from working properly. &gt;me: well… to be honest we actually have a disk image that your normal tech made before he left. i looked over at the red haired lady, she threw me a confused face. i finally figured out she didn’t know what i was talking about, she’d made me think she was another tech. talking about “registry editors” … who does that but techs? &gt;me: oh… er an image is like a clone of the old drive. &gt;redcheer: so, all this was useless? she looked over at her computer she’d just spent an age installing windows on, she seemed pretty sad. &gt;me: er, no its not useless. not if you learnt something, and you learn by doing…. remember? the red haired lady looked down at her computer a moment longer, then suddenly looked up, she was beaming with happiness again. &gt;redcheer: you're in the roof! &gt;me: haha, yeah. &gt;redcheer: that's so cool! i looked about, it really wasn’t cool. &gt;me: actually its pretty awful, its dusty, cramped and you can’t stand up. &gt;redcheer: so cool though. &gt;me: are you even listening to me? she wasn’t. in fact, she’d already left the room i was hanging from the ceiling in. about thirty seconds later i heard banging on the ladder, it was almost on the other side of the building. as i thought about how quickly she got over the other side of the office and found the ladder, i heard a loud bang. a loud bang, followed closely by... **ahhhhhhhhh** oh…. the scream found me, eventually. so i am a biscuit. [next](i originally posted this but either deleted it or didn't submit it. as part of government service, i was supposed to take a training course each year. my boss decided that he would send me on an exchange course, which wasn't strictly my job area but parts overlapped. a week later he stopped by my desk. &gt;boss: dpg, i need you to work on something for us. our service desk software already automates emails but if anyone emails our public folder, it needs to acknowledge that. we must respond to them within 24 hours. &gt;me: surely an automated response doesn't count and they want something more personal, such as a phone call or a personalised email? &gt;boss: not at this time. it's purely a receipt email. &gt;me: then just turn on read receipts for the mail domain. case closed. &gt;boss: not everyone emails from inside the organisation, especially if their email is faulty or they're a school. &gt;me: i suppose we could put an autoresponder on it. it would be quick-and-dirty but we could put images and other stuff on it. &gt;boss: write a proposal, and you can run it by the change advisory group. report written, i head to the cag meeting on friday, and we discuss it. &gt;cag1: brilliant idea. how do you want to implement it? &gt;me: i was going to leave that to the servers team. &gt;cag2: ok. we'll approve the change on the provision that servers make the change. for about six months we used this without incident. send us an email and you get a message back to say thank you, and that the call will be looked at within your sla. a link to the sla, and the latest news item were also included. then we consulted with a different team and set theirs up. before we knew it, eighteen seperate teams within the council had this, and the it departments of partner organisations - nhs and the local hospital. the nhs it department sent us an advisory on the issue of new smartcard readers. our email received it, and pinged back a response. their email responded to ours, and their response generated a response from our server. this kicked off at 8:03 on a day when i wasn't due in till 9. by the time i got in, everyone was in a state of panic. our mail queue had around a thousand messages in it, and no email was going out. the server was so overloaded that the remote management software wouldn't connect. the server team arrived five minutes after me (coffees in hands) and after a thirty minute meeting, went to the server room and disconnected the ethernet cable from the rear of the exchange servers. they then removed the responder, restarted the servers and re-connected. &gt;head of it: this mail flood we had was your fault dpg. it's cost us who knows how much money in wasted time to fix. i hate it when government or similar services attempt to monetize their losses or the work they do. they never lose money on anything as they don't sell goods or services. &gt;me: my report did state that two autoresponders could cause a flood like this. it's in the appendix under potential errors. &gt;head of it: *nonchalant wave of his hand* i never read the appendix on any report. &gt;me: i'm sure the server team looked at it. &gt;server team leader: we did, but we were over-ruledas i closed the door on my cozy warm house on a bitterly frosty thursday morning, clutching my car keys in one hand and a small plastic scraper in the other, i immediately regretted my decision of not purchasing gloves the previous night while shopping. my car bellowed smoke as it churned into life as my red cracking knuckles powered the scraper into the solid ice on the car windows. the fact i had purchased a ford for it's clever quick-clear windscreen technology just seemed to mock me more as the damned thing was had failed to operate at all over the last few days. i made it to work and felt rather disappointed with the turn-out of animal rights protesters - the promise of an impending and very visual protest outside the gates of the center as emailed by hr seemed rather overkill as i spied a single figure waving a poorly legible placard from near the gate, being carefully watched by two security guards. it seemed a rather poor effort! i duly parked my car in the usual spot next to a brand new looking jaguar. i admired its sleek lines and somewhere in the back of my head, thought that one of these days, all this toil will be worth it! exchanging early morning pleasantries with various security guards, i arrived at my desk and removing my jacket, the cold radiating outward. i couldn't help but notice a familiar stern sniff. jesus... angie was here before me!? there i was hoping for at least an hour or two of recovery from this morning's voyage before having her in my face. mere moments had i sat down to get my machine warmed, i reached into my drawer for my coffee cup only to find angie standing right next to me, her stature akin to that of a hitchcock serial killer. armed with her coffee cup, she placed it on my desk, dragged over a nearby chair and sat with notebook in hand. "can i help?" i politely inquired. "i want to see what you get up to in the morning!". i motioned towards my empty coffee cup, but she meant business! "you can get your tea later! i want to see what you're going to do first; open the paper program!" (she meant touchpaper...) the next two hours was like being dragged over icy knives naked! i had started the day with eleven open tickets, six of which i knew were long ones and had already made appointments to service that day. the other five i could knock out easily while waiting for builds to finish thus leaving plenty time free to pick up anything new that came in. angie's plan was for me to pretty much assign myself almost every open ticket - even those not to do with 2nd line support. my colleagues started to arrive one by one and on seeing this spectacle, shrunk into their seats, trying to root out any ticket which would mean escaping their desks and the vicinity of angie. by 11 o'clock, my queue looked like a ticket-bomb had gone off. 47 open tickets! crikey - what was i meant to be doing this morning? angie had retreated back to her lair as middle-aged family guy sent me a quick communicator message, "do you want me to have a look at some of those cases for you?" i duly replied whatever he fancied doing, go for it. after taking a couple of password resets, angie's snarl came from her desk... "jon6, i did not tell you to make others do your work for you! mafg, if you have nothing to do, i am more than happy to give you something to do!" mafg quickly retreated back to his own call list without saying a word. 5 motionless minutes elapsed, until angie walked up to mafg and ordered him to accompany her. they disappeared into the murky depths of the corridor, swallowed by the blackness to some horrible fate. i decided to keep to my plan that day. i retrieved five machines from leavers' desks and made for the it cupboard to get them re-imaged for some imminent arrivals and replacements. i sat in the dimly lit room as the unattended scripts did their bit; i had a rep's laptop in several bits to replace a faulty screen before he would leave for a flight. the sound of the security badge failing in the electronic lock, followed by the sincere knock on the door, thrice performed, meant it could only have been one person. up until now, although she knew it existed, angie had no idea how to get to this place much less have access to it. putting on my pro-face, i duly opened the door. immediately, angie went for the neck, a starbucks tall firmly clasped in her bony fingers, eyes like a spear! "what are you doing in here? why aren't you at your desk? what is going on in here?" i politely showed her around the it cupboard, though what i really wanted to do was batter her with bits of dell laptop and bury her somewhere in with the junk p133 viglens, kept only for laboratories and their outdated gear. the prospect of me attempting to fit her bitter bony body into a fullsize tower also crossed my mind. not happy with my explanation (there's a surprise), she ordered me back to desk despite my protests that the rep was expecting their laptop back before leaving today for his flight to whereeverthehell, and the fact that the machines i was imaging needed to be on desks by close of business. planted at my desk, she left me there with a "now get on with your work and don't let me catch you again!" i felt impotent. time for a reaction. i figured, if the above work doesn't happen, i'm in it with several department heads. if i go back, i'm in it with angie. so, i fired an email to balding it head, cc'ing in angie, asking for direction. it read, "i have work going on in the it cupboard which requires resolution. angie has made it clear that i am not to return to the it cupboard. can you please provide direction as to how this work should be completed?" mere seconds after i signed my fate, angie frog-marched me and some spotty helpdesk kid back to the it cupboard. she ordered us complete the work as she watched and verified every step. of course, spotty helpdesk kid had no idea what any of these 2nd line processes were about and questioned nearly every stage. an hour later we were finished and went our seperate ways to re-deploy our efforts. as i walked away with two machines and a laptop bag slung, she said "i want you back at your desk in ten minutes, don't let me come looking for you!" that afternoon, angie sent us all an email! we couldn't help but imagine it read aloud by her razor sharp tongue, each paragraph almost lyrical in its context. her order was that the it cupboard is no longer to be used for any sort of maintenance or work; it is for storage of computing equipment only. having recently learned that her circle of "bitter women in positions of power that drink too much starbucks coffee" also included some oversized tank of a hr administrator, the icing to the cake was present and correct citing health and safety violations and that any further activities would be referred to management for disciplinary. a few of us held vigil over our lost it cupboard as we watched several burly men from facilities tear down our nest. the glorious ghost server which held all our builds slammed onto a trolley, ready for its trip back to the server room; our beautifully installed network cabling and network switch was unceremoniously ripped from the wall and tossed into a rubbish old box; our carefully ordered and neatly packed away toolkits were also in a box, it seemed that they had been claimed in the name of facilities; our electric kettle, together with a tin containing our hotel and restaurant liberated packs of tea bags, coffee, sugar and dairy creamers were tossed into a black bag headed for the skip. we discussed the predicament in depth. how would we image machines with a three-item limit on our desks? where would we go to dismantle machines to replace or upgrade hardware? these sentiments were later echoed when one of the server admins asked "i notice the ghost server is on a trolley in one of the network riser rooms; i thought you guys needed that for building machines?" yeah... we did too! my shift ended and i made for the sanctuary of my car, again a thick layer of ice and snow serving to only impede my progress. i again noticed the brand new jaguar which had miraculously seemed immune from the effects of this brutal british summer. you can all predict who was behind the wheel. angie glanced as she noticed me approach over her black leather steering wheel, no smile or acknowledgement. she reversed out of her space as her shining black jag powered her away from my presence; her work for the day was done. thorougly deflated, i clicked my ford mondeo's remote key. strange, the remote wouldn't work. i put the key into the lock and the central locking groaned into life. sitting into my ice pit, realizing the water that had leaked from the roof onto my seat had now frozen, a quick turn of the key also revealed that it also wouldn't start. a few more tries and there could only be one culprit. my reward from the day's toil was one flat battery and an hour waiting for the rac recovery person to arrive and give me a jump start. bang goes my early leaving time. what a day...  i’ve got a few weeks off between jobs. i had originally decided to go for a 2 week road trip. to ‘fund’ the trip, i had agreed to do some short term work with a friend of mine. a part of it was to create a phishing awareness presentation for a small financial services firm (fancyfirm). i had put in financial services specific content, talking about how the [fin4]( group had tricked high ranking users into going to sites with fake owa login pages to steal email credentials. the fin4 phish was really nice- it was an email from a client of the firm claiming that ’an employee is disclosing sensitive data at this discussion thread. i may pull my business’, with a link to a faked discussion board with fake owa authentication popups. i gave an example of the phish as well as sending around the fireeye report to fancyfirm’s it director. they were happy enough to pay me. a few weeks later, i’m taking a break from my road trip at a gas station in a rural area, looking for cold seltzer water and having to settle for perrier. i check my phone and notice multiple texts and phone calls from fancyfund’s head of accounting . seems there’s an emergency. i call the head of accounting. head of accounting:”that thing happened.” me:”uh, which thing?” head of accounting:”that phishing thing” me:”ok, so you’re getting similar phishes. just delete them and remind people not to click on the links” head of accounting:”how do i make it stop?” me:”i made some recommendations to the director of it, but nothing’s going to completely eliminate these” head of accounting:”unacceptable. i entered my username and password, but it keeps popping back up. i want to see who is posting sensitive information” me:”oh. i didn’t understand before. i can’t help you. you need to call your director of it and he needs to call my friend. you all have to do a password party.” head of accounting:”you need to help us now” me:”i tried to help you when i told you about this scam. i must not have been helpful. call my friend instead.” this sounds unbelievable because honestly, who is this stupid, but i swear to god, this really happened today and only you guys will understand. so i'm helping a customer reset their password, running through the usual rigmarole. here's exactly how it went... me: your password has to be at least 8 characters long with an uppercase and lowercase letter and a number in it. customer: so it has to be 8 characters? me: yes, or more. it just has to be at least 8 characters. customer: can it be 7 characters? me: *brain explodes* if it wasn't for their completely vacant stare, i would've assumed they were totally f*cking with me but no, just stupid. i'm not it, officially (yet). ~~let me know if this story doesn't belong here.~~ i guess it does. thank you all! i'm a designer in a small company. our it guy left the country a few months ago, and since i'm "technically inclined" i've somehow been turned into the in-office it guy. i can imagine thats a story you've heard before. being a small company, it's a very casual setting. lots of grumpy brits that swear frequently and punish their hardware when stuff goes wrong. i tried telling them to be nice to their computers "otherwise they won't listen to you". and so it has become sort of a running joke that i can talk to the computers since 90% of their issues are very simple fixes. which brings me to today. i've been very busy the last week so i had not had a chance to look at a computer that everyone just told me had gone to shit. i turned it on an sure enough it was completely messed up. i wish i had taken a picture, but there was a lot of random shapes and colour and noise all over the screen. i sat there for a moment. another seemingly impossible situation that i've never been in before. i just stared at the screen while weighing my options. is it a hardware fault? should i take the hd out? has the video card failed? i'm not trained in it, but i'm a pretty good problem solver so i was taking pretty wild guesses. i moved the mouse around a little bit and noticed some of the pixels changed accordingly. eventually i noticed distorted letters scattered around the screen. and a blue bar around the top. i realized there was a window there, but it was impossible to make anything of it. i managed to grab hold of it. i started moving it around and saw about 1-3% of the pixels on the screen were displaying correctly. moving the windows through one of these readable blocks made it possible to read the letters one buy one. i was able to make out the words "do you want to restore". it sounded promising so i found the ok button and clicked it twice. computer restarted and was fine. i turned the monitor towards my co-workers with a huge grin on my face. i'd like to say that the office erupted in applause, but that wouldn't be true. some lighthearted clapping was heard though. one of them had a face that looked confused and horrified. "i'm scared of you man.. but i can't say i'm surprised" he said. edit: thanks for the gold, and the warm welcome to the subreddit! i have some others stories that i will be sure to share with you on a later date.we have a helpdesk app, which has an agent that launches the helpdesk portal on our user's computers. the agent is java-based, and it collects data and allows remote connections, etc. however, most of what the user ever sees is "if i press f11, the helpdesk opens." well, the agent configuration was messed up on a user's machine. if he hit f11, it popped up a window that said "choose the program you would like to open this file: java.exe," then showed a list of programs to choose from when i saw this, i wasn't paying close enough attention. so my brain said "helpdesk open in browser. i click browser" and i selected internet explorer. windows said "ok! put an entry in the registry: from now on, all .exe files will open in internet explorer." at once, every icon on his desktop changed to an internet explorer icon. i checked default programs first, maybe i could just reset the association. unfortunately, there is no entry to set a default for .exe files, because who in their right mind would set a .exe file association?? alright, looks like i have to do this manually. let's open regedit. start &gt; run &gt; regedit internet explorer pops open "would you like to run or save regedit.exe?" i click run. internet explorer pops open "would you like to run or save regedit.exe?" alllllright, maybe i can do this as another user. start &gt; run &gt; cmd internet explorer pops open "would you like to run or save cmd.exe?" right, cmd is an executable. ok, so let's try just doing runas from the run dialog, because at least the run dialog works. start &gt; run &gt; runas /user:$domain\$admin_account cmd internet explorer pops open "would you like to run or save runas.exe?" this user is on a thin client, connecting to a vm in a pool of possible vms. so i said "well, this machine is hosed. no big, i will log him off and put him on a new machine, then we'll just recompose the old vm." so i logged him off, and logged him back on to another machine. except... the user preferences for file associations is in hkey_current_user. which is part of the roaming profile. which syncs with every machine you log into. finally i went back to my pc, and created a fixme.reg file with the following contents: windows registry editor version 5.00 [-hkey_current_user\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\explorer\fileexts\.exe\userchoice] i went back to the target computer and merged the reg file, and that fixed it.so i'm currently contracting for a big company, i'm a sw engineering consultant so i move around a lot. all of a sudden the network share i use to access my linux home directory stops working. i went through my own troubleshooting steps * "df -k ~" - yup i didn't get moved to a different server, i've seen that in the past. * unmap all my network drives/remap * heck threw in a flushdns just for fun. * i even rebooted. * i even checked that i could map a coworkers home directory, and he also could not map mine. so i'm pretty sure it was not my issue. now i get to call it. i tell them what they have tried, naturally they don't trust me (and i don't really blame them from the stories i see here) so they have me go through the same basic troubleshooting steps, and finally gets "can you try rebooting your pc". now it's been a long day and i have multiple code windows open that i'm working on and don't feel like wasting 15 minutes shutting things down and getting everything back to the way it was when i was debugging my real work. so i ask him, "can you map my home directory from your machine?" he says he doesn't know if his machine has permissions to get to my group. so i ask him "can you map my coworkers home directory?". yes he can. now can you map my drive? no it didn't work. so i asked him, "have you tried rebooting your pc?" first day back today from christmas and new year break. it has taken my manager all of an hour to quit. i'm not actually sure what has happened but a user came up giving him grief for not sorting out her problem at about 9:30am (which she loggged yesterday, on a sunday evening) and no staff have been in at all since 24th december. i just saw him mutter to himself 'fuck this'. sorted out his things stood up, wished us all luck and has walked out. i'm in a little bit of disbelief. 1 user too far by the looks of things. edit: just thought i would add a follow up, nothing exciting unfortunately. just spoke to him on the phone and there was no other reason than he realised he couldn't put up with it anymore so he walked. he has had a few interviews recently anyway so he's positive something will come up soon. other than that he's done what i and a few others dream of, but can't actually do and just walked. i wish him well. [previous]( at the end of the second day with the young adults i sat in my office, head in my hands staring at the floor. hours of mental torment, including “do you think she likes me?”, “whats her number?” “do you think she has a boyfriend?” had been dished out by badshirt all afternoon. i was already at my limit. redcheer knocked at the door. she too was looking warn out. &gt;redcheer: can we swap back? defiant keeps just saying words… i can’t handle it. &gt;me: oh please yes! badshirt has fallen in love with sassy, a marketing girl. he won’t be quiet about it. so many questions…. redcheer smiled weakly and slumped herself tiredly in a chair. &gt;redcheer: i think i can take the love talk, its the complete c$%p defiant says that i can’t take. &gt;me: defiant only says stuff sometimes. badshirt never shuts his trap. actually wasn’t defiant with headhr all day? a knock at the door interrupted my questioning. solitaire was smiling brightly at the room. &gt;solitaire: you two think you have it rough? ... my kid won’t even talk. solitaire started chuckling to himself. &gt;solitaire: actually to be honest. hesitant is awesome, we’re having great fun. anyway airz i was wondering if i could teach hesitant about the network tomorrow… just take a look inside the server room and a few networking closets. hesitant is pretty keen on networking. &gt;me: yeah. sure… whatever you want. i was too tired to care. the students had worn me out. ***** the next day defiant and badshirt turned up at my office. they both seemed surprised to see the other boy. &gt;defiant: what are you doing here? &gt;badshirt: airz swapped us. you’re now with the lady…. badshirt pointed out through the door at redcheer. she looked wreaked. i couldn’t bring myself to lump a kid on her today. &gt;me: actually… no. you’re both with me today. lets look at the ticket queue. &gt;badshirt: but i wanted to talk to you about…. you know who… alone…. i grinned, realising badshirt couldn’t talk about sassy with defiant around. today might actually be okay…. i opened to ticket queue. **new ticket** &gt;*could we get an it staff member to help shuffle some of the computers in sales? we need to move a few desks.* -salesmanager my grin turned into a smile as i looked at the two young men in front of me. moving computers…. no problem. ***** walking up to the sales floor i told the boys what we would be doing, defiant started moaning about the manual labor. &gt;defiant: we’re it. not… lifters. &gt;me: don’t worry, you just have to move the computers and connect them up. it jobs. -*kinda* arriving at the floor the sales manager rushes over. she greeted us with a huge smile. &gt;salesmng: oh great! you’ve brought some helpers too. okay we just need to move all these computers from here… to over there, and set them all up ready to work. the sales manager points to a pile of computers on the floor and a bunch of desks over the other side of the large room. &gt;me: any particular placements? &gt;salesmng: nope. defiant and badshirt then got to work moving all the computers and setting them up. i attempted to help, but i got bored rather quickly. badshirt seemed to be working hard, defiant on the other hand was going superbly slow. i tried encouraging him, but my shouts from a chair didn’t seem to help. eventually all the computers were to be moved and everything was plugged in. &gt;defiant: we’re missing some peripheral input devices. &gt;me: wha….? &gt;badshirt: keyboards. we’re missing like…. four keyboards. i looked around, but couldn’t see any keyboards spare. the sales manager however arrived and started praising the boys efforts. &gt;salesmng: oh my! so fast, you two are such good workers. i can’t believe you’re finished already. &gt;defiant: we’re not done yet. some keyboards have gone missing. salesmanager looked puzzled but shrugged it off quickly. &gt;salesmng: don’t worry about that. they’ll turn up. you should go get yourselves a drink after all that hard work... &gt;defiant: we can’t leave a job half done… &gt;badshirt: come on defiant, i’m thirsty. badshirt dragged defiant over to the break room that sales manager was pointing out. sales manager turned back to talk to me. &gt;salesmng: have you checked all the cabling? &gt;me: looks right to me. i glanced at the computers, everything seemed like it was plugged in correctly. &gt;salesmng: you gotta check them all! i saw the kids put them together, so you gotta make sure they did it right. &gt;me: not really much to screw up but… okay… i walked over to the computers and checked them. they were all fine. &gt;me: yep. they all look good. the sales manager didn’t look happy that my checks only took a few moments she walked over to the first computer and pressed the power button. i heard it whir. &gt;salesmng: you didn’t check these computers at all! the screen isn’t even working… sales manager walked around to the back of the computer and started inspecting the wires. i however walked over to the front of the computer… &gt;me: you just need to turn on the screen. i pressed the power for the screen and the computer glowed with life… the sales manager started stammering. &gt;salesmng: yes… well… good. but, i don’t want to have to check them all myself. check them properly. &gt;me: don’t worry. i have. i started shouting. &gt;me: defiant, badshirt, come on. we’re going back to it. sales manager looked incensed as i started walking away. she didn’t seem to want to call me out in front of the children so she said the only thing she could…. &gt;salesmng: oh airz! could we get another box of keyboards… i didn’t stop walking. [next](short one which happened not 15 minutes ago. those of you that work on helpdesks and/or operations can most likely relate to this one. users have a tendency to call for issues with their accounts when they inevitably enter the wrong password one too many times. when their password expires and anything else they can come up with (they're pretty inventive). so here i am, sitting at my desk, when the phone rings. caller id is a lady from eastern europe, let's call her $lee. and she has trouble with her account. normally speaking, during the day this is a job for the helpdesk, but it's been a pretty slow day and i'm (strangely enough) in a good mood. &gt; $me: hello this is it, how may i help you today? &gt; $lee: i think my account is locked out. &gt; $me: ok, could you provide me your account? i'll take a look. &gt; $lee: it's $userlee "goes to look up user account, no issues found, except the password being past the required changing date. bingo!" &gt; $me: alright, i see here that your account is not locked, nor is it expired. however, i see here that your password needs to be changed. could you check this please? &gt; $lee: no, that's not right. that's not what the error message says. &gt; $me: could you please read me the error message? &gt; $lee: the password of your account has expired and must be chan... thank you "click" penny dropped.[previous]( as i looked down at the busted remains of a screen, i thought about just revoking computer rights. coffee in hand, i was hoping for a firing. the sales representative whose computer it was looked up at me. he was wearing dark sunglasses, inside. he was weird. &gt;sun: its broken. &gt;me: yep. the screen, an lcd had its glass cracked, some words where showing on some of the shards, most where black. &gt;me: so… what happened to it? sun looked up at me, the glasses made his expression unreadable. &gt;sun: errr. don’t worry, i think i know whats wrong with it. &gt;me: oh, the screen? a clearly broken screen, and the gentleman with sunglasses knows whats wrong… brilliant. i took a sip of coffee. &gt;sun: it needs de-gaussing! my coffee almost spurt out of my mouth. only years of coffee experience kept it in. &gt;me: sorry, what? the sales floor manager walked over, and looked down at the screen. unimpressed. good. &gt;sun: i looked it up! my monitor was a bit fuzzy, so i followed the instructions… &gt;me: sorry…. your lcd needed degaussing, so you followed some online instructions. &gt;sun: it said to look for a degauss button, but since you guy’s probably bought the cheapest model. it didn’t have one. i looked over at the manager. hopefully i’m not the only one enjoy this comedy of errors. the sales manager looked confused, more for me then. &gt;sun: but the internet said magnets sometimes both caused and could fix the problem. i took a sip of my coffee, tasted like an idiot. &gt;me: so you… got the magnet and it made it worse? &gt;sun: i think i swirled the wrong way or something, because now my screen’s black. sales manager looked up at me, and decided she’d seen enough. &gt;sales: we should probably get this working now. &gt;me: its a broken monitor, it’ll need replacing….. just as i was about to launch into my speech about how this user should be separated from technology, i was interrupted by the sunglass wearing idiot. &gt;sun: oh my! it’s an epidemic. he pointed over at his colleagues computer, the oldest worker at sales. he’d turned on magnifier to look at some things. &gt;sun: that's what mine was doing, see the blurriness? &gt;me: magnification. &gt;sun: how can he work like that? &gt;me: hey, errrrr… (i tapped the older gentleman on the shoulder) did you use sunglasses computer recently? &gt;old: oh yes! mine didn’t have a keyboard and i needed to look something up real quick. &gt;me: see sunglasses, your magnification was turned on, your monitor didn’t need degaussing. the sales manager looked like she’d had enough. &gt;sales: okay, sun you didn’t need to use the magnet, just go swirl the magnet the other way to make it go back. then turn off magnification. &gt;me: that won’t…. &gt;sales: … shhhh sales had a smile on her face. the smile was wide. sunglasses was swirling the magnet over the screen clockwise. &gt;sales: you better be sure that's the right way. &gt;sun: it is! it is! &gt;sales: keep swirling! i want this monitor working again fast. i couldn’t believe sales manager was having fun with this. we walked away from sunglasses, who was swirling away. &gt;sales: hahaha, that was fun. &gt;me: you know that’ll never work though right? &gt;sales: do you think i’m a moron? eventually he’ll just go replace it, no work for you. &gt;me: saving me work, how nice. i took a sip of my coffee. tasted weird. &gt;sales: vp’s secretary sent me an email, saying not to mess up it so much. tasted really weird. &gt;me: whaaaaa? &gt;sales: i think they’re trying to pull down your budget or something. &gt;me: did they say that? &gt;sales: well no…. but why else would they tell everyone not to mess with it. everyone knows vp doesn’t like you too much. maybe he’s trying to cut your budget by making it look like you don’t spend it all. &gt;me: huh. &gt;sales: so with that line of thinking… i took another sip of my coffee. here it comes. &gt;sales: could we get another box of keyboards? this time my years of coffee experience couldn’t keep the coffee down. coffee rained over everything. ________________ [next](i'm a one man repair band and today i got a call from a new customer that was short, confusing, and i thought worthy of this sub. &gt;**lcp**: hello, this is lcp, how can i help you? &gt;**old guy**: do you fix ram's? &gt;**lcp**: yes, i do, what's wrong? &gt;**old guy**: my bluetooth won't connect. i've had my fair share of elderly folks that mix and mash technologies and use the entirely wrong terminology. the only solution is ask more questions. &gt;**lcp**: what kind of computer is it? &gt;**old guy**: i don't know, i think it's just a stereo. &gt;**lcp**: so you can't connect to the stereo? &gt;**old guy**: correct! &gt;**lcp**: what kind of stereo is it? &gt;**old guy**: it's in my ram, the one that comes with it. it finally hits me when he says “*in* my ram”. &gt;**lcp**: do you mean ram like the truck? &gt;**old guy**: yeah. &gt;**lcp**: i'm sorry, i thought you meant a component in the computer, yes i can troubleshoot the bluetooth in your dodge ram. i continued to get more info and will be troubleshooting it next week. first post on tfts but i'll post some more if people want to hear them. im 23 in my first job in it working 1st/2nd/3rd line support in a school. we have about 400 staff and 1500 pupils with a lovely 3 it tech team of me, my colleague (and uni friend) and our boss who's a great guy. get a ticket comes in today &gt;*"$student can't open files and she needs to print for coursework assignment.* okey dokey so this is either dead usb or weird file format. head over to the dept thinking its probably just something like an open office doc or google docs been saved in a weird format. teacher shows me the files and its in a .wsp &gt;"ok so this isn't something i recognise, i'll just take it back to the office and see what i can do." now im only 23 so not all that familiar with all the obscure legacy file formats but a quick bit of googley later it turns out to be from microsoft works, which i might add was discontinued 8 years ago (2007). just open them with word, save as and now they have .doc equivalents, job.done=true head back over and give the usb to the teacher, all is dandy &gt;*"thanks $possiblyreef you're a life saver"* have a quick talk to the girl who seems non plussed that works isn't all that normal anymore. oh well problem solved. some time later in the office $teacher comes in and says thanks for helping and said the girl was really worried all her work was gone. &gt;"why would she think that? all the stuff was there" &gt;*"her family are incredibly hard up and she was scared she was going to have to get her parents to buy something"* &gt;"for reals? can you possibly go and get her and i'll tell her what she needs" few mins pass and $teacher returns with $student_from_lesson who has a worried look on her face &gt;"hey, so $teacher tells me you dont have the newest stuff you need for work" &gt;*"no but im not good at computers, i was scared all my work was gone and i didn't know what to do"* &gt;no problems, thats why i have a job, so about your work. in future you can use this cool bit of software called open office. works exactly the same as ms word (also ms works i guess) and you've got your powerpoints and excel if you need it and the best part is, its all free!** &gt;*"oh that sounds good, how can i get it?"* so i jot down the name of what she wants the url and show her on my screen where to click on the oo site and run her through the next next next spam when you install. &gt;*"so i need to download it at home?"* &gt;"yeah, all the info is on the postit i just gave you, any problems give me a shout" &gt;*"oh errr. i dont have internet at home"* :( *at this point shes looking really sad, i can tell it was quite uncomfortable telling me this* &gt;"why didn't you say so? let me just grab a flash drive" i proceed to notice her usb stick is one of the free 32mb promo ones some companies give out. so i grab one out of stock, download the installer for her and stick it on the new flash drive then inform her that she can keep the stick if she wants (*we inventory them at pretty much nothing because we get through so many although they're all decent 8gb ones*) at this point she just broke down in tears and was just saying thank you over and over again and how she was so worried about telling her mum and thought they couldn't afford it. she stayed around for about 10mins whilst she regained her composure and she honestly seemed interested in what we get up to before she thanked us again and left (*walking through a school of 2000 kids with red eyes is social suicide*) just made me realise how lucky i am even having a computer and internet connection when i get home and gives you a real insight in to other peoples lives at the telco i work for, there is/was a policy for call centers whenever a customer acted 'irrationally'. no matter how bad it got, everyone from sales to techs was supposed to politely explain that unless they calm down, we would terminate the conversation after three warnings. in case of repeat offenses, service could be terminated. whole thing was meant to give frontline a way to cleanly terminate calls from abusive customers once attempts to calm them down failed - but intent doesn't always translate to documentation. part of the procedure after terminating a call this way is to send up a ticket with a short explanation of what happened for possible review. usually that's documentation for it's own sake. as tech senior staff i get alerts on a ton of things i am not really expected to take action on, including flags that tickets have been filed in accordance to this policy, commonly called icbp tickets. few months ago, i got one i actually wanted to investigate. the incident description read *"icbp - customer wouldn't stop crying despite the three warnings, had to terminate call as per policy."* **wat.** so i logged into the call monitoring software, found the call (an unreasonably arduous process really, the tools suck), and listened. the customer was indeed panicking and crying, but certainly not in a threatening or aggressive way. sending emergency help would have been more appropriate than terminating the call. more importantly, it was entirely our fault. her ticket history showed she called us several times for help with a still-unresolved ingress issue and that she still had severe packet loss. by the letter of the policy and considering how it's explained in basic training, i couldn't truly fault the frontline tech for terminating this call - though i certainly faulted his common sense and the policy itself. intermittent electrical noise issues are notoriously hard to fix and there are sometimes long delays, but in her case it was downright ridiculous. she had called us every two weeks for over six months without a fix nor even a single escalation to senior staff. she endured a randomly utterly useless internet connection (35%+ packet loss) about a third of the time. she eventually stopped paying her bill after telling us *in writing* she'd pay up everything once it was fixed. instead of helping, it got her file sent to recoveries - the department tasked with recovering debts from non-paying customers acting in bad faith. they have leeway to negotiate depending on the situation, but somehow the person handling her case skipped the formalities and went nuclear right out of the gate, threatening her with escalating her non payment to all major credit rating agencies. that's usually a last-ditch effort before they resort to nuking the account, which means reporting the black mark to cras and selling the bad debt to an external recovery agency. (either of which means your life will likely suck.) so i'm just sitting there looking at one screen showing in real time that she has 33% packet loss, on the second a huge list of unresolved tech support tickets and on the third that she's flagged 'terminal' by recoveries for not paying for nine weeks - even though it usually takes a year for 'legitimate' non-payers to earn this status .. all while listening to the call where we hung up on her for crying after she had just been threatened with wrecking her life. some panic was warranted - recoveries was basically saying she would not be able to renew her mortgage at market rates because we spent months not providing the service she paid for. i first called fellow senior staff over at recoveries. &gt; bytewave: "hey, bytewave from tech support's senior staff, i'm calling to have your recoveries file closed for $account, all procedures to be suspended." &gt; recoveries: "huh, we do have a file open for this account, but it's not in the red. there's actually a positive credit of several hundred bucks, no debt. wait, there was just a huge credit applied by.." &gt; bytewave: "yes, that's me. just applied full credit for over half a year to this customer's account, dating back to the first time she contacted us about an ongoing technical issue. as per policy, tsss is allowed to grant credit for any issue we deem major if it persists past 72 hours after initial report from a customer. also just added a note to the account for documentation." &gt; recoveries: "huh, i don't get that everyday, over six months, really? closing our file just now. what the hell happened?" &gt; bytewave: "on the tech side of things, i'll handle it. on yours, i have no idea how this got escalated so quickly to cra threats. can you look into it - and have someone who is allowed to leave a brief message explaining that all is well billing-wise?" &gt; recoveries: "on it. thanks for the heads up." senior staff aren't allowed to talk directly to customers as per union rules, as direct contact is frontline's job description. i never got the skinny on why they basically went nuclear almost immediately, but a few minutes later i saw through the hardline troubleshooting tools that there was an apologetic voicemail explaining that the account was in the black from one of their guys. then i got to networks' senior staff. the department in charge of making sure ingress issues don't last for over half a year... &gt; bytewave: "hey, bit of a situation in node nt1587, ongoing for over half a year. i looked at the network tickets and all i see are excuses and delays, all written from numbered accounts. what the hell is happening there?" 'numbered accounts'... internal employees write tickets under their own names; you can tell instantly who did what. contractors' accounts however, use numbered accounts that are hard (but not impossible) to trace back to the tech who actually did the job. &gt; networks: "oh, that. we don't have anyone in that node, it's all handled by our 'favorite network contractor'. according to everything i have, despite sixteen attempts, they were never able to replicate the issue while on site or pinpoint cause. but you're right, that has been ongoing way too long." &gt; bytewave: "so, send one of our guys to confirm and verify. closest depot is.. less than a hundred miles out, but given how.." &gt; networks: ".. yeah, that's not so easy nowadays. boss don't like approving off-region work, the union benefits for off-region are too generous or something. we can lean on the contractors, though." &gt; bytewave: "we're well past that. i'll send your boss the audio recording of this conversation if you want. where i'm hereby stating that i just applied a 1200$ credit to a single customer's account for gross failure of service over the last 6 months, and that tsss *will* do the same for everyone with similar ongoing ingress issues in this node. we're talking several dozens - all of which we'll file under the 'major network failure' code." the guy chuckled and soon after union network techs went out there. credits filed for 'major network failure' go back to *their* budget if they can't reasonably explain it wasn't their fault after a sla is busted - and it was by literally over 6 months. it took networks two trips out there to pinpoint and fix the source of ingress because of the intermittent nature of the issue, but somehow i doubt that explains why the previous 16 contractor attempts yielded zero results. this left open the issue of the actual ticket in front of me where a tech legitimately hung up on a customer because she was crying. sadly and common sense aside, it was literally what he was taught to do in basic training. &gt; bytewave: "boss, i need to add something to varia for the next tsss meeting..." a couple weeks later, at the tsss meeting, we had to debate my motion to edit the blanket 'irrational customer behavior' policy so it would apply only to customers who are unreasonably angry or threatening. frontline shouldn't be allowed nor required to hang up on someone just desperate for help. duh! ... but instilling common sense is never easy. after a short discussion, tsss agreed that it should change, but the process for editing inter-department policies is slow. right now, tech support is allowed to take context into account, while sales and recoveries are still supposed to hang up on you for crying after three warnings. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](the week came to its natural conclusion over several bottles of spilt milk and the mandated amount of crying. several more instances of angie's managerial style being put into action came and went. however, i still had tickets building up which needed build area time. realising bhit was ineffective in offering a solution, i tried and failed to sweet-talk third line into segregating some of their server room space for machine builds. i turned my attention to our so-far more than amenable post-room guys. but it seems i was slightly pushing it at the prospect of wheeling our server in there. the request was met with more displeasure at our storing new laptops and bags in there already. the answer flooded towards me one day when angie, fat finance wench, unnaturally skinny finance wench and the hr tank took off for their near twice daily trip to starbucks. i heard them gossiping about their new coffee related discovery on their way out. see, they have to take baby steps otherwise hr tank will break out in tonnes of sweat. but, so i hear, ginger shots in lattes are simply gorgeous! angie's seemless change in personality between her dealings with us and her friends still resonated around the team with astonishment. it was just odd to hear this scorpion do nothing but treat us like shit all day, but then with friends actually smile and be human. but, my time came to put my diabolical "fuck you" plan into action! like batman with a purpose, i ran round the office building like a thing possessed! i had a third liner retrieve our imprisoned ghost server from the network riser room and patched up some network ports. i finished phase 1 of my mission with an email to angie requesting several parts from the it cupboard just as she returned, stinking of coffee and biscotti. she accepted my request with a disinterested but reassuredly managerial style. monday morning. car defrosted, it's time to get the hammers on! i'm at work early for phase 2. quiet blonde girl (qbg) always seemed to fly under angie's radar. i did initially suspect her to be our rat as she has a tendancy to be popular with higher up types. though i would say a lot of that would be hormonal. her arrival in helpdesk was a little perplexing as nobody - not even the helpdesk manager - had even interviewed her. similarly, her record quick transfer to 2nd line was equally enigmatic. i think we were just lucky that qbg was actually a decent worker and learned quickly. underhandedness? personally, i think more cleavage-related! all suspicions of her being a mole were slightly dispelled one lunch hour when she launched into a seething verbal attack about angie; the sort of stuff that had it ever been heard by anyone with power would have definitely landed qbg with her p45 (the sack). however, monday was to be her day. she had done some extraordinarily terrible thing and it was time for her to feel angie's wrath. and, female to good looking female, angie was in no way going to let her off lightly! but, i was ready and waiting for angie. angie, with qbg in tow, opened door to her dungeon of dispair with an angered and authoritative fling. she stood in the doorway sideways, motioning for qbg to enter. her attention was soon diverted. there was i, several machines imaging on top of the file cabinets, two further machines lay dissected on the table and a studious and official amount of paperwork lay with my blue ballpoint nestled neatly on top. i said with a slightly officialised and victorious tone, "can i help you at all?" angie's face turned red as a small vein on the side of her temple bulged; leaving qbg outside, she closed the door and turned her attention to me. her sharpness was echoed in the warming meeting room amidst the blur of machines. "who gave you permission to do this?" my short simple reply amounted to "nobody; i used my initiative. we have no build areas anymore, customers are waiting on their machines!" knowing that there was nothing she could do, she left the room with "i'll be checking on you later!". as the door closed, it was obvious qbg had returned to her desk, assuming she had escaped capture. no such luck. angie's venomous streak played out as she called across to her in a way one would talk to a 5 year old with a simple "hey you! here!" as her bony finger pointed downwards. qbg obliged with this demand as angie simply stated "this one is taken; come with me" the door closed completely, leaving only me and my machines. i felt like some sort of mad professor finally alone in my domain. angie was usurped. i relaxed in my new man-cave, all manner of industriousness going on. mafg even swung by minutes later for a victorious high-five, the smiles from other team members shining through the open door like lighthouses. i think i just further angered angie more when i came out to the team that "the room has been booked all week, but there's plenty space. feel free to use it, back to business as usual!". i think it was the last part. angie's hand froze as she amateurishly moved the mouse around the screen in her attempts to find the outlook icon again. in a way, i did sort of feel sorry for angie. my girlfriend's hypothesis of a lone female trying to make it in man's world resonated a little. that was until she turned around and demanded we kept the noise down, people are trying to work! her snap only reaffirmed her brittleness. though something told me that i hadn't heard the last of this. one thing you will learn too about women in positions of power who aren't cut out for the job. they always win. no matter how much you think you've had the upper hand, they still win. i returned to my desk to reply to some emails, leaving my machines image in my cave, claimed in the name of man! i couldn't help bu wonder if this would eventually be qbg's fate; socially promoted as guys in positions of power like the eye candy until she gets to a stage where she is truly out of her depth, only able to rely on her position of authority to motivate her staff. as it happens, i was dead right. my moment of victory was surprisingly cut short... **previous** in my job, i support servers. the typical client that i talk to over the phone is an sa with several years of industry experience and multiple certifications. in short, i don't have the privilege of dealing with 'stupid users' very often. tfts being my favorite subreddit, i've always wanted the opportunity to have a story worth telling here, and recently, like manna from heaven, that opportunity presented itself. the call went something like this: me: thank you for calling *company*, how can i help? her: i just changed my isp and now my workstations won't connect to the internet. me: i'm sorry to hear that, ma'am! you've actually reached server support, but if you'll hold for a minute i'll get you down to our workstation guys... her: no. this is obviously a server problem. something is wrong with my domain controller and now my workstations can't connect to the internet. at this point i decided 'what the hell'. it was a slow day, might as well dig into this and once we prove it isn't the server maybe we can figure out what the problem is. i check out the server and everything looks fine. i then turn my attention to the workstations. me: ok ma'am, i want to walk you through checking a few basic things on your workstation. (*provided instructions on checking her ipv4 settings*). can you tell me what the settings are? her: the ip address is xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, etc. etc... the preferred dns server is 2.2.2.2 me: (*puzzled*) you said the dns is 2.2.2.2? that doesn't sound right to me... her: well, yeah. this is workstation 2. me: so... what is the preferred dns for workstation 1? her: 1.1.1.1. shouldn't you know this? me: ma'am... it doesn't really work that way. we need to reconfigure these. her: that can't be right - workstation #8 works just fine!!! it was very, very difficult for me not to laugh. we got her straightened out, but this was quite possibly the funniest call i've had in years.[previous]( annoyed, bitter, angry. all in the first hour of returning to work in this personal hell. why did i return here? the vp trailed my footsteps as i made my way into the bigp’s office. &gt;bigp: airz! you got my message. oh… vp had followed me into the room. bigp’s face had lit up in surprise. &gt;bigp: vp, what are you doing here? i suddenly remembered the note the bigp had left in my office, telling me to come see him. &gt;vp: just here to… sit in. the bigp was fast. however this development threw even him entirely. he sat in silence for several seconds. i almost launched into a tirade about he vp’s incompetence then, but i thought it would be better in private. &gt;bigp: why? again i almost boiled over in rage at the vp’s terrible management, i considered it might be better to hear his counter arguments, however it may muddy the… waters. &gt;vp: i feel it would be better if i was here. &gt;bigp: oh. well, i don’t. so. leave. shocked at the bluntness of the bigp, i realized i hadn’t actually seen them argue before. the vp looked annoyed, his eyes looked to be calculating his options. &gt;vp: but, you don’t know what he’s about to say. the bigp leant forward in his chair, his eyes darted between both myself and the vp. &gt;bigp: is there something i should know? vp’s eyes went from calculating to panicked. i opened my mouth to start my speech on mismanagement. &gt;vp: yes! beaten to the punch. i decided i should hear his version of events, to look professional before slamming him to the curb. &gt;vp: see, some computers were damaged by rain. &gt;bigp: damaged… badly? again i opened my mouth to answer but the vp was in rapid fire mode. &gt;vp: destroyed actually. &gt;bigp: destroyed! &gt;vp: yes. it was mostly my fault. my mouth went into an oh shape. the vp admitting fault? what is this world coming to? &gt;vp: i apologize i stupidly left some computers in the dock, which flooded. destroying the computers. &gt;me: you left them for a week. horribly mishandled. the bigp looked very serious, he gave a very grave face before continuing. &gt;bigp: destroying equipment especially from a department you insisted on managing whilst airz was away is terrible. what disciplinary action do you believe is appropriate, airz? i opened my mouth whilst thinking up an appropriate punishment for destroying ¥2400000 worth of equipment. before i could say “fire him”. the vp’s fast mouth beat me to the punch again. &gt;vp: i didn’t actually destroy any of airz departments equipment. &gt;bigp: you destroyed computers, they’re it equipment. &gt;vp: yes and no. they were new, but since airz forbid me from spending any it budget on that *particular* upgrade, the money came from my own budget. in terms of punishment, i think if i cannot produce the cost of computers through cost cutting or spurring additional sales, i shall either be sacked, or pay for the difference from my own money. that punishment didn’t ring fair to my ears. &gt;bigp: double. you need to find double the cost of computers in either additional cost cutting or sales. or else you’re fired. you have…. 6 months. &gt;me: but, isn’t that his normal job anyway? the bigp gave me a massive smile. his eyes looked like they held back knowledge. &gt;bigp: extra incentive. also since it’s no money from it, doesn’t matter to you, right? although, the vp probably owes it a favor… for being so good during his tenure as it head. right? vp’s head was nodding up and down so fast i thought it might fall off. a secretary knocked on the door and told the bigp an appointment had arrived. &gt;bigp: sorry to cut this short. however if you don’t think this is fair airz, we can discuss it later today, at 6. meeting room. head of hr and the company lawyer will be there too. &gt;vp: you can’t discuss these things without me! &gt;bigp: that’s why you’ll be there too. 6pm. the bigp walked out of his office rather swiftly. next to me the vp let out a long breath i didn’t realize he was holding. i got up from my chair, walked over to the door. half turned around and gave the vp the biggest smile. &gt;me: see you at 6. let the countdown begin. :) [next](my mother was finally convinced to upgrade from her toolbar-infested windows xp pc when the local tv 11 p.m. news did a story on how hackers will be able to empty out atms and hold your files ransom with encryption. she bought a new pc running windows 8. i get a phone call that she keeps getting "stuck" while using her new pc. i come over later in the day. "let me show you." she sits, double-clicks on the internet explorer tile, types "google" into the search bar on yahoo.com, clicks search, types "aol mail" into google search, clicks search, moves the cursor over the bottom arrow in the scroll bar and clicks it many times until an e-mail with a .pdf attachment is visible. she hits the open button on the attachment and a full screen pdf reader presents some letter. "see? there no way to get out of this. the same thing happens when i run any other program except for internet." she pushes the power button, and then pushes it again to turn on the pc to get a start screen on the monitor. windows 8 does indeed boot very fast. i had to search for an [answer]( on how to switch between programs, get back to somewhere i can launch programs from, and generally navigate without trifling passé visual aids such as window buttons, taskbars, or start menus. and then i asked myself whether this would make sense to her. i thought to myself, "shit." it looks like i'll be giving her a copy of windows 7 as a gift tomorrow.this isn't so much a bad user as an amusing circumstance. we have one office in mexico with a half dozen spanish-only users. usually a manager who also speaks english can assist us in tech support, and the users know enough to enable remote support and usually enough english to describe a problem. i had this amusing exchange over instant message: **mexican user:** no print. i attempted to fix the problem and replied: **me:** print? :-) **her:** print :-( i tried another fix and asked **me:** print? :-) **her:** print :-( third try: **me:** print? :-) **her:** print! :-) gracias! tl;dr: language barrier: pwnd. edit: thanks everybody - i'm glad ya'll like this story![previous]( as i sat down at my desk i felt sympathy for the teachers of the world. marking was horrible. everyone complains when you do it, and you never get a compliment for a good job just universal disdain. i sat down to a coffee in my office. delicious coffee, keeping me sane. a knock at the door woke me from my daydream. solitaire entered the office. &gt;sol: i just wanted to have a chat about how much some things are worth. &gt;me: oh for goodness sake…. &gt;sol: oh no, wasn’t a complaint. just wanted to know why you’ve set password resets at ten minutes. my coffee demanded to be thrown at solitaire. i decided against it. &gt;me: how long… should they take? &gt;sol: is there a zero option? i looked down at the drop down menu, it didn’t have a zero option. &gt;me: sadly not. solitaire looked at me, his eyes slowly working up the courage to continue. &gt;sol: as you know, its a four way tie between itsec, colourblind, hockey and myself. i looked down at the current number sheet, he was right all four where pretty close and far ahead. i was almost dead last, mostly because choosing times for these tickets was eating time. &gt;me: sooo? &gt;sol: well we’re all camping out on the ticket box. waiting for the next ticket to come in, and instantly taking it…. i took another sip of my coffee, i couldn’t bring myself to care. &gt;sol: but since you’re grading them in batches, hockey has setup a packet sniffer in the comms room so he knows exactly when you’re marking some. my coffee decided it was time to wake up and start caring. &gt;me: so he’s… going through all my traffic? solitaire gave me a sheepish look. &gt;sol: i just want everything to be fair. &gt;me: sol, take the afternoon off, go enjoy yourself. solitaire looked down at his watch, it was early. very early. &gt;sol: but i…. &gt;me: no, no i insist. a paid afternoon off, what could be better? &gt;sol: uhhh….. the look in his eyes said he wanted to argue more, but a free afternoon off was slowly changing his mind. i decided to walk solitaire out of my office, and went to go have a chat with hockey. i sipped my coffee en route. hockey was sitting at his desk, staring at his many posters surrounding his work space. &gt;hoc: airz! hey, just waiting on some more tickets. he gave me a smile, coffee was telling me to remember he was a good employee. &gt;me: i hear you’ve been sniffing through my packets. hockey’s smile slid off his face. he had an attempt at a contrite face. &gt;hoc: sorry, but… &gt;me: you know i should fire you, like… right now. &gt;hoc: in my defense, i can hardly get any tickets colour-blind has set up a script to pull tickets as soon as they come up. it checks every 0.5 seconds. the only way i could compete is because his box would fill up with five, i was getting the left overs. &gt;me: so your answer was to go through potentially confidential traffic? &gt;hoc: huh? &gt;me: arn’t you packet sniffing my computer? &gt;hoc: no! …. i’ve a sniffer on the ticketing server telling me when you login, so i know about when new tickets will be marked. &gt;me: that's all you got? &gt;hoc: ill show you… after looking through his setup i realized he was just looking for my login. coffee told me to let this one go. &gt;hoc: i'm sorry, but i'm just trying to make everything fair… i can’t compete otherwise. &gt;me: you seem pretty stressed about it. &gt;hoc: i am! colour-blind has a huge advantage, you should tell him to cut it out, at least my way only tells me when you’ve posted more. his just takes everything. &gt;me: you should take the afternoon off. so you can de - stress. &gt;hoc: but i …. &gt;me: no, no i insist. a paid afternoon off, what could be better? &gt;hoc: uhhh…. &gt;me: or we could spend the afternoon going through every security breach you’ve committed. in detail. &gt;hoc: bye! i took a sip of coffee. too easy. almost toooo easy. time to see colour-blind. [next](many many years ago i helped run a support line for these custom medical testing work stations our company assembled. these particular devices were used to test memory, and part of those tests required an auditory component. one day, i got a rather irate call from a client saying something like: &gt; the machine is producing no sound. this is unacceptable. i have the patient waiting here and we have wasted almost an hour already with your system. if you can't resolve these issues we will be forced to consider legal action / find a new vendor. so, i personally had worked on building these machines and knew most of their quirks. a completely working system sans the sound made absolutely no sense. i spent about 20 minutes running through some basic diagnostics asking the user about the speaker power cable, speaker audio cable, volume levels, etc. the user, was getting very annoyed at me for asking such basic questions. apparently i had insulted them. they were an important doctor after all! the issue was definitely with our system! why was i not believing him!?!?! frustrated myself, i asked for the third or fourth time... &gt; *me* are you sure the volume knob on the speaker is all the way up? &gt; *user* of course the volume is up! i know how to use a computer. with no obvious solutions, i grasp at a straw and say... &gt; *me* okay! well, what happens if you turn the volume all the way down? at this point, i can hear the background test audio for our application blast over the phone. i hear a bit of a kerfuffle from the other side of the line and the sound quickly goes dead again. &gt; *user* hey, hold on a minute. a few moments pass. &gt; *user* listen, something just came up here and i have to go. if we can't get this fixed in the next day i'll call you back. never heard from them again. [this]( reminded me of a time i did a bit of showing off. i'm a seagoing engineer on big ships. i love it, the work is incredibly varied and i get to travel around the world. but this tale isn't about how wonderful the job is. it's normal for us to have a cadet or two on board. these guys are training to become officers. generally 18-25 years old, pretty green (as you'd expect) and to begin with at least very much like a fish out of water. one of the tasks that we're required to be able to do is bring a generator online and connect it to the ship's switchboard. with modern tech, it's perfectly possible to just press a button and the computer will do it for you, but we need to be able to do it by hand in case it goes wrong. the switchboards are all 3 phase ac. so in order to connect a generator, you need to start it, synchronise the waveforms of the switchboard and incoming generator and then connect the breaker. once connected, you need to balance the load so all machines are taking proportionally the same. it's not that straightforward, but given a bit of practice it's easy enough. we were talking the cadets through doing this. one of them was particularly nervous - after all, if you screw it up then the lights go out. and i said as an off the cuff remark something along the lines of: &gt;it's easy, i could do it blindfolded to which the immediate answer is: &gt;go on then. so i did. with a rag tied over my eyes and standing in front of the switchboard i started, synchronised, connected and load balanced a generator. the other engineer and the cadets were dumfounded as to how i'd managed it - because on the face of it you have to be able to see all the lights/synchroscope and power meters to be able to do it, even if you could find all the buttons. so how did i manage it? simply the engineer's secret weapon: by listening carefully. 1. the switchboard was right above the generators, so once they're running, you can hear the difference in running speeds as 'beats'. a phenomenon of alternating destructive/constructive wave interference. that got the incoming machine close in frequency. 2. listen for the click of the synchronisation check relay. that's the one that prevents you connecting them when they're out of sync. when it clicks, you know it's safe to connect. 3. hit the button. 4. load balance by listening carefully to the noise from the turbos. a turbo's speed is proportional to engine load. when the whistle is about the same, they're both loaded equally. of course i didn't tell them this. i just grinned and said. &gt;i'm that good. now your turn. we have a unique to our industry software product that shaves a lot of time (@ 80%) for our users buying a certain market product and our product makes it easier to buy that product at auctions (our software wraps around 3rd party native websites to add additional functionality and a dashboard layout for fast data aggregation from multiple data points). well my tale starts 2 years ago with a guy that signed up for our software. we went above and beyond to train this guy late at nite, a couple hours after normal business hours. our account managers and support staff spent hours with this guy trying to teach him (it's not rocket science, it's actually pretty easy to use) the software and best practices to get him drilled in quickly. one day he emails me complaining how he hates certain functionality on one of the client sites we wrap around - i explained in a very business professional email that those functions are native site functionality that we do not control, those are elements native to the website and he should contact that company to express any changes he would like made. he then replies back and ccs the entire executive staff at the other company screaming in all caps "i have complained about these issues for years and no one listens to me!!!!!". so he tried to busroll me. because of other staff abuse and him just 'not getting it', i was able to get him cut loose and banned. the only user i have ever banned in my 20+ it/support career. it was that bad. we put notes in our crm to never call the guy again and don't let him sign back up. fast forward to yesterday. we just launched a new product at a recent trade show event and guess who signed up. new sales staff and a recent merger or our crm software converged into them not knowing and they signed him. yesterday, as soon as we found out we let the new account manager know the fine details of the situation so he is prepared for the shitstorm this user may bring. last night, the emails begin from the account manager 'i have a situation on my hands'. within a couple hours the guy was blowing up my ams phone/email with complaints and abuse. 1st email from the manager - cut him loose, we knew this would happen and he isn't worth the time and effort. user banned again! seriously made my night. love it when a company has your back and won't put up with bullshit abuse this was a little while back now working one of my first jobs in it, it was a laptop repair place that mainly did toshiba warranty repairs. now let me just give you some background info, this place was fairly dodgy, they would claim all sorts of parts from toshiba even if it wasn't a warranty job. screens were a great one as at that time they could cost upwards of $1000-$2000 just for the screen replacement. they would also charge customers ridiculous labour hours as they claimed they had to test the laptops thoroughly before giving it back when in reality we never did any testing other than checking if the problem was fixed then moved on to the next one. this one model of toshiba (forget which one exactly) would always come in with the same issue, the screen connectors would come loose and cause the screen to display incorrectly, showing different colours, lines across the screen, etc. a few months into the job a customer comes in with this exact issue, by then i'd done enough of them to spot the problem right away. the customer stated (in a nice way) that he was in a rush as he needed to get to work and needed the laptop. as he was polite about it i thought, hell ill fix it right here and now. i knew what the problem was. so i quickly pulled the screen apart, cleaned the monitor cable connections, plugged it all back in and put it back together. fired it up and sure enough, screen was displaying correctly. only took me a few minutes. the customer stood there in awe as if to say "how the hell did you just do that?" he was happy to pay the bill and was on his way, thanking me for fixing it so quickly. a couple of days later the manager approaches me for a chat, he goes on to tell me that i should never fix anything on the spot as we could have kept it for a day or two and charged the customer a lot more for it. i defended myself by saying that customer probably left there and would have been so happy he would have told his friends about it and given us more business through word of mouth / referrals. but he wouldn't have any of it, that's not how this company operated, they would rather rip people off. he then gave me 2 options, either i play their dodgy game or leave. i got fired friday that week.the inevitable consequence of heading to bed the second you get home is that the morning tends to come quicker than you expected. i arrived bleary eyed not truly knowing what fresh hell angie was about to concoct that day. my fate was postponed as angie was busy providing a critique of every detail as quietblondegirl rearranged her desk to angie's preference. it became apparent that angie had taken issue to some typical girlie deskwear and was ordering it be suitably secreted in desk drawers or disposed of. a grim reminder of another of yesterday's ordeals came in the shape of an email from hr tank demanding to know when her "new faster" computer would be delivered. not only was hrt's computer perfectly fine, it was only 10 months old and not due for replacement for two years. this, i knew, was an argument i would have to save for later. i logged a ticket and moved on. bhit arrived in just after me and made a pit-stop at my desk. he must have felt it his duty to appear interested over my late night last night. his pale head seemed to silhouette against the dimly lit office lighting. i grabbed the opportunity like a child with a new toy and demanded that we resolve this build area problem immediately. with angie trapped in her reprimand of qbg, i knew i was stealing her thunder! "this is getting just stupid now. customers are complaining about us doing hardware replacements and rebuilds at the desk side, what's more they're taking longer as we've had to use usb hard disks for builds since the ghost server went missing; we have six machines now that nobody knows where they are; the networking gear has also gone missing; what annoys me is that all this was working perfectly fine while we had our build area. so the fact remains, you need to sort this out now. we have a major rollout project coming up, sort it out!" my concern echoed with my vocal severity; bhit was well and truly put in his place. i could feel angie wincing as i had beaten her to the punch. bhit's bald head nodded as he claimed he understood. with every nod, a ceiling light just slightly came into view as he stood over my desk, almost cowering behind the green partition. it was about damn time he took this on board! bhit walked away with the weight of the world on his shoulders. he knew i was right, he knew he had to step in. i sat at my desk uncomfortably, the newly recovered bleach-smelling ghost server had found temporary shelter home under my desk where my legs should go; the psu fan blew hot air, almost providing some relief from the cold - a small yet powerful offering from the inanimate object almost thanking me for its rescue. the prize was doubly exciting as for first time in many weeks, my overnight whatsalive script proudly showed ghost server as now being rejoined to the network, like a soldier's homecoming. it's location? switch 303b, port 19, area its. i busied myself that morning by staying rooted to my desk, firing out responses to some of my tickets. in part, i wanted to make sure bhit was doing his job, but i also wanted to see how angie would react to having the rug pulled out from under her again! an hour rolled by and angie was still busy reprimanding the team. she had worked out - or been shown - how to properly use touchpaper and its accompanying stats screens! the evidence of an inter-team rat was all too clear as angie, who could barely use outlook, could never have worked out touchpaper to this degree. nevertheless, this rat would have to be discovered at a later date! tea in hand, i rolled up to bhit's desk for progress. finally, he had some news. i was to report to facilities so they could show me some rooms. i picked up my napalm death fleece to embark on my fantastic voyage. but, the familiar loud rattle of angie's keys disappearing into her small leather handbag accompanied her bony figure as it stood up to place a black and grey shawl around her veiny neck. "right, let's go" she proclaimed, as if to usurp leadership of my mission. bhit cowered behind his computer screen rather than face confrontation. what could i say? i felt the next hour of efficient decision making suddenly hampered as angie set off to facilities, as if dragging me by my ear like a scolded schoolboy! after the facilities manager had led us to our third room visit, it soon became clear what angie thought constituted a suitable room. she wanted something near to the main office so she could check up on us regularly, difficult to work in and not much space. ironically, the meeting room would have fit angie's specifications exactly! i wanted something near the it cupboard for supplies - access was another battle i was soon to wage - plenty space and somewhere away from the freezing cold aircon vents. we finally came upon angie's ideal. the only access was a flight of stairs - just short enough in number to appear inconsequential, yet just ever so slightly add enough inconvenience to keep this bitter woman happy. add to the annoyance of not being able to get a trolley up them, they were just narrow enough to ensure scraped knuckles in the event of anything bulky! this would be enough for angie to know that this place would be a last resort - no longer a fort of solitude when the outside world became too much! the room itself was just about big enough for a couple of desks and right above the door hummed the icy cold draft of the aircon vent. "this is totally unsuitable! any one of the first few rooms would be fine!" i protested. angie completely ignored me as her bitter face spat out, "this will do!". the facilities manager looked perplexed at angie's decision. rather than argue it, he just agreed and muttered something about arranging access and desks. i knew this would happen. i relayed our adventure to its as angie disappeared off for another starbucks run with her menopause group. their faces looked angry. calls of "out of all the rooms you just saw, angie picked some shithole that's basically gone unused for years?" rather than offer an explanation, i merely motioned in the direction of bhit, still cowering behind his monitor. i could see none of my colleagues were going to speak up. it'd have to be me again. fine. "bhit..." i started. he almost winced behind his monitor - he knew what was coming. "can you come and join us for a second?" after regaling yet again what had just transpired, bhit seemed like he was mustering all the courage that he could. as i continued let loose on what a stupid decision angie had made, together with her obvious attempts to prevent the team actually working, he dug deep one last time. with a quivering yet determined voice, he said "i thought i told you to get a new build room sorted out? well, which one do you want?" i looked back at my crew and just said, "well, actually, the it cupboard was perfect! it's got a window, it's worked fine for years, there's plenty storage; in fact it's only called a cupboard because there's racking and shelving in there! i also have an email you sent to fat tony from 3rd line when he was on 2nd authorizing the use of the cupboard and having facilities convert part of it for workspace..." sometimes, the odd swift half after work with monkeys in other teams can pay dividends ;) "leave it with me!" said bhit as he made for the doorway. its smiled at me, but deep down i shat a brick; i've really done it now. if i wind up getting bhit to relinquish the chains on our beloved cupboard, i can only imagine what sort of games angie will play with that one. but i was pleased. for once, i was up where she didn't know i was up! she was out with a bunch of menopausal women, blissfully unaware, sipping her insipid starbucks coffee, somehow providing life support for her scrawny architecture... i decided i didn't care about angie's reaction anymore. i'd won a major victory. now, to just let the day play out. i wonder what monday morning will bring?

&gt;customer: i traveled abroad with my phone, i didn't use it and now its broken! &gt;me: can you specify what exactly is broken? do you get a signal? &gt;customer: no, i can't even turn it on. the battery died on my vacation, i didn't bring the charging cable, because i wasn't going to use it. &gt;me: did you plug it in when you got home? &gt;customer: yes, it's plugged in right now, it still doesn't work. did you change my contract while i was abroad? she thought we barred her contract because she was abroad. &gt;me: no, besides, that wouldn't break your phone. what happens when you try turning it on? &gt;customer: should i try that? &gt;me: yes, please. &gt;customer: oh it's doing something. did you fix it? &gt;me: you have to turn it on when it's off, otherwise it won't do anything. &gt;customer: oh i see. well thank you. will this happen everytime i go abroad? &gt;me: no, it has nothing to do with that. this went on for a while, at the end of the call, she was still convinced that we shut her phone down because she went abroad.[previous]( monday mid-morning &gt;**new ticket** - *a program is not working. recently had a computer upgrade, please advice.* —pursales typical, no information at all. i picked up the phone and called pursales. &gt;me: hey, it’s it here. what program isn’t working? &gt;pursales: ahh yes. come take a look. i can’t get certain programs working at all. i sighed, and resigned myself to a trip up to sales. as i walked out of my office into the it department redcheer smiled and walked over, she held a box in one hand. &gt;redcheer: chocolate? &gt;me: where’d you get these? i looked down at the nice box of chocolates presented to me. i took a coffee flavored one. &gt;redcheer: ummm, hr? &gt;me: are you asking me? &gt;redcheer: no, no hr got them, i was a bit upset there on friday. i think these are meant to make me feel better. i shrugged and started walking to sales, popping the chocolate into my mouth as i went. savoring the delightful coffee flavor. ***** as i arrived at pursales desk, she looked up slightly startled. her eyes narrowed at me. &gt;pursales: are you it? &gt;me: yep. which program isn’t working? &gt;pursales: are you eating chocolate?! i swallowed the remaining chocolate, and smiled. &gt;me: coffee flavoured, my favourite. &gt;pursales: **so** unprofessional. pursales turned her nose up at me as if i were a peasant and she a princess. i decided to ignore it, focus on the job. i took control of the mouse off her and opened up a few critical programs. &gt;me: which program is causing the error? &gt;pursales: i can’t get my purple monkey to work. &gt;me: purple monkey….? pursales snatched the mouse back off me and quickly directed her browser to the bonzibuddy website. it was blocked. &gt;pursales: on my home computer i got it from here, but i can’t download it. when i tried moving it with usb drives it failed. &gt;me: this is spyware. i honestly couldn’t believe someone wanted to install bonzibuddy. &gt;pursales: i want my monkey! &gt;me: no. i’m not installing bonzibuddy on a company computer. &gt;pursales: install it! i need my monkey. he helps me do work. &gt;me: no. pursales gave me a look of fury. she didn’t seem to understand the term “no.” &gt;pursales: i’ll get my manager. i need this working. i sighed i didn’t really want to talk to the sales manager. i turned my nose up at pursales. &gt;me: this particular program is, **so** unprofessional. [next](this tale harks back a few years when we were in the midst of replacing the menagerie of thinkpads in the wild with a fleet of dell laptops. luckily we had $hard_worker contracting for us at the time - he powered through almost all of these while i was busy doing other things. we started on the sales reps, as they were (a) logistically the most challenging and (b) not generally known for their fastidious treatment of laptops, so some machines were running on borrowed time. to address the geographical challenges, we bought 10 or so 32gb flash drives and bundled them with the new laptops, along with a sheet of basic information about how to set the new machine up and the major differences between windows xp and 7. we also included a note asking them to call $hard_worker so that he could log in remotely and finish their email setup, install their home office printer and walk them through transferring their data. one overcast friday afternoon, my phone rang. i reluctantly put aside my oh-so-good chicken schnitzel burger. &gt;**me:** $company it, this is moufassa. &gt;**$remote_sales_rep:** oh hi moufassa, it's $rsr here. &gt;*$rsr was only a couple of years off retirement at the time and a self-confessed computer know-nothing, but a very pleasant guy to deal with. he also lives around 200km from the nearest regional centre, so we had his type in mind when we devised the flash drive plan.* &gt;**$rsr:** i received a new computer from you a few weeks ago, and it's working really well now. i just need your help getting $crm_app working. &gt;**me:** sure, i can hel... hang on, it's working well **now**? was it not working properly before? &gt;**$rsr:** well it didn't have any of my stuff on it and i couldn't print, so i transferred my stuff and installed the printer software. &gt;**me:** oh so you talked to $hard_worker? &gt;**$rsr:** no, i didn't call anyone. i did it all myself. &gt;**me:** y... you did it yourself?? transferred all your data from your old laptop to the new one?? &gt;**rsr:** yep, and yep. that's what that usb drive you included is for, isn't it? &gt;**me:** *[gobsmacked]* well yeah, but *we're* here to help you do it! &gt;**$rsr:** i nearly threw it out the window a few times, but i didn't want to bother you. let's just say i know a lot more about how google works. i quickly sorted his crm issue out and then checked out his handiwork. all his photos, outlook archives, documents, desktop files - *everything* was in its place. $rsr retired last year but he will forever remain the user that could. tl;dr: user interrupts consumption of a chicken schnitzel burger, wins place in moufassa's heart. edit: hey, qotd! sweet. edit teh second: lots of people have asked for details on the chicken schitzel burger... i've described it in the comments. enjoy, but don't blame me for the resultant hunger pangs. i'm on the senior helpdesk team for a hospital system in my area. we have a secure messaging system that has both desktop and mobile phone interfaces, that nurses will page doctors with. this system is entirely independent of our ad domain, but uses our exchange email addresses to create user accounts. a call was forwarded to me for assistance with a user who couldn't log in. me=thepaintsaint; nurse=technologically inept nurse; nm=nurse's manager &gt;me: "information systems, this is thepaintsaint." &gt;nm: "hello, this is nm, i need to get one of my nurses logged into the secure message system. we've called a few times and placed several tickets, yet she's still unable to get logged in." &gt;me: "sure, let me pull up the console... who are we talking about?" &gt;nm: "nurse, she's gone through the setup via email invite, and she logged on once; but she can no longer remember her username to log in." &gt;me: "ok, let me bring her account up... uh... i haven't seen this before... let me make sure it's right." the username is a user-defined field when setting up the account. most people use the first part of their username - i.e., if my email address is thepaintsaint@domain.org, i'd use thepaintsaint as my username. but this user was special. &gt;me: "yeah, this is odd, but i guess it works. her username is 'domain.org'." &gt;nm: "you mean like our website?!?" &gt;me: "yeah, nurse's username is our website address... never seen someone do that, but since the system is entirely different than the rest of our network, it could be 'happyanimals' or 'domain.org' or anything really that they want to put in there. have her try that, and give us a call if you need further help." tl;dr: user uses our domain name as her username, it works.a teacher at my school sent email to the it department asking where her students could get copies of ms powerpoint from. she said her students would need it during the year when doing project presentations for her class. we emailed back telling her that powerpoint was available in office 365, which all of the students can get for free. it is a part of our site licensing program. they just needed to log into their student accounts to get the details. at the end of the day we get another email from the instructor asking which building office 365 was in. she couldn't find it when she walked around looking for it. **tldr:** manager won't let us make fake signs leading to the fire escape. so i came into work today and i had an email marked **urgent!* in outlook. it seems that the "end of fiscal year" inventory is due at the end of this week and they need some information. we use ibm tivoli endpoint manager (purchased from a company called bigfix) for our inventory stuff (and patching, etc) so i ask what information they need. &gt; we just need all the boxes that run websphere and their versions... well, that information isn't just sitting in a text file on the servers. a batch file on each box will output the information for us, and we can just pipe it into a text file, but that would require us to touch each box or push out a fixlet to do it (we obviously decided to do the latter). after that text file is generated we can parse the information from the text file and put it in web reports (another ibm purchase from bigfix). it should be easy. (i never should have said that). i tell them that this won't be a problem. it will take me an hour or two to set up the fixlet and the analysis for web reports, but it will probably take a day for tivoli to gather all the relevant boxes, another day to push the action to them (we have 150k+ endpoints), and then at least 4 hours for the analysis to parse the text files and pull the version information. well, this is unacceptable. their part of the report is due by end of day and they only need some "quick and simple" information. i inform them that there really isn't a way to push it any faster even if i babysit it and i do not have access to these boxes so i can't just run the batch files manually. well, at this point they decide to have a chat with my boss and it precipitates a meeting. we're all sitting around the table and they tell my boss: &gt; craysh has been willfully unhelpful in helping us get some easily accessed information. he gave us an eta of 2 1/2 days before he could even get to it, and this is important! he asked me what was going on, and being familiar with tivoli himself (as well as our environment) he understood exactly what would take so long. he turned to the inventory group and said: &gt; this is how long it will take to get this information parsed out. he's not stringing you along, it's just how our infrastructure will work. once it's in place it will take at most 4 hours between updating the versioning information and it will be available to you any time you need it. they respond: &gt; that is totally unacceptable. we need this information in be the end of the day! my boss responded: &gt; your lack of planning does not constitute an emergency on our part. i got chills. okay, i'm going to start by saying this did not happen recently, it was probably around october 2014 time. basically i worked on a it helpdesk for an outsourcing company who was contracted at the time to a large transport company in the uk. i was working nights as cover for a colleague who was off sick. this is the story of my worst user ever, at 4am! lets call him s and me l. &gt;l: how can i help you sir? &gt;s: i logged a call with you guys earlier as my pc will not turn on at all. i went through the diagnostics with a colleague of yours who advised me i will need an replacement machine. &gt;l: okay yeah i can see on our systems an engineer is scheduled for later today between 9am-5pm to replace your pc. &gt;s: thats no good, i am unable to get any files off my pc at the moment so i can't continue to work. i want an engineer out right now. &gt;l: sir the on-call field services engineer is only available for high priority incidents that are affecting multiple users. unfortunately this does not justify a callout. &gt;s: this pc should of been replaced years ago it is very old and you are only replacing it now that it has broken? this is pathetic &gt;l: apologies sir but all pc's on the estate are issued at the same time and only replaced when there is a irreparable issue with one of them. &gt;s: i don't care. if this i do not have an engineer here in 30 minutes i will be going to my manager and handing in my notice as i can not work under these conditions. &gt;l: unfortunately i can do nothing to get the engineer to you as it would be against all of our policies for an issue of this sort. &gt;s: whatever, half an hour or i will be leaving! **phone hangs up** a few days later i was doing some account admin work during quiet spells on the phones, and a request comes through for me to delete s's account. turns out he did actually hand over in his notice over a broken pc. the even funnier thing was i looked into his incident history and this was the first issue we had on record for him! he had never before had a pc issue at work since we upgraded the entire estate (4 years prior!) tl;dr : guy has a broken pc, demands fs at 4am, i decline, he quits his job.grandma had been using her pc with xp for an awful long time, and realised she needed to upgrade after microsoft started putting popups on her pc. we order her a nice new overkill dell laptop so it will last the next 10 years, she receives it and rings me up after an hour of not being able to open her laptop lid. &gt; grandma: hi jzmx, are you busy? &gt;me: nope, what's up? &gt;grandma: i just got my new laptop and neither me or grandad can work out how to open it up, we don't want to break it so we thought we better ring you. &gt;me: you're having trouble opening the box? &gt;grandma: no, we got it out of the box, but we can't get to the keyboard. there are two clips at the front but they don't do anything! &gt;me: one moment, i'll look up a picture online... at this point i find the laptop and see there is no mechanism to open the lid. &gt; me: you literally just pull the lid up, there are no clips. &gt;grandma: there are two clips here, are you sure you're looking at the right picture? i look at the images again and suddenly realise what she's looking at. &gt;me: grandma, you're looking at the back of the laptop! you need to turn it around. those clips are the hinges for the screen! at this point there is a lot of laughter from both sides. &gt;grandma: the dell logo was round the wrong way though, why is the dell logo upside down from the front? &gt;me: grandma, that's because when you open the lid its the correct orientation from the back side. more laughter and then the call ends, this was the first time she had owned a laptop in fairness.customer calls in and leaves a message on our ticket system: &gt; "i need an urgent call back!" no details, just panic. this is a team leader / supervisor at our largest client, a call centre, so i figure the router's exploded or something. i pick up the phone. &gt; him: "yeah, i'm looking to move a phone from this end of the desk to the other. the cable doesn't reach that far." &gt; me: "...sorry, our engineers are all booked today. we'll be onsite tomorrow but not before then. have you tried swapping the cable for a longer one?" &gt; him: "oh! oh, yeah, that would work." what?! leaves me wondering if he's ever dialled 999 because he stubbed his toe. other urgent support requests this supervisor has called us about: - user's 2nd monitor turned off and won't turn back on. we've tried everything! (solution: plug the power cable back in.) - he can't access the shared folder on the server. (solution: connect his laptop to the network.) - user's computer crashes constantly. (solution: user was lying in hopes of getting issued a new pc.)i don't work in it, but i'm the only tech savvy person in the department. i came out of a long appointment and one of the admin staff came running up to me saying that her monitor has gone weird. it turned 90 degrees, and she tried to turn the monitor to compensate, but still had to crick her neck at 45 degrees for about an hour waiting for me to come out. i pressed the shortcut to get the screen to rotate back to normal. she looks gobsmacked. but at least i saved her neck. knowing her, she could have been like that all day!we've all been there before. there's a conference room full of field reps, sales reps and the like in town for training. it's day two of the training. and after yesterday's treat of plugging speakers into a laptop, i thought all the high level work had been done. boy was i wrong. today we had a crisis not seen in the it world since stuxnet or the michelangelo virus. my manager tasked me with resolving a problem that brought the conference room to its knees. it seems the projector wasn't displaying any video. like at all. like it was as if there were no projector at all. the regional manager had the vga plug connected to his laptop, just as i had directed him to do from yesterday. he even had the laptop turned on. but, lo, no video, of any kind was being displayed. drawing on my 20+ years of system administration and tier ii level deskside technician experience. i did something crazy. most technicians would cringe at the mere suggestion of this practice. i picked up the remote control for the projector sitting next to the laptop. was it that simple? i pressed the button that says on. i held my breath. at first, the image was faint. like a unpreserved medieval fresco painting. then in vivid technicolor the same display from the laptop appeared on the screen. i nearly passed out from the excitement. few exceptional techs can realize the genuine high you get when fixing a problem of that magnitude that quickly.i left a job a few years ago. today, they called me back to solve a problem with their website that my replacement couldn't handle. i decided to skim through their tickets with their web host so i could see what had already been tried. in the process, i found this gem, written by my replacement: &gt;"we are installing new software and we need access to the main router i think it’s a asus router – do you know where i can find it - i have the password." let's forget for a moment that you don't need physical access to your router to install software. he is somehow under the impression that the support rep at his web host - who lives in another city and has never even been to his building - can tell him physically where in the office his router is.so, my kids (young teens) are bitching because they want netflix and we don't have it. talking it through, we decide to drop a premium cable package and order netflix. everyone is happy with this. i send the family a text after doing this the next day... &amp;gt;*we now have a netflix account. [username] [password]. if anyone watches this over your phone, i will hang you by your toes in the backyard. use wifi.... love you!* oldest kid goes on a weekend trip the next day with his friend and their family for the weekend. monday morning, i get a text from at&amp;amp;t: &amp;gt;*"you have reached 75% of your data for the month..."* wtf?!? check at&amp;amp;t usage and netflix usage... pissed, i go talk to him after work that day: &amp;gt;me: dude. you watched netflix over the phone at [friends] lake house this weekend. what'd i say about that? &amp;gt;child: no i didn't! i used wifi! &amp;gt;me: i thought you said [friend] didn't have wifi at the lake house? &amp;gt;child: he doesn't. i created a hotspot with my phone and we watched on his laptop. &amp;gt;me: **blink blink**... waiting on a *just kidding!* &amp;gt;child: what? we used wifi. *facepalm* edit: formatting edit: holy crap. front page for this? i shall celebrate this event. first time posting yey. on mobile so forgive formatting. i just had a user call wondering why he couldn't back up his outlook file to his external hard drive. the file was 4.11gb and he had 107gb free. i'm still fairly new to it so i am stumped. i ask him to read the error to me exactly. "the file is too large for destination file system." file system? wait a minute... i am reminded of a joke from /r/programmerhumor... "yo mama is so fat she can't save files larger than 4gb!" i then direct the user on how to check which file system his drive is using. sure enough... it's fat32 and not ntfs! so he can't do anything but reduce the file size or save it somewhere else, and i let him know. :) thanks reddit! :di work it for a school. last night, at about 10, as i'm brushing my teeth, i get a somewhat frustrated email from a teacher who i helped by performing ipconfig sorcery on her laptop earlier that day. apparently that had *not* solved her problem as allegedly her internet stopped working almost the moment i left and her entire teaching day was a disaster as a result. how that is supposed to reflect badly on *me*, who didn't know about it, instead of *her*, who couldn't be bothered to dial my extension when i was there for a couple more hours that day, i'm not sure. i ignore, go to bed, and get this the next morning from one of the cc'ed administrators: &gt;i have heard nothing about what the plans are to deal with this. no, you haven't heard plans because we only became aware there was a problem literally as we were going to sleep. i'm very, very part-time and the degree to which i'm on-call is limited to, you know, reasonable daylight hours and stuff that actually **needs** to be immediately addressed. this doesn't qualify. i also get this email from another: &gt;she has been without internet for a week it is wednesday. last week was the middle of spring break. we have only been in school for 2 days so far, and i learned that there was still a problem a mere 10 hours ago. tl;dr: /u/dolphins3 isn't leaping out of bed in the middle of night and driving to work/user's house to fix the problem they sat on the entire workday without telling me, and one which has existed for longer than the current academic term. flog the it guy![previous]( heads of department meetings are a waste of time, normally. i sat down in my chair, and stared at the new projector in the middle of the boardroom table. it was a fine looking beast. so clean. &gt;vp: today’s meeting will be a little different as the head builder will be presenting the work on our buildings thats about to start. &gt;headhr: shouldn’t this have been done ages ago? the new projector pointed at the screen, eager to work. &gt;vp: let’s not get into the timetabling…. &gt;headhr: and, why are we starting a building project in the middle of winter? both valid points were completely missed by me. i was too busy admiring the sleek lines and fine gloss white exterior of the projector. &gt;vp: well yes, but… the vp never got to finish his defense as the builder had entered the room. he walked up to the projector and plugged in his computer. &gt;gbuild: so as you might be aware we’re nearing the start of our building phase…. the head builder looked up at the projector screen expectantly. the projector was displaying a plain black screen. &gt;gbuild: f*%$ing thing. headbuilder was looking down at the new projector with great fury, its glossy white cover glared unapologetically back at him. &gt;me: maybe i should take a look…. headbuilders fist rose into the air. &gt;me: **don’t** headbuilders fist slammed down into the projector, slightly dirtying its surface. my eyes glazed over. &gt;me: what the *hell!* you don’t hit equipment. ever. the head builder looked over at my face, slowly filling with anger. &gt;gbuild: calm down, these things are built to last. i once demolished a room with one inside, and when we went through the rubble with a digger we found it. it still worked. &gt;me: okay, a) no you did not. and b) don’t hit our equipment regardless of its build quality. &gt;gbuild: **are you calling me a liar?** gbuild’s face had gone completely red, he was screaming. he’d completely lost it. i opened my mouth to retort, but saw gbuilds fist clinch and thought better of it. &gt;vp: calm down… please. the head builder blinked a few times, as if remembering where he was. &gt;gbuild: sorry, everyone. …. i’m just a little stressed. i wondered why a builder who hadn’t started work would be stressed, they hadn’t screwed anything up, yet. the vp passed round paper copies of the new plans for the buildings. i took a look at the it department areas. oh for f**$ sake. &gt;me: hey vp, who made these plans? &gt;vp: gbuild is a builder and draftsman, he drew them up. why? &gt;me: fire him. he’s an idiot. &gt;vp: what? why…..? [next](another short but sweet one! before myself (it/network manager) became a one (full time) man department, there were 3 of us. one of these blokes (a mate i add) had his mom working at the company with us. she was the ceo's pa. shes a great lady, but one day she was being dippy and she had admin access (one of the few users on the system we trust to listen and no screw up). so this one day she calls us over to the office for a problem she admits shes caused. &gt;us: so whats all the fuss about? &gt;lady: i think i've broke the internet?! &gt;us: ok so what make you think you did that? &gt;lady: i was messing with the desktop and before i knew it, i had deleted the ie icon?! before i could say anything, her son comes out with: &gt;son: yea you broke the internet, nobody is able to get on the internet now, thanks mom.... (we don't tend to do this one because she's rarely is a pain for us and because shes one of our "work moms" she maybe not in it but all the support staff cover each other.) her face went white, she was mortified. i gave it 5 seconds and told her she hadn't and promptly restored the ie icon to her desktop all the while we were giggling. she took it well but safe to say her son didn't get sunday roast that weekend ;). jhjmy mom relies on me for tech support at a moment's notice. same story for the rest of you, i imagine. she calls me to fix even the simplest of things without doing much if any troubleshooting first. today's email, though, was different: &gt;really didn’t want to bug you on your weekend but i needed to figure out why i was getting the “check signal cable” message. i realized i could ask google “how to fix check cable signal cable” and learned it meant the monitor wasn’t getting the signal. then i remembered i had disconnected that cable, and not plugged it back in when i reconfigured how the wires were running across my desk. so glad i didn’t call you. &gt;pretty good, right?? &gt;love, &gt;mom *wipes away a tear* pretty good mom, pretty good.background: my mom has an ok laptop. not amazing, but not a piece of crap. my sister is a "programmer" on her robotics team (she does nothing) that i volunteer for. my sister is tech illiterate. recently, my mom turned on her laptop. she hadn't used it in a while. after taking 10 minutes to get to the desktop, she gasps. $mom: &gt; what the hell happened to my laptop? me and my dad (my dad is a tech-literate person) go over yonder, and we see an *abomination*. this poor laptop has 2 toolbars, lots of sketchy desktop shortcuts, and expired norton antivirus. and pop-ups. $mom: &gt; i didn't do anything! i haven't used this thing since october! sure enough, me and my dad look through the downloads folder, and s*** hit the fan on 11/8/15. after looking closer, we see that the first thing installed on 11/8 was a sketchy art program that i've never heard of. the kind my sister tries to get me to download on my nice desktop. $me: &gt; $sister, what the hell did you do on 11/8? $sister: &gt; i think i got the $1337artpr0gram that day. $me: &gt; did you hear of that program before you downloaded it? $sister: &gt; no, but it was free and recommended by millions of people. *facepalm* $sister: &gt; i swear i didn't download anything else! i don't even know the rest of the stuff on there! my dad is still trying to get the crap off of there. tl;dr: not everything you see on the internet is true. -a8raham l1nc0ln. also don't let your little sister have the admin password. [previous]( a new day, a new cup of coffee. i smiled as i looked at the three people assembled in the meeting room for interview round two. at least this next candidate will get a fair trial. a table had been set up, along which the head of hr, myself, the vp and bigp all sat. the interview was to start at 9am. i looked at my watch. 9.01. failed already? the door gave a rattle, then opened to a middle aged gentleman dressed in a reasonably nice suit. no tie. &gt;notie: hello, is this the… interview room? &gt;vp: yes! i take it you’re notie. come in, sit down. notie walked into the room, he placed a copy of his resume/cv in front of each of us. very professional. i looked down at the resume, it was a pretty impressive amount of skills. however under listed employment, only one company was named. &gt;vp: what did you do between school and your first job? there is a 10 year gap. notie looked down at his shoes, he looked a little … defeated. &gt;notie: err, you haven’t done a background check yet? &gt;vp: no, not… *yet*. &gt;notie: well for about seven of those years, i was in prison. before that i was in a gang, not really employed. i stopped looking at the paper he’d given me impressive as it was. prison!? &gt;headhr: what were you in prison for? if you don’t mind us asking. &gt;notie: handling a restricted substance, various firearms offenses. i only got seven years because i rolled on my old gang members. they also dropped the chargers of assault with a deadly weapon and armed robbery. &gt;vp: i see… an awkward silence settled on the conference room. i looked at his papers again. time for some tech questions. &gt;me: so what languages do you know? &gt;notie: french, german…. &gt;me: er…. i meant notie was laughing from his chair. &gt;notie: just joking, i know c++, ruby, javascript, perl, lisp plus a few things in the lower level like assembly. &gt;me: oh nice, so it says here you’ve been at the same company for 15 years. what types of jobs did you do there? &gt;notie: what didn’t i do? ummm, it was mostly helping out users. closing tickets. occasionally restoring backups, rolling out new pc’s, that kinda thing. &gt;me: oh excellent, it sounds exactly like what we do here, so can i ask why leave your previous employment now? notie looked at me from his chair, his eyes seemed hollow. &gt;notie: my previous employer was my wife’s father. &gt;headhr: ahhh… you’re getting divorced? a little tackless, i thought. notie looked troubled. &gt;notie: she passed away two months ago. unfortunately my father in law cannot stand the sight of me. a single tear ran down noties face. i looked down the table, head of hr looked mortified. vp’s face remained passive, bigp was busy eyeing notie up and down. looking back at notie i realized i should probably get him a tissue, however… we were in the middle of an interview. &gt;bigp: any questions for us? before we wrap this up. &gt;notie: no, no. can i just thank you all for giving me the opportunity to interview with you, i understand most companies avoid it because of my past. however that was over 15 years ago now, and i will work hard for any company that chooses to take me on. getting up from his chair, notie wiped the tear from his eye and left. as soon as the door was closed bigp finally spoke. &gt;bigp: well, i know redcheer personally. so i’m going to abstain from this vote. it’s up to you three to pick who gets the job. come tell me when you’ve decided. bigp walked out the door. &gt;vp: well, we’re hiring redcheer. head of hr looked horrified. &gt;headhr: what?! heavens no. notie is way more qualified, and he’s asking for very low pay on that position with so much experience. &gt;vp: we’re not hiring a convicted armed robber! it’s not happening. headhr being a people person had obviously decided to “save” notie. i didn’t know if that was a good or a bad thing. &gt;headhr: he’s the candidate you put forward! how can you not want to hire him now? &gt;vp: you told me to get someone at 6pm yesterday! i don’t just have people just sitting around wanting jobs. i rang up an agency and asked for an urgent interviewee for an it position. i asked if anyone would be keen enough to come in for a rush interview today. they told me they had the perfect person. little did i know it was a **criminal**. &gt;headhr: he’s reformed! and he looks ready to work. the engagement between the vp and head of hr had caught me off guard. i still didn’t know what to think. &gt;vp: look this is getting us nowhere. airz, just pick one and lets go tell bigp. as we walked towards the door… i looked down at my hand, it still held notie’s resume/cv. hmmm…. pretty impressive…. [next](if you're not familiar with it, the cryptolocker virus encrypts your files and shreds them if you don't pay them $300 or so. this accounting firm got it, got the threatening letter, wiped their server because they knew they had a good backup via carbonite. the tech decided to use a privately managed key instead of letting carbonite manage it, presumably for extra security. he can't remember the password. the number of ways he fucked up is truly astounding. the owner has been blowing up my phone, desperately hoping there's some way to crack the 1024-bit encryption. all i can suggest is that she tell the nsa that edward snowden sent her these files and ask what should she do with them. edit: omg. ok, so i got some more information. 1. right when it happened, the owner asked the tech if it would be a good idea to clone the drive, then pay the money and that way the person who would supposedly log in and decrypt the files (not sure if that's how it works but that's what she said) wouldn't have access to the server. he (the tech) said it wasn't worth it. 2. right after it happened, they started to restore files from the carbonite backup, one by one. it was taking so long that the tech said it was inefficient. that's why he wiped the server to get the full backup. 3. he has apparently spent the last 8 hour or so trying every password he could remember with no luck. 4. i'm going to try to throw hashcat at it and see what happens. i have a couple of gtx680s so hey, maybe we'll get lucky. i don't actually know how to do it yet, but i'm researching like a fiend. i don't need to crack the key, i just need to get his password from it. this might be a total dead-end, but jesus, i feel like i need to do something. 5. this company does my company's payroll. i feel like i should throw that out there, just because it makes the situation so much funnier. or not. 6. i wish i could tell you the name of the company. i really do. the irony is so thick i could cut it with a banana. anyway, i'm off for the night. i can only take so much of this in one day so i'm going to head out and drink myself into a stupor with a good buddy. oh, and last, but not least, i posted here that i liked getting snapchats of random things from random people and holy fuckballs, my phone exploded. i got snaps from all over the world, with the strangest, oddest, most bizarre shit, and it's great. one guy had a chicken hat on and sent a snap-video of himself nodding to the chicken dance. i even got an epic set of boobs and a few from women too! so with that in mind, if you're bored, add warlizard and snap me stupid shit. i'm a snapping fiend, nothing of real interest, but i like taking pics and sending them out to the world. laterz. shit. i forgot one thing. i said to the owner, "well, it sucks, but at least you can go to your email and get the files. i'm sure your outlook pst wasn't encryped." "i don't send anything through email because it's not secure." i had to mute the phone. ok, last edit from my computer (i may update as i get more lit as the night progresses). i'll update as this progresses, but the funny thing is i've only been back doing the store stuff for 1 month. three times in one month i've seen something that in 20+ years of it i've never experienced. so while i have great sympathy for this owner and the firm, omg, there isn't enough butter for the popcorn. edit: someone snuck in last night, shit in my mouth and put little socks over all my teeth. hungover edit: i'm really enjoying the snaps. what's really amazing is how good looking the people are who are snapping me. maybe it's a self-selecting pool, but the stereotype of the nerdy neckbeard is not being supported here. i work for a small 3rd party it company who install and manage severs/applications for small to medium businesses. today the customer let's call him bob tells me he thinks the server shut down last night with no warning and that he is going to change the ups (he bought the ups to install himself to save money) me: ok bob let me log onto the server and check the log bob: ok i'll change the ups in a few minutes then few minutes pass.. and i get disconnected from logmein while checking the logs i give bob a call me: bob can you go to the server and check if its still on bob: oh i just changed the ups there now its turning back on me:... did you shut it down before you do that? bob:.. no, did i have too? me: yes.... bob: hangs up now the e-mail mailbox wont mount in exchange so now i have to try and repair it while the whole company cannot send or receive emails.... thanks bob tl:dr user plugs out plug of live server without shutting down to change ups himself to save money and corrupts the mail database costing him a lot more time and money. thanks bob edit: got the mailbox repaired about 4 hours after the incideant, it cost bob a lot more than a a call out fee now :d[this tale]( reminded me of one of my own. i worked frontline for a mass retailer with thousands of stores all around the country. every week, we had critical applications that crashed and hundred of people calling us to check if it was down, when it'd be back up and so on... so of course, we set up automated recordings answering all these questions, but there were *always* a lot of idiots who kept waiting because they were to stupid to listen. so one time, i pick up the phone and there isn't anybody on the line, but i can hear people talking in the background. so after raising my voice a bit and trying to get their attention for a minute, a woman picks up the receiver. i tell her that she shouldn't do that because when that happens, we usually end up dropping the call after 30 seconds. then she starts getting all annoyed "yeah but i was on hold and i was busy working on something else, it's your fault for taking so much time answering" (which i know is bullshit, she was talking about clothes with her coworker while i was trying to get her attention). of course she's calling about the outage, so i tell i tell her "all the answers to your questions were in the automated recording that was looping during the 15 minutes you spent on hold." "yeah i don't listen to these, when i don't immediately have a technician i just put the phone on speaker and do something else." i was pretty pissed at that point, so i tell her in a really nice voice "ok no problem, i'll just put you back on the queue so you can listen to the messages again." then i dropped her on the queue before she had the time to answer. if you're following the story, and you're not up to the new job hit the previous button. if you've never read one of my tales before, hopefully this small arc will hold up on its own. ***** [previous]( first day of my new job. time to make a good impression. i walked in the door of the design company. a secretary greeted me. &gt;me: hello, im airz. i’ll be your tech for the week. i make my smile wide, nothing like a great first impression. &gt;sec: hey airz, thank goodness you’re here! my smile faltered a little, nothing ever good happens when people are thankful for a tech being around. &gt;sec: follow me i’ll take you around to the new pc’s that aren’t working. i followed the secretary into the design company. everything looked fairly tidy. we stopped in front of five brand new machines. &gt;sec: our tech received these last week, he’s installed all the programs and everything onto them already. however they keep crashing. &gt;me: crashing? the secretary turned one on. it booted up fine. first impressions, it was a fast, good machine. &gt;sec: wait for it…. wait for it… after about ten minutes waiting for this brand new pc to crash, nothing had happened. &gt;sec: oh. they’re working now. &gt;me: maybe we should open a few things, see if its a specific program. i opened a bunch of programs, mostly at the same time. design programs are huge loads, which i’d forgotten. i was stuck watching the computer struggle to open four programs that should never be open at the same time. **peshuuuuu** the computer had just turned off, mid load. &gt;sec: see! they’re broken. we only got them last week too. &gt;me: mmmm if they’re all like this its probably a manufactures fault… &gt;sec: can you do a return for us? my smile was painted to my face. good impressions remember. &gt;me: sure, sure. i’ll just ring your tech to double check some things. &gt;sec: oh sure, he left you this. the secretary handed me a list of contact numbers, along with a small set of instructions on day to day work. i rang the tech’s number. &gt;me: hey, tech. it’s airz here. i’m covering your post for the week. &gt;tech: oh airz hey, good of you to call me. i looked at the five new computers set in front of me. they looked good, brand new and not cheap. odd they’re all failing. &gt;me: so, these new computers you’ve gotten. &gt;tech: top of the line they are. &gt;me: yeah, really nice pc’s. unfortunately they seem to be turning off under load. tech sounded a little downhearted about that. i think he’s very proud of his department. &gt;tech: weird. all five? &gt;me: yeah every one of them. should we send them back to the manufacturer? &gt;tech: package them up and ship ‘em out. &gt;me: aye aye. i hung up the phone, a return was my first job at the company. nice. as i picked up the first pc i heard a small rattle. weird, top of the line pc’s usually have cable management. i cracked open the case. what i saw almost chilled me to the core, even my good first impressions smile was gone. every power cord to a fan had been cut. not unplugged, cut. i grabbed the phone and called up tech again. &gt;me: hey, tech. its airz again. do you know anything about cut fan cables inside the new computers? &gt;tech: oh! i do. i always replace the fans with water-cooling. &gt;me: why? &gt;tech: design companies are a place for creative people. fans are loud, they break the creative process. i thought about asking how he cooled the water sump without fans, but thought better of it. &gt;me: so how.. did these fans get cut. &gt;tech: oh i was about to replace those fans, with water-cooling, but i didn’t have all the parts. &gt;me: so the cords got cut….? &gt;tech: they’re easier to take out cut. i looked at the pc internals. they didn’t seem too cooked. &gt;me: so what do you want me to do with these pc’s? &gt;tech: the parts should be there by now. maybe just install the water cooling. i hung up the phone. that was my first conversation with the most forgetful tech ever, and now i was working in his place for a week. magical. [next](i spent a little under a year working in a retail electronics store, which specialized in computer hardware. since my specialty was the networking equipment, i often complemented my sales with tech support, helping customers figure out what they needed, how they could set up a network, etc. most of the people i worked with were average users or office types with a minimal or basic understanding, but there's one that i just can't forget. the customer came in looking for a high-power solution for his new business, and wanted eight machines on a wired network, as well as a wireless router that would cover something like 12000 square feet. smelling a steak dinner commission, i spent close to 90 minutes giving him personalized attention, walking him through how ports and addresses worked, what kind of cabling solution was the most cost-effective, the pros and cons of various routers, etc. finally, with about $2000 of hardware, software, accessories, cat6 spools, and warranty forms (cha-ching) in his shopping cart, this happens. **customer**: alright, great! you've been such a huge help. i think the only question i haven't asked yet is how i connect the internal network to the internet. **me**: couldn't be simpler! just run this cable here from that port to the modem or gateway provided by your isp, and you'll be able to manage all the settings in the software i showed you. **customer**: isp? *the feeling of impending doom suddenly welled up inside me.* **customer**: i thought the whole reason i was buying all this was so i wouldn't have to deal with those scummy companies. you told me this would be able to get me online. *the shadow of doom fell over the land.* **me**: yesss... once you have a hookup from your isp. you wouldn't expect to get power in your home if you didn't pay the electric company, no matter how fancy your light fixtures are, right? same concept applies here. **customer**: what do you have that can get me around that? you've been so helpful already, just work with me here. **me**: sir, i'm sorry, but there's no way to work around subscribing to an isp if you want internet service. who's your internet provider at home? **customer**: oh, i just use the wifi. **me**: right, but who do you pay for that service? **customer**: i don't pay, it's the free one in my apartment building, netgear-some-numbers. it's slow, but i figured i could get better speed with all this expensive stuff you just sold me. now you're telling me i should pay on top of all this? *i could hear it whispering in my ear, "doom doom doom."* **me**: it's not that you should, that's just how the internet works. **customer**: what about my home wifi? why can't i get something similar at my office? **me, not wanting to tell the customer he's been stealing service from a similarly tech-illiterate neighbor**: i don't know the details of your home setup, sir. but the setup we worked out here will cover your needs and make sure that you can keep things running smoothly and quickly even with a basic, no-frills isp package. **customer**: so you're saying you don't have anything here to *actually* connect my business to the internet? well, fuck you very much for wasting my time. i'll just find someone who knows what they're talking about. he walked off, leaving me to put away everything in his cart. ***tl;dr save money on data by upgrading to a faster router.*** i built a $100 pc for a family and my usually angry boss suddently gifts them the accessories. so yesterday i had another client at the store, carrying what seemed at first sight like a 20 years old computer, the man seems to be in his 30s come in and with $elboss and my co-worker being away, i attend him, for context, i'm in mexico and we use pesos (mxn) i'll just convert the currency for the tale. &gt;$me: welcome to taco-mputerstore, my name is crescent-argonian, how may i help you? &gt;$father: hello young man, i'm going to need you to give me a budget for a basic computer for my son, it's his 9th birthday and i want to gift him a computer. &gt;$me: of course, what is your maximum budget? &gt;$father: we only have about $100 (or $1900 mxn, my currency) &gt;$me: only $100? well sir, that is going to be tough, there isn't much we can do with that. &gt;$father: in that case, you think you can upgrade me this one? he places the case on the desk and $elboss approach us. &gt;$elboss: hello sir, what can we do for you? &gt;$me: boss, the sir would like us to upgrade his desktop pc, but he's on a tight budget, didn't we had some spares from the other day? &gt;$elboss: mhm, sir, we have some parts on the back, let me get you a budget. my boss brings some paper and pen and starts writing on it, 100gb hdd, intel atom cpu plus the motherboard, windows 7, 2gb of ram, and a power supply, the father looked at it, next to the numbers, close to $75. &gt;$me: we can also sell you the keyboard, mouse and monitor. &gt;$father: and how would that cost? &gt;$me: give me a second. i head to the store computer and search for the cheapest monitor, we still had a 1024x768 acer monitor in stock somewhere, only $25 &gt;$me: well sir, we reached your exact budget for this build. &gt;$father: what's left? &gt;$me: well, the keyboard, loudspeaker and mouse will be about $25 more. (we didn't had many in stock) the father seemed to accept the offer but he was clearly worried about the remain of the payment. &gt;$father: i'll try to get the remaining $25 &gt;$elboss: no no señor, none of eso. we both looked at him. &gt;$elboss: this pc is for your son, so those parts are yours for free. my boss while still a not so bad person, he was extremeley strict and doesn't like anyone failing to sell anything, much less giving it away just like that, but if we are not playing loud stuff on youtube or browse reddit we are cool, i still couldn't believe a boss like him had a heart, he looked at me. &gt;$elboss: crescent, go build his son's pc. so i went to the back, pick up the parts from the storage room, and started working on it, i grabbed that old hdd that still had windows 7 home installed, got rid of anything but the os, installed the rest of the parts, voila! didn't take me long to finish and i hand the father the now reborn pc, and the father shook my hand, and my bosses', i could see happiness in his face. &gt;$father: thank you so mucho señor and young lizard ~~overlord~~ man, thank you so so much, you made me a very happy father and my son will be so happy as well. he left shortly after, i didn't expect much but sometimes, even us from tfts can have happy endings. edit: a couple of clarifications ~~i will be your new argonian overlord, gimme skooma~~ tl;dr: father can't afford a complete pc, ebenezer scrooge feels bad for him and gifts him the rest of the parts.i was trying to get this client to send a picture of a router to the support email. &gt;me: send it to support@genericnetworks.com &gt;them: genericnetwork? &gt;me: genericnetworks...with an s &gt;them: network &gt;me: no, networks, with an s, at the end. &gt;them: ok 5 mins later haven't received it and i called them back: &gt;me: did you send it to support@genericnetworks.com &gt;them: genericnetwork &gt;me: it is genericnetworks....with an s &gt;them: network? &gt;me: spelled it out &gt;them: is support with an s &gt;me: **headdesk** run a computer repair shop in a small mountain town, and i get some real gems in here. today, i got yelled at by a customer for quite some time. yesterday this customer brought me this beige gateway windows me computer because the drive was clicking. no problem, cloned the drive, popped in the new one, and it booted right up. charged them 95 for the service. they stop by, i show them it works, and they go on their way. then i get a call at the end of the day, "it doesn't work, we're bringing it back tomorrow. huff puff huff huff." so they stop in today. the customer is fuming, red in the face, fists shaking. they looked like they were going to smash my display cases. they begin to scream, "you fucked up my computer! ten years, and not a single issue and you broke it." so i calmly inquire what the nature of the issue is, and i got a surprising response. i'll save you the capital letters, assume screaming, "you broke the damn thing! i brought it home and hooked it all up right, and don't tell me i didn't because i labeled every cable before unhooking it. i plugged it in and nothing happened! i unplugged it and plugged it back in a dozen times and nothing happened!" okay... maybe a power supply issue? let's see. i toss it up on my bench and plug it into the kvm, and press the power button and it turns on. all hell breaks loose. "what was that?! you pressed a button to turn it on?! i never had to do that before! what the fuck did you do to my computer!? you ruined it! that thing's been running fine for 10 years and i never had to press a button! you screwed up the whole thing! i want my money back and a new computer!" i'm astounded at this point. i didn't know what to say. they had this computer installed by some guy years ago and never turned it off. they lacked such basic electronics knowledge that they had no idea what a power button was. i did my best to explain. "you see, this is the power button, you have to press it to turn it on." "but i've never done that before." "did you ever turn your computer off before?" "no!" "that's an issue in itself. normally folks shut down their computers when they're not using them." "why in the fuck would i do that?" "to make it last longer- hard discs are only good for about 10 years or so, and capacitors don't last forever." "but it never failed before why would i turn it off." "regardless, this is how a computer works. you turn it off, and press a button to turn it back on." "no it's not you broke it. fuck you give it back i'll see you in court. i've never had to press a button before this is un fucking believable." so... i'm going to court apparently. they called the police and reported me, got that call a minute ago. i'm not sure if i should laugh or cry. **edit**: tl;dr customer thinks i broke their computer because they have apparently never pushed a power button before. **edit #2**: yes i know how insane the idea of a computer being on for 10 years sounds. that's their story, not mine. u/bobnojio brought up the very valid point that the cmos could have been set to 'power on ac failure' to solve their issue. i'm starting the hypothesize that maybe it was already set that way, and i may have cleared the cmos, somehow, but i don't think so. my feeling is the woman is just a total bitch, and didn't want to admit she was wrong when faced with something so obvious as a power button, so she raged and followed through with her accusation. **edit #3**: february 25th 5:44 pm pst: her husband called today. he says i can avoid court by giving them a new computer and refunding their 95 bucks. i... lost my temper. **edit #4**: on monday, march 3rd, i received a call from a "lawyer" who represents ms. herpderp, who said they want to settle outside of court to "save us both some time and money." i told him i am not willing to refund any money, as the computer worked, and that i don't believe that he is a lawyer. i explained that the amount they would receive back is nothing compared to what it must cost to pay a lawyer to start a case. i probed him and have a suspicion they are the couple's son or something. he said, "well, we'll have to settle in court then." to which i replied, "in small claims court? i'm not sure you know how that works. bring it, bitch." the next day, i noticed a terrible review on yelp!, and i'm more upset about my five-star rating being in jeopardy than anything else. the whole ordeal is going nowhere fast, i'm starting to hope i get served soon so i can just get this all over with. **edit #5**: on thursday, march 13th, i got served. [imgur of proof of that.]( sonovabitch. son. ova. bitch. **edit #6**: i get a lot of messages regarding another update. court is on the 24t of april. no new news until then. **edit #7: "the final update"** i've just returned from court. i arrived there at 0730 for my 0800 appointment, after grabbing a quick taco bell breakfast. this was my first mistake. the judge didn't enter the courtroom until 0830, and by then i had already begun to realize the problem i had created for myself when the woman next to me commented on my belly rumbling. man, did i need to pass gas. but not here, not now, "not like this." the judge sits down, we rise, i cringe. the judge sent the first four or five cases out for mediation, as is the normal practice. now i'm waiting for an unknowable amount of time, but i knew what i had to do. i excused myself and wrecked the stairwell. with a certain amount of self-satisfaction i returned to court and fidgeted for the next hour waiting for my case, another problem brewing. finally we are sent out for mediation at 1030 we climb a few flights of stairs to the mediators office, and start the discussion. immediately the feller starts ranting about this and that, how i broke their computer, how we had a "verbal agreement that i would replace the computer," (we didn't.) and how their son was, "a+ certified in 1992," but with no point to follow that. they kept going for quite some time, i don't believe they know what a mediator is for, they were acting like he was the judge, throwing accusations. finally i couldn't take it anymore- the gas, not the unintelligent rants, i'm used to those. i interrupt with, "look, you're claiming $364.80 worth of damages, and i don't believe you deserve a single penny of that, your computer works, plain and simple." yelling and ranting is what i get back. at this point i begin to realize i'm arguing with apes, and decide to get out of there. the mediator is resting his face in his hands, he's tired of this too. myself, i could be making a couple grand this morning, or be here battling a combination of idiots and flatulence. i needed to call this a loss and get out of here, open my store. i make them an offer. "i'll give you a reconditioned laptop and we're even, can we agree to that?" oh wow really mister that'd sure be swell. it's funny how people change when they're starting to get what they want. "sure, a windows 8 laptop, why not. it's almost new." they accept, we write out the agreement, and i make sure to have a clause put in there. "plaintiff will verify functionality of the defendant's provided laptop on site, and once it leaves there will be no support for it." sweet, they signed it. they try to make small talk with me, "so that's your bike, nice day for a ride, etc etc." my mind screams insults while i smile and agree. so we go back to court, have the case dismissed, and i head back to the shop. i walk into the storage closet, take a glance at the three giant racks with around 200 laptops on them, grab the first one i see, a toshiba c855d-s5106 machine i bought for 20 bucks from a tweaker who probably stole it. i boot it up, it works, factory reset it (hellish on windows 8 if you don't have the password) and give them a call. i'm waiting for them to arrive now while i write this. in conclusion, i lost on this one, but i keep telling myself that i made the conscious choice to lose in order to reapply my efforts and make more money than i lost on that machine. the entire ordeal has really made me rethink my career in consumer product repairs. consumer electronic repairs has done little for me but turn me bitter and resentful towards the end-users of a technology i find rather beautiful. so, i'm looking to hire somebody who loves computers to work full time in my place, with options for room and board at the shop's apartment upstairs. i've been looking for -anybody- for a month now, and so far i'm realizing that mountain towns don't have much to offer in the way of computer techs who have any sort of background in repairs. myself, i plan to move on to create shitty ios and android games that generate 1000s in ad revenue daily to fund misadventures in hardware development. **tl;dr**- i felt flatulent so i rushed through things and gave them a windows 8 toshiba during mediation to stop the ranting and get back to work. total loss: $20 and 4 hours of my time. thank you for the gold, kind stranger!boss calls me. **bossman:** my computer is running really slow. check the broadband. **me:** err. ok broadband is fine, i'm in ftp at the moment and my files are transferring just fine. **bossman:** well my browser is running really slow. **me:** ok, though you could just go to speedtest.net and test it, takes less than a minute. **bossman:** you do it please, i'm too busy. **me:** ok, hang on... *2 mins later* **me:** speed is 48mb up and 45mb down. we're fine. **bossman:** browser is still slow....is there a setting that's making it slow **me thinks:** yeah, cos we always build applications with a 'slow down' setting... **me actually says:** no, unless your proxy settings are goosed. that could be the issue. **note the bossman is notorious for not shutting things down etc** **bossman:** what's a proxy....? why do we need one? is it expensive? **me:** first things first have you rebooted to see if that solves the problem? **bossman:** nope, i don't do rebooting... **me:** err...but it's the first step in resolving most it issues... **bossman:** i haven't rebooted or shut down in 5 days...why would it start causing issues now... **me:** face nestled neatly into palms.... edit: formatting and grammarwe have a location with a terrible infrastructure. all the desktops are xp on terrible wifi adapters to get them to the network. i got a call from a user that "your guy must not have set the printer up right." teamviewer wasn't working so we figured out how to make sure he was connected to the internet. a bit of struggle later and i'm actually in. i looked at the printer and it had a bunch of items stuck in queue. i found the ip address and went to the web interface. bam - giant error warning: put ltr in drawer 1. i told the user: "looks like it's out of paper." user: "it printed fine this morning!!" me: "which is why it's now out of paper..." user: "it's all the way upstairs!!" me: "you see this error on the screen right? put letter in drawer 1? i really think we need to start there before trying any more troubleshooting" user: "ugh - fine! i guess i'll call you back when that doesn't work" me: &lt;stays connected to the remote system to smugly watch the queue clear out a moment later&gt; so this happened during my apprenticeship as an it tech with a german it service-organization, taking care of small businesses and schools roughly 15 years ago. we had one special client (funny job, blasted old industry buildings and quarries) who had permanent issues with his online banking (remember, this was 15y ago, when hbci banking was still done with the rsa keys on 3,5″ disks). regular procedure in case something went wrong with the key disk was to call the issuing bank to send the customer a new disk. we did this game several times, including some test transfers on the customers computer: the tests went fine, but within a week the customer complained again about the "messy online banking". so after another reissued rsa disk i decided to stay a bit longer after the tests were done and suddenly i got an reveiling insight on the issue. as the label on the disk clearly stated: "keep in a safe place (in german)" the customer used a fridge magnet to safely store the disk on the side of the pc casing. after a short discourse on magnetic storages we were able to focus on "real" issues. edit: formatting edit2: as multiply requested tl;dr: **formatting**there was a lot of interest in this [part 2] ( ) and [part 1] ( ). thank-you for the gold and stuff. one of the questions asked struck me, and i thought i should answer it in a new thread. q: so what was my last day like? shortly before leaving i received a sizeable payout over a significant injury i had suffered a few years earlier. management found out about this and tried to guilt trip me with "you have a lot of money now and you don't need money from us". then the issue of not buying the bosses car surfaced again. i was criticised continuously for driving a "suzuki sierra" (samari or jimmy to the rest of the world) . the boss started to insist again that i should buy his small car as it was a much nicer vehicle. my refusal not to buy his car, with the reason "i like my car more" was taken very personally. we had agreed on two weeks’ notice. i did not want to drag it out and they didn't want to accumulate more debt to me. so i did my time and built up a last vital patch to the software. on the second last day, the patch was ready and all that was needed was to commit the code and do a final build. as i left that night, something odd happened. i was cornered by management and asked to give up my office key, i saw no reason not to, so i did. i asked why, they said they felt i would try and steal computers to recover unpaid wages. i basically said ffs. when the morning of my last day rocked round i was feeling jubilant. i was flush with insurance money, a great new job lined up and my life was set for a brand new course. as i prepared to leave home a call came. &gt;boss: "don't come in, we will do your last day another time". &gt;me: "ok" (stupid me) over the next two weeks a new date for the "last day" was set and re-postponed often. eventually a last day actually happened, i was instructed to turn up at 9:30, a half hour after opening. so i turned up to work as agreed. all the doors were dead locked. all staff were actually locked in the building. i knocked on the door and was escorted into the meeting room by my boss. some new faces were present, everyone was in suits, and the room was given an intimidating “you’re out-numbered feel”. a contract was placed in front of me. it basically stated that “i verified the software was 100% bug free, and i would fix any bugs found at any time in the future for free. i would to this immediately and without limit for time required to do so. this agreement would be binding without time limit.” i was told this was my exit contract and i had to sign it. i declined. instead, in this adverse environment, i re-negotiated a consultant fee for any further work and a minimum 10 days a year availability against future requirements. i signed the new contract. they signed it and then backdated it to when i first joined (wtaf). i was then escorted to my office. while i was away they had been busy. the room had been turned upside down and my filing cabinet emptied. my computer had been reformatted and all software re-installed fresh. my computer had also been disconnected from the network, and i was informed that all passwords had been changed so i could no longer log into anything. they informed me that when they rebuilt the machine, apparently one piece of software failed to re-install i was accused of doing “something” that prevented this and blamed. i could not assist them, the software key was on my company email account, no longer available to me. they suddenly nervous, and refused to let me access my e-mail account for the key. in a brief moment of privacy i discovered something from a friend. actually a massive network outage was in effect because a certain manager had taken it upon herself to "rearrange the stack of network routers" as a security precaution against me making an imminent cyber attack on the company. now a familiar consultant joined us. his job was to read the code i was going to commit and ensure it was not malicious and verify the final build of the software still functioned. the consultant felt very awkward about this, he knew i would do no such thing, but he wasn’t going to turn down work. the management was suspicious that the consultant trusted me. so they supervised the consultant. so there i sat for an hour as three people looked over every move i made. management questioning every second action, as i built the final release of the software. i then spent another hour in a random code audit. the consultant was to sift through the code looking for anything malicious. i was on hand to answer any questions he had. i was then promptly escorted out of the company. i never looked back. edit: i have finished the account [here] ( ). [previous]( _________________ christmas planning meeting number three. how many meetings can you have for a party? probably hundreds at the rate we’re going. as i waited for nice to arrive i was stuck in the room with head of security who had mysteriously decided to join the meetings. &gt;hsec: while we’re waiting… i wasn’t pleased at his presence, with him around coffee became scarce. &gt;hsec: last meeting, i asked nice to go with me to the chirstmas party. i sighed. it was one of those “girl” conversations. without coffee. &gt;hsec: remember? &gt;me: all i remember is the answer of “probably not”. i tried to hide the smile that was building, that was a pretty fun answer. &gt;hsec: what does "probably not" mean though? &gt;me: pffff…. hell if i know. &gt;hsec: maybe you could… ask her about it? &gt;me: why? this is not secondary school. just ask her yourself. &gt;hsec: nah i’m too embarrassed. it was at this point nice arrived at the meeting. perfect timing. &gt;hsec: oh hey nice! errr...... oh no. &gt;nice: whats wrong? &gt;hsec: i just remembered i gotta go do, something. don’t worry i left all the important questions and stuff with airz, you’ll remember to ask right airz? i looked down at the coffee-less desk. he made coffee go away. &gt;me: probably not. i smiled. it was a good smile. _______________ security guard left. he didn’t look happy, he looked livid. &gt;nice: sooooo, what do you think would work for drinks? &gt;me: wine, beer, coffee. usual stuff. &gt;nice: no, thats not themed. it needs to be special. i looked into her eyes, they where very distracting. very special. &gt;me: special… &gt;nice: it themed, what do you guys drink normally? &gt;me: normal drinks. &gt;nice: hahahaha no, i know there’s special it drinks out there. i thought over every drink i’d had. nice’s eye’s looked like coffee. delicious coffee. &gt;me: no, no… just coffee. &gt;nice: mountain dew! thats what its called. &gt;me: sorry, mountain dew? &gt;nice: thats an it drink. mountain dew, an it drink. and the base for our xmas punch. amazing. [next](another quick story from my time working at my university's main computer lab. an old lady came up to my desk and told me her "monitor was low on ink". i walked over and her monitors brightness was turned all the way down. i turned the brightness up and she said "oh, you young men are so smart." then she gave me some candy. she was nice.i just discovered this sub so i thought i would share. early one saturday morning (2am) my on-call cell rings. i answer the phone and a co-worker who works on the storage team tells me the data-center just went dark. i tell him just because a server loses connection to a network drive doesn't mean the server went down. since i was a windows admin at the time my team was responsible for all the server hardware, so i was the point of contact for emergencies that weekend. "no the datacenter went down" he replied irritated, but i still didn't believe him.... it's 2am in the morning and i'm not thinking clearly. when he finally says " i'm in the server room and all the power is off, every server is off." long story short i get dressed and make the long drive into corporate headquarters while calling other senior members on my team about the outage since this is a "all hands on desk moment." everyone arrives in sweats and we sit in the "war room" while senior managers explain something triggered the smoke detectors so power was immediately cut. we walked though the data center and there was nothing visibly showing a fire, no smoke, no scorch marks. the it director in his wisdom issued a decree. " we will station admins at the end of every server and router row with fire-extinguishers, and then turn on the power. we'll see where the smoke is coming from, and if a fire breaks out we can put it out." we all stared at the director and reminded him of the following. 1) we have liquid extinguishers. you want us to spray electrical equipment with liquid? 2) the datacenter systems will automatically lock the doors then start vacuuming out the oxygen. "so to be clear.. you want us to electrocute ourselves while simultaneously suffocating?" the it director was walked out (fired) 2 weeks later. **cause of smoke**... one of the four huge air-conditioning units began dripping oil. the oil hit an electrical outlet below the raised floor and the resulting sparks caused smoke... not a fire. this was finally discovered via security recordings of the datacenter that happened to catch the rising smoke. simply turned off the effect ac unit and fired everything back up slowly. was a long day..... and lots of pizza.[previous]( getting back to it i took a rest in my chair. i was tempted to put my feet on the desk, probably not professional i thought. opening up the ticket queue, i looked at the number of tickets pending. &gt;me: oh what the?! tickets had started piling up. looking out my office door, it staff seemed to be relaxing. unconcerned about the mounting tickets. relaxing over. &gt;me: what the hell is going on with the ticket queue? i shouted at it. they seemed surprised at my anger. itsec our newest it member found his voice first. &gt;itsec: oh, airz! welcome back. &gt;me: thanks, but what are you all doing? tickets are piling up and you’re all chatting. the other it staff gave each other a look. eventually itsec explained. &gt;itsec: when the vp was in charge, he made a new system, see tuesday last week the sales manager rang him up to complain about how long tickets were taking. so now we just do four ticket sweeps a day. everyone got a memo saying if you get your ticket in before 9.30am you’ll have a reply before 10am. 11.30 for a reply before 12. etc. see right now its only 9 o’clock, so there’s still half an hour before the first sweep. &gt;me: why the hell would you do it like that…? nervousness swept over the it department, murmurs of “it’s a good way” and “no complains so far” could be heard. however no one was openly talking. i glared at my staff for the laziness on display. i waited for a response. no one seemed keen to reply. &gt;me: so if someone wants a password change at 9:31, they get a reply at 12? that's… insane. &gt;colorblind: actually does seem to be a spike of traffic just after a cutoff. i think people like waiting… less work for everyone. he smiled at me. i couldn’t tell if he was happy about less work, or just happy to be submitting an answer. &gt;me: oh.. is that the goal? less work for everyone? silence. out of the corner of my eye i saw solitaire take his feet off his desk. [next]([previous]( tuesday midday why are people happy on tuesdays? it’s probably the second worst day of the week. ***** i’d been called up a users desk for a problem. unspecified problem. naturally. &gt;me: so, whats wrong? i looked down at the user in question, his face old and greyed. &gt;grey: are you the technology man? &gt;me: yes. i’d never been called the technology man before, it sounded like a super hero name. &gt;grey: oh good. you know what all the children like right? &gt;me: ….?! what a strange question. i didn’t know how to respond. my mouth went dry as my eyes searched for an it related problem on grey’s desk. &gt;grey: we’re getting school children to our department for a while. so… which background do you think is more children orientated? &gt;me: is this your it problem? i was pretty annoyed, grey however was flicking back and forth between pictures of nature and various cartoons, mostly cartoons from the 70’s(?). i attempted to give grey a withering glare, however he simply ignored my glances. eventually he relented. &gt;grey: i also wanted your opinion on this… grey bend down and pulled out a usb floppy disk drive. he proceeded to plug it in…. &gt;me: it seems to have died. &gt;grey: my thoughts mirror your own. i was slightly confused to his wording…. my brain took a second to recover. &gt;me: what … do you use floppies for anyway? &gt;grey: nothing is ever truly lost. not with me. grey walked over and opened up a nearby filing cabinet. it was filled with floppies. completely filled. &gt;me: i’m impressed with your commitment to data retention. however i must ask, why not just save to the server? it gets backed up every day. it has multiple redundancies. grey looked confused. &gt;grey: server?… like someone that gets you food, a waiter? oh darn it. i then spent the next half an hour explaining what a server is, and how it works. grey seemed very interested in the idea. &gt;grey: so you can guarantee that if i save it in the server it’ll be saved forever? &gt;me: yep. &gt;grey: is that a personal guarantee, young man? grey looked at me sternly. i started to question not that the server would back it up, but weather grey would save in the right place. &gt;me: … err… i asked to borrow the computer for a second, and checked online how much another usb floppy drive would cost. **€25.00** i realised it wasn’t worth giving out personal guarantees for only 25 euro. &gt;me: you know what… i’ll just go get you another floppy drive. &gt;grey: excellent. now… about these backgrounds…. nope. [next]([*previous tales from dishonest used car dealership*](/user/36055512/submitted/) this is it, folks, the last part of the last story from my days at dishonest used car dealership. it’s been a hell of a ride, and i want to thank each and every one of you from the bottom of my cold, black heart for coming along with me, laughing at my dumb jokes and commiserating about the dark times. when i started posting back in february, i thought it would just be a fun thing to write up a story or two while i was sitting on my tail waiting for a job interview, and never expected anything approaching the kind of response i have received. and here we are, at the beginning of october, 26 stories across 27 posts, more than 64,000 words later. it has been a profound honor to get to share these little snippets of my life with you all. but, rest assured, the ducd saga may be at an end, but after much cajoling, i’ve decided to drop at least a story or two from the places i worked after. i can’t promise quite as much drama, but we did get up to some nonsense. and thank you all so very much for all the kind words as i have shared these stories with you. i appreciate it more than you know. i do have one brief bit of business, if you will permit. after many extremely kind requests to put my stories from ducd into a more permanent form, i am actually getting off my lazy backside and doing something about it. i have gone and edited these stories into something a little more “book-like,” and as soon as i am happy with the manuscript, i will be self-publishing them in paperback and e-book formats. i’ll have more news about that very soon. anyway, i now present the conclusion of the dishonest used car dealership saga. *** in the fray at dishonest used car dealership surrounding the departure of the diplomat and the necessity of the owners filling in for our now-missing sales staff, the one critical thing we absolutely required to do business had not gotten paid: our insurance. i can get cars fixed without running water or electricity. god knows i can do it without garbage pickup, since we hadn’t seen a garbage truck in weeks. but insurance we had to have. we also now had a major cash-flow situation as well. with lady applebee’s having cost the company a good $10,000 on her car switcharoo, my former romantic prospect’s medical bills to pay (not to mention replacement shoes to buy), and a once-show-quality mercedes that we were going to have to buy out-of-pocket, we had a lot of money about to head out the door. we also had no sales staff other than rom and the amazon filling in and were short two technicians. felonious monk should have been out of police custody already, but he wasn’t. the police wouldn’t tell us much, but the rumor around the shop was that he had failed a drug test while in custody and we would not be seeing him for some time. as with all rumors, it was impossible to know whether it was true or not, especially considering felonious monk always seemed pretty skittish when drugs would be found in customers’ cars. at the same time, he was also impulsive and didn’t think very far ahead, so who knows? in any case, we were going to be very far into the red with no real way to make it up any time soon. that monday morning, rom and the amazon called an emergency all-hands meeting. we piled into the conference room, not really sure what to expect. it certainly wasn’t going to be anything pleasant, that’s for sure. we all sat down and the amazon broke the silence. &gt;ta: “good morning everyone. i think we all are well aware of the events that have transpired recently, and so i don’t think we need to rehash the unpleasantness of the last few weeks. but, as you are undoubtedly aware, whether by accident or malice or incompetence, the last few weeks have been extremely costly. however, what most of you are unaware of is that our insurance company has terminated our policy, which means the costs of these incidents will likely have to come out of our budget.” there was a murmur among the technicians and miami vice. &gt;ta: “we are currently in talks with our attorney as to whether something can be done about this situation, but in the meantime, we are going to have to tighten the belt considerably to survive.” lord salisbury spoke up. &gt;ls: “what, precisely, does that entail?” &gt;ta: “i’m glad you asked. colossal redneck, rom, and i have been discussing this situation over the weekend, and we all agree that sacrifices will have to be made in order to keep this ship afloat. most of these sacrifices will be minimal. to save some electricity, we’re going to unplug the refrigerator in the shop and we’re going to ask that the technicians refrain from using the welders, the tube bender, or anything that runs off the phase converter. we’re also going to take a brief hiatus from restocking things like office supplies - we’ll just have to use what we’ve got until we run out. we’re also going to clear out our used car inventory and not purchase any more cars at auction for a while. so, most of the changes are going to be minimal and shouldn’t significantly affect the course of business.” &gt;ls: “that all sounds very good, except… except there’s a word in there you keep using that makes me nervous.” &gt;ta: “and what’s that?” &gt;ls: ““most.” you keep saying *most* of the sacrifices will be minimal. it’s that “most” that’s bothering me.” &gt;ta: “yes, well, as i said, we are all going to have to make sacrifices if we want to stay afloat.” lord salisbury was beginning to look irritated. mr. sarcastic spoke up in his place. &gt;ms: “are you going to continue farting around and avoiding whatever it is you’re trying to say, or are you going to get to the point?” &gt;ta: “fine. in order to ensure the company’s solvency, commissioned employees are going to have their commissions suspended until this crisis is over. you will still receive your base pay. hourly employees - i guess that’s just miami vice - will receive minimum wage.” the technicians leaned back in their chairs and shook their heads. i was completely taken aback - the entire pay cut plan had certainly not crossed my desk - and in my surprise i spoke up. &gt;me: “you’ve got to be f#cking kidding me. *this* is the plan you came up with? that is not a small pay cut you’re talking about here - it would be one thing to have some furlough days or for us not to work overtime, but that’s half my paycheck, and it’s more like 75% of the techs’ pay you’re taking away. not one of us had a damn thing to do with everything that’s gone down in the last weeks, and it is ridiculous and entirely unfair to dock our pay to cover other peoples’ f#ck-ups.” &gt;ta: “well, you were driving the 240 when it burned that girl.” &gt;me: “yeah, and when you can articulate how her getting hurt was my doing, let me know.” &gt;ta: “36055512, i think you are failing to comprehend the magnitude of this situation.” &gt;me: “okay, then. if the cash flow issue is that big, tell me, are you pursuing a business loan to hold us over? or perhaps you could sell or mortgage or rent out one of the three houses you two own. or perhaps rom could sell that tacky gold rolex on his wrist. or maybe you could flip some of our inventory at cost just to get some cash in hand. there are a thousand ways to solve this problem, but what you’ve done is push the responsibility and the pain onto everyone but yourselves.” &gt;ta: “now that is completely unfair! all of us are having to make sacrifices.” &gt;me: “really? so what kind of pay cut will the two of you be taking?” &gt;ta: “i can assure you, rom and i will be taking significant pay cuts as well.” &gt;me: “yeah. i’m sure you will.” lord salisbury chimed in once again. &gt;ls: “well, i’ve heard about enough of this, what about you, mr. sarcastic?” &gt;ms: “yeah, i’m with you. this is bullsh!t.” lord salisbury reached into his pocket and fished out his keychain. he unthreaded the shop key from the ring and thunked it on the table. mr. sarcastic followed suit. lord salisbury turned to colossal redneck. &gt;ls: “post me my check.” colossal redneck stood from the table. &gt;cr: “now, wait jes’ a minute, fellas…” lord salisbury stood from the table and faced down colossal redneck. &gt;ls: “post me my check.” rom, seeing this, jumped from the table and blocked the door with his body. &gt;rom: “none of you are going anywhere.” lord salisbury whipped around to face him. &gt;ls: “move. now.” rom braced his hands against the door frame. &gt;rom: “no one is leaving without my approval.” in all the time i had worked with lord salisbury, i had never once seen him angry, never once heard him raise his voice. he was the textbook definition of the charming english gentleman. all of the sudden the lord salisbury i knew vanished from the room, replaced by some sort of lesser demon. absolute fury washed over his face and his body tensed. in a flash, he reached out with his hand and grabbed rom by the neck and squeezed. rom’s eyes betrayed his terror and he tried to scream, but lord salisbury’s hand crushed in around his neck. rom released his grip on the door frame and lord salisbury tossed him aside into a heap on the floor. the amazon shot up from the table, but lord salisbury stopped her cold with a glare. his voice dropped into a deep, hissing snarl. &gt;ls: “sit. the f#ck. *down!*” she immediately retreated to her chair and lord salisbury stared her down for a moment. he turned and disappeared out toward the shop, mr. sarcastic in tow. the room was in stunned silence. rom gradually crawled back onto his feet and we sat for a moment. i finally threw my hands up in disgust at the whole thing and went back to my office. *** it was two hours later, and i was in my office polishing off a letter of resignation. i had already packed my things into a box, taken down the paintings off the wall, and deleted anything good off my computer. i heard a knock on the door and miami vice slipped into my office. &gt;mv: “look, uh… i don’t know how to say this…” &gt;me: “i think i know what you’ve got on your mind, but shoot.” &gt;mv: “well, i’ve been thinking about it, and… it’s the pay thing… i can’t live on minimum wage.” &gt;me: “i understand. do you have something else lined up?” &gt;mv: “i just called a friend of mine, he works at a bar up at the top of the lake. i guess they’re looking for someone to help in the kitchen.” i stood up and reached out a hand. &gt;me: “you’ve been a terrific employee. i’m sorry it came to this. let me know if there’s ever anything i can do for you.” he shook my hand. &gt;mv: “it’s been wild, it really has.” i walked with him out through the bay and he disappeared beyond the sandwich shop toward the bus stop. a minute later, two flatbed tow trucks rolled into the parking lot and idled up next to the shop’s bay door. mr. sarcastic and lord salisbury slowly rolled their enormous tool chests out toward the trucks. the tow truck drivers grabbed their winch cables and pulled the tool chests onto the trucks. the drivers strapped down their loads and the trucks pulled out of the parking lot toward their respective destinations. i ran into the shop, grabbed three beers, and intercepted the technicians. we cracked our beers and shared a toast. &gt;me: “gentlemen, it’s been an honor working with you. i just want you to know, if you ever need a reference, if you ever need someone to vouch for your skills, you have my number.” we chugged our beers and threw the cans into the back of colossal redneck’s pickup, and the two of them got in their cars and drove out of the parking lot for the last time. i went back inside and printed my letter of resignation. i folded it in thirds and walked over to colossal redneck’s office. &gt;cr: “this here has been quite a day, hasn’t it?” &gt;me: “it has. this is for you.” i handed him the letter. he read it over. &gt;cr: “you too, huh?” i nodded. &gt;cr: “i would’a thought of everyone on the staff, you would’a been the loyal one.” &gt;me: “well, i have a sneaking suspicion that i’m never going to see a paycheck from here again, so…” &gt;cr: “what if i went an’ got you yer paycheck right now, whatever’s outstanding, would that up an’ change yer mind any?” &gt;me: “i gotta be honest, you and i know that it’s just going to bounce. plus, i ain’t gonna try and live off just my base pay from here on out.” &gt;cr: “you and me, we kin sort out yer pay rate. as fer now, i’ll betcha there’s enough money in one’a the accounts ta cover what yer owed. gimme a minute.” colossal redneck disappeared down the street to the bank and came back a few minutes later with an envelope full of cash. he handed it to me. &gt;cr: “that ought’a cover ya up to friday. how’s that sound?” i fanned out the cash on the table and counted it. it was all there, more or less. colossal redneck handed me back my letter of resignation. &gt;cr: “i don’t suppose i’ll be needin’ this, then.” i flicked it back on his desk. &gt;me: “no, i’m afraid you still do.” &gt;cr: “what? c’mon, man, ya’ can’t quit, ya’ got yer money!” &gt;me: “look around you, man. we’ve got no technicians. we’ve got no sales people. it’s just you and me. now, i don’t know what things look like from your vantage point, but this sure looks like a sinking ship from where i’m standing. you and i are clinging onto the top of the f#cking mast and you’re trying to tell me that because our feet aren't wet yet, that there’s nothing to worry about. well, i’m sorry, but that’s bullsh!t. there was a time when i worked here because i thought we were doing something special, that we were selling really cool cars that were going to help save the environment, that this was an up-and-coming business where i could build a career, but those days are so far behind me they’re on the other side of the horizon. if i can’t even rely on my paychecks coming in, then i’m not real sure what point there is to being here. how much more money is there to just up and hand out come payday? enough for a month? two weeks?” &gt;cr: “sometimes we all gotta make some sacrifices, though. i mean, y’all haven’t been the easiest employee, and it seems like ya ought’a show some loyalty, ya know?” &gt;me: “if you think you’ve got to do the “honorable thing” and ride this ship all the way to the bottom, you go and do that, but i’m not about to sacrifice even one second of my life on some made-up principle for two people who don’t have the slightest inkling of what the words “honor” or “loyalty” mean. every f#cking day here has been a fight, you and i have never received the slightest bit of respect, and i’ll be damned if i’m going to sit here and have you try and tell me that i owe you or them or this f#cking company a god-damned thing.” colossal redneck looked down at my letter of resignation. he paused, and then stood from his desk. &gt;cr: “alright.” he held out his hand. &gt;cr: “it’s been terrible havin’ y’all as an employee.” i shook his hand. &gt;me: “you’ve been a horrible boss.” he saluted me and i grabbed my box of things and walked out the big bay door for the last time. *** epilogue: it was a month after i left ducd, a drizzly cold friday afternoon, and i was loading the last of my possessions into a big box truck. on a lark, i had applied at a job in a city about three hours away, and strangely enough, they had offered me a position. the pay wasn’t quite as good, but it was a chance for something new, somewhere new, where i could clear my head and just start over. i had given notice to my landlord that i was leaving, given away the things i didn’t need, said goodbye to the few friends i had left, and sold the jeep. as a final “f#ck you” to the dealership, i had also dropped a dime to the county about the illegal dumping going on behind the shop. the pile had gotten bad enough that we had started calling it “the trasherhorn,” and between that and the dozens of gallons of old coolant and used motor oil the technicians had dumped on the ground back there, the county had told me that they were *very* interested in conducting an investigation. on the way out of town i made one last swing past the dealership just to see what had become of the place. i pulled off to the far side of the road and idled for a moment. the lot was very empty. rom and the amazon’s car was there, but no others i recognized, not even colossal redneck’s. they had little inventory on display and even fewer cars that appeared to belong to customers. the service bay was shut tight and the lights were off inside the service office. as i idled, rom and the amazon appeared from the sales office, shouting at each other. the amazon got in rom’s face and screamed something, then turned and marched back inside. rom stood for a moment and then started kicking a honda over and over again until there was a big dent in the back door. he stopped and stood there alone, shoulders drooped in the rain. i put the box truck into gear and pulled away. i turned onto the highway, pointing the truck toward the edge of town. i switched on the radio and turned it to max, slid the transmission into overdrive, and put the pedal to the floor. i drove south, far beyond the horizon, away from it all. many months later i came back north with a girl i was dating to show her the city that had defined so much of my adulthood, a city that has so indelibly dyed the very fabric of who i am that all these many years later i still dream of warm summer nights, windows down, driving on the bridge across the lake; that the smell of food still transports me back to the little ramen bar just south of downtown, the one i never knew the name of because the sign was in japanese, windows fogged from the warm soup and the cold rain. and to this day when i drive through the big city to the north i choke up and my voice catches, because when i came the city broke me and molded me and made me new, and when i left i left so much of me there. most of me still stands there on the pale sands on the shore, feeling the wind just this side of cold, looking out across the water to the islands beyond and watching the boats come in for the night as the sky turns orange, then red, then blue, then black, standing there waiting for the rest of me to come home. i turned off the highway in the big dodge i now drove and pulled into the dealership’s parking lot. it was empty save for an abandoned oldsmobile decaying silently in a corner. the windows to the offices were hastily boarded up and graffiti covered the bay doors. the sign for the dealership was dingy from the rain and moss was beginning to grow over the letters. i drove around back and we hopped out of the truck. the empty lot behind the service bay had been mostly cleaned up. the girl looked around and turned to me. &gt;”what is this place?” &gt;”it was a car dealership. i used to work here.” &gt;”it looks awful.” i gave the place one last look as i climbed back into the truck. &gt;”it was. it really was.”it is the year 2013. we have refurbished our boardroom and installed a lot of new gear, including 2 60" screens (the largest we could fit in the space), a hub of sorts in the table that handles (almost) every type of connection one may need, and a spiffing switching system that allows us to display any source on either screen via a nice touch-screen remote control. this remote control is quite intuitive; the home screen has buttons for the left screen and the right screen, and pressing one or the other brings up the sources you can display. as part of the project i had to write an instruction manual for the new kit. i set this out in a task-based format, eg. "preparing for a presentation using the boardroom laptop". this took the better part of 4 months to get right (and it had to be right, given senior management would be referring to it when setting up the room) ...or so we hoped. in the nearly three years since, i have received many, many urgent summonses to the boardroom because $someone has a meeting in there in 5 minutes and they want to share their (or someone else's) laptop display on a screen. no-one ever opened the instruction manual, to my knowledge. cut to today. i am eyeing my ticket queue with some suspicion when $exec darkens my doorway. he informs me that he will be conducting a demo of $system to a whole bunch of people in the boardroom, and will need his (ultrabook) laptop to display $system on the screen. $system is network-only and quite chatty, and these ultrabooks don't have built-in network or vga ports, so i hand him a usb-to-ethernet adapter and tell him where the boardroom's mini-displayport-to-vga adapter is kept. he leaves my office saying that he'll come up again when his laptop is in the room, so that i can set up the equipment. about 45 minutes later i realise that his meeting will start shortly, so i saunter down to the room. a screen is on, there is a laptop screen on it and it matches what's on $exec's laptop screen. &gt;$exec: "hey, yeah i'm all good. i read the instructions!" &gt;me: "y... wha... which instructions? those ones there?" *points to the instruction manual* &gt;$exec: "yeah. worked well!" never before have i had to physically restrain myself from throwing my arms around another man. tl;dr: some users actually rtfm.i'm on my way into the office yesterday. at 8:02, my phone rings. it's $userb: &gt;**$userb:** "hey $sparkstalker - we've got an issue over here at $office. $usera's signature pad isn't working. do you have a new one to replace it?" ***$me:*** *"ok, so this is the one she emailed me about on friday night - the email i replied to telling her i would call her as soon as i could on monday morning, right?"* &gt;**$userb:** "yeah. so how soon before you can bring a new one over?" ***$me:*** *"well, i'm actually still on the way in, (hence why i haven't called yet) but let's try some troubleshooting before we start swapping out hardware. i can walk you through a few steps before i get there. first things first - was anything changed or done on friday before this happened?"* &gt;**$userb:** "nope, nothing at all. it just stopped working friday." ***$me:*** *"ok, so what's it doing?"* &gt;**$userb:** "well, it lights up, and you see the signature on the pad, but nothing shows up on the pc." ***$me:*** *"ok, try moving to a different usb port."* &gt;**$userb:** "we did. we put it in another one in the docking station *and also in the laptop*. it still didn't work." ***$me:*** &lt;sigh&gt;&lt;/sigh&gt; *"alright, try switching it with yours. i'm almost at my office, so i'll walk across the parking lot to yours once i drop my stuff off. give me about 20 minutes."* naturally, it's about 25°f, and it's a half mile walk across the completely full parking lots. nonetheless, i hike over, while dodging the maniacs that seem to think a hospital parking lot is their personal indianapolis. once inside, i start talking to $usera. we run down all the normal things: * did anything change (of course not!). * did you restart the machine (of course!) * did you swap out the pad like i asked (of course!). * well, did the swapped out pad work on $userb's pc (i don't know, why would we try that? his doesn't have the problem, mine does!). &lt;sigh&gt;&lt;/sigh&gt;. i should mention, that at this point, $usera lets slip that $userc (a.k.a the third stooge) downloaded and renistalled the software - so much for "nothing had changed". alright, let's check the setup. sure enough, the wrong stile pad is selected. i change it, but still no luck. not knowing what version $userc downloaded and installed, i set about removing and reinstalling with the correct settings. all with no success. so the process of elimination begins again. first things first - move the usb plug to the laptop directly instead of the docking station. &gt;"oh, we already tried that, it didn't work!" exclaims $usera. funny, because now the signature pad works flawlessly. i’m guessing, if they did test it, they only did it after $userc decided to fuck around. and remember i asked them to switch the pad? yeah, somehow, in their panicked state, i'm sure they remembered to zip-tie the new pad down nice and neat. i'm sure they did - why would they lie? but at least, we're getting somewhere. i move the usb to another one on the docking station. &gt;**$usera:** "why are you doing that? just leave it in the other one since it works!" ***$me:*** *"well, we want to isolate the actual issue. i need to know if the one usb is faulty, or if it's the whole docking station."* &gt;**$usera:** "well, it seems like a waste of time since we know it works now." as i ignore her and continue testing, i see that her scanner is plugged in to the docking station also. naturally, i inquire about its functionality. &gt;**$usera:** "oh, it's working fine. the problem is with the signature pad! the scanner's perfect!" uh huh, sure it does as the signature pad fails in another usb on the docking station. so for giggles, i try the scanner. it's a no go, of course. &gt;**$usera:** "funny, it worked fine on friday." amazing, just like the signature pad. so now, i start to dig deeper for the root cause. everything else on the docking station is functional - ethernet, video, etc. just the usbs. i scour my memory banks - power. i've seen before where a docking station will drop usb performance if there isn't enough power. i look at the power brick. it's the correct one for the docking station - it should be providing enough juice....unless...i trace the cord back to the power strip. and it looks a bit weird. weird, because there's a heavy duty extension cord plugged into it, that runs behind a cabinet. i follow it around the wall. and there, on the end of this heavy ass extension cord, is a refrigerator.&lt;facepalm&gt;...&lt;/facepalm&gt;. ***$me:*** *"so has this been here long?"* &gt;**$usera:** "oh no, we just added it on friday." i wait, probably too long, for $usera to connect the dots. apparently that's still beyond the capacity of her brain functionality. so i finally explain to all three stooges that a refrigerator draws quite a lot of current, and that by plugging it in to the power strip, not only were they depriving the docking station of the power they needed, but were also creating a major fire hazard. the dull, glassy look in their eyes told me that i would be better off explaining it to the furniture. i told them they needed to move the fridge and check with facilities before they plug it in to see if their area even would support a small appliance, and begin the game of frogger back over to the safety and warmth behind my office door. **tl;dr:** it's like a screwdriver. just because it fits, doesn't mean you should stick it in there.backdrop: i am the entirety of it at a resort. recently i walked in to my boss's office (she is part of accounting), and had this brief conversation. &gt;me: so i heard $employee is no longer with us &gt; &gt;boss: that is correct. &gt; &gt;me: and she's been gone a few weeks now? &gt; &gt;boss: also correct. &gt; &gt;me: so, do you want me to, i don't know, disable her network access? also you might want me to disable her email access, since she has that set up on her personal phone and all. &gt; &gt;boss: ... yes please she is supposedly going to review the termination procedure with hr. i am waiting with ~~baited~~ **bated** breath... edit: ty /u/redlotusaustin for the correctioni am not the hero of this story. that honour goes to /u/haakon666, my partner in crime and *more crime*. have you ever been on call, and had a fault come in, and thought, 'oh god i really cannot deal with this right now'? i've been that guy. today i'm that guy. i'd recently said 'fuck you' to working for other people and started my own business. /u/haakon666 and i had been idly discussing ventures we might like to undertake for about 6 years when it happened. i went out on my own at first, and when we were making enough money, he quit his job also and we went to work. but before that happened, he helped out on nights and weekends, wherever he could. it was tough going for both of us at first, but it was worth it. when i started out, i contacted all the companies i'd done contract work for in the past and offered them support contracts. one in particular, who i'll call server tech, did web hosting, server rental and colocation. they'd been keen to support my venture but declined to move forward, saying they'd call when they needed something, and deal with the cost later. we both knew they would when an emergency came, such was the manner of our existing arrangement. we just didn't know how big. so when i found a missed call from server tech on a saturday morning, and i was 100km away setting up my tent at a camp site, ready for a weekend off, i called /u/haakon666 and asked him if he could call them to see what they wanted. i then promptly went back to my tent/beer and proceeded to have a lovely weekend in the mountains. on sunday evening when i got back, i thought i'd ping him to see what they wanted and how it went. i could've guessed any number of reasons they'd call, hell i could have sat there guessing for a whole week and not gotten it. server tech's building had been bought by a 3rd party, who had agreed verbally to let them renew their lease. the actual lease agreement, however, had not been signed. so when the day of the lease end rolled around, no-one expected anything to change. they certainly didn't expect the new owner to cut all power and fibre to the building. unbeknownst to server tech, the new owner was planning on using his new acquisition to start a competing business, using not only their floor but the entire building. and in one fell swoop, he'd managed to knock their business entirely off the air. now, we've had some pretty tough jobs in our time, but this one .. this takes the cake. while i was off soaking up the forest air, /u/haakon666 and the customer had: - located a suitable building for the new datacentre site - agreed to lease it - connected a wireless microwave link from a nearby highrise to the new building - rented the largest generator i've ever seen, and more portable airconditioners than an airconditioning convention - organised cablers to cable up the new site - organised electricians to power up the new site - moved every single server, network device and rack - reconfigured them and finally got everyone back online. it was the end of sunday and they'd just finished working, but they were online. the customer base wasn't happy, but the story was so catastrophic that some of them just straight up didn't believe them, turning up to the old site to complain to find it empty. the generator powered the site for over a month, being refuelled every day, until enough high-voltage power cabling could be run from the grid into the building to power up the upss and finally have a completed site. i was stunned. server tech had managed to run up a bill close to $6000 of after-hours support time in one weekend, but their business was alive and kicking, so they paid it happily. i've never been so glad to miss a phone call in all my life, and to this day i look back at /u/haakon666's dedication for inspiration, because that motherfucker *went back to his day job the next day*. if i'm tech support macguver, then he's the terminator. -- *usual plug for /r/chhopsky for other non-tfts good times. fortunately, nothing like this. nothing like this ever again please* compulsory thanks for the gold! edit!i was recently hired by my university as a tech support drone. answer phones, trudge up the hill from the it department to the academic buildings to plug things in, that sort of thing. since it's a university, i have to deal with tenured professors. the worst kind, really. last week i got a call around 2pm: me: "hello, it, have you tried asking one of your students to turn it off and on again?" prof.: "yeah, hi, i'm having some issues with the ribbon, could you come take a look at my machine?" helpdesk policy: if a professor asks you to come look, you go do it. i'm actually glad about that one, it usually saves me from trying to interpret what's going on. i assumed, blindly, that the professor meant the microsoft office ribbon. we upgraded to office 2010 at the beginning of last semester, and some people don't adjust well to change. we all know what happens when we assume, right? yep. turns out "ribbon" meant "typewriter ribbon." professor selectric was having trouble replacing the ribbon and type ball. lucky for him, typewriters are a hobby of mine, and i had the selectric humming away in a matter of minutes. tl;dr please send helpdesk tickets to our telex at wui 118999 and we'll fix your dictaphone within 24 hours i got a call earlier from a woman whom i've personally witness her print out documents to scan them. she asks me, "do you know where last year's payroll reports are? they aren't in the usual place on the network drive" i reply with "no". since i am just a consultant and wouldn't access payroll reports. she tells me, "i have to find the reports. the shredding company is due here shortly and i have to shred them" stunned, i ask her, "wait? you're printing out the reports just so you can shred them???" "yes" i reply with, "well if you can't find them, i'm sure who ever wants to print them can't find them either. so you don't have to shred them" "that's true!" i am seriously contemplating telling the owner of the company as she's in charge of bank accounts/payroll and has other fiduciary duties. she clearly doesn't get how paper and electronic data intersect. the heat of the summer had started to burn into the roof of the building, forcing its occupants to move from hidden heaters under the desks to hidden fans. the air conditioner which and been idling on heat, had been swung over to cool, its increased rumbling a soundtrack to summer. with all these changes around the office, managers also got in on the act. updated policy documents spun round the office. &gt;leadone: milestones are essential to any project! leadone stood in my office with her hands on her hips. she looked disapprovingly down at my vacant stare. my mind was too busy to care about her trivial projects, i was dreaming of the beach. perhaps a holiday? &gt;me: yes. it slowly dawned on me that i’ve no idea what leadone was in my office for. it just seemed right to agree with the angry woman. i tried piecing the conversation together in my head, but it was still filled with sand. &gt;leadone: so you agree? &gt;me: milestones are essential...? &gt;leadone: you’ll update me. how often? hourly? &gt;me: err... i thought to all the things it could do hourly. nothing came to mind. i had come too far into the conversation to admit i’d no idea what we were discussing. i was in too deep. &gt;leadone: okay! i’ll get back upstairs and you make sure you update me hourly. we need to stay on top of this. &gt;me: yes. hourly. on top. blessedly the conversation ended. as soon has she’d left the department i started searching for leadone’s most recent policy changes, hoping for a clue as to what i was doing. i found one. recently leadone had been promoted to lead of development, she was forcing through a number of measures to increase workplace efficiency. “making her mark” with management. she’d announced a new tracking scheme aimed at larger projects to keep them on track. to get the tracker up and running, she wanted it to purchase a host of project management programs. i checked the prices and sent a quick conformation email to leadone. which she prompt replied affirmative too. i frowned as i thought of the poor souls i was condemning by making this purchase. the screams of frustration and micromanagement haunted me as i made the relevant orders. **** a few hours later, i’d forgotten the horrors leadone was soon to inflict upon the development department. in fact i was relaxing in my office with a fresh brew, a flights website clearly open. **airz!!!!** came the angry voice from my door. leadone was standing with the air of a disproving mother. she sauntered into the room with an angry tone. &gt;leadone: it’s been three hours! &gt;me: oh. the update, yes. everything has been ordered. my words stuttered out, as the overbearing figure of leadone surged forward with the look of teacher catching a naughty student. &gt;leadone: hourly. i said hourly updates. &gt;me: okay ... well we’ve ordered the software. when the payment has been processed they’ll ship it too us. so i’ll let you know when it arrives. &gt;leadone: no. i. want. hourly. updates. as. agreed. leadone paced her words out, like jabs. she had eyes that looked crazy, you couldn’t argue with insanity. my mouth opened to retort but i could feel my coffee getting colder. i wanted her out. &gt;me: i’ll update you hourly, at the bare minimum. leadone seemed to smile, her eyes fell back from the insanity and she looked normal again. &gt;leadone: good, i’ll eagerly await your updates. she walked off with a hum, probably to find other people to harass into insanity. i popped open a new search tab and looked for an appropriate service. the dreams of beach holiday fleeing my mind. **** two hours later and i’d perfected the design of an “email cannon”. i’d set a program to send a random vague message of “still waiting for the package” or “the software is in transit” every 20 minutes. it had taken time to write a **huge** list of valid short phrases to choose from. the flight tab i’d left open had completely timed out. **** the next day, as the software had still not arrived. i set the email cannon to send a vague message every 10 minutes. just to be sure. **** the third day the software had was **still** in transit. to make up for this i set the cannon to go off every 5 minutes. i didn’t want leadone to not be in the loop. **** the software didn’t arrive for an entire fortnight. when it did arrive, oddly leadone never came to consult about the next step, even after repeated emails. leadone’s project was canceled eventually. i chalked it up to lack of proper management. if only our company had some sort of tracker to check up on these things....about 3 weeks after starting a casual role at my current job at a it help desk, i got a call from one of our customers who immediately demanded 2 new phones as their ones weren't working. i was still in training while this happened. my job at the desk was to help troubleshoot and determine the problem/cause and if it is equipment fault then i send for replacements etc. the call went like this: me: (company name) it helpdesk, how can i help? customer: hi i want two new phones thanks. me: sorry which site is this for? customer: (site), i need two new phones. my phones aren't working so i need two new phones to arrive by tomorrow thanks. me: sorry i'm just going to need you to do some troubleshooting with me is that alright? customer: look, i need two new phones. my ones are not working and we usually just call you guys to get these replaced so i'd like two new phones here by tomorrow morning thanks. me: sorry sir, when you say not working what do you mean? customer: it's not bloody working. i can't hear anything. i need two new phones sent out to me. we get it through you guys so i'd like you to send me two new phones. me: so you can't hear the dial tone? customer: no because it's broken. both of them are broken and i need new ones. at this point my mentor tells me to transfer the customer over to her and i tell the customer i'm escalating to my mentor. my mentor picks up and i hear the customer start to rattle off about the broken phones. my mentor cuts in and says "hi (customer name), your site currently has no phone or internet connection because the isp is working on the lines near your site. your site called about 30 minutes ago to inform us that there is was an outage and we've followed up with the isp and will update you when we get updates from the isp." he was the one who called us regarding the outage. **tl;dr:** i'm supposed to fix bugs, not change diapers. fridays at derpco are strange beasts. they are either the calmest, or the busiest and craziest day of the week. never anything in-between. **\*ring!!*** &gt; me: "hey man, what's up?" &gt; accounting: "hi, can you teach alice how to do an invoice?" &gt; me: "the answer is no. what for, anyway?" &gt; accounting: "well, bob is out of the office and alice doesn't know how do an invoice." &gt; me: "so, alice, who has been in accounting for upwards of a year, has never been taught how to do an invoice?" &gt; accounting: "that's correct." &gt; me: "and bob, whom i know has a very precise invoicing procedure, involving many different subtleties for all sorts of wacky customers, has not taught alice about this procedure as a back-up measure?" &gt; accounting: "that's right." &gt; me: "and we know that bob will raise the fires of hell if he finds out that somebody did an invoice without following the procedure." &gt; accounting: "well, yes..." &gt; me: "and your first thought was to ask it, which is entirely far removed from all concepts of accounting, to teach someone how to make an invoice." &gt; accounting: "kind of..." &gt; me: "is bob on vacation?" &gt; accounting: "no." &gt; me: "when's he back?" &gt; accounting: "monday." &gt; me: "thank you, i have all the information i need. the answer is *hell* no." **\*click***[previous]( first thing monday morning i found myself underneath the desk of an employee. &gt;me: you’ve a lot of stuff plugged in under here. my face was inches away from three power strips all daisy chained together. every port was filled with various chargers, printers and screens. i wriggled myself out from under the desk and quickly snatched up my monday morning coffee. the employee looked expectantly at me, he wasn’t happy. i looked around the office, and saw the grumpy employee’s manager. he was struggling carrying a few boxes, it wasn’t the right time to call him over. yet. &gt;mondaygrump: so…. mr. expert. why? why is my computer occasionally shutting off? &gt;me: you’re overloading the power strips. probably drawing too much power through the first one, tripping it. i looked around his desk at the various chargers and devices. none seemed particularly power hungry… &gt;mondaygrump: you say that with such certainly. like i said before however i can’t be overloading them i’ve calculated. mondaygrump pushed a piece of paper towards me. it was filled with various numbers with addition and subtractions. i opened my mouth to explain for the fourth time that perhaps plugging the computer directly into the wall and seeing if that would work is perhaps a good idea. the words however would not come out, i had tried too many times already. i looked around for the manager. i caught sight of him in the break room making coffee. it would be too mean to call him over mid coffee… i thought as i sipped my own brew. &gt;me: i can see you’ve put a lot of effort into your sums… i caught sight of one of the numbers. i stopped talking instantly. &gt;estimated power draw for coworker - 400w. &gt;mondaygrump: well if you can’t even argue with the numbers like a professional… &gt;me: wait! whats *this* estimation? mondaygrump pointed me to the first power strip. first plug. i followed that plug. it went to **another** power strip. &gt;me: oh, come on! &gt;mondaygrump: whats wrong? i looked at the pyramid of daisy chained power strips underneath his coworkers desk. &gt;me: she’s drawing well over 400 watts. &gt;mondaygrump: is she? his face was gleeful. i was taken aback at how happy he seemed. he dove underneath the table with me and started chasing wires and counting wattages. &gt;me: err…. i stood up from underneath the desk. i decided to wait this one out. eventually mondaygrump crawled out from underneath the desk. he looked at me with a smile. &gt;mondaygrump: nope. nice try though. combined we’re still under… &gt;me: can’t we just try plugging the computer straight into the wall? mondaygrump shook his head. &gt;mondaygrump: we need to solve this mystery. where is your sense of duty? i looked up for his manager, this time i caught sight of him, he was oddly mid embrace with another employee. i decided not to call him over mid hug. &gt;me: its monday morning. i tried to stifle a yawn, by drinking some coffee. at that time mondaygrump’s co worker turned up. she was wearing a very long dress. she sat down at her desk and turned on her computer. &gt;longdress: hey, what cha all doing? &gt;mondaygrump: nothing, just power stuff. you know… men talk… mondaygrump was smiling at longdress who was contently smiling back. i got a sexist vibe, that i didn’t care for… &gt;longdress: well don’t mind me. longdress proceeded to duck underneath the desk for a second. then popped back up. &gt;mondaygrump: so… what’s wrong with it… &gt;me: you’re overloading the power…. longdress looked up from her desk. &gt;longdress: oh no. he can’t be… i’ve checked that… she rummaged around in her desk for a moment and pulled out a piece of paper. it had a bunch of numbers with plus signs etc. &gt;me: you two are … longdress reached down between her legs and suddenly the computers all turned off. &gt;grumpymonday: see! they’re always turning off just like this! &gt;me: wait… what did you just do? i stared at longdress. &gt;longdress: turned up the heater a tad… &gt;grumpymonday: heater!? since when did you have a heater? i smiled and wrote **heater +1000w** at the bottom of the page. job done. &gt;longdress: i hide it under my dress, so i can get warm air. you’re always making a fuss about peak power usage. i just want to be warm... &gt;grumpymonday: those things are huge loads, they’re ineffic…. &gt;me: sorry to interrupt. but i’m gonna go… as i turned around the manager of the department was standing behind me. &gt;manager: everything fixed? i looked at the two people fighting behind me. &gt;me: yep… kinda. mostly. &gt;manager: twenty years of marriage will do that to you…. they should probably hug it out, that's what i did whenever i had an office argument with my wife. oh, they’re married. right! &gt;manager: almost a shame we don’t work together anymore. office hugs are fun! the manager looked happy, however i was too busy trying to work out who he was hugging before…. &gt;me: im just gonna… go… i drunk my coffee as i left the department and tried to remove the bad taste that place left in my mouth. [next](i keep telling myself i have to post more of my stories, but i've had a lousy day, so i'm going to cheer myself up by posting an old problem. this is from about 8 years ago, and as for the background, i had been doing tech support for end users with printers for about a year or so. customer calls up, gives me his details, and i start generating a case. i got a bad feeling about this a few minutes in, where he cuts me off while i'm talking to tell me "you have to speak up, i'm at a train station." great. so he's nowhere near the machine if we need to check anything. plus, i can't compete with the noise of a train, so while i do speak up, i'm not shouting like he would like. i get round to what the problem is: "i bought printer x a few weeks ago to print out notes for my university course. i'm studying law. it says on the box the toner in it lasts for 1,000 pages (as a rough memory, i can't recall the numbers exactly). i've done about 250 pages of printing, because i need notes. i'm studying law, so they are quite important. anyway, the machine tells me the toner has run out. but i've only done half a ream of paper, so i know it's can't be true." this is not a shocking question, as people have got this before, but 4 times the speed of it being used is surprising, seeing its a cheap desktop black and white machine that will often not get much use. i start to ask questions regarding the usage: that expected toner life is based on constant printing, and more importantly, only covering 5% of a page. i remember a flat mates law notes and ask how much he is printing on the page: "they're law notes. i'm studying law, so i have a lot of notes to review. i've got reasonable eyesight, so to save carting around heaps of paper, i cram it all onto a page at about 5 point font." "so if you hold a page at page at arms length, it probably looks like a patchy black colour all over the page, right? due to all the text?" (sound of rustling paper) "yeah, pretty much... it's law notes, so it's all very important." i go on to explain how usage like that is going to drain the toner quicker than expected. he's not happy, and wants to check the numbers, as well as what i am saying about the usage. i direct him on where to get the coverage information from the machine, and where in the manual it explains the link between coverage and the toner life. he goes quiet and makes notes through this, confirming page numbers and a few other things. he starts talking about what i'm telling him can't be legal. he knows these things, apparently. i explain that if he has numbers that don't match what i said to let me know, and we can look into it further. he's not happy, but ends the call. i note it in the system, and go on with my day... two days later... customer calls back, again from a train station. he starts ranting immediately, and i end up not being able to get any details out of him, but dig up the customer notes in the system when i realise it's the same guy. he has checked the numbers, and he's been doing 25% coverage or something like that. the machine has printed something just above 200 pages. at a glance, these numbers seem right to me. but he wants free stuff! "i've wasted a lot of time finding this out, and still can't print! you need to send me toner to fix this fault!" it's not a fault. he used the toner a lot, and got his usage from it. more to the point, i find he actually has a small amount of toner left, and the machine is just giving him a low toner message. i explain the maths, and he insists that even though the matches works, someone at the store should have warned him law notes use a lot more toner than other subjects, because he told them several times he was using it for notes. i explain that unless he showed them what he was printing, they may not have realised what he was going to use it for. but he told them several times he was studying law (really?!), so they should be prepared for this. at this point i know i'm in the right, so tell him he isn't getting free stuff, he has to buy new toner, and at his current usage, a replacement toner will last him x number of pages. he doesn't like this, and hangs up. i check his details, find which distributor sent the machine out originally, and forward some notes to our sales rep for that group, just in case it comes up. sales rep in question is pretty good with usage and things like that, and he basically replies that he doubts he will hear about it, but will keep it in mind. about an hour later he comes and sees me. a store just called to report this guy called them trying to make a complaint, then threaten legal action for "misrepresenting the product". the store had told him he wasn't getting free stuff either, so he hung up, and they called the sales rep to ask if they were going to get in trouble from this guy (no, we have notes already). "he threatened legal action. did you know he's a lawyer?" i grumble, and add some more notes to the system. i don't hear anything for the rest of the week, until monday morning... first call of the day, a co-worker answers,and we can all hear shouting the moment he picks up. he tries for a few moments, then spins around in his chair, "it's for you" i get a call transferred to me, and behold, it's the law student, now arguing that the toners don't fill properly. we've already guessed that he didn't buy a new toner, so i'm trying to get him to tell me how he refilled it. because at this point i suspect he has either got a non genuine item (not supported) or possibly even refilled with inkjet ink (it's happened in the past, and sooooo not supported). "it's not refilling with paper ash." wait... what? "i spent two hours on the weekend sending through blank pages for it to burn with the laser and fill the cartridge again. it's not burning the paper, and it's not refilling the toner." at this point i stand up, so my supervisor can see me over the partition and hear me. the co worker from earlier looks up as well to see what's happening. i want to make sure i have witnesses to this. "so you're telling me that in order to refill the toner cartridge, you've been sending through blank paper under the impression that toner is paper ash, and doing so will let the machine burn the paper and create a new source of toner for you, depositing it back into the cartridge, and letting you keep printing." customer sounds smug, "yes. i did my research. i know what i'm doing. i found out how these things work." i make eye contact with everyone who i can see, as they are mainly trying to hold back laughter. "no. that's not how it works at all. i suggest you buy a new toner and install it when prompted. this machine will not create new toner for you" "you can't tell me that! i'm going to be a lawyer! i'll take you to court over this." "in which case i will repeat what i have told you the last few days in front of everyone assembled. that is not how the machine works. you have used your toner, and need more." customer grunts and ends the call. to this day, i have not been asked to appear in court for this... a few months ago i got an emergency call from a customer because the core switch (cisco 6509) at a school was down. symptoms: switch would boot up, experience a crash, then reboot. over and over and over again. after some troubleshooting it's obvious that the problem is bigger than just corrupt firmware; the supervisor is damaged and possibly even the backplane. &gt;me: so, what happened? &gt; networktech: power outage. &gt; me: i thought all of the core network gear was on ups? &gt; nt: well, there was a ups but they unplugged it. &gt; me: who unplugged it? &gt; nt: the principal. it started beeping last year so they unplugged everything from the ups and powered it off. &gt; me: *facepalm* so someone whose networking knowledge barely covers the configuration of a residential wireless router took it upon themselves to disconnect a $150,000+ switch from the only thing keeping it safe from texas summer power fluctuations. this resulted in the school being down for a day and a half while it tracked down new equipment, because years ago someone else decided to save money by not renewing maintenance contracts. of course the school blames it because they should have just *known* that the ups was bad, and they should have fixed the switch faster. tl;dr it's easier to buy a new car than it is to change the oil.today at the helpdesk i was helping get an old professor set up on his new computer after a complete data transfer. he opened it up, logged on, and immediately brought up finder and started frantically searching for a file. i noticed he was holding his breath. then, he located a particular video, and let it out with a long sigh, pressing "play" and entering full screen. it was an old woman wired up to a host of machines, breathing heavily, looking right at the camera. the professor turned to me and said "this is the only file i wanted. it's my last conversation with my wife before she passed away from cancer." after he left i had to take a few minutes to compose myself. gosh. edit: wow! i didn't expect this response at all. i'm glad you all like happy stories :) i think that everyone who works tech support agrees that it's what keeps us going :) if anyone wants to read something from the complete opposite end of the spectrum, i also just wrote this up: [linky.]( /shamelessselfpromotionany telco has lots of people manning phones in a myriad of departments. sometimes things are busier than usual on key lines, ranging from sales to tech support. that's when hr-logistics where i work start handing down orders to cut corners to save seconds in every way possible. at tech support, high call volume is common for front line staff when we have sudden, unforeseen technical problems. spikes in calls waiting and the tickets front line file about them is key for senior staff to rapidly identify the problem(s) and get the ball rolling on a fix. we also use unofficial scripts that check frontline's logged tickets every couple minutes and report unusual volumes in any ticket sub-category. selecting categories is one of the first things done during a call, so we often pick up on a new problem within 5 minutes thanks to this. used to be that during a spike in calls, hr-logistics would only send people in call centers emails asking to avoid doing anything but taking calls until further notice, use cold transfers in-between departments instead of politely conferencing, offer unlimited overtime to everyone who is in a position to take it (if their shift is about to end), and other reasonably sane things like that. but the 'special efficiency measures' as they call them got worse and worse. floor managers were to ask politely if you'd agree to delay your lunch/breaks till later if lines were deep red - they can't order you to according to the work contract, but they tried *asking*. then they started offering to pay overtime to people willing to forgo their lunch break altogether. they started scrutinizing bathroom breaks while deep red to make sure they weren't 'situationally abused'. then they told front line to ask customers whether we could have a 'specialist' call them back in a couple hours if their issue was clearly going to take a long time to fix. then they finally went a bridge too far, adding to their orders... &gt; 'due to high call volume, stop logging tickets immediately until further notice.' ... tsss was dumbfounded when we read that. on one hand, this was hr implicitly acknowledging our ticket system is slow and inefficient. it's always been; awhile back they spent a few millions trying to improve it and it somehow got worse. some stats-crunching suit up in his ivory tower figured out we could shave a minute off wrap-up time anytime we don't file tickets about why customers called us. it might even kind of make sense in some other departments but not at tech support. we rely on that data to pinpoint issues and outages and keep track of repeat callers. it's invaluable data. not only would this hurt troubleshooting, it really wouldn't improve their holy 'average handling time'. front line techs during outages hate the speed at which they're expected to take calls, and if they have an extra wrap-up minute here and there to use while staying within expected metrics, they spend it cooling down, not taking an extra call. since this crazy directive came up from on high i first sent up the food chain a lengthy, polite explanation of why we need the tickets at all times, how not having them hurt our ability to efficiently solve the issue, and why this was a particularly bad way to save time. hr-logistics immediately reacted by editing their 'special efficiency measures' template... &gt; 'due to high call volume, stop logging tickets immediately until further notice, *unless specifically instructed to by your department's senior staff or your immediate manager*.' ... which not only did not in any way solve the issue or respond to any of my points. it in fact made things worse, as we started getting escalation calls from techs who wanted to ask us permission to file a ticket for issues mid-crisis! the next time we got a temporary order to stop logging tickets, i immediately sent a reply to every group working at tech support, omitting all departments not under our purview and hr-logistics, using tsss' group-wide emergency procedures email. this meant about a thousand people including contractors and the department's lower and middle-management would see it. &gt; tsss: "in compliance with the special efficiency measures, tsss instructs that everyone at tech support under our purview keeps logging tickets for every single call. failure to do so would unacceptably hinder our ability to address current issues in a timely fashion and would negatively impact our overall customer experience and satisfaction." if you're likely going to piss off management in writing, throw in a couple buzzwords, it makes the pill much easier to swallow for them. i thought i was basically taunting them over this nonsense. i figured it would make enough waves that they'd have no choice but debate it and likely review their procedure, though it could put me in a little bit of trouble to practically just reply-all 'plz ignore hr'. union job security affords me enough leeway to poke anyone in the eye if need be, but i was definitely expecting some minor fallout. i was ready for pretty much any scenario aside from everything going well. i was expecting to be told *'this isn't what was meant, you can't just tell everyone to just ignore the directive!!'* and yet stuff around here works in mysterious ways. not only did no one question my email, everybody complied, and all went well. and at the next tsss meeting... &gt; frank: "so, that email bytewave sent during the last outage? it helped tremendously. we're utterly f***ed if we don't get tickets during outages! i suggest we add procedures for whoever is handling the tickets to send the same email should this directive be sent to tech support's frontline again in the future." &gt; my boss: "yes. as long as hr's email has the language saying senior staff can grant instructions on the matter, i expect a copy of that email to go out within 5 minutes tops every time we get this set of 'special efficiency measures'. we really need the tickets, it's a core business intelligence priority, but i'm told the order not to file tickets will stay in their template - no more information available." everybody nodded or shrugged and that was it. i tried not to seem too surprised. whenever tech support is swamped and they hand down emergency orders to temporarily cut corners, it's now *on the books policy* for tsss to reply asap and tell frontline to ignore the part about not filing tickets on our own say so, and everybody is fine with that - yet we can't get hr to not ask in the first place. kafkaesque. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!]( using long.time.lurker; using first.time.poster; hello tfts! i'm a software developer, currently working in london but for several years i worked in another more sunny country. this tale dates back to that time. i was employed by a biggermanengineeringcompany at the time; being such a big company, the "management" section of our headquarters had more people than the actual engineering section, or the marketing section, or any other section you can think of, and rumors were that it was because any high-level manager would hire friends and family giving them a role in "management" even when the company was cutting down on new hires. what they did in that section consisted basically of glorified bookkeeping, filling out excel spreadsheets for every single task, from keeping track of expenses to tracking down how many plastic cups were in each coffee machine every friday (no, i'm not kidding); all the developers (including me) have been called more than once to "design a new spreadsheet for x task". i usually did that without thinking about it too much: it didn't happen often, i could wait until i had finished whatever more important project i was working on at that moment, and usually never took more than 15 minutes to prepare the spreadsheets with the correct formulas. they could probably do it themselves if they spent a bit of time googling beginner guides to excel, but i figured it wasn't really an issue to help. the coffee machine was placed right beside the door to the management offices, so whenever i was on a coffee break i could actually see and hear what was going on in that office. there was this one time when i overheard the following conversation going on between a guy and a girl in management: she was sitting at the pc, typing, and the guy was standing beside her desk, with papers in his hands, telling her what to write: &gt; guy: on b3, it's 156 &gt; girl: *types* &gt; guy: on b4, it's 200 &gt; girl: *types* hmm hmm... &gt; guy: on b5, it's 44 &gt; girl: *types* ok... repeat for another 50-60 cells, all on column b &gt; guy: ... and on b60 it's 121. &gt; girl: *types* done. now the total? &gt; guy: *pulls out a desk calculator and starts typing* yeah, let me just make the sum and i'll tell you what to type on b61. **edit** : formatting, i fail at it.i work at a large tech company and was just taking some typical tier 1 calls when suddenly: *ring* me: hello, this is $me, how can i help you today? customer: what the hell did you guys do to my mozilla? me: what seems to be the issue? customer: every time i open mozilla it just goes to $companyhomepage. i want you to remote in now and fix it. i tried to explain to the man that mozilla is a company and that firefox is a web browser and that it was perfectly normal for him to be seeing web pages while opening this application. customer: well i never asked for firefox to be installed on here. where is my mozilla? i was in shock. i kept trying to explain the idea behind a web browser but he was not having it. i finally got into his computer and saw that indeed, firefox was working as advertised but this was unacceptable to him. finally, he demanded that i bring back mozilla. i navigated to the mozilla homepage and made it his homepage and he was delighted that i had fixed his "issue." he even called me a "miracle worker." i sometimes get frustrated with every day users and then i realize that it can always be worse. i did this call about ten(10) years ago. the complaint was the printer would not continue printing while the secretary went for lunch, and that even if she stayed on her station during her lunch break it still refused to print until her lunch period ended. i arrived early because they had other problems in different parts of the company to work on. i first checked out the secretary's printer, it was a light gray hp model (i can't remember the model number) and it was printing fine. the secretary then joked that i should come back just before noon and the printer would stop working just like the janitorial staff would do at noon. i came back just before noon and did a test print, it worked ok. i then spent some time checking that the computer's printer settings were correct (they were), then tried test printing again. there was no printing coming out! there also were no error messages, just a non-printing printer. tested it again and then after checking the computer found the print jobs were still in the print spooler. i looked at the printer, the blinding white printer, the blinding white printer? i looked up to see a skylight directly overhead the printer. i then just held a file folder over the printer and it started printing, right away. it did not take much checking but it seemed the bright sunlight entered thru the cooling slots on top of the printer and tripped so many of the sensors inside that printer did not even produce an error message. once i showed the secretary how to block the light entering the slots so she could print but also explained why she could not just leave the folder over the cooling slots her problems were solved. ps. this problem only occurred in summer for just a few weeks, then the sun had shifted enough that the printer could once again work all day. i do onsite tech support for a large bank. my co-worker (we'll call him bob) and i cover an area that includes 72 locations, some are really close, some are about 3 hours away, the rest are in between. one sunday, a really bad thunderstorm rolled through our coverage area, a few of our locations lost power, so bob and i were expecting a fair amount of calls on monday. we get to the office monday morning, and over the course of the day, we end up with about 25 calls in four separate branches for equipment that got fried by the power outages. we spend the entire day loading software on pcs, unboxing displays and local printers, and calling our various branches to let them know that we would be out on tuesday. tuesday morning rolls around and we meet at the office and load up our cars with equipment for the day. we leave going in the same direction, after about 45 miles, he was going to go south and get 2 of the branches, and i was going to go north and get the other 2. about 10 minutes after leaving the office, bob calls me. "trrwilson, meet me at that gas station up the road." we meet, and he tells me that he has to go 2 hours in the opposite direction to replace a down switch; tickets like those take priority over any others. we transfer his equipment into my car, i wish him luck and we part ways. while he was on the road, he called his 2 branches and let them know what was going on and that i would be out in the afternoon. i get to my first 2 branches and things go ok. i head south to go to the branches bob was supposed to visit. i get to the first one, and it was a mess. one of the replacement pcs wouldn't come up, so i had to frankenstein a working replacement from all the bad ones we picked up. i finish up, and realize that i'm not going to get to my last stop before they close; not a huge problem since i have after hours access. i call them up and tell them what's going on, and they're cool with it; then i ask them if they can mark the bad equipment for me so that i don't have to stumble around in the dark trying to figure out what i have to replace. again, no problem, they'll have them marked when i get there. i arrive at the branch about 30 minutes after the last person has left; i carry my equipment into the foyer and then i see it. there is a fun size candy bar laying on the floor of the foyer. i figure someone had just dropped it as they were leaving. i go through the doors into the branch lobby and then see another tiny candy bar right inside the lobby. i look down and see that the users had made a candy trail leading from the front door into the offices with damaged equipment. i follow the trail into the first office. taped to the monitor is a picture of the user fake-punching the monitor. i pull out my copy of the ticket and check the asset tag that is listed, and sure enough, the monitor was called in; so i replace her monitor. i follow the trail further and the next office has a picture of the user fake-stomping on their pc. i take the hint and replace his pc. the last stop on the trail had a picture of the user fake-kicking his printer, so it gets replaced. before i left, i took a picture of me giving a cheesy grin and a thumbs up and taped them to each replacement. the next morning when i got to the shop and checked my e-mail, i found that each user had send me a picture of them hugging their new equipment. they really managed to brighten up a long and annoying day. i just had an issue that i couldn't resolve locally. it was for a printer that wasn't printing. it worked fine from our test utility, but wouldn't work from the user's application. with issues like this we always escalate it to the company that hosts the application and they'll do some magic on their end (reset a bad address, update a config, etc) to get it working again. usually it's a 5 minute fix. so i emailed them the details of the issue, the exchange was something like this: &gt; me: hi, we're having issues with [application] not printing, it works from our test utility but not from [application] so i imagine it just needs an address resetting on your end. &gt; host: thanks for letting us know, could you please give the location so we can send an engineer? (i thought it was strange they'd send an engineer for an issue like this, they usually just reset it remotely). &gt; me: [location details]. are you going to send out an engineer? usually you guys would just reset it remotely from your end. &gt; them: i've logged this as [ticket reference] and the engineer will be arriving soon. i figure whatever. it's their application, they know what they're doing, if they think they need an engineer on site then they probably do. i leave the issue while i wait to hear back from them. 30 minutes later i get a call from my helpdesk: &gt; "hi haddock420, we've just logged a ticket for [aforementioned issue] from [application host]...." apparently i'm the engineer they were going to send out, to look into the issue that i just escalated to them. i don't think this is going to end well. tldr: thanks for reporting the issue, we'll send you out to fix it shortly.i did it support for two years before moving onto a software engineer role and i can say the level of incompetence was astounding but this was by far the best story i have. one day me and my fellow it team were chilling in our office, waiting for the day to be over, when our manager gets a phone call. our boss fuming over how someone stole his hdd, generally we never get a call from the boss so we all take this very seriously. me and my manager along with another tech leave to check out the situation. upon entering the office we find our boss using his computer, i'm a bit hesitant so i let my manager do the talking. he asks what computer had the hdd stolen, as it obviously couldn't be the one he's using but our boss was adamant it was. he asks us to come look at the computer and points to a hole on the tower, an empty bay where a cd-rom should be, and starts fuming about how his hdd is completely gone. i get red in the face and the other tech is pointing at the obviously working computer. our manager explains what he's missing and how his computer does in fact have a hdd, the boss is completely dumbfounded by this revelation. he calmly sits back down, and this is where he tries to save face, states it was a test to see how responsive we were and how we could leave the office now. that's when i knew it support that directly dealt with customers wasn't for me.hello tfts, long time reader first time poster. i used to manage desktops and do general troubleshooting at a university that had an aviation department (ironically my actual degree, not computer...anything) with an airport campus. i'd make weekly trips to the airport to fix whatever might be broken, set up new desktops, figure out why their file server wasn't working, etc. these folks were definitely my favorites to help, were rarely demanding, would usually only call well after they'd already covered all of the basic troubleshooting steps, and were very out-of-the-box thinkers when it came to computers (sometimes a good thing, and as you're about to see, sometimes a very bad thing) so on one of these visits i was tasked with installing some software on one of the mechanic's computers. when i got to their office, they weren't there, which was to be expected. unlocked their office and discovered their computer was awake and logged in. this was not to be expected, our lockout policy put the computers to sleep and locked them after 15 minutes. sit down to figure out what was keeping it awake, and imagine my surprise when i moved the mouse and found they had carved a hole in the desk and installed a small cessna clock in the desk (as in, a clock pulled from a cessna instrument panel) every time the minute hand moved, the mouse registered it as movement and kept the computer awake. to quote the great ron burgundy: "i'm not even mad, that's amazing" told my supervisor, don't know if anything was done, i was too impressed to care. tl:dr; cessna manufactures mechanical mouse jigglersthis was at a previous job: after years of people coming into my office to ask me if "the server" was down, which of course would be followed by a game of 20 questions. keep in mind, we had 400+ servers, and numourous little systems all over the place. i decided to have some fun with it. i found a decomissioned dell desktop, wrote "the server" on the side of it in sharpy, and put it up against the wall behind my chair. for the next several months (only with co-workers who i knew and knew that they knew my sense of humor), whenever someone would come in and ask "is the server down?", i would respond by looking at the desktop on the floor and reply with "looks good to me." one time, one of the users said, "but it doesn't have any cables connected to it. shouldn't there be cables?" "nope, it's wireless" "ok, good!" then walked out. turns out their issue was trying to connect to an external webpage with a broken link[previous]( tuesday morning *kick, kick, kick, kick.* &gt;me: hey defiant, football’s aren’t really meant to be kicked around here. &gt;defiant: practice is this afternoon. defiant kept juggling his football, bouncing it off his foot over an over again. &gt;me: we’re in it though. just, stop. you could hit something. &gt;defiant: meh. fine. defiant reluctantly picked up the ball from the ground, whilst i looked at the ticket queue. **new ticket** &gt;*i need some help saving my documents. it keeps failing* - headhr. perfect. i thought. ***** as defiant and i arrived at hr, i saw head of hr’s face. she was beaming with delight at defiant. &gt;headhr: look. my computer is just not saving. perhaps you can help me young man. head of hr winked at me as defiant sighed and walked up to the computer. &gt;defiant: okay… click file… then save. **oh**. defiant was startled by an actual error. the error was a standard formatting error. &gt;defiant: lettme think for a sec. defiant got up out of his chair and started juggling his soccer ball again. i hadn’t realized he was still holding it. &gt;me: you can’t kick that in here! &gt;defiant: we’re not in it. this is hr. &gt;headhr: what are you… head of hr seemed confused that defiant had stepped away from the computer and was now kicking a ball in her office. &gt;defiant: it helps me think. don’t worry, a few more kicks and i’ll be able to solve your error. &gt;me: defiant, put the ball down. get fixing. defiant stopped kicking and fell back down into head of hr’s chair with a thump. &gt;defiant: okay. this is a standard formatting error, right now when you’re saving, it is throwing up errors because the standard data conversion the program or format it uses cannot compute some of the building blocks you’ve used. if however we change the format to another class it should be able to recognize all the charters and blocks. head of hr stood slightly stunned next to me. eventually she whispered to me slightly loudly. &gt;headhr: i know what it does, i messed with it so he’d have a job to do. why’s he being so… i wasn’t sure if defiant could hear, but he was looking at head of hr with a cold stare as she whispered. headhr obviously lost her nerve mid sentence because she continued, however speaking normally. &gt;headhr: very good, young man. how would you like a day in hr? &gt;defiant: can i play football here? defiant looked mournfully at the football on the ground, head of hr looked perplexed. &gt;headhr: we generally do work here in hr… &gt;defiant: no thank you, then. head of hr looked a mixture of annoyed and dismayed. defiant had got up and continued kicking his ball. &gt;headhr: could you stop… that? the kicking is a bit annoying. defiant shrugged. he kept kicking. i’m not sure what exactly happened next, but head of hr walked around her desk. she then made a swift kick at the ball, connecting with it beautifully. the ball sailed over her desk and would have gone straight out the door, if i wasn’t directly in the way. **smack** &gt;defiant: awww dammm, **headshot** &gt;headhr: oh my goodness. i’m so sorry. my face hurt. luckily after seeing such a good kick defiant seemed to want to stay in hr for the rest of the day. so.. that was good. i guess. ***** getting back to it, my head very red and sore. i was jumped by redcheer. &gt;redcheer: hey airz, small problem... [next]([previous]( monday morning i felt refreshed after a whole weekend off. the office looked less depressing after a good sleep. i did however feel that something was missing from the office. it then dawned on me that defiant wasn’t coming in anymore. me: ahhh, darn it. i decided the best way to get over it was to throw myself into tickets. &gt;**new email** - *they’ve finally confirmed it! mac has been hacked. you need to disable all macs from the network.* —headsec a helpful email attachment was included, a word document inside which contained a single hyperlink to a news website announcing the confirmation of the first mac malware. as soon as i’d read the article my phone started to ring. &gt;me: hello? &gt;headsec: airz, you’re in already. good. have you checked your email? &gt;me: yeah. actually next time you want to link something, just post the address in the email. don’t attach a word document with the link inside. headsec didn’t sound like he was listening through the phone. &gt;headsec: you gotta disable the macs, man. they’ve been hacked. &gt;me: we’ve known about that vulnerable for a while, it made world news, how are you only hearing about this now? &gt;headsec: are you disabling the macs? &gt;me: no. my simple statement send headsec into overdrive. &gt;headsec: but they’re vulnerable!!! &gt;me: we’ve known about the problem for a while, luckily we’ve been spared infection. &gt;headsec: we can’t risk it. i sighed, first thing monday morning and someone already wants to disable an entire segment of our users machines. &gt;me: just calm down. if we’re infected applications stop working. it even says so in your article. &gt;headsec: no, no. wait. i’ll get the vp on the line. he’ll sort this out. the head of security proceeded to conference call the vp. &gt;headsec: vp, the mac’s are infected. did you read the article i emailed you? &gt;me: they aren’t infected. we’ve known about this bug for a while. the vp was slow to respond. it sounded like he was chatting to someone else in the background. i thought i heard giggling. must have been my imagination. &gt;vp: mmmm, yes. i’ve read the article. i think i saw it on the news a while ago. &gt;headsec: we should disable all mac’s. &gt;me: we’re not infected. so. no. &gt;headsec: **i’m** hired as the security expert. the secure thing to do is disable all the mac’s. the vp took a while to respond, this time he sounded like he was deciding. &gt;vp: we’re not infected? &gt;me: no. &gt;vp: but we could be? &gt;headsec: yep. the vp paused for a second. &gt;vp: well the answer is obvious then…. another pause, this time for even longer. &gt;vp: pda’s can’t get infected. …. f$#@ me. [next](journeying to work that day, i knew there was to be plenty bad noise. despite this feeling of ensuing doom, it was an oddly upbeat kind of day. the morning sun was subdued as it accompanied the first warm day of the year and seemed to fill the office with naturally warming uv light. news of our remarkable failure flurried around the office as eyes stalked my path from the lobby to my desk. as my outlook churned into gear, it presented several new emails to look at; i was only waiting for one. the ominous calendar entry from our eminent sales director was present as expected, decorated with the high-importance flag. i spent the morning glancing through my tickets, though i really had no intention of doing any of them. angie appeared around her usual 10am. her pace was rushed and the lack of her signatory starbucks cup distinguished angie’s obvious apprehension. “care to explain what happened yesterday?” her condescending vocal tone was different this time. before, harsh and snappy like a loathsome strict teacher, a faint quiver existed somewhere in the background. “i don’t know!” i responded. for once i seemed to be in the power position. “i don't feel i was involved in this project!” she pressed for further information, her voice taking on her signatory snarl and gripe. hr tank, accompanied by an anonymous administrative orderly, unexpectedly appeared to relieve me of this interrogation. she demanded the immediate presence of the entire its department in the nearest meeting room. again, our walking pace to the meeting room seemed exaggeratedly slow, a homage to hr tank’s slow purposeful walk. i stood in the corner of the room only finally noticing the distinct lack of bhit. hr tank began to speak through her reddened face, fatigued from her trip. her drained voice read her palpably pre-prepared and rubber-stamped statement from a sheet which seemed to also serve as a barrier of defence. “it has been decided,” she began “that due to incongruences that have arisen in the department of late that bhit is no longer able to fulfil his duty as head of it; he will therefore not be returning to the business!” her statement droned on with all the officialdom you would expect from such a legally exacting statement. her statement ended with “i am authorized to answer any questions at this point”. the its team shuffled out, dazed and wounded. for his spinelessness, bhit had evidently had all our backs somewhere along the line. we took our seats, like a pack of wounded animals returning from some failed hunt. angie remained with hr tank discussing an imminent starbucks trip as roland stood guard in her absence. we all sat still and silent, in one way to mark the demise of bhit and, in the other, we felt that the slightest motion would be recorded and later used against us as evidence. the fact that bhit had evidently taken the fall for the whole thing just seemed unreal. angie’s consistent belittling and hateful nature just seemed to be the only outlook, we were shellshocked that she had apparently won! the post-rollout meeting time came up. as angie, roland and i made our way to the top floor in the elevator, the air grew thick with scorn. the silence bellowed like a thousand years of social indifference, as if the slightest word could ignite the situation like a megaton bomb. it seemed like ages until the lift doors finally opened. angie and roland obnoxiously barged out of the lift, though i had yielded to them anyway. this was my first time in front of an official board. the room layout had changed. the sales and marketing managers sat in a row along the centre line of the arranged desk, flanked by the conspicuous presence of hr tank and another woman who it seemed was there to take notes. cantering the congregation was a man whose obverse mannerism exuded the confidence and exterior meant he was someone of importance. angie, roland and i took up position in front of this jury of vips. our plastic chairs clanged and noisily bent into form to exemplify their cheapness, an extreme contrast to the leather-bound pews claimed by the panel. the central character, who it soon became apparent was the division manager, opened with a speech akin to that of some great dictator. his appraisal of the utter failure intensified as his voice raised in volume, yet remained controlled and collected. it was like he needed to say everything he needed to say like some pre-interrogation tactic. the panel would interview us one at a time. i remained sat outside the office with roland as angie pleaded her case as its manager. memories of sitting outside the school principal’s office at school seemed came flooding back. though i had never really been a bad kid, i found myself winding up outside the head’s office a few times - a catholic warden clad in black whose manifestation was intended solely to scare straight. roland sat with a smirk, apparently unconcerned with these on-going. his motionless gaze made me think that this guy had far more experience explaining himself to school principals than me. roland was up next. angie sat in the seat roland vacated. her arrogant indifference mirrored roland’s posture with eerie exactness. i began to grow worried; angie was always one step ahead of any game currently in progress. thoughts of explaining my job loss to my other half, thoughts of having to job-hunt made me nervous. after an hour of waiting patiently, my time was finally up. i sat central to the panel trying to remember every interview technique that had ever been drilled into me by any chance i’d previously had to take such advice on board. i made sure to look at the person who was addressing me, back straight, shoulders back. here we go! the panel had their tactics down. it seemed no one person would ask more than one question at a time. the questions came slow, strategically calm and collected. the lady on the end of the panel appeared to note everything i said as the panel would wait for her silent ok to continue. at this moment, i was ready to hang angie and her bastard youth out to dry! i just waited for my chance. after the initial questions, largely surrounding who planned what, the director placed his pen in front of him. he placed his elbows on the table as he leaned his hardened chin on his first and second fingers, mirrored and extended to provide support. as he leaned in, he said, “tell us, in your own words, you account of what happened”. i relayed my entire saga, from angie’s commandeering of the project plan, roland’s inauguration to being responsible for the images, our flawed and hapless manner of couriering laptops instead delivering at the conference – all of it. i finished, almost spitting out my words, exercising this demon called angie. one of the sales managers enquired, “why didn’t you check anything before you built them?” i defended “there was no time to do that. they had been built and qa’d by roland who apparently knew what he was doing. we had 200 machines to build and no means to verify anything!” i couldn’t tell if i had impressed with my answer or not. the thick silence felt like a poorly performing job interview. “why did you believe roland fully equipped to manage this implementation?” the weightiness of their questioning became stronger. “i didn’t!” responding inadvertently with a tone similar to angie’s impertinent and self-aggrandizing sneer. “i followed the direction of my management. i was told to leave him alone, i did!” the md passed me a copy of my rollout plan. “was this the rollout plan you followed?” i picked it up, glancing through the already familiar pages i had spent several days perfecting, re-enumerating before my final presentation. i looked up and said, “no! angie altered the specification several times. the final version was signed off, i believe, by everyone here!” i felt like i had delivered a blow to everyone in the room who could even slightly have been rooting for me, as if i’d had twisted the knife in the very same way angie had done to claw her way to the top! after 30 minutes of grilling, i left the room. angie and roland had long vacated leaving the empty seats, their emptiness like some satirical congratulatory prize. hr tank had concluded the meeting, thanking me for my time, ordering me back to my duties. its was silent for the remainer of the day, juxtaposed against the now brilliant developing sun, obviously out of place in britain’s spring but seemed to invite action and good times contrasting against our office-prisoner mood. angie and roland were stealthy silent against the humanistic blur and shuffle of the its inhabitants as they adjusted their postures to comfort. the only reprieve came from angie’s regular group ushering her to their second of their starbucks trips, this time joined by roland. the escape of my 4pm leaving time couldn’t have come quickly enough; i made for home, wondering if i would ever set foot in its again. the crystal clear night sky gave birth to another sunny day. the grime and dirt that incrusted my car seemed to beg for a good washing and detailing session. it was relieving to have at least one thing on my list to occupy my time on the end of a dole queue. as i approached the car park gates of the pharmaceutical giant, i wondered if security would deny access to their fortress. i envisaged ramming the gate in some movie-like attempt to exact my revenge to dance on angie’s decrepit corpse. 15 months of this woman was too much for anyone to deal with. as i uneventfully descended the giant lobby stairs towards its, i expected to be bundled to the floor at any moment by all manner of burly security guards to the approving look of angie. i was convinced this woman was far too street-smart to be outdone by anything! almost disappointedly, its remained unmolested in its usual ground-floor spot. my windows login worked, as i began to prepare for the day’s work. i arrived back from lunch with several members of third line and our previously borrowed helpdesk guy, still licking his wounds from the onslaught of sales reps. qbg met us on our way down. she smiled wryly, excitedly yet softly declaring "angie’s packing her desk! she’s history!” i didn’t believe her. i had to see this with my own eyes! i sat down, maintaining as detached an outlook as i could, pretending not to notice as angie wrapped her scaly neck in the familiar black and grey shawl. roland’s desk, surprisingly, also lay vacated. angie disregarded the looks from its as she picked up her leather clutch bag and made for the exit. “is she gone? was she fired?” a fervour of questions engulfed our modest team. as we excitedly theorized and conjectured, we eventually realized that there were only questions - no answers. this tumultuous turn of events did nothing to allay my own fears. i tied myself to my desk, waiting for someone – anyone – to order me into a closed doors meeting. but, nobody came that day… nor the next… **previous** [pt1: a new world order]( ) [pt2: safety first]( [pt3: the it induction from hell]( [pt4: undercurrents]( [pt5: how to make friends and...]( [pt6: marking territories]( [pt7: one friday to rue them all]( [pt8: best laid plans]( [pt9: its one step for man]( [pt10: ...and one step back for its]( [pt11: bring home the solider]( [pt12: who needs minor victories...]( [pt13: dawn of a new nightmare]( [pt14: rules of engagement]( [pt15: bring out your dead]( [pt16: the greatest trick the devil ever pulled...]( [pt17: who's the king?]( [pt18: now that's what i call a sticky situation]( [pt19: throw the dice]( [pt20: cardboard city]( [pt21: the rollout from hell](years ago. this was just another day taking escalation calls from frontline at my telco when i got an amusing call. &gt; bytewave: "senior line, bytewave, you may send me your ticket." &gt; subcontractor: "sent. this is a military emergency, camp nathan smith in afghanistan has lost communications with cfb suffield. something is wrong with the satellites, i don't know what to do - but it's major trouble!" ... &gt; bytewave: "okay, first, we're not providing support for any satellites. we have no control over what goes through satellites. it's just ultimately routed through us. entry point for this there is our node, network kilo bravo dash 997. did you check that node?" &gt; subcontractor: "uhh, but.. our soldiers in afghanistan cannot connect to the biggest military base in the country!

mom: i can get message from $friend2 but not $friend me: do both of these people have iphones? mom: yeah. me: then you should have gotten any message that sent. it's unlikely that imessage was turned off. mom: it was. i had to turn it back on. why did it get turned off? did you touch my phone? me: i'm only here once a week, and i never touched your phone. mom: then how did it get turned off? me: you probably did it by accident. mom: no. i wouldn't have turned that off. me: that's why i said accident. mom: no son, i know what i'm doing. me: then why was your imessages turned off? who played with your phone. mom: (scoffing) no one! i'm the only one who touches my phone. me: so you probably accidently turned off imessages and this prevents messages from coming in sometimes because the other iphone that is sending the message doesn't know to send it sms instead. mom: i didn't turn off imessages son. me: then your fucking phone is haunted. smdh not exactly tech-support, but i know we've all been down this road with someone we know. i'm sitting at home in my pjs waiting to get ready for work when the home phone rings. it's my grandma. me: hey gram! how are you?

no one answered. it seemed the news of the tickets stacking up in a silent account was already spread before solitaire worked up the bravery to come see me. &gt;me: we’re going to get through all these tickets in record time. &gt;colorblind looked up at me. he wasn’t happy. &gt;c/b: sorry i can’t help. i gotta go audit every computer in the company…and clean out ever filter… colourblind waited for a response. &gt;me: oh, yes. those tickets will now be taken out of your account. &gt;c/b: thank you, but i still don’t see why we should race to solitaire’s aid… just fire him now and we can spend a week or two fixing this. i looked over at my coffee. it said you can't fire someone for helping out another employee. which is what the ghost account started off as. even if it did backfire in everyone’s face. &gt;me: oh good plan. solitaire gave me a worried look. &gt;me: and i suppose you’re going to take over teaching itsec everything he needs to know. &gt;c/b: we could just fire him too. right? &gt;me: while i'm at it, since i’m firing two people already… i should really fire everyone who potentially messed with the competition and the ticket server in any way. perhaps the increased load from a script checking the queue every 0.5 seconds contributed in some way to the problem. &gt;c/b: oh… a knock at the door drew my attention. a secretary with her hair in a twist walked into the office. &gt;twist: the vp wants to see you in his office… now. &gt;me: he could have called. &gt;twist: the it systems seem to be breaking, the vp didn’t want the phone lines to also potentially mess up the message. we gotta re-test everything now. so till its all retested, we’re walking the important messages. &gt;me: whaaaa? its only the ticketing service…. never mind. coffee screamed at me to stay on task. i turned back to the techs assembled in my office. &gt;me: okay team listen, do your best, pump out those tickets. good luck. time to see the vp. fun. [next](a month had passed since mafg's passing. morale was at a low point and apart from angie's bipolar temper, things seemed to slog along as they were, each day proving to be more and more difficult to get through. the it cupboard slowly relinquished its isolation as angie seemed to track our movements with animal-like instinct, imposing ridiculous policy after policy. the battery indicator on mafg's mouse had at some point faded to nothingness having spent its remaining energies fruitlessly lamenting its master’s disappearance. mafg sacrifice was guarded in its reasoning. many theorized the lost machines from the meeting room had made it to his car; some theorized he’d wronged some director in a drunken moment of sincerity; there was even a rumour he had put angie in her place in some magnificent fit of comeuppance, bathed in the flabbergasted stares of twenty faceless onlookers. the reality was far more boring and told to me over a weekend pint of fine ale. mafg’s wife had previously worked with the company in their research division. she had left under explosive circumstances for a competing pharmaceutical company. management felt that mafg’s continued employment was incongruous and had compelled him to take a pilon agreement to end his tenure. it seemed odd that mafg’s wife had left the company over six months ago; we felt that this discrepancy stank of angie’s involvement. for a while though, a specific date had shone brightly in my outlook calendar. it had acted as a target, representing a reprieve from the mundane trivialities support had to offer. i had prepared for it arrival with jubilation. it finally arrived and my audience with several heads of sales/marketing, bhit and the software vendor was mine to shine in. the purpose was to set into motion the plans for their large-scale laptop rollout. armed with my carefully crafted number-work dutifully outlined on several handouts, i set off for the meeting, three floors up in the swankier part of the building. in my mind, i was alexander the great, sword raised in hand, off to conquer in what seemed to be an inevitable foregone conclusion. ok, i don’t know much about history, but all i knew was my sword was huge and i was about to go kick some ass! my arrival at the meeting was met with the usual pleasantries and shaking of hands. the meeting room was perfectly air conditioned with several pieces of foliage standing elegantly in large ceramic plant pots. the large window welcomed the sun in vast quantities into the fragrant room. underneath the heated rays of light was the ominous shape of angie, sat at the far end of the room, away from all human contact. the sunlight seemed to darken and blur angie's outline, like some satanic aura, but her bent, bitter frame was just too familiar and imposing to ignore. the meeting began with the usual round of round-table identification. angie’s snarled introduction was only suffixed by the words "i am in charge of support!" her declaration made an instant impression on everyone as they hastily moved on. the software vendor rep was a techy through and through. he stood for his presentation, draped in what was obviously a brand new suit purchased for the occasion. it seemed to contrive him as he awkwardly passed around his company endorsed paraphernalia; pens, cards, product sheets… there were logos on everything as if he was clearly instructed to embark on this endeavour but try to hide his obvious geekiness. my segment came. i eagerly handed out my carefully crafted mission statement, adorned with pie charts, gantt charts and technical jargon made just basic enough to empower even the most it-illiterate of sales managers. i explained my intentions with a well-rehearsed speech which lasted several minutes: 212 new laptops and 57 to remain in the field. across three hardware types; several primary targets were to be used for pilot testing; each user would receive an extra 100mb on home drives and be responsible for their own backups; each rep's laptop would be first imaged for any later data retrieval and each rep would be re-furnished by the end of the day. angie's eyes remained focused on me throughout the session. i felt odd as she hadn't interjected once. our vendor's rep nodded in anticipation as rep after rep smiled in anticipation. they liked what they heard: new toys for everyone and all they had to do was give the all ok! my moment of triumph at an end, angie finally spoke up. "what sort of manpower do we need for this?" her voice was rather different; she spoke as if i were part of her menopause club, all harshness had dissipated into a normalized vocal tone. i retorted, putting aside my stunned silence, that i expected to prepare the images myself and builds would be used to train up some more junior members of staff in the absence of mafg. she nodded in approval as she made notes. her lack of typical angie-style anger perturbed me. nevertheless, the meeting ended in what appeared to be a climactic sense of collaboration as the balding head of it smiled proudly, sharing all manner of manager-speak with his congregation as the vendor techie and i exchanged pleasantries, angie left anonymous in her wake without saying another word. i knew this move by now! her silent departure was signatory of her underhandedness; she was up to something. it distracted me momentarily as i asked the vendor guy to repeat what he had just said… what was this devious cow up to? i was not left in suspense for long. that afternoon, its were summoned to a meeting room where angie wanted to discuss the rollout. i knew angie was cooking something and i knew it was a clear move to usurp my finely laid plans. my only consolation was that i had the backing of bhit and several higher-ups, what could she possibly do? our entrance into angie’s meeting was made strange by the unexpected presence of a spotty urchin who had previously been chained to helpdesk. his sharp eyes and pointed, thin facial features seemed disturbingly familiar, his unbranded shirt and pale jeans seemed to be a desperate attempt to look normal. angie began the meeting by introducing the urchin, returning to her familiar intense vocal tone. “this is roland. he is joining 2nd line today” she hissed as her eyes danced around the room as if to highlight her claim. the meeting continued with angie’s voice droning my exact words, complete with inaccuracies one could only attribute to someone whose obvious depth had long-since been surpassed. i think at some point, the only thing keeping us awake was angie’s voice, shrill and bent in character. she had finally finished when i decided to speak. i knew my interjection would further madden the beast, mainly as it would actually be of technical relevance and accuracy which angie could never possibly dream of. but i had to stake my role in this project. “we’ll have the majority of the machines built prior to the event, so most will only need booting up and profiles loading. there will also be a ghost server, file server and we’ll have a connection back to the office. all out-of-field laptops will be backed up later back at the office, any laptops that are staying out will have to be backed up and loaded at the event in one hit. we’ll also keep ten spare new laptops just in case anything happens.” the its crew hung on every word, as if i were mandating a life or death situation. angie fired corrections in as much as she could, though mired in technical incompetence. “you will have to back up everything you get!” her accusatory vocal sneer hinted that we may do anything different. we had a mission, we had our tasks, i had a rollout to deliver. it was getting towards the end of the day. roland had picked his spot next to me, taking mafg’s spot. he was not talkative, he barely acknowledged anybody’s presence. a few banter-like quips intended to embroil him into our team didn’t get so much as a raised eyebrow. his body language was eerie in its familiarity. brandishing my purchase order, signed by bhit and bearing sales &amp; marketing’s stamp approving the project with every endorsement that one could ever hope to see on such a document, i headed to the elevators to scale the heights to the procurement department. i was joined in the elevator by qbg who seemed eager to have a word. it seemed qbg had some sort of big secret she would have burst if she hadn’t let out. “roland! you know who he is, don’t you?” qbg spoke softly, as if the lift were rigged with some manner of bugging equipment. “that’s angie’s son!” her words were difficult to believe… but roland’s mannerisms, posture, familiar sharpness… it all rang out clear as a bell. the thought of this woman propagating seemed unnatural! it conjured images of some monstrous carnal act between a musty stick-insect and some hapless male donor entangled in her web, held prisoner for his seed. but, it all seemed too obvious now. like a slow head-on car accident, everything started to make sense. there had to be someone who had shown angie how to access touchpaper; she was clearly still struggling with it a month on! someone had to show angie how to use the printers! someone had to have fed back to angie anything and everything we’d complained about her! someone had to have kept angie informed of our whereabouts – how else could she track us with such animal-like accuracy? there he was - in the background the whole time, as enigmatic and as slimey as the bitch that spawned him. that same spotty 1st liner who angie demanded i cleared down the it cupboard with so long ago, the insignificant shadow which seemed to appear every so often, as if every photographic memory which flashed into view had his image super-imposed somewhere on it… standing by a printer, walking through the its area, sitting nearby in the canteen… her spy, invisible to the naked eye! as incredible as it seemed, there it was… our rat… exposed far too late to be in any way wary, he was now closer than we could have ever imagined. we had allowed him to creep up on us like a ninja - angie’s inside man! **previous** [pt1: a new world order]( ) [pt2: safety first]( [pt3: the it induction from hell]( [pt4: undercurrents]( [pt5: how to make friends and...]( [pt6: marking territories]( [pt7: one friday to rue them all]( [pt8: best laid plans]( [pt9: its one step for man]( [pt10: ...and one step back for its]( [pt11: bring home the solider]( [pt12: who needs minor victories...]( [pt13: dawn of a new nightmare]( [pt14: rules of engagement]( [pt15: bring out your dead](so back when i was a teenager i worked in technology retail. one day minutes before closing time a middle aged man came in saying that he was having volume problems. i ask him what problem he has and says let me show you. he pulls out his laptop and starts it. of course it takes 5 minutes to boot up so as it is doing that i ask him what problem he is having. he tells me that the volume on youtube isn't working. i ask him if he is able to hear audio from other things on his computer. music, other websites etc. he says everything else is working. so i tell him that if all sources of audio are working except for youtube then the first thing i would assume is that youtube is simply muted. the man is insulted as if i am calling him a monkey. i was merely thinking aloud, but that was all i could immediately think of. the manager walked by and the man started saying that i was being arrogant and insulting to him. he says that this is why he never comes here...despite being here now. so his computer is on, i pick a youtube video of cher's believe as that is my go to sample video. no volume. i tell him, yeah the volume is off. he then points at how the x to represent mute is not there. i tell him yeah it isn't muted, you just have the volume all the way down. he appears visibly embarrassed which was fine i just wanted to go home. he then proceeds to pack up quickly and leave without saying thank you. man, what a vacation. america is weird, but i like it. thanks brooklyn, you're my favourite. thooklyn. thanks /u/timinthetrees for the drinks and hangs! -- back at the infamous datacentre from hell, i formed good relationships with a few of the founding customers. they'd ask for favours every now and then, and i'd help out where i could. sometimes this ended well for me (contract work on the side), other times it didn't (helping out people who were either too smart for their own good, or too dumb for life). this is ... i don't know. somewhere in the middle. one of these customers had a couple of odd requests over the course of maybe a month. 1. buy a roll of rg58 cable and 8 cores of it from his rack out to the plant room. 2. take delivery of a box of weird-looking pci cards i've never seen before and leave them in the rack. "wat" sure, whatever tony. i guess some other stuff happened while i was away, or he got someone else in to do some things, because a few months later, he had an incredibly bizarre request. i didn't know it yet, but all these requests were linked. &gt;tony: 'i need you to go across the street to the 7-11 and buy me all the vodafone sim cards they have' now, i gotta say at this point i was confused. goddamn confused. this got no better when the next set of instructions came through a bit later. &gt;tony: 'pull out every pci card in the servers and take the old sim cards out, then put the new ones in' afterwards, he explained what was going on. see, when vodafone was hitting the market hard for prepaid phones in australia, they did something pretty stupid. there was a $200 recharge that would give you $1200 of credit, the only catch was that it had a 30 day expiry. who would do such a thing? what person needs $1200 a month of phone credit but can't get on a plan? someone who was terminating skype's voip calls in australia onto the mobile pstn network. yeah. i know. by taking advantage of the ridiculous call value, he was able to generate cell calls at a fraction of the cost of a pri. in fact, what he'd done while i was away was to install 8 massive antennas on the end of the cable and hang them out the window of the building. he'd generated so many calls that he crashed the local cell tower. then crashed it again. rinse, repeat until vodafone upped the bandwidth to the site, and finally could begin investigating how one small area could be saturating the mobile phone network so much it was breaking it. it was then that they started realising this huge volume of calls was coming from very specific sims, so they did what any carrier would do - cut them off. upon doing this, his response was to just *buy more sim cards*. so, they were replaced. and thus began an endless game of cat &amp; mouse as he varied the call timing allowed out on the channels to randomise them to look human-ish, as voda kept blocking his sims. this continued until it became unworkable, by which stage he'd made so much money from it he had the capital to float more pops and move the calls around to different towers, and became effectively untraceable. well played tony. well played. -- stay tuned to /r/chhopsky for more hacks and fun that aren't appropriate for tfts!its had a full compliment of staff the following morning. there was work to do - but nothing seemed important enough to leave desks for. we were all were gathered for one purpose. one of our soldiers was in trouble. though we were powerless to do anything other than offer moral support, we felt glued to our desks. angie was palpably absent, her familiar black and grey shawl being the only spectral reminder of her presence somewhere in the building. mafg was quiet; assurances of help to find other work and amending cvs came and went like splashes of water. soon, angie and hr tank arrived at mafg's deskside. the scene, brief as it was, seemed as if they had taken him into custody short of only handcuffs. they led him to angie's special place of solitude, situated somewhere far beyond the familiar dimly corridor just barely visible from its. a bulb had gone in that corridor some time ago, it just seemed that nobody had ever replaced it. i had seen angie lead a few people down this corridor when they had hit the height of her displeasure. today though, they moved artificially slowly. mafgs limbs moved uncomfortably as if to not let on their progress was impeded by hr tank's inability to keep up with normal walking pace - a walk that angie had seemed to perfect. as the figures shuffled around the corner at the end of the corridor, the dim lighting served as a poignant landscape of some mysterious doom, the shadow of angie's tall thin figure casting on the yellowing walls like some fairytale ghost. a few minutes of disbelief followed in its. the team stared at various spots on the floor of our square work area, trying to explain things in our own minds; not even a breath was audible. this two minutes silence was terminated only as mafg's monitor emblematically entered their sleep modes and faded to black. as quickly as the images faded, so did any sense of hope or morale we barely clung onto, and so did our moment of stillness. we promptly turned to our own desks to work. angie and mafg returned two quick hours later. accompanied by two security guards, they stood sentinel to angie's familiar sharp tongued leadership of the situation. hr tank was nowhere around, i could only presume that her weight disallowed her making the return journey. mafg added personal items from his desk to a small cardboard box, his lips dry from lack of saliva, his throat obviously lumpy. angie's stern face stood expressionless. the silence in its was broken only with angie's snipes. "where is your usb disk, you can't take that" she barked; mafg coiled the usb cable around his impeccably well taken care of freecom drive. she snatched it as he offered it to her, her eyes still now showing even a grain of benevolence. "we need your phone too!" her growl seemed to antagonize mafg, but he couldn't react. his slow purposeful movements were fighting every urge to succumb to the lump in his throat. mafg duly handed her his trusty blackberry refusing to make eye contact. it instantly brought back memories to me of when we had first been issued these phones. mafg and i had spent a good week exploring their potential, loading on useful utilities and configuring them for maximum it support effectiveness. they had been the formation of a good work-based friendship. it just seemed this memory was torn now, trampled on by this monster. angie took mafg's blackberry and extended her arm in my direction, clad in a heavy black cardigan sleeve as if to contrast so heavily with her pale skin. her emaciated hand ushered it in my direction. as i took it from her, it felt like i was taking a gift from some devil. she said with a bitter tongue, "there, now you have one". i sat stunned as mafg looked at both me and angie. the ordeal was nearly over - but not quite! mafg picked up his cardboard box of meager possessions, old pay slips and desk candies. he motioned his completion, but angie again extended her hand to block his passage. springing into life, one of the security guards broke from his uncomfortably official-looking stance and took the box from mafg. he placed it back on his desk. the guard started digging around in the box, almost neanderthal in his movements. his grey security shirt stretched over his fattened arms as he bent over for his task. he removed several company branded pens and an unopened pack of mafg's business cards. on their discovery, each piece of contraband were cast onto the desk surface, their respective rattles and thumps a soundtrack to whatever wrong-doing mafg had done to earn this punishment. after nodding towards angie and refolding his arms, the security guard took his rightful place next to his colleague, both mustering as much energy as they could to maintain their stern postures. beads of sweat ran down the guard's face; he was not used to standing this much. the funeral march shuffled away towards the main staircase. the procession led by angie, mafg carrying his own cardboard coffin and the duo of security guard pallbearers seemed to have the attention of the entire floor. the only evidence of mafgs existence was now reduced to four pens, a pack of business cards and the wireless mouse whose flashing red battery symbol echoed the loss of its user. the only noise was from finance, callously ignorant of the situation as they loudly discussed their day-to-day. **previous** [pt1: a new world order]( ) [pt2: safety first]( [pt3: the it induction from hell]( [pt4: undercurrents]( [pt5: how to make friends and...]( [pt6: marking territories]( [pt7: one friday to rue them all]( [pt8: best laid plans]( [pt9: its one step for man]( [pt10: ...and one step back for its]( [pt11: bring home the solider]( [pt12: who needs minor victories...]( [pt13: dawn of a new nightmare]( [pt14: rules of engagement]( i'm a developer on the it department of our company. we had a summer intern one summer documenting some of our processes. he tried to install something and needed an admin password, so he asked me for help. &gt;$intern: hey can you install something for me?

something about insurance liabilities? i just burned my hand on the computer. there was something wrong with my mouse, i tried to fix it, but... yeah i'm a klutz, all i got to show for it is this burn." &gt; lower-management: "err, it doesn't look all that bad, are you sure that it's actually worth filing.." &gt; hr: "what the hell?! we don't second-guess injury claims! we need them all reported, we already have a problem where too many employees fail to report minor injuries. insurance liabilities at stake!" &gt; union rep: "right ... very important to be thorough about this ... indeed, always report any injuries no matter how minor. let's file the paperwork?" &gt; amelia: "well, if you want to put your hand near where i got the burn, you'll see how hot it is?" knowing her, probably some doe eyes involved somewhere ;) always effective. they're just too damn blue. soon after, they decide to look at the offending computer. the hr rep puts his hand on her terrible clone, which happens to have a gfx card pumping everything it could thanks to the dna software running, which ensured her gpu stayed north of 95c. most of our clones simply used on-board video but some had real video cards - it happens when you're using random hardware everywhere. &gt; hr, with a warm hand: "fuck! ouch, what the hell! call in the bilateral health &amp; safety board, now!" they didn't say anything else in front of that union rep or union employees, but her trick was good. within three weeks, *everything* was pulled out and replaced by nice-looking asus boxes and dell screens. the last of our crts were thrown out. hell, i saw someone loading some of the trash into a truck from our garbage bin - i hope he had better luck with them than we did. that stuff was seriously outdated. since then, no such issues - the telco sucks right and left, but we no longer appear to consider that it's worth it to cut corners when it comes to the hardware tech support needs. nowadays, senior staff can often work from home using top-tier equipment they install at the telco's expense if we ask for it.

even i didn’t know, but what i did know was… if worst came to worst, i could always hang up. i heard the phone pick up as i took a sip of coffee. a gruff voice spoke. &gt;gruff: hello, the line is terrible…. &gt;me: wha.. oh sorry, i was just drinking… never mind, hello its airz here. &gt;gruff: airz aye? what cha calling me? what cha calling me?! i don't even think that makes sense. coffee reminded me to just get on with it. &gt;me: i just wanted to ask you about notie. gruff started coughing through the phone, the instant he heard the name notie. &gt;gruff: what about notie? &gt;me: he used to work for you? as an it staff member.... &gt;gruff: you think i don’t know what my own son in law did? i realised gruff was taking offense, i took a swig of coffee and plodded on. not hangup worthy, yet. &gt;me: just wondering how he was as a worker, did he turn up on time? &gt;gruff: you call me up. to ask me about my son in law’s working skills? are you implying he wouldn’t turn up to work on time? &gt;me: er… no? wait, what? gruff started sounding angry. &gt;gruff: you’re asking me if my own family is punctual, of course he is, he’s a proud notieian **(edit: he said noties last name)** i didn’t really understand what was going on. i was fairly sure notie and gruff didn’t even have the same last name. &gt;me: sorry, i think we’ve had a misunderstanding. we’re currently ringing up notie’s references, he just interviewed with us for an it position. &gt;gruff: i see. gruff sounded like he’d calmed down a bit. &gt;me: so insights into his work you can share would be helpful. &gt;gruff: well as you know, he’s a notieian **(see edit above)** which means he’s a good worker. that's your seal of quality, you can take that to the bank. never had a day wrong with him. i picked up my coffee, that was useful information to know. i took a sip. tasted like, confusion. &gt;me: sorry, wait. what? he’s a great worker? &gt;gruff: yes. &gt;me: apologies but why would you fire your best worker? gruff paused for a moment on the other end of the line. he’d either had an epiphany or a stroke. &gt;gruff: fire him’s a bit strong a word i think… i didn’t know how to reply to that, silence reigned for what seemed like forever. &gt;gruff: i encouraged him to pursue other options. &gt;me: okay. &gt;gruff: listen, airz… whats your last name? i seriously considered telling him, but my hang up meter was pretty high. luckily he kept going without it. &gt;gruff: notie, he’s a good worker. however he took the best years of my daughters life and guess what…. no child. no one to carry on the notieian **(see edit above)** name! i’m pretty sure he can’t even have a kid. what do they call that?

i grabbed a pen again and as i hung up i wrote down “punctual." next to the other two words i’d already written. as looked down at my sheet, i admired my handiwork of two phone calls. “angry?” “infertile?” “punctual.” [next](got a new hire a while ago. let's call her $noobcake. $noobcake is your classic "needy user." on $noobcake's first day, i made a grand total of six trips to her office for various issues. i don't like this mouse, my monitor is too bright, my monitor is too dim, my wrists hurt from typing on this keyboard, i don't know how to check my email, etc. she started on a friday, so i have a nice, refreshing weekend away from email and the ticket queue. monday morning, i see several tickets from her in the queue. i open the first one. it was submitted on friday evening well after i went home. &gt;*"hi tedtheviking! i got an email from $vendor telling me to sign in to $application, but it's not letting me in. help!"* that's strange, i think. my organization does have dealings with $vendor, but her department doesn't use $application at all. i ask her to forward the email to me. i hang out in the break room for a few minutes, gazing into a scalding cup of coffee. i wonder if i'll be able to see my future in the steam. nope, but i manage to fog up my glasses. my phone pings. new email from $noobcake. i ignore it for now - it can wait until i'm back at my desk. the main riff from "jukebox hero" starts blaring out of nowhere. it takes me a moment to realize that it's coming from my pocket. i recognize the phone number of cavedweller (cd) from netops. the guy's a real character. he's two parts grizzly bear, three parts terminator robot. we go way back - used to work for the same department. &gt;me: hey baby, talk to me. cd: stop calling me baby. do you have a user named $noobcake? me: yeah, she's a new hire. what's up? cd: apparently, her account hit the exchange server over 400 times in the past hour. any idea what that's all about? something clicks in my brain, and everything makes sense all of a sudden. &gt;me: i know what's going on. lock out her account. i'll deal with her when she comes in. i go back to my desk, and pull up the forward from $noobcake. yep, all the classic signs are there - poor grammar, threat of account deletion, generic hotmail address. i rifle through the contents of my desk, and grab a pamphlet on web security and phishing. still half an hour before $noobcake arrives. the coffee is finally cool enough to drink. it's a thankless job, but people like $noobcake ensure that i'll always be able to find employment. *tl;dr - took lsd and viagra before going on space mountain, woke up as the pampered concubine of two bisexual android lumberjacks. lost my pager in the bouncy castle, but at least my necktie still tastes like pumpernickel.*note: the company’s weeks are sunday to sunday, but it takes three days for them to “process” that into actual payment. so pay day is… wednesday/wednesday night. (kinda irrelevant tbh) [previous]( wednesday afternoon i sat in my office, two coffees filled to the brim sitting on my desk. waiting. a knock at the door made me jump. redcheer smiled from the door, she was holding two coffee cups. &gt;redcheer: i brought you a mid afternoon coffee, but it looks like you beat me to it. i smiled at redcheer and looked down at the two delicious cups in front of me. &gt;me: yeah. &gt;redcheer: two coffees is a bit much, it would almost be irresponsible to give you a third. &gt;me: oh, give it to me anyway, as a backup. redcheer looked at me quizzically as she walked over and placed a third cup down on my desk. &gt;me: thatguy is coming… &gt;redcheer: thatguy? i had forgotten redcheer wasn’t at the meeting. i decided to tell her the entire story. after describing it to her i felt a little better. redcheer looked a little angry though... &gt;redcheer: what a little b*$#ard, and… all you did is kick him out? &gt;me: well… he’s meant to be here for his one on one session but he’s over an hour late. i don’t think he’s gonna show up. &gt;redcheer: what a f*&amp;#ing time waster! the coffee smell from the three coffees in front of me was giving me perspective. &gt;me: nah. he’s just awkward, maybe? &gt;redcheer: well f*%$ that guy. i laughed as redcheer left the room. i’d heard that somewhere before. ***** thursday morning i’d been called up urgently to the head of accounting. upon arriving at the accounting department i bumped into orangetie. &gt;orangetie: airz! &gt;me: oh, hello. an awkward pause as i realised i didn’t actually remember orangetie’s name. &gt;orangetie: i’ve changed every password i had to something new, after your talk. &gt;me: er… good? &gt;orangetie: i take it you’re here for **the** error. &gt;me: whhaa? yes? maybe? i’m looking for your boss. orangetie smiled and gestured over to headac’s office. upon reaching the headaccounts office i saw the headac looking worriedly at his computer. &gt;headac: look whats happened… the screen showed an account error. i wasn’t familiar with the software though. &gt;headac: the numbers don’t match. we’re meant to pay out x for all the employees for payday, but this week we’re paying out y. somethings wrong. &gt;me: err… &gt;headac: tell me whats wrong!!! i took another look at the software. a warning/error was showing on the pay(?) software. &gt;**account invalid** *bank details invalid* *bank not found* *payment failed* **user:101010101** &gt;me: oh… who is user 101010101? headac searched the user id. &gt;headac: its “thatguy”… what the hell… i took a look at the screen. the employee details were there, but underneath banking details someone had changed the bank’s name to: asks to many questions. and every number field to 0’s. headac looked up at me. his eyes searching for answers. &gt;headac: computer error? &gt;me: no chance. &gt;headac: s@&amp;t. ***** [next]( [comic]( thanks artzdept. looks amazing :) [previous]( tuesday afternoon. “that guy” one manages to be hired in every company. he always manages to make meetings take forever by asking the most insane/inane things. the following, is a battle with my morals not to murder “that guy”: ***** i’d been asked to host a talk on computer security, as i arrived i noticed the room was filled with people. i smiled at the assembled crowd. the head of security walked over, he was happy. &gt;headsec: all ready? look how many people turned up… &gt;me: yep. i handed over a usb stick to headsec. &gt;headsec: powerpoint? i nodded my head. he beamed happiness at me. turning to face the assembled crowd, i tried to look as friendly as possible before starting my talk... my first mistake. &gt;me: when leaving your computer, for an extended period of time. lock the session. a hand shot up from the crowd. in my head i tossed up leaving questions till the end. i decided it was okay to answer them as we went. my second mistake. &gt;thatguy: how long is an extended period of time? &gt;me: if you can’t see your computer, and you're away for more then a minute. lock your session. engaging “that guy”. third mistake. &gt;thatguy: what if, someone comes to your desk and asks you a question. so you turn around to face them. you can't see your computer, and the answer will take longer then a minute…. should you lock it then? &gt;me: i think a bit of common sense, would tell you that its okay to leave it unlocked if you’re sitting at your desk. now i’m not sure if the backhanded insult landed, or he was just this disruptive always but he became unbearable. &gt;thatguy: how far. would *you* say, a person has to be before locking the session on a computer is required. &gt;me: just as soon as they've left their desk. thatguy smiled. then feigned a look of confusion. &gt;thatguy: sorry. just to be clear…. as soon as they’ve left. so even like … a metre away? &gt;me: sure. on to passwords. i smiled again at the audience. my patience running thin. bad cop grumbled. the next slide displayed on the screen. &gt;me: don’t share your passwords. ever. don’t even write them down. a hand shot up again from the audience. i looked at its owner. “that guy”. nope. &gt;me: i think we’ll save questions till the end. &gt;thatguy: oh, i’ll forget them all if you do that. i stared down at him. badcop took over my eyes. i’m fairly certain i death stared him. &gt;thatguy: okay. fair enough. anyone got a pen? i need to write my questions down. thatguy was now standing up looking around for a pen. no one seemed to have one. &gt;thatguy: no one with a pen? ahhh… it would be totally easier if you just answered my questions now…. i just stared at him. i waited…. i was on my second slide. :( bad cop already wanted out. [next]([previous]( ***** i walked over to the cupboard i knew held the water pumps. as i opened it, a cheerily red headed lady approached me from behind. &gt;redcheer: hello. i jumped a little. not realizing someone was behind me. &gt;me: oh hey, sorry. are you trying to get in here? i pointed to the cupboard, then realized it was full of equipment only it would need. &gt;redcheer: haha, i’ve come to help you. &gt;me: er… are you a tech? i thought there was only one. &gt;redcheer: i’m a designer! but i wanna help you, it’ll get my creative juices flowing. i looked down at the water pumps, i’d never installed one before. probably shouldn't let people know that. &gt;me: oh, i’ll be okay. &gt;redcheer: i wasn’t asking, silly. now you grab those tools. i’ll get the pump boxes. i got back to the desk and wondered if they expected me to help everyone with design. surely not right? &gt;redcheer: okay, whats first? &gt;me: we gotta read the instructions. opening a box i plucked out the instructions for installing. &gt;redcheer: booooring…. let’s skip that step. &gt;me: okay, how about you open all the boxes, and put all the pieces next to each computer. she seemed much happier with doing manual labor. she got to work. the instructions were super dull. basically install the sump, do the piping, check all the seals, install into the pc. &gt;redcheer: what now? she was super keen. &gt;me: we gotta take a sump and install it into the case. i grabbed the screwdrivers required. i started install it into the first pc. &gt;redcheer: let me do one. &gt;me: do… you know how? red headed ladies demeanor changed dramatically. her smile wiped off her face. &gt;redcheer: are… you saying i can’t? i remembered my good first impressions idea. i started smiling. &gt;me: oh, just checking you know what you’re doing. this is expensive equipment. &gt;redcheery: give me that… she took the screwdriver out of my hand, started installing the pump. &gt;redcheery: this is more fun. she started smiling again, the cheeriness was back. after she’d announced she’d completed the first pump i looked inside the computer. it was perfect… everything was installed properly. &gt;me: oh… just… nice. &gt;redcheery: haha, starting to see me as more then just a pretty face, huh? &gt;me: err, yeah. i went back to installing the pump on a different machine and cheery moved onto her second computer. &gt;redcheery: it is fun. i think i’ll help you out all week. &gt;me: don’t you have… work to do? i looked around at the other people working. they didn’t look like they had time to spare. &gt;redcheery: don’t worry, you’ll help me with it right? &gt;me: err…. i don’t know anything about design. &gt;redcheery: haha, i’ll teach you. plus dad said you’re great at metaphors. i was confused, who was she related to? &gt;me: sorry… dad? &gt;redcheery: the boss of this office. &gt;me: carefree? &gt;redcheery: yeah! he says you’re a designer in disguise. so we can help each other right? i looked back over at the installed pump. it was done pretty well. without instructions too. could be a worse partner… right? &gt;redcheery: ouch! ahhhhh darn it. her shout made me look back over at the red headed lady beside me, her hand had a huge gash through it. &gt;me: oh f&amp;#$. &gt;redcheery: woah! don’t swear, that’s way to negative. it’s okay just a scratch. her hand was bleeding, it was a fairly deep cut. blood was about to drip down onto the computer. &gt;me: ummm, lets go get your hand treated. &gt;redcheery: oh no. it’s okay, this is my machine now. i’ve decided. the blood started dripping down onto the top of the newly installed sump. &gt;me: we should probably go get your hand treated. plus blood isn’t great for electronics. &gt;redcheery: haha, if i give it a little blood now, me and my computers bond will be great, and we’ll be able to design good things together. i was seriously worried about her sanity at this point. &gt;redcheery: plus, its only going on the sump. &gt;me: okay come on, blood sacrifice over. &gt;redcheery: haha, its not that weird. it hurt me, now i’ll feel connected to that computer. designers are like that, okay? we walked over to the break room sink. i realized i didn’t know where any medical aid was in this new office…. hand of the boss’s daughter, cut whilst working on it…. how bad? [next](obviously, fake name. anyways, a while ago, i was working a contract for a rather significant pharmaceutical company. it was your standard run-of-the-mill 1st line maybe 2nd line type role, with a clear difference! our manager was great. attentive, offered good career advice when you needed it, always had your back when the proverbial hit the fan, guided us through some difficult times with lunch on the company card or the odd tin of quality street. the guy was excellent - one of the few times i could hand-on-heart say it! however, good things don't last and as higher ups decided that support was way too happy, decided to dispose of our erstwhile leader, much to the cue of "oh captain my captain" upon his departure. enter angie... there are few words to describe angie. we'd heard tell of her actions and personality through her previous subjects during our morning coffees around the campfire. apparently she would snipe and shout at you for merely existing and applied the logic of a 3 year old suffering major attention deficit disorder at a lecture on string theory. angie had been in charge of drug safety for about a decade. to put it into perspective, if you took this company's product and turned into a blue octapus that shot fire, the authorities would contact her department for advice. now, from what i could tell, these guys seemed to be very well versed in everything from chemistry, biology and some were even former doctors. none of this sheer brilliance washed with angie; she merely treated them like tools that she had no idea how to use and would bang with a hammer when they worked her way - even if her way was clearly stupid. still - judge no book by their cover and all that! angie arrived in support a day early mere moments after our former hero had walked the long mile. she immediately proceeded to command facilities to join her at her desk, where she chewed out a 17 year old girl mercifully due to there being dust on her desk and grit in her drawers. this relentless torture went on for a good 20 minutes while angie inspected every inch of the girl's effort to appease her whims, even re-cleaning several spots more than once. afterwards, she walked away red faced, eyes to the ground and with a lump in her throat after just about getting the words to indicate she will have her drawer pack replaced with a brand new unit. we all knew it was to be a new world order with angie's arrival; we would have thought her showing up a day early was to meet and greet the troops... it was very apparent to me that she was just a vicious troll marking her territory, showing everyone who was boss! suffice it to say, we finished up the day typing up cvs and comparing layouts.i recently left school and started in a big it company as an apprentice so i'm still learning a lot. every new it apprentice starts in the first level support to get a general overview of all the support cases that come in from our employees. we have a ticket system and also a hotline, so one day a lady calls since we see the name on the phone display my colleagues immediatly ignored the call so it goes over to me. i didn't think much about it and picked it up. **me:** "(name), it-servicedesk how can i help you ?" **lady:** "i opened up the excel file my colleague sent me via email but it doesn't seem to open up properly, can you build up a remote connection and take a look at it?" **me:** "sure give me a second." after i had remote access on her computer, i tried to open up the excel window since the program was clearly running. nothing happened but the program seemed to be responding, so i opened up taskmanager to see the process status. everything looked fine. then one thing my colleague said to me on the first day came to mind. "always think, that the customer you have on the phone, never touched a computer before." since every employee at our company has a second monitor i asked her: **me:** "can you check if the window opened up on your second monitor?" **lady:** "wait let me turn it on first" "yes it opened up but the window looks odd, can you see it?" **me:** "no, i can only see your main monitor, so you need to move the window to the other monitor." **lady:** "so can you see it now, normally it looks different." kinda confused i look at the window and it looked completely fine. **me:** "whats wrong with the window, you need to be a little more specific?" **lady:** "the size, the window should be way bigger." **me:** "ah thats what you meant, you can maximize the window size with the button you can see up here in the right corner." the lady hung up and left me behind confused how my company can hire people without the most basic computer skills. it's tough to be the it guy ..i got a trouble call from one of our non-linear video edit rooms. this was back when we still used tape to tape linear editing, so this room was "special". so special that they had sent the "expert" from ny to install it without telling us or even saying hello. anyway, the room had a funny smell and the editor pointed to a little ups on the floor which was smoking, and the sides were bulging. i told her to stop editing, save her work, and shut her workstation off. we needed to get the ups out of there immediately. she said that she was on deadline, and the ny "expert" had told her to always use a ups to protect her work. she wanted a guarantee that nothing would go wrong if we removed her ups. i told her that she will never get such a guarantee from me about **anything**, but that i could almost guarantee that her project will be lost if she continued to use the smoking ups. she reluctantly shut down her system. the ironic thing is that we have an enterprise-level building-wide ups for technical power which is far more reliable than the crappy $100 desktop apc unit she loved so much. i work it for a small office of about 40 people. it is part of a larger organisation that has hundreds of different types of sites across the nation, and as such also has a centralized it helpdesk that i'm not a part of. my story is short and sweet. on monday morning i received the following email (literally ctrl+c ctrl+v except the name changes): &gt;help me pinklemming, solitare and mindsweeper aren't on this computer, and i know i can'd lodge a ticket with the it support desk as its against thier policy. in my defense it was monday morning and my coffee level was still critically low, so i did what *technically* i'm supposed to do in such a situation (that is; being asked to break company policy/ code of conduct etc...) and simply forwarded the email to the newbie's manager to let them deal with it, then i went about my business (read: i went onto reddit and other internet "research"). this morning the manager i forwarded the email to came in to thank me for giving her a reason to fire the newbie as she "*just didn't like him as a person*". and then handed me a mars bar. *winning*my company just rolled out a new web-based system for people to use for time-sheets etc. part of the switch-over involved deleting the browser cache and old favorites links etc. if they didn't do this, the website wouldn't show correctly. one user i had was having issues clearing out the cache. been working with him for over 20 minutes, trying different ways to explain it &amp; just can't grip the terms somehow (...i click toooools?? where is tooooools??). *note: can't remote access his pc, otherwise i'd just do it for him* finally, i'm just about ready to give up and escalate it when i had an idea. &gt;me: ok user, one last thing. when you use the internet at home, do you ever have to delete anything you wouldn't want certain people to see, like your significant other or someone like that. &gt;user: oh yeah! hold on a sec *couple of clicks and a small muttering of sound* &gt;user: yep the site works! thanks! **tl/dr**: the internet is for....**preface:** there is this guy - let's call him pete. pete comes in the it department every month or so, because *his computer fails somehow*. actually, petes computer doesn't fail on it's own - pete just doesn't know how to properly watch porn on the internet. **today:** porn pete (how we call him) comes in to our it department and rages about that *something happend again on the internet* and that we just need to run *the cd* again (kaspersky rescue boot disk). my colleague starts his computer and what pops up while porn pete stands beside him? yep - a flavour of the "interpol department of cybercrime" fraud malware. the funfact: the malware made a shot with the webcam of him **while he sat naked in front of his computer fapping** oh and by the way, pete is about 60 and one hairy dude. bricks were be shat and the whole it laughed to tears. made our day.2nd story. this one boils my blood. *please note this story does not take place in the usa* i used to work as printer support for a small business. these printers were actually x-ray printers which would produce digital quality images from x-rays machines and such using our provided equipment. pretty fancy. nightmare to install and troubleshoot. also bear in mind that since this is a very specialized kind of equipment, it wasn't like you could "google" the answer since most of the problems would be user related or hardware errors. it's also worth mentioning that the closest piece of equipment we had was about 3-4 hours away with no way to remote into these machine/printers. when i joined i didn't have any kind of experience dealing with this kind of equipment. i was told anything i needed to know would be provided to me and i would be trained accordingly. nope.avi first day at work: the training i received was in the form of a pdf manual with 1k-2k pages and the "product orientation" was going to the website of the product and reading anything that was there. everything else was "figure it out". enough ranting and background. on with the story. $me: yours truly $ot: other tech. (quite knowledgeable and cool dude.) $manager: regional manager of the company &gt; $manager: i just got a call from $client (who is at least 3 hours away driving through mountains and dangerous roads) and they are not able to print!!! &gt; $ot: ok, i'll give them a call and- &gt; $manager: no! they are upset and are threatening to return the equipment if we don't help them now! &gt; $me: rushing, that's at least a 3 hour drive while a phone call can resolve the issue in 3 minutes or less. &gt; $manager: i don't care! i want someone there now! *sigh* earlier that day, $ot's car had broken down and it was at the shop with no reasonable eta. so it fell on me and my whole 2 weeks of "training" to solve the woes of this machine. after driving through treacherous and dangerous paths to get there (during which one of many trips, i witnessed an accident right before my eyes where 3 people died but that's a story for another day) i get off my car, head in the hospital, into the x-ray imaging room to see the hospital's manager fiddling with the machine and printing as usual. at this point, i wanted to murder anybody inside that tiny, cold, humid and god-forsaken office but being the nice it i am the only thing that popped out: &gt; $me: oh, it's printing! that's good! what did you guys do? &gt; $hospitalmanager: i just power-cycled it and it worked. &gt; $me: that's great! let me take a look at the logs and i'll be on my way! i took the damn thing off, took it to a pitch-black room so the special printing film wouldn't go to waste and quietly weeped at the incompetence of higher ups for not letting me make a single phone call. needless to say, i quit 3 months afterwards and the company dissolved 1 1/2 months later after that. tl;dr i drove 3 hours to sit in a pitch-black room to cry with a special printer. edit: formatting edit 2: wow! thanks a lot for the support guys! also quote of the day! big thank you!first tale and italian, so excuse me for my mistakes and poor english :) august 2014, i'm on holiday in barcellona with a friend of mine. we are on the beach, relaxing under the sun with two mojitos. &gt;*beep beep* *my friend receives an sms* &gt;**friend**: it's my mum, she has some troubles with the notebook. you're the it guy, can you help her? &gt;**me**: which kind of troubles? &gt;**friend**: she says the screen isn't working anymore, she went to a computer shop and they say she probably will have to change the screen. &gt;**me**: did they look carefully? sometimes it is not the screen but the little cable that connects the screen to the motherboard that is damaged &gt;*friend writes to mum* &gt;**friend**: wait, she says she put the videocard in the oven. &gt;**me**: she did what? &gt;**friend**: she disassembled the notebook and put the videocard in the oven &gt;**me**: which videocard?? her notebook does not have a dedicated videocard! and why the hell did she put something in the oven?!? &gt;**friend**: now she says some parts of the videocard are missing i choked on my mojito. edit: typos (thank you /u/mamatiger ) edit2: typos again! angie arrives in tech support and starts work. a few tech support underlings had moved her machine down the previous evening but, from what i had heard, she had had another chewing out session as she preferred her monitor on the left hand side as opposed to the right. ok, a simple mistake to make and one which is easily rectifiable - not without a lot of noise and assurance of stupidity. i did wonder why i found our resident work experience kid close to tears in the mensroom. i sat down and began my day. at 10:00, my first interaction with this hellhound was imminent. i was busy tapping out a response email to a remote worker about an excel problem and she beckoned me over. well - i say beckoned, she clicked her fingers and with an impertinent commanding tone, she scowled "you! come here!" thinking i couldn't possibly have had enough time to annoy the woman yet, i assumed this was just another vulgar display of power (sorry, been listening to pantera this morning). however, she then demanded i showed her how to access her email. now, i'm used to running it inductions and showing new users the jig, but someone who's been here for 10 years? hmmm. so, i managed to show her where outlook was amidst the utter blur of icons on her desktop, adorned with a background of her several pitbull terriers - figures! as outlook ungraciously churned into gear, she immediately snapped "why does it take so long?" ok, in fairness, this was taking ages! her disapproving sighs as i attempted to determine the cause was all the signal i needed to know that i really hadn't impressed the boss from hell. task manager showed outlook knocking on 97% cpu and the hard disk was going nuts. until i noticed that network packets had also rammed up. musting up the voice to break through the blackened icy air, i politely enquired "when is the last time you opened outlook?" this was met with a sharp stare and "don't be stupid. why would i ask you how to use it if i had been using it already?" after waiting several minutes, the cause eventually became clear. angie was presented with approximately 5 years worth of completely unread communiques - an unsettling amount of them marked urgent, or with subjects implicating fatal consequences had occured totally without her knowledge. as i said, angie had headed drug safety for a decade. in that time, she had never seen a single email, nor did it seem had she ever any cause to question why. and now she was in our realm - infecting our happy little team with a blackness mired with incompetence and only a tongue sharpened with the stones of hell to act as her only contribution.i'm the guy responsible for handling all the support calls in the morning. this morning i check the queue and see a ticket from a user saying the phone software has disappeared from his computer. at my work, we use a remote support program where we can direct the user to our help site, have them click our name and download a file, and it will let us remote in and fix their issues. i called the user and told him i would be happy to help. i said, "please open a web browser for me." he replies, "bruh, i'm gonna be completely honest with you. i don't mess with computers like that." so, i ended up having to send one of my techs out there, probably just to replace the desktop shortcut for the "missing" program. this happened about 10 minutes into my day, and i'm already fucking done. update- i called yesterday to try and talk to the night shift worker, but was told he would be working the day shift this morning. i'm going to call over there in a few minutes to make sure we fixed his issue, and see if he will let me remote in to check the logs. if he can't/won't do that, i'll just get the service tag from the machine and use it to look up the mac/ip address, and have one of the it engineering guys remote in (they don't need the user to let them in) and check for me.so in response to the last closing account [post]( someone in the comments said "[i hope you are the only isp in the area]( so i thought i would share this lovely story with you all. well as it happens, i am ceo of *** broadband. we are the only broadband provider in a large part of our rural coverage area. had a woman rent a house on a 6 month contract in a semi-rural lifestyle area 5 mins outside of the local suburbia - she moved in, everything was fine. then one day a storm went through the area. it took out the power lines and access to a hill where the transmitter tower was located which served her. she rang up the help desk and said her husband was missing out on work because they couldnt get the incoming phone calls. the tone of voice and attitude was unacceptable. the support rep apologised and said once the weather improves, one of our techs who was already on site will be able to get up on a quad bike with a generator and charge up the backup batteries. the power lines company managed to get the power back on at the bottom of the hill before he got up on the quad bike. a week later same thing happened and this time when she called she was much more abusive. i took over the call this time and politely informed her that due to the flooding, her husband wouldnt be able to get to work if he was called because the only bridge into the area was closed for safety reasons. this was preventing us from getting on site with our generator. she hurled more abuse at me so i said that if she speaks to me or any of my staff like that again i am cutting her off. it happened a third time - she accidentally unplugged her voip ata with the vaccuum cleaner. the notes on her account said if she is abusive to instantly hang up on her and cancel the account, so thats what the support rep did. she called me that afternoon, literally crying like a 6 year old trying to explain a booboo, because she was stuck in a contract on the house rental for another 5 months and couldnt move back into the city due to the cost of early termination of the house contract. i told her she had two warnings and "we dont have to put up with people like you" who cant appreciate how hard it is to do what we do. never heard from her again. edit: many of you are concerned about my lack of empathy or the fact i did not reinstate her connection when she called crying at the end. she didnt even try to say sorry - she was just trying to justify herself which i did not accept. it actually reminded me of a scene from southpark where cartman wants to be wined and dined. this just happened an hour ago and i couldn't resist sharing it with you all. ___ &gt;**user:** "hi, yeah, i'm having trouble signing into my email, do you know my password." &gt;**me:** "hi, who am i speaking with?" &gt;**user:** "oh, i'm **talldense&amp;amp;dumb** from *generic reality &amp;amp; co.*" &gt;**me:** "his, **talldense&amp;amp;dumb**, sorry, we don't keep your passwords listed. i can try to help out though. worst case, we can just reset the password." &gt;**td&amp;amp;d:** "okay this is what it says:" *reads out standard username/password field letter by letter, asterisks and all* &gt;**td&amp;amp;d:** ".... -star-star-star." &gt;**me:** "alright no problem, just enter in the password you use to log in." &gt;**td&amp;amp;d:** "well if i knew that, i wouldn't have a problem." &gt;**me:** "sorry, i mean the password you use to unlock the computer." &gt;**td&amp;amp;d:** "yeah, i know what you meant." &gt;**me:** "do you never lock your computer, or log out at all?" &gt;**td&amp;amp;d:** "no." *facepalm* &gt;**me:** "that's really insecure, i'd definitely recommend at least locking your computer when you leave the office, if not logging out completely." &gt;**td&amp;amp;d:** "what do you mean, you guys are supposed to handle the computer security." &gt;**me:** "well yeah, but that's like having 2 deadbolts and a combo lock on your front door, but always leaving it wide open." &gt;**td&amp;amp;d:** "oh, i got it now, forgot to capitalize. thanks!" &gt;**me:** "wai-" *click* &gt;"fuck." *headdesk.* **tl;dr: maybe you should turn off the neon sign above your computer reading "steal my data, it's free"** ___ checked his pc's up-time, the guy wasn't lying. edit: i work at an msp and this is one of our clients. i have no say on their group policy settings.. i could set them myself but that could also get me into trouble as that's not something i have the power to decide. but after verifying via the rmm that was not the case (which the ticket was submitted through mind you), jumping remotely onto 5 random unoccupied systems from the site and browsing, i called the user who filed the ticket. it went like this: me: hi there, this is guidoz and i received a trouble ticket that i need some more info on. it was stated that the internet was down, but all our tests indicate it is working correctly. can you be more specific? user: my web browser won't display pages. i've tried rebooting and refreshing. *i pop on user's system via remote* me: the fact that i can get to you this way is a good sign. let's take a peek. * i instinctively open up google and it comes up instantly. i do a quick search and hit a random, but safe, link. me: it appears to be up to me! is there a specific website you're having trouble with? user: yeah, umm. facebook. *user types in facebook and it fails to load.* me: that is likely an issue with facebook. it even says it has an issue on the screen. (facebook displayed a "something went wrong" message.) user: no, facebook can't be down. there must be something wrong with our systems. me: &amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232; *i do a twitter search for #facebookdown tag and show her a few hundred tweets in the last 10 minutes.* it appears to me facebook. give it a bit, it should come back up. user: do you mean i found a problem you can't fix? ha! i stumped you! me: mmhmm. buh-bye. [more comments]( (x-post from /r/sysadmin). edit: i love you all.1330 rolls around. angie is already sat in the stale meeting room waiting for me. obviously, given the events of the day before, i knew i had essentially caused this impromptu ticket review. to me there remained two choices. i could head in there, a subservient professional, plead for my sins and be managed. yep, be managed by angie. as she had already minced three of my colleagues into vegetative states, i realised this tactic was doomed. however, my heavy metal spirit prevailed; i took a cue from dee snider and instead presented myself as just me. the guy who will still smile and offer professionalism with a light hearted stance even in the face of a total bully. i walked into the meeting room brandishing a pint glass of red fruitjuice which i happily placed on the desk. i honestly don't think angie was expecting this one. i jovially sat down and acted like i was eager to go through any concerns she had with my tickets. she came straight out with it, "i want to know why you close the lowest amount of tickets out of everyone in the group? this isn't good enough, you are consistently the lowest score in every single stat i have!" my case revolved around the fact that we were never ruled by stats. ever. we maintained a low open-ticket count and concentrated on mentoring junior staff and leading by example. i was hired as a senior simply as a representation of my experience and it was not uncommon for me to accompany junior staff on their calls. as you can guess, as well as a frosty stare, this was met with a single-worded writeoff: "rubbish!" she sniped. she tyraded for another 10 minutes, scribbling all over her prints in red pen like a crap maths teacher and proceeded to throw me ticket after ticket and reasons why she wasn't happy. that's ok, i don't stop there. after she finishes her rant, i decide, i can play your game. i turn her stack of redenned paperwork over and begin to go through them in depth, one by one, to answer her concerns. "this ticket here, " i started, "you were unhappy as it took too long to resolve. i admit, three weeks is a little out there. however, this pc is running some bespoke medical software and as it happens will only run on windows nt. the department is not willing to shell out five figures on a new xp-compatible version so they asked us to source a replacement motherboard instead." now here's how i knew we had a rat. angie has no idea what nt is - or even a motherboard. however, her tyrade this time seemed more bitter and twisted. i was really stirring the hornets nest here! i insisted on moving on after "i can take your comments on board". i started into the next ticket. "this ticket resolved around a new vendor requiring set up of several oracle databases..." angie stopped me mid sentence. she reiterated bitterly my low call count; if i didn't shape up, she would have no option but to seek disciplinary steps. ok so i didn't win. but at least the playing field has been set. i don't back down, though i know i won't win. but at least now i know what her prize is. why, i don't know. she can't be after everyone's job, surely? that makes no sense. **epilogue** angie left for the day. i was alone watching a new hp laptop complete a windows install, ready to fine tune and install, later to sysprep. the balding head of it wandered over to ask what all the meetings were about today. i adopted happy-mode and shared my thoughts in as diplomatic a manner i could. i expressed how i was the lowest ticket closer and angie isn't happy about that. initially, balding head (bhit) tried to plecate me, asking how i could do better. blimey, i'd forgotten higher ups were meant to "help". however, he soon discovered my tickets for what they were; all mine were the complex issues. internal wifi dropouts, preparing master configs for different models of routers the sales reps had, troubleshooting legacy windows nt and msdos 8.3 systems... and then i landed everyone in it. compared to some others, it seems the bulk majority of calls assigned by people to themselves in the mornings were password resets.... i guess that's one way to boost your stats... ooops... did i just self-rat my team?so, as i'm typing this, it's a few minutes short of 4am. this happened a little under an hour ago. i'm family tech support, and sometimes school tech support. so, i'm sitting in my room playing kerbal space program and i here my phone ring. i recognize [the ringtone.]( it's either my mom, my sister or my former boss. never good news at this time in the morning. i look at it and see it's my mom. i find that disturbing because i know she's just on the other end of the house. me: it's 3am, what do you want, and why didn't you just come here? mom: i have a problem with my laptop. me: why didn't you just bring it to me? mom: that's the problem. whenever i unplug it, it dies. i knew this was coming. it's an ibm thinkpad t60. it's gonna die soon. me: okay, you know my fee. mom: okay. i just need the computer. me: i'll be there in a couple minutes. i establish a stable orbit and go down the hall. me: so, every time you unplug it, it dies? mom: yeh. me: you try turning it off and back on again? she gives me the death glare. mom: do you ever want to be able to eat again? me: do you ever want to use your computer again? mom: touche. me: you drop it lately? mom: no. me: knock it over? mom: no. me: you still leaving it on its side like i told you not to. mom: it doesn't hurt it. me: it's the cat that would hurt it. mom: well, i found it on its side the other day. i look at it. look at her. look at it. i turn it over, and jiggle the battery. me: should work. mom: what? me: it should work. mom: i don't believe you. me: double or nothing my fee it works. my fee for my mom is dinner out. mom: deal. i unplug it, it gives the cable unplugged beep and continues on its day. i stand up and walk out. me: i'll be collecting one of those tonight. she just grumbled under her breath. that took me 10 minutes and i got 2 dinners out out of it. edit: i typed this at 4am. i had a typo.our helpdesk usually consists of four staff and the supervisor. on this day they were less than half staffed and they were very busy. postroom calls them and asks it to collect a package, because postroom are shortstaffed and too busy to do a post run. it replies that no, sorry, we are also short staffed and cannot leave the phones unattended. some time passes. helpdesk get a call from reception. &gt;recep: the mouse isn't working! please come up urgently, we can't route calls! our naive pfy $juniortech leaves $seniortech to hold the fort alone, and hurries to another floor of the building. it's about as far away from it as you can get. reception and postroom have the same staff. you see where this is going. &gt;pfy: this mouse is working fine. &gt;recep: oh i know, we just wanted you to come and collect this package. what did reception really achieve that day? all front office tickets are now lower than lowest priority. tldr: oh we didn't really have any urgent post for you to collect, but can you please take this laptop to the front office for us? i've been *the computer guy* for many a year and have seen some weird stuff going on but this really takes the cake. some time back, i was engaged to provide some i.t. services to a user, $r. $r had a naim networked music player. for those not in the know, this is a music player that connects to media shares and streams music. what i could make out over the choppy call was that $r was having issues with his web browser. i arranged for a site visit since he had expended all the usual options - reinstalling java &amp; flash, trying different browsers (safari, firefox &amp; chrome). turns out $r was having issues with logging into the web interface of the naim. no matter what he tried, the login page would turn up blank. i gave it a try and \*waddayaknow\*, the login page loads up just fine. &gt;$r: "what did you do?" &gt;me: "i don't know but i think i have that effect on computers." &gt;$r: "yeah, i've seen this before. you computer guys seem to really strike the fear into computers and make them behave." with the problem solved, i left after setting up the new nas network shares for him on the naim. a week later, i receive another call from him - the issue has resurfaced. i try to run him through the usual troubleshooting options of clearing the cache et al. to no avail. &gt;$r: "hang on, lemme put you on speaker while i get at it." &gt;me: "sure. hey, you know what, i'm in the area so let me head down and take a look at your computer." &gt;r$: "what the?!?!" &gt;me: "what?" &gt;r$: "i think the imac heard you. it loaded up right when you said you were gonna come down." &gt;me: "ohhhhkayyyy. i'm glad i could be of help." &gt;r$: "listen, this is probably going to sound weird but i'll pay you $50 if you could whatsapp me your mugshot." &gt;me: "what?!" &gt;r$: "yeah, seems like this machine really fears you. i'm going to print your mugshot out, frame it, and hang it on the wall to put the fear into it." it's $50 for doing next to nothing so i did, and he did. i haven't heard from him in the last year and a half. tl;dr - some computers are sentient and fear *the computer guy*.**background** this happened about a year ago when i was a senior in high school. at the time, i was the webmaster intern for the school and my "boss" was the head of the business department. his friend was $boss from the local home realtor agency and needed somebody to revamp their website, seeing as it was very outdated. cue $me being hired as on-site tech support and webmaster. *2 months later on a monday* i busted a tire driving to the office so, after a lot of swearing, i put on the spare and call $boss to let him know i'll be late. while on phone, $boss lets me know that the network was down and that i need to fix it when i get in. the office was small, with only about 10 people actually staying on-site, so they use a old office grade router. &gt;**$me**: greets $boss and walk to server closet. &gt;checks back of router, see that the ethernet cable going to the network switch is undone. &gt;notice a lot of cables between the switches are missing. &gt;plug in cables and wait for traffic to resume through the switch. &gt;pack up and go to desk. &gt;**$boss**: so what was the problem? &gt;**$me**: there was just a *few* cables undone on the switch. &gt;**$boss**: oh, yea. i thought i looked messy last week so i got rid of a bunch that didn't seem to need to be there. *facepalms into oblivion* tldr: boss sucks and doesn't know how networking works. **edit:** holy crap this post blew up. i guess i'll write some more horror stories from my it experiences lol. thanks guys![previous]( as i stood in the car park surrounded by fellow employees i could hear the screams of the vp. today was not a good day for him. he was currently bellowing at the head of hr. &gt;vp: what do you mean everyone isn’t accounted for? &gt;hrhead: well. not everyone is assembled here. so we can’t give the all clear till we know we’ve got everyone. i hadn’t seen anyone from it yet. i kept looking. &gt;vp: its just a f&amp;%$ing drill! lets just go back inside. &gt;hrhead: sorry, how did you just speak to me? &gt;vp: i err… i took a seat on the ground, it was cold. winter was coming. &gt;hrhead: have you ever heard of a hostile workplace environment? &gt;vp: yes, and i’m sorry. it’s just a drill though. can’t we go back inside. &gt;hrhead: sure, do half a drill… that sounds reasonable. &gt;vp: fine, who the hell is missing? &gt;hrhead: i’ve no idea. can’t we get the heads of department to gather their own employees? the vp decided that was a good idea. everyone was cold, getting inside was my new goal. &gt;hrhead: airz! why are you sitting on the freezing ground? go find your department. &gt;me: i’m not feeling great… &gt;hrhead: you don’t look great, just go find your department then we can all get back inside. &gt;vp: airz, don’t leave my sight. i took a walk around the mass of employee’s the vp trailing my every step. i was too sick to call out. i couldn’t find any. not a single it person. about fifteen minutes passed, i still couldn’t find a single it person. the vp decided to shout at me. &gt;vp: where is your department? &gt;me: er…. &gt;vp: they better not be still inside. its getting close to an hour long drill. the vp called over his secretary. &gt;vp: hey vpsec, i think i know which employee’s are missing. we can’t find it. can you go check they aren’t still inside? &gt;vpsec: walk into a potentially burning building? i decided to sit on the ground again, it was freezing. &gt;vp: it's a drill. &gt;vpsec: a drill i take very seriously. the vp then spent the next half an hour arguing with various people in an attempt to get someone to go check it. eventually the cold got too much for the hr manager, and she sent the vp’s secretary to go check it. &gt;vp: so she goes in when you say to? &gt;headhr: hahaha…..yep. the vp didn’t look pleased at that. he looked pissed. about ten minutes later the vp’s secretary returned from it with all the it workers. &gt;vp: typical airz! it’s your department that took over two hours to get outside for a fire drill. you should be fired right now. i was sitting on the freezing asphalt, i didn’t care. i wanted to throw up. &gt;vpsec: actually the alarm wasn’t working down in it... &gt;headhr: no alarm in it. thats crazy, who’s the fire marshal? &gt;vp: urh.. i am. &gt;headhr: and you’re trying to fire someone who in a literal fire would have burnt from your negligence? have you learnt nothing from the current wrongful termination lawsuit? the vp was annoyed, but not insane. &gt;vp: i… i think that's everyone outside now. drill over. airz! come up to my office, it's time to continue our discussion. &gt;headhr: i think i’ll come too. we don’t want to get sued again. the vp smiled. his smile was wide. &gt;vp: yes, actually having hr in this meeting might be wise. i looked up from my seat on the ground, i wanted to say something witty. instead i just sat, waiting, cold, bored. [next](the it cupboard had transformed into a veritable hive of activity. boxes of laptops littered every available crevice in the it cupboard. some boxes contained freshly built machines, signified by their address labels, destined for their new homes. others lay brand new, yet to be called to command. our efforts were meticulously presided over by a flickery samsung monitor which recorded our every move in a single excel spreadsheet. names, addresses, serial numbers, asset tags - all required recording. despite the obvious pressure qbg and i were under, roland seemed content with doing the bare minimum. he took his position in the only seat left in the room. our demands for action seemed to go unnoticed as he idly fiddled with his phone, occasionally breaking his concentration to scroll up and down the excel sheet, his arm outstretched to reach an old mouse and keyboard we had rescued from a junk box for our purpose. roland indolently looked up his phone, "what one are you doing now?" qbg's response was evidently irate in tone as she read out the serial and asset numbers. roland duly tapped in qbg's response, barely even taking the effort to capitalize his text. the keyboard, old, yellowed and not even built with the windows keys, clacked loudly as he typed. roland's attempt to permanently affix himself to his throne and rule the roost had grown weary. after this exchange, while unwrapping a fresh laptop, i decided enough was enough. "roland!" i started. "if you're not going to help, could you kindly go back to support?" "i'm busy!" his snide response grated on me. as if to exemplify his uselessness, qbg dragged the keyboard away from towards her as she entered another row of data into the spreadsheet. her body language exuded bitterness towards roland's unyielding lethargy in a stereotypical way that only the female of the species can perfect. i knew how she felt, though! roland sat without a single reaction. he seemed to silently shrug off this display of discontent, as if it were of pure meaninglessness. for the next hour, we worked around roland uncomfortably, as if he were a cold and jagged heavy rock, inconveniently situated in the center of the room. we had expected angie's inevitable visit. her arrival intensified the high feeling in the cramped environment as we shuffled around box after box of dell laptops. she discussed our progress with roland loudly, taking great purpose to exclude mine or qbg's input. roland dutifully furnished angie with our present number; we had imaged, repacked and addressed just under 40 laptops. the fact is, angie could not bear to leave any situation without imposing her sense of authority; it just wasn't even in her vocabulary. angie especially liked imposing her authority onto qbg more than almost any other engineer. it was though qbg represented everything that angie was not to the letter. true to form, angie directed her attention towards qbg where she was loading a trolley of outbound boxes. angie's voice drowned out the whir of the imaging laptops and the groaning ghost server. "are these laptops supposed to be finished?" angie's loaded interrogation was not intended to garner any real information. qbg duly provided her response, knowing that angie had simply just opened her line of questioning to find fault. "these postage labels are entirely too small. you need to redo them all in a larger print!" this condescending request lashed qbg like a whip as she winced at the proposition. qbg declined angie's proposition, instead offering "we'll do the next ones bigger, these are fine as they are!" angie's insistence was delivered over a lambaste which seemed almost infinite as she constantly picked up more and more trivial matters of discontent. not enough tape; this box is slightly damaged; there are too many boxes on that trolley. angie, satisfied with her instruction, retreated back into the ether of the office. roland remained motionless on his pedestal, smugly smiling as he reclined back into the chair where he stayed for the next hour. 4pm slothed into view. roland donned his dark grey duffle coat, each popper irked us more and more as their echos disturbed our frustrated silence. he left for the day without saying a word, leaving qbg and me to continue our work. his departure was suffixed with our in depth symposium of the situation. as we offered one another further anecdote of why roland and angie both should be buried in shallow graves, we seemed to further agitate each other. "right, you know what..." i started, "this isn't happening another day. let's go see bhit!" our mercenary strut through the hallowed halls towards its seemed to gain in speed the closer we got; it was tantamount to a race to reach bhit. as he sat, blissfully unaware of the onslaught we were about to deliver, his balding reflected the ceiling light with a dull shine. qbg and i tag-teamed our way through our complaint as bhit listened. our frustrated accounts grew louder as we described in depth what the first day of builds had brought. we spilled the beans on roland, angie's micro-management and how the duo were jeopardizing our attempted rescue with their banality. bhit pondered our predicament as he noisily scratched the side of his unshaven head. he finally leaned forward and said, "ok, leave it with me. get back to work!" **previous** [pt1: a new world order]( ) [pt2: safety first]( [pt3: the it induction from hell]( [pt4: undercurrents]( [pt5: how to make friends and...]( [pt6: marking territories]( [pt7: one friday to rue them all]( [pt8: best laid plans]( [pt9: its one step for man]( [pt10: ...and one step back for its]( [pt11: bring home the solider]( [pt12: who needs minor victories...]( [pt13: dawn of a new nightmare]( [pt14: rules of engagement]( [pt15: bring out your dead]( [pt16: the greatest trick the devil ever pulled...]( [pt17: who's the king?]( [pt18: now that's what i call a sticky situation]( [pt19: throw the dice]( [previous]( f*&amp;% this. i didn’t want the vp’s threat to hang over my head. i grabbed a coffee and got to work. arriving back in my office, i looked online for a new job. the job market looked terrible. just like yesterday…. and the day before…. better to work with what you’ve got, coffee whispered to me. &gt;me: itsec, redcheer get in here. itsec still looked upset about screwing up, redcheer however had bounced back oddly she was smiling. &gt;me: i just got slammed over your mistakes. redcheer’s smile slid off her face. &gt;me: so consider this a warning. one more screw up and your gone. &gt;itsec: sorry boss. &gt;redcheer: yeah. sorry… boss?! i looked between the two of them, they both looked contrite. &gt;me: now i’ve got a job for both of you. go collect every spare box and piece of cardboard in this building. if you see any rubbish foil or, silvery wrapping take that too. &gt;itsec: where, would you like it boss? &gt;me: make a pile. i pointed to the middle of the it area and sat back in my chair as they left. that should keep them out of trouble. ***** about an hour later, a huge pile of cardboard was mounting in the middle of it. &gt;me: itsec, redcheer… you can stop now. i looked at the mountain before me. &gt;itsec: we had to argue with the cleaners to get it… apparently it was all meant to goto the recycling plant. so this weeks recycling quota will be down. &gt;me: recycling quota… we don’t have a recycling quota… you know what, never mind. anyway with this material i want you to make it costumes. redcheer and itsec looked confused. &gt;redcheer: it costumes? &gt;me: okay redcheer, itsec, you’re going to an it party. it is the theme. make costumes with that theme in mind. colourblind heard the words, redcheer and party and turned around. &gt;colourblind: party?! costumes? i’m great at that. i’ll help you design, redcheer. his look of excitement was odd. menial tasks to distract the two screw ups, and someone wants in? &gt;me: get back to work colourblind. redcheer **was** a designer, she can handle it. i walked away with a smile on my face. a thousand boxes and an it theme. how hard could it be. as i left the office, fairly late that night itsec and redcheer were arguing over comfort vs. style. i shook my head as i walked out the door. crazy amounts of effort was going into this. ***** then next day i walked into the conference room, that was meant to hold my it costume help session. both itsec and redcheer were already there, they looked tired. very tired. the costume pile behind them however looked oddly impressive. behind me the vp walked in the room. &gt;vp: airz. i’m looking forward to this. it was at this point he noticed the pile of costumes. he looked oddly impressed. i savored the look, until i realized he was carrying my coffee mug. &gt;me: wait. is that my mug? &gt;vp: oh, could be actually. i found it on my desk. the vp smiled as he took a long sip. &gt;vp: ahh, delicious tea. i’ll wash it, and get it back to you. the room slowly filled with people. the least hardworking members of the company. &gt;vp: we’re gathered here, to get some help from airz in regards to the it party being held this week. airz…. &gt;me: as you can see, i gestured over to the costume pile behind itsec and redcheer. &gt;me: we’re come up with a few ideas about costumes. however…. i paused for effect. and looked directly into the tired eyes of itsec and redcheer. &gt;me: there has been a miscommunication, and the party is it themed. however the dress code is…. smart casual. the vp looked oddly annoyed. he stood up, and spoke rather loudly. &gt;vp: are you sure?! &gt;me: i am the only one here **on** the organizing committee. anyway, back to work everyone and remember, smart casual for the party. people started shuffling out of the office, mumbling about how a supposed 2 hour meeting only took 10 minutes, and if they should take an extended lunch break to compensate. vp wandered out last. he looked at me dead in the eye. his hand loosened. the coffee cup fell. &gt;vp: ahh.. the coffee cup split tea all over the vp, and bounced off the floor. it however didn’t break. &gt;vp: f*%$ing thing. &gt;me: let me get that… i walked over and picked up the coffee cup off the floor whilst smiling at the vp. he however was already gone. redcheer and itsec looked wrecked. i took a look at the pile of costumes. &gt;me: nice work on the costumes, you two. i smiled as i walked out the door. coffee cup back in hand. [next]([previous]( &gt;redcheer: hey airz, small problem… redcheer paused and looked around. she spoke quite softly. &gt;redcheer: my student is a bit of a … perv. today he tripped and his hand fell on my bum. &gt;me: is it possible he just tripped? &gt;redcheer: yesterday he *fell* as well. two accidental falls in two days, both with hand… action. not likely. the red haired lady's face didn’t look pleased at all the groping that was going on. &gt;me: do you want me to have a word? &gt;redcheer: well i told him to stop. then just minutes ago he had another fall, this time onto my chest. i raised my hand to slap him so fast. the colour drained from my face. &gt;me: please don’t say you hit a child. &gt;redcheer: i realized just in time. however i think we should swap kids. mines a nightmare. speaking of… where is your kid? i told redcheer about what happened in hr. she laughed, and decided swapping still sounded fun. eventually i went over to where badshirt was sitting. &gt;me: hey badshirt, i’m working with you for the rest of the day. badshirt turned around, he was wearing a youwantit. t-shirt. he looked disappointed. i guided badshirt back to my office. he sat down on the chair opposite my desk. he started looking around the office. &gt;me: so badshirt what about it do you know? &gt;badshirt: nothing much. i thought you’d teach me stuff. i looked at the list of current tickets. nothing looked particularly nice. teaching time? &gt;me: okay what about it do you want to learn? &gt;badshirt: how do you hack someone? &gt;me: errr. hacking isn’t really a good idea. ever. badshirt finally looked interested, a spark in his eye ignited. &gt;badshirt: what if …. someone was blackmailing you with something and hacking was the only way to get them to stop? or… what if someone was trying to frame you for something and hacking was the only way to prove your innocence? &gt;me: haha interesting ideas. i can’t say teaching you hacking is a good idea though. &gt;badshirt: so… you do know how to hack! badshirt started smiling and leaning back slightly in his chair. he looked oddly happy. &gt;me: err… okay, lets do some work now, yeah? &gt;badshirt: sure thing! badshirt bounced off the chair excitedly and ran around my desk to look at the computer. ticket queue was still displayed. &gt;badshirt: lets do… that one. badshirt pointed to a ticket from the marketing department, from sassy. (a lady who i'd dealt with in the past) &gt;me: lets… avoid her. &gt;badshirt: no i picked that ticket cause of her nice name. come on. lets go. badshirt seemed so keen on working finally. so i decided to just go along with it. ***** sassy sat at her desk cross armed when badshirt and i arrived. her face fell to a frown when she saw me. &gt;sassy: oh. its you. &gt;badshirt: how can we help madam? badshirt was giving sassy the broadest smile he could. she was taken aback by the friendliness. &gt;sassy: my mouse isn’t working, its a new one that came with this… computer. sassy said the word computer with disdain dripping from her words. badshirt jumped at pc trying to get the mouse working. &gt;sassy: the mouse hasn’t been working ever since i got the new computer. it’s really slowed my productivity. my manager won’t let me leave today until its sorted out. &gt;badshirt: mmm, its not responding at all. badshirt flipped the mouse over, as i looked up at the clock. it was only 10am! &gt;badshirt: the red light isn’t on! probably something to do with the batteries. &gt;sassy: it’s a new mouse. it came with new batteries, they’re less then a week old. are you telling me this mouse chews through batteries in less then a week? badshirt pried open the battery cover. &gt;badshirt: these batteries are wrapped in plastic! &gt;sassy: is it fixed now? badshirt unwrapped the batteries and the mouse started working perfectly. he smiled at the good result. sassy however was beaming. &gt;sassy: you’re awesome kid! she gave badshirt a hug, then loudly proclaimed to the room. &gt;sassy: *woooo* computer is fixed. home time! sassy got up from her desk and started walking out the door. i saw her manager run out from his office to intercept her, however didn’t get to see what happened as badshirt started talking. &gt;badshirt: that was fun. &gt;me: mmmm. yep. as we walked back down to it i noticed badshirt was still blushing from the hug. &gt;me: haha badshirt, looks like you’re in love… i waited for the bashful reply “no” reply. chuckling slightly to myself. &gt;badshirt: i think i am. sassy needs me. oh god. ***** go [here]( for something awesome by /u/wizbam :) [next](names redacted to protect the innocent, and guilty. it all started with a phone call. "the whole network at [customer redacted] is down and they have no power - they need your help." my blood ran cold. the engineer calling me sounded panicked, and for good reason. [customer redacted] has an enormous natural gas facility in south texas, too far from civilization to get enough power off of the grid. we designed and built an onsite natural gas power plant for them - a big one, capable of supplying 40+mw of power at peak load. they could run the facility for a short while without the power plant, but not long - and shutting down the facility meant losing 7 figures per hour. by the time i was informed, they had 6 hours until they had to shut down. as the guy who had designed and installed said network, i was naturally the guy to call when it had problems, which had never happened before. it was a pretty simple network, honestly - just switches, cat5 cables and fiber. since this was the network all the plcs, relays, meters and whatnot ran on, it was airgapped &amp; isolated, no routers. not much to go wrong. i quickly get on the phone and walk the guy on their end through plugging in a laptop and running some simple tests. check lights on things, ping this, ping that. everything seems good, though. the network is emphatically not down. so i send him a remote app and take control of his laptop to see for myself. log into switches, check things, nope, the network's not down. when i log into the hmi system, though, i see a big red error message: "network error: cannot connect to database". the database server is up, though. i log into the database server (windows server 2012 running mssql) and that's where i find the problem: sql isn't running. i try to start it and it immediately shuts back off. now this is very bad for a couple of reasons. this server provides databases for a couple of very critical things in this plant. included are the plc systems, which explains why the plant shut down - the plcs weren't running and the monitoring system had shut down the turbines. additionally, this was not a problem with the network, this was a problem with a server, and we had subbed out the systems work to [plc contractor], so i had no idea how all this was supposed to function and no documentation on it. i'm flying blind here. a couple of phone calls later i find out that [plc contractor] had subbed out procurement and set up of the server to [incompetent morons], who was on vacation. [plc contractor] doesn't want to touch it, tells me to call [incompetent morons]. woohoo. 4 hours to shutdown and this has now become my multi-million dollar problem. back at the database server i start digging to find out why sql won't start. it didn't take me very long to find the problem: "invalid license data. reinstall is required." turns out that [incompetent morons] had bought the appropriate licenses for sql 2012, but never bothered to retrieve or use the license key. the plant had been running on a trial install of sql this entire time, and went down because the trial period ended. i wish, i really wish i was making this up, but i am not. of course, i can't do anything to jeopardize the integrity of the database, including reinstalling, and i don't have the license key. the next hour or so consisted of lots of angry phone calls until someone at [plc contractor] finally dug up the documentation from the purchase, and the hour after that consisted of, roughly: 1) impersonate the ceo of an energy company ([incompetent morons] put him down, personally, on all the microsoft paperwork), to get into the msdn account [incompetent morons] had inexplicably set up in his name. 2) find out that ms does not just give you a license key anyway, it's embedded in the install disk. which means that [incompetent morons] actually bought sql and then proceeded to set it up using a trial copy. 3) sweat bullets waiting for the install disk to download. 4) extract license key from install disk. 5) use procedure i discovered using the powers of google to update the license information without reinstalling. 6) reboot everything, sweat more bullets. after the database server was again serving databases, the plc came back online and the techs were able to restart the turbines. we avoided shutdown by about 30 minutes. i took the rest of the day off. edit: vlsc, not msdn. i had a brain fart there.so i work in tech support for [insert big computer manufacturer brand name here], more specifically for their big business customers. which means that more often than not, systems have either same day or next day onsite support when it comes to critical hardware failure. this one lazy thursday i was minding my own business at work, probably browsing tfts, when one of my coworker currently on vacation, messages me over fb. more specifically, he was still in the plane to his holiday destination : (cw : my coworker, he kinda looks like a skater or hipster, important to the story) cw : "lol this dude sitting next to me in the plane has the new [insert brand new ultrabook model here], but can't seem to get it past the bios splash screen" quite unfortunate, but not something we've never seen before. most of the time it's because of a bad bios or bad motherboard. in the end, the same part. me at work to my cw: "ok, ask him for his serial number and contact information, and i can book service for him directly, so that we can get his system up and running before the weekend". in my mind i'm thinking "if this isn't the best customer service in the world, then i don't know anymore." so my cw asks the frustrated user for his serial number and explains to him that he works for the company and that that way we might get it fixed shortly after the plane lands already. the users reply to that ? "[big computer manufacturer] would never hire a kid like you, they have professional men working in their departments. i don't believe you really work for them" flabbergasted by his comment, my cw didn't reply back and told me to drop it, all while the user packed his faulty system back in his bag in great frustration. we were the heroes he needed, but not the one he deserved in the end. so, i'll keep this short as i'm at work... but this really teared me up earlier. i work for a company that manages networks for many different companies and businesses in our area. i was on a service call, working away on one of the servers when one of the custodians approached me. the custodian looked to be about 55 years old or so... me: "can i help you?" custodian: "yeah, um... i have a laptop here that i brought from home. it's been having issues, and won't start at all." me: "okay, can i look at it?" i usually don't do stuff on the side, but i figured it wouldn't hurt to help. custodian: "well, i know you're busy. are you sure you can?" me: "'course, just bring it here i'll see what i can do." about ten minutes later he shows up with a pretty new hp laptop. he tells me he just purchased the laptop about a year ago, and the warranty was expired so he didn't know what to do. he then tells me he brought the laptop to a local computer shop and they said the motherboard was fried, so he'd be better off purchasing a new laptop. i tell him just let me look at it and he says he's going to finish a job, and to let him know when i was done. so, out of interest i boot the laptop up. it shows bios screen, beeps, then restarts... over and over. hmm... i turn it over and open up his ram cover. i take out both sticks and put one back in, trying each on individually to test them. lo and behold, one of the ram sticks is bad and the computer boots fine with the second one i try. i actually had just ordered new ram for my own laptop, and had the old ones in my car. i run out to the car and grab them, and install them as well. boots up fine, with two more gb's of ram mind you. custodian comes back and i tell him what i did, and let him know i put in two sticks of ram and he need not worry about it. the look on his face was stricken... he looked taken aback, and i'm not sure why. he then tells me he's been using skype to chat with his son who is in the military and his grandson from across the country, and would never have been able to afford a new laptop to continue the chats. he looked like he was going to hug me, and had tears in his eyes when i let him know the computer was fine and i wouldn't be charging him. it's like he never knew kindness from another human. his voice was even a little choked up... i hate seeing grown men cry, cause i can't help but feel choked up as well. either way, i sent him on his way and told him to let me know if any issues come up. makes me happy to be in this job... tl;dr: helped older man with laptop that was deemed "dead to world", bout made me cry when he told me what he used it for.&gt; /u/bytewave: "senior line, this is bytewave, you may assign me your tic..." i hear loud barking and someone screaming obscenities in the background. in addition to answering frontline calls for assistance, road techs can also call us sometimes. they're instructed to call frontline for basic questions but that they have our line for 'emergencies'. someone took that a little too literally that day. &gt; desperate subcontractor: "yeah, hey, i'm stuck up a ladder here. i'm here to disconnect non-authorized potentials! a guy is batshit crazy, he doesn't have a gun but his two huge dogs are down there! i'm scared, man!" thing is, they don't have a direct number to reach us. they go through the call queue like any frontline agent... &gt; /u/bytewave: "okay, i assume you already called 911..." ... i check the phone system - this guy waited *153 seconds to talk to me* up his ladder sweating, not counting the time spent in the menus. &gt; desperate subcontractor: "uhh, no, not yet, but you're the emergency line right?" oh my f****** gawd. i'm just speechless. &gt; /u/bytewave: "yeah, for technical emergencies. but let me help you out here." i pull his geodata as i conference him to a third line where i dial 911. &gt; 911 operator: "911, what is the nature of your emergency?" &gt; /u/bytewave: "i'm calling on behalf of a road technician working for telco.ca current trapped up a ladder, actively threatened by a man and two large dogs. as you can hear in the background, we're conferenced-in to his blackberry. address is 1234 main street, he is working on our pmd up there, in the backyard of a 16 units apartment building - clear access on both sides according to plans, wider on east side's parking lot. please note that the building is in a school zone since we are in school hours." &gt; desperate subcontractor: "uhh yeah - i could really use some help here!" screaming and barking continues. &gt; 911 operator: "thank you for the details. we have a patrol on the way, i will stay with you sir... not sure why we need a third party, i'll take it from here." &gt; /u/bytewave: "believe me, third party doesn't know either. i'm leaving you two on, i'm sure everything will be okay." *... i couldn't resist ...* "thank you for choosing senior line for your life-threatening emergency." *hang up* and i end it, leaving them both connected. *obviously* i monitored his service call's completion to read the resolution details. it read; "job complete but 911 intervention necessary. contact supervisor for details." thank god the angry customer with pirated analog didn't have a gun. seriously, if they ever give you an in house line and tell you it's for "emergencies"... *they don't mean this kind*. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](short feel good story for a monday afternoon as i continue to dump old stories from my former career in university av support. i get an email from $faculty, way older and super nice guy who despite how smart he is really should have retired quite some time ago. he tells me that he's having trouble getting a powerpoint of one of his lectures to open. i help people plug in their flash drives and hit f5 so naturally i'm the powerpoint expert to everyone, not our it help desk. i go through a few steps "what version of powerpoint are you using? is the file extension .ppt or .pptx? did you enable a read only permission on the file?..." instead of an email i get a confused phone call back that doesn't yield any results. he can't really even explain what the file is doing when he tries to open it. so like i said, he's a nice guy, very few faculty are so i offer to go to his office on the other side of campus to take a look. get to his office. try to open the file (i believe he was using a macbook) and get an error that it can't find a program to open the file with. okay, this i can work with. check to make sure powerpoint is actually installed. then i take a closer look at the finder window. there's the file **lecture_7.ppt...** hang on, what's this ellipsis doing there? all the other file names in the folder just end at .ppt i drag the divider bar over and reveal the remainder of the file name **lecture_7.ppthello timothy i'm sorry to have to do this in an email but you havent answered any of our phonecalls your mother and i feel its time you finally gave up this charade and came home...** i'm paraphrasing the actual contents but he had somehow pasted a disapproving letter to his son after the file extension. what was he doing editing the file extension with a very personal email copied in his clipboard? we'll never know. quickly deleted it before he realized just what he did, replaced it with a .ppt and it worked. $faculty was thrilled despite not actually realizing what happened. unless i'm mistaken there is no known file association for fatherly disappointment. i work for a multinational manufacturing company, and while most of our technology is up-to-date and changed out frequently, we have no need or desire to be *bleeding edge*. as such, we tend to hang back a bit after big updates, and wait for our various groups to thoroughly test the new update or os before doing a large scale roll-out. when the new ios 8 came out recently, we decided it would be a good idea not to upgrade everything overnight, because we don't know how a new ios will work with our other systems on the corporate iphones. for example, our mobile security program is specifically intended for ios 7.1.2. because of this, we sent out an email when ios 8 became available, saying: &gt; tomorrow, september 17th, apple will release the latest version of ios, the operating system for iphones and ipads. *our group* requires some time to test and certify ios 8 with our systems. &gt; &gt; **please do not upgrade any apple device until we have sent an updated communication and instructions.** (emphasis was in the original email as well) &gt; &gt; thank you, later that day, i got a call from someone who said his iphone wouldn't send or receive email. he said "i got that email from you guys that said to update to ios 8, i did, and now it doesn't work anymore!" i asked him to check the email again, and read it closely. "oh..." i really wanted to say "you did the thing! you did the very thing we said not to do! and you did it because we said not to do it!" but i did not, because i'm nice. unfortunately there wasn't anything i could do for him except send it to our ios guy as a test case for how to fix a problem like that.as a woman in tech support, often times you find yourself in unpleasant positions. there are some people who can't wrap their heads around the fact that in offices these days, there are things that are no longer acceptable. for the guy in his sixties who seems lost in the culture time forgot, the idea of a woman shouting down the phone to a manufacturer about the 3 centimetre fault in the custom made new server rack that we ordered is almost too tempting. such an individual will respond loudly with "and what would you know about good racks, flaticus!" we had one of those here. he was a senior administrator in the department that deals with procurement and we know him as mr touchy. now, mr touchy has no concept of personal space. no idea about inappropriate jokes and he frequently likes to give what we dub 'the reverse bear hug'. we call it this because he comes up behind you and will wrap his arms around you, pinning your hands to your sides. he's been in hr more times than i think the hr people have. it's like his second home. however, he's the younger, idiot brother of ceo and in his contract is a nice little handshake should he ever leave or be fired. every single human being in this building seems to hate him. a cleaner once told me that she would wipe neat solutions of various corrosive cleaning agents on the toilet seat in his office ensuite. just because she knew that the stuff would give you a rash unlike anything else if it contacted unprotected skin. thankfully, he's not down here very often, and the last time he was in my neck of the woods an improperly fitted toner cartridge had explosively leaked toner from my nose down and i was avoided to such an extent i'm surprised that they didn't give me a bell to ring as i wandered round. on the fateful day in question, we had a client onsite, one of the junior network admins who was down to talk about an upgrade to their current setup. they wanted to come in and have a look at some of the higher spec machines we'd be supplying to them, considering we were using them ourselves. for once the sales people were on the ball and decided that it might be able to answer some of their more technical questions about upgrading. absolutely no problem. so ms cleverclient was down with us having coffee while we drew up the details we had on file for her and the main hiccups we'd expect with changing out the machines with her setup. it so happened that on this day mr touchy was down our way to argue with big boss about an order we'd put in with procurement to purchase some extra licenses for the floor planning software the sales team used. he wasn't aware we had a client on site and with looks of horror dawning on the faces of those who spotted him, he grabbed ms cleverclient from behind in one of his 'hugs'. all us women look the same it would seem. to which he received a headbutt which broke his nose, and an elbow to the ribs which cracked one of his floaters. she then asked calmly if we could call the police. which we did immediately. mr touchy, unfortunately, was released with a caution. since our client chose to drop the charges in exchange for an 80% discount on her purchases. the details of which weren't clear at the time. mr touchy was released from the company within two weeks, and the hundred thousand handshake? well, it turns out he never got it. it was absorbed to cover the practically free equipment we gave to ms cleverclient; some clause about damages to the company in his contract. smoothing over something like assault is pretty costly it seems. ms cleverclient was one of the instructors down at the local women's self-defence group. tldr; go figure, karma exists. [previous]( as i walked towards bigp’s office i clutched notie’s papers in my hands. i tossed up the decision in my head, it seemed so obvious. the vp followed me into bigp’s office and stood staring at me. &gt;bigp: ahhh, so quick. the vp’s already told me he likes redcheer. &gt;vp: but the voting comes down to you… the vp and bigp looked at me expectantly. the choice started clouding my mind. &gt;bigp: so who’ve you decided? who had i decided? the coffee in my hand told me to go for it. &gt;me: we have to go with notie. he’s too qualified to let walk. the bigp’s face fell, he looked rather shell shocked. &gt;bigp: wha.. .. but.. ? &gt;me: he’s more qualified, he’ll be an asset to the company. the vp’s face broadened into a smile. &gt;bigp: i’ve actually.. &gt;vp: he’s already hired redcheer. the vp was smiling insanely at this point. &gt;me: …. but, you said it was my choice? the vp took my shoulder and walked me out the door, after leaving the office the vp turned to talk. &gt;vp: oh, airz. bad choice. &gt;me: but… he was your candidate. the vp gave me a sadistic smile and walked off. i looked back into bigp’s office, the bigp gave me a wave to come back into his office. i took a sip of my coffee. tasted like courage. i walked back into the bigp’s office. &gt;bigp: you look, …. angry? &gt;me: you hired someone, without even waiting for my opinion? bigp looked resigned. &gt;bigp: didn’t you like redcheer? carefree told me you got on famously. &gt;me: well she’s a nice lady, but she’s basically an it intern. &gt;bigp: i’m sure you can train her up. plus, free employee. win for you whoever we hire. is it still a win if you don’t get who you want? i wondered as i walked away. [next]([previous]( as the vp and i walked towards the bigp’s office i wondered why all big decisions at this company had to made so quickly. odd. actually, screw it. i’m not basing this decision on guess work. &gt;me: hey, vp you go on ahead i just gotta check up on something. &gt;vp: okay, i’ll be in bigp's come tell us when you’ve made up your mind. we’ll go tell the bigp your decision. the vp waved me off with a smile on his face, weird. i looked down at notie’s cv/resume in my hand. something at the very bottom caught my eye. two numbers. i can’t believe my luck, he listed references. i picked up the phone. i wanted to see what other people have to say about notie. &gt;*first reference* - co-worker at notie’s ex- employer. &gt;me: hello, this is airz calling about notie, who recently had an interview with us. the voice that replied was deep, and loud. i think he was shouting into the phone. &gt;vloud: oh! notie. he got an interview then? &gt;me: er.. yeah. i was just wondering, what he was like as a coworker. vloud’s tone went much softer, basically whispering. &gt;vloud: s*$#. oh, not a great start. vloud had paused, as if considering his options. &gt;vloud: i was hoping he would come back. he’s the only one here that knows everything. he pretty much holds this place together. &gt;me: sorry, come back? did… he leave? vloud started whispering even softer. i could hardly hear him at this point. &gt;vloud: our f&amp;#$ing boss threw him out. what my idiot boss didn’t realise is he was the only one that knew about half the stuff here. we’re literally one screw up away from having to hire someone very expensive. son of a b*^%$ boss doesn’t realise how much replacing notie is going to cost. &gt;me: so, he’s competent? &gt;vloud: f@#$ing-a he’s competent. he’s a pretty cool guy to work with too, after you get used to his sense of humour. i grabbed a pen off the desk in front of me and started clicking it, i was getting nervous. &gt;me: anything else, i should know about notie? &gt;vloud: er… if you’re serious about hiring him? don’t make him mad. &gt;me: wha… er.. what happens if you make him mad? &gt;vloud: oh. ummm. nothing. i just… er. he’s just a really good candidate. i looked at the pen in my hand, i wrote **angry?** down on the paper in front of me. &gt;me: i see. &gt;vloud: c$#p okay, look pretend i didn’t say anything. i just said it because i want him back here. i wasn’t thinking. it was a stupid thing to say. i started clicking my pen again. nervousness had just increased by a factor of two. &gt;vloud: oh darn it! i hear clicking. that better not be hard drive failure! as i opened my mouth to tell him it was my pen, i heard a crash on the other end of the phone. &gt;vloud: okay … not great. i have an emergency over here. umm.. hire notie, he’s a great guy who deserves a good job, without a f*%$ing retarded upper management. vloud's voice was barely even audible. he was speaking so softly *click* vloud had hung up the phone. [next](my job is to get the "product" the "company" makes connected to the internet. one day i had someone call in. &gt;user: my "product" won't connect to the internet. i want to use it to use "internet service". &gt;me: ok i can help you out with that. who is your isp? &gt;user: what is an isp? this isn't usually a bad sign as a lot of ppl that call don't know this information. &gt;me: you know the company you pay to get internet service? here are some examples "list of isp examples" &gt;user: no i don't have the money for those monthly fees. i just bought a router. that will give me free wifi. at this point i face palm so hard my coworkers were concerned i might have a concussion. it left a red mark on my forehead. after a few minutes of silence. &gt;me: sir...that is not how routers work. you need to first pay an isp to get internet service. a router by itself will not give you free wifi. &gt;user: you're lying to me. the person at the store said if i got this i can connect "product" online. i demand to speak to your supervisor. &gt;me: ok transferring you now...but he's just going to tell you the exact same thing... an hour later, at the end of my shift, my supervisor comes to my desk sporting a nice red mark on his forehead that matched mine. &gt;supervisor: i just spent 45 minutes trying to convince user that a router doesn't provide free wifi without paying for access to the internet. he still doesn't believe me. i gave up and just hung up on him. let's go get a drink...i really need it after that.... edit: concussion not concision. my head hurts leave me alone. the following morning, i waited at my desk, primed for a showdown with angie. roland sneered and snorted loudly as he worked on some inscrutable task. angie, fresh starbucks cup in hand, barely made eye contact as she approached the its area. my opportunity to loudly demand satisfaction was at hand. as she placed her cup on the desk, i armed myself with a copy of her project plan. i stood up to metaphorically remove my glove to slap angie’s face with it. just as i began talking, i was stopped in my tracks as angie barked into gear. her scoff trampled my incursion with a strident whine, “why hasn’t hr tank’s machine been replaced?” she demanded. i defended with “there’s nothing wrong with her machine at all, it’s barely a year old and is one of the highest spec machines we have deployed! anyway, i…” angie dismissed my petition with a stony faced ultimatum. “i want that machine replaced before you go to lunch today! reopen that ticket and get it done!” still brandishing angie’s project document, she retrieved her cup and stormed towards the lair located somewhere beyond the dimly lit corridor which had seen many an engineer walk to their deaths. i was left immobile, the duel won before i had even drawn my weapon. the emptiness of bhit’s desk offered no sanctuary in this moment. i left the project plan on my desk, skulking away towards the it cupboard to furnish hr tank with a new optiplex. after enduring yet another hour-long session of unintelligent questions, garbled, half chewed up and spat back out by the hr tank, i escaped her deskside with her old machine and yet another list of demands she felt inhibited her capacity to perform as she otherwise would. at the top of the list, she required a colour printer placed near her desk. i guess having to walk half way across the floor to the communal printer may have burned vital calories necessary to plug the real-estate offered by her 80-inch wide trousers. in reality, i was aware through the rumour mill that an apprentice she had appointed in the guise of being mentored in all manner of hr and legal duties had left some weeks prior citing the need for an actual career. hr tank had instead used her as a dogsbody to fetch printer output, deliver files to various unsuspecting recipients and, on the way back from such voyages, procure various canteen supplies for her. this morning’s diversion of angie’s insistence became all too clear. bhit had finally gotten word of what had happened last night – most likely the tip off was my email sent to him just prior to my leaving which complained vehemently about angie’s actions. it seemed he had grown an impromptu pair of balls and demanded angie’s explanation via email – which of course angie was all too eager to give! remember, this power woman had a lifetime’s experience of deviously plotting her rise to the top! attached to angie’s response was yet a new project plan, now detailing my newfound responsibilities as technical delivery engineer. what’s more, the handover of machines would no-longer be carried out at the conference; instead all machines would ship next week directly to their recipients. this lunacy has been given the eager thumbs up by all middle management who welcomed the fact that angie would deliver the project apparently ahead of time. opening the pdf, i scaled down to the procurement section only to validate what i fully expected to see anyway. against the parchment-coloured background of the branded company document, my 50-at-a-time proposal had been replaced by a single line, “252 machines to be ordered from dell”. the statement, rubber stamped by all and necessary, seemed to vindicate angie completely. the ball, it seemed, had bounced clandestinely into my back yard. bhit rushed to my desk. i knew what he was going to ask before he’d even asked it. even though roland, angie’s eyes and ears, sat in close proximity, i let my true feelings known to bhit. “so, you’re telling me there is one week to image 250 odd machines? so, in reality, that’s 50 machines per day?” bhit nodded, hoping i would concede and provide some magical way out of this new found emergency. “this is stupid! whoever planned this needs their ass handed to them!” my claim had now garnered the attention of the rest of its; no longer were their eyes transfixed on their screens, scared to move. they were intently watching the spectacle as it unfolded in front of them. i turned to roland, demanding “are the images even ready?” roland’s familiar ratty vocal snare simply retorted with a shrug, “the images are ready whenever you want them!” angie returned to its and immediately interjected my exchange with roland, as if something deep inside her had fired up and manifested into some sort of primal trait of a mother defending its young. she started, “you told me it would take a week for the laptops to be imaged!” her obviously incorrect statement seemed a purposeful twist of words on my initial claim. “no! i said that each batch of 50 would take a week to build and qa!” refuting my claims, angie’s stern voice still sought to overshadow any offering of reality. delving deep into her pdf, i demanded “why are we now couriering the laptops out? why aren’t we delivering at the conference as planned? what about the 50 or so that are staying in the field that only need reimaging?” i felt confident - for once i felt that bhit had my back, albeit ever so slightly blunted by how easy he had historically caved in. angie’s abrupt answer seemed to be the line she had used to sell her project amendment with, “i will not disrupt an entire conference just to give out laptops! it is better to present the face of it by offering a support drop-in service as people need it instead of disrupting an entire event!” there was no way we could now argue this round now. angie had landed us in it. she had played her cards, now it was an all-or-nothing game of seeing where the chips would fall. bhit was powerless to do anything other than hope for a magic-wand solution. angie was golden in the eyes of the upper management who had rubber stamped her new proposals all the way. there was only one card left to play. i hadn’t expected things to go off to this magnitude – i was inexperienced in this sort of corporate espionage. if i failed to deliver 250 built laptops, angie could easily pass the buck down, my name made synonymous with total disaster! if i delivered 250 built laptops, angie would get the glory and i would remain a nameless entity. for me, neutrality or bust! for angie, glory or neutrality! “i dunno how we’re going to do this…” i said rising from my chair. leading the procession, qbg followed closely behind me as roland wheeled the ghost server towards the it cupboard. bhit watched us disappear; hoping we would indeed find this desperately needed magic wand!

(all names have been changed to protect the incompetent). i used to work in a service-desk/triage capacity (lovingly dubbed tier 1.9) where we would monitor, ticket, troubleshoot, and escalate as needed (we were expected to have a 90% self-solution return). one thing that we never were allowed to touch was network issues. our area telcom team had lost their extremely competent team lead some 18 months earlier and their team had quickly degraded to people who didn't really seem to care about their job. they were also secure in the fact that the telcom system had degraded enough to be sufficiently obfuscated enough where it would take considerable resources to figure it out by a competent replacement. this made them act like they were untouchable. as such, i had learned fast to start recording my phone calls to them (thank you google voice!) so they couldn't pin anything on us. anyway, one day around 6pm the network dropped out. as such, i called the telcom on-call. **me leaving voicemail:** hi, this is craysh from tier 1.9. it looks like the network is having issues again. internet, communicator, and email are all unresponsive. all three webfarms are unavailable. trace route to the gateway has failed. ticket is unavailable as the ticketing system is inaccessable due to the issue. please call back to confirm your taking ownership of the incident. 15 minutes go by and sop dictates that i call back before escalating to their manager. the on-call answers. **tech:** on-call phone, this is steve **me:** hi steve, have you gotten my voicemail? we're having issues with the network. **tech:** no, i haven't. tell me what's wrong. **me:** repeats what i said above. **tech:** ok. wait 20 minutes and try again. *click* i had assumed that by 'wait 20 minutes' he meant that he was taking a look at it and that it should be back up in 20 minutes. 20 minutes go by and the network is still having issues (the network has now been down for the last 40 minutes or so) i call the on-call phone again. no answer. **me leaving voicemail:** hi, this is craysh again. the issue is still ongoing. please call me back as soon as possible. 15 minutes go by so it's time to call again. no answer. time to call the acting supervisor. **supervisor:** this is aaron **me:** hi aaron, this is craysh from tier 1.9. we are having issues with the network and the on-call has stopped answering their phone. **supervisor:** stopped? you mean they initially answered? **me:** yes, he said to wait 20 minutes. **supervisor:** ok, he's probably working on it. call me back in an hour if the issue persists. *click* at this point i'm calling my supervisor and apprising him of the situation. for the next hour, i continue to call the on-call every 15 minutes (as is procedure). no answer. i call the supervisor again **supervisor:** this is aaron **me:** hi aaron, this is craysh from tier 1.9 again. we are still having issues with the network and the on-call still has not answered his phone. **supervisor:** ok, i'll take a look at it. turns out that telcom had pushed a policy to the junipers that had scrubbed the white lists (completely blocking all access to all ports). all in all it took 5 hours to get everything back up and running. i documented the ticket extremely thoroughly once the system was available again. the next day came the fall-out. telcom was claiming that i had never paged them, and they said that a customer ended calling the supervisor to find out what was going on. they even showed zero calls on their cellphone (they had removed the calls and messages). as such, we had a meeting to 'discuss tier 1.9's failure to report a severe incident'. i walked into the room filled with extremely pissed off big wigs, including aaron and and steve. they demanded why i hadn't contacted the on-call, and i stated that i had and that they had lead me to believe that they had been working on the issue. nobody believed me because "the on-call phone didn't have any messages or call logs from tier 1.9" their excuse for having a completely empty call log was that they cleared it daily so they could keep track of the calls made on the phone. i calmly walked to the overhead projector, logged into google voice, and played each consecutive voicemail/conversation. they no longer work here, and i've had three promotions since. ----------------- **edit:** someone expressed an interest for the actual meeting. here goes: i was working the 2-10 shift at the time and i had stayed an hour and a half late to 'own the incident. a little after 8am i'm woken up to be informed that there is a meeting i need to be at for 9am concerning the 'issues that tier 1.9 had alerting proper individuals in a high visibility incident'. running on 3 hours of sleep (i usually went to bed around 5am and got up at 1pm) i figured "great! it's about time telcom got reamed for never answering their on-call phone!" when i walked in to the meeting i pretty much knew that the telcom guys had decided to screw me. they wouldn't look me in the eye (alarm bell one). we sat there while management had a little pow-wow before hand outside the meeting room (including the acting supervisor for telcom) and i heard phrases like 'separation procedures' (obvious alarm bell two as i knew that they would not get rid of any telcom guys as of that point). my supervisor was not a part of this meeting, he was sitting next to me (alarm bell number three, and he was pretty sure that they were planning on letting him go too). they came in the room and sat down quietly. they asked my supervisor if he had been apprised of the situation last night and responded in the affirmative. we went over the procedure that i had followed, and my supervisor acknowledged that i had called him and told him of the situation. they then asked telcom their version of events. they essentially said that i had never called the on-call phone and that the supervisor had been contacted by a customer 'friend' of his who asked in passing why the internet wasn't working. they took out the on-call blackberry and showed that there were zero calls and messages last night. the acting-supervisor 'forgot' his cellphone that day so they couldn't check his (i so wanted to call his cellphone in the middle of the meeting and watch him explain that away. he was one of those people who had their blackberry attached at the hip). the 'contracting officer's technical representative' or cotr came in to the room and he was fuming. asking me pointed questions, and kept repeating 'why didn't you page out?' and 'there are procedures in place that you should have followed!' i couldn't get a word in edge wise, and the telcom guys had very smug looks. i pretty much didn't care anymore at this point so instead of trying to explain further i stood up (which pretty much made everyone tense up a bit) and i walked calmly to the overhead projector. logged in, turned on the [screen]( and started playing the voicemails. nobody really said anything at first, but the telcom guys definitely had priceless faces. the cotr told me 'please excuse us craysh. we have some business to discuss. feel free to take the rest of the day off with a $50 per diem.' i think i ended up seeing prince of persia. my supervisor was told not to tell anyone what happened in that meeting after i left. all he would say was that they were very lucky that charges were not brought up against them since the documents that they filled out with the false information was a government document and what they did was technically fraud against the u.s. government. the only reason he told me this was because i had to help file an amendment to the incident report. currently waiting for this persons pc to reboot. she's having issues connecting to a remote server from home. shes on a vpn and its taking forever. servers pinging fine, vpn is set correctly. then she says "of course its set correctly, its been on all night." i suggest a reboot and thats when she dropped the "rebooting won't fix it! i never reboot my computer and it runs fine!" line to me. she finally reboots and of course its fine now. if you’re not up to the interviews, please go backwards :) [previous]( ***** as the red haired lady walked into the room and sat opposite i realized why i was forced into sitting on the same side of the desk as everyone else. interviews are always done across a desk. always. &gt;bigp: welcome redcheer, you’re here to interview for a position in it correct? redcheer looked nervously at the interview panel. she gave me a weak smile. &gt;redcheer: yes. vp didn’t miss a step. he looked keen to get stuck into the interview. &gt;vp: what’s your biggest weakness? after an opening question like that i could tell he was out for blood. &gt;redcheer: ummm…. probably it knowledge. i don’t know that much, however i’m a fast learner. i would be willing to go on any it related courses to get my skills up to scratch. head of hr looked rather endearingly at the poor lady across the table. she glanced down the table at the vp and gave him a stern look. &gt;headhr: sorry dear, that was an awful opening question. how about you tell us a little about yourself and why you want to join our it staff. &gt;redcheer: well i worked as a designer at carefree’s company, but recently i’ve learnt i enjoy it related things. so i feel your company would be a good place for me. redcheer smiled at the interviewing panel. i looked over at everyone else in the room. bigp was smiling heartily back, vp looked calculating, head of hr looked the happiest and the company lawyer on the end just looked bored. i decided i’d go with a smile. &gt;vp: why’d you leave design? &gt;redcheer: i still like design, its a part of me, however i felt the need for a change. &gt;vp: why though? vp looked very intently down at redcheer, odd that he’d ask the same question twice. &gt;redcheer: at my old company i had an ex-partner , and i felt if i didn’t leave… he would have. considering i’ve been thinking of a move to it, it wouldn’t have been fair to not leave now…. redcheer seemed to realize at that point where she was, perhaps sharing interoffice romance stories in a interview wasn’t a great plan. the vp however had a massive smile on his face. &gt;vp: oh please… do go on…. head of hr snapped at the vp. &gt;headhr: oh stop it, vp. redcheer, what it knowledge do you bring to the team? &gt;redcheer: i know how to physically replace some parts on the computer. i can reformat a pc. bigp and the head of hr nodded their heads understandingly. the vp however decided to strike. &gt;vp: what server side knowledge do you have? redcheer looked very nervous at that question. i knew she had no knowledge at all in that area. &gt;redcheer: i know that basics of databases, and i know about html, and sizing constrains on hard drives. i also know about server side upgrades, and how sturdy racks are. other server knowledge includes safety when working in dangerous environments. and yeah… i realized she’d literally strung some words together and it vaguely made sense. i mean none of it was at all useful but the vp was still trying to work out what she’d even said. i decided to ask a question before he could counter. &gt;me: hello again redcheer, so why this company? &gt;vp: again?! wait airz, have you met redcheer before? before i could open my mouth, bigp answered for me. &gt;bigp: no, they’ve never met. the vp was giving me a suspicious face. &gt;me: i haven’t ever seen redcheer *here* before. in my mind that wasn’t a lie, i had never before seen her specifically **here**. &gt;headhr: okay. any questions you have for us, redcheer? &gt;redcheer: just one. if i worked here, would i be working with airz? or are there multiple departments. &gt;headhr: he’s the head of it, so you’ll be working under him, yes. redcheer smiled at that. then got up to leave. after she’d closed the door the vp erupted. &gt;vp: we can’t hire that! she’s probably got kicked out of her last place of employment. i thought about speaking up, but i was worried they’d ask me if i thought she seemed competent, truthfully, she seemed like a mess. &gt;bigp: she’s the daughter of a friend. &gt;vp: oh…. ….. … the vp took a minute to recover. &gt;vp: still… we can’t hire her, not until we’ve interviewed all the candidates. &gt;bigp: redcheer is the only candidate. &gt;vp: no no, there is another. if the position is open and i’m paying for it…. its only fair if a candidate of my picking gets an interview. right? the vp looked over all the faces of the group. everyone wanted to say no. i didn’t have the strength… my coffee had run out. &gt;vp: good. i’ll schedule it for tomorrow morning. first thing. the vp smiled and left the room. bigp looked over at me and gave me a smile. he saw my worried expression &gt;bigp: don’t worry airz, either way… you get a new tech. [next]([previous]( boredom. nothing was happening today. i guess this is what happens when everyone is mildly competent and looking out for any mistakes themselves, instead of just leaving mistakes in a pile to collapse on someone. i looked out over the tech area. everyone was hard at work, kinda boring really. time for a ticket, i thought to myself. but which ticket to take? i looked at the queue, nothing jumped out. time for some ticket roulette. i closed my eyes and hammered the up and down arrows on the keyboard until i couldn’t keep track of where in the queue i would be. i pressed enter, and opened my eyes. new ticket &gt;*could someone come upstairs and help soothe some problems with the new desktops* - marketing dept walking up to the marketing department, i remembered the desktops the vp had left in a pool of water. i wondered where these other “new desktops” came from… &gt;markhead: airz! come see the new machines. &gt;me: where… did you get them from? the ones ordered while i was away were wrecked. markhead smiled knowingly at me. &gt;markhead: silence has its price. a high one actually. i looked at the desktops in front of me… they were mac’s. &gt;me: woah. you managed to get these, from **our** vp? i stared at the silver beasts before me. &gt;markhead: they say its the fastest apple computer ever built. &gt;me: so whats the problem? markhead looked a little sheepish for a moment. &gt;markhead: you see.. we love the look and feel of mac… but.. we sorta forgot… all our… programs are in windows. sooo…. umm? markhead looked at me with a worried expression. i was still ogling the powerhouses passing off as personal computers. &gt;markhead: any ideas? i stared hard into my soul. trying to think of a solution. &gt;markhead: anything? &gt;me: just one idea…. ***** the next day a whole shipment of computers arrived. marked as upgrades for it, oddly they didn’t seem to ever get to the it department. &gt;markhead: so these new ones… will work with our existing software? &gt;me: yep. markhead watched as one of the mac’s got taken into the lift. &gt;markhead: and those mac’s go…? &gt;me: mmm haven’t worked that out yet…. &gt;markhead: you sure its okay these new computers are coming outta your budget? markhead’s face was filled with concern. i smiled back at him. &gt;me: you let me worry about that. &gt;markhead: thanks for keeping this…discreet. &gt;me: discretion has a price… i smiled at the head of the marketing department who in turn, smiled back. &gt;markhead: i owe you one. ***** as i got back to my office i saw a pile of brand new mac’s just sitting in the middle of the department. well… no use these going to waste. i looked around at the it department. &gt;me: time for an upgrade anyone? apparently sometimes ticket roulette really pays off. [next](i hate heads of department meetings. everyone gets together to push an agenda and ignore everyone else’s. the secretary pokes her head in the door. &gt;sec: tea anyone? &gt;me: i’ll take a coffee. &gt;sec: only tea in these meetings i’m afraid. coffee leaves the china with marks. i get my tea. the fancy cup and saucer looking so floral. i regret the tea. i take a sip. tastes like bad water. the vp comes into the room to start the meeting. &gt;vp: so to start i’d like to congratulate airz23 on becoming the new head of security and it. &gt;me: temporary head. &gt;vp: its a big plate to handle, so hows the budget looking for this quarter? i sit back in my chair. i smile. &gt;me: this quarter the it budget still has some spending room we’re asking for zero additional funds &gt; at this time. &gt;vp: excellent, and even with the purchase of the new radios for security, see guys this is how to run &gt; a department efficiently…. &gt;me: wait, what? i didn’t order any new radios for security &gt;vp: oh i know, i got my secretary to order them, i knew how much you had on your plate. i'm surprised the it budget to stretch that far though, perhaps we’re giving you guys too much money. &gt;me: the radio’s are coming out of the it budget? &gt;vp: well you are the head of department…. &gt;me: can’t it come out of the security budget? &gt;vp: they don’t actually have one. not to worry, you manage both in one budget that's efficient. its why we promoted you, no additional funds and you still manage to get new equipment. &gt;me: how much was the new equipment? i look down at my floral cup. its pretty patterns do not mirror the thoughts going through my mind. i take a sip. i try to swallow all the rage building up. &gt;vp: about $3000, i think. &gt;me: i think ill need additional funds to cover something that large. &gt;vp: you don’t need any more funds, you said so before. &gt;me: that was before i took a 3000 hit. &gt;vp: i know.... but you’ll find a way to squeeze it in. i pick up the tea cup. i take a sip. still tastes like bad water. [next]( old stories [one]( [two]( [three]( [four]( [five]( [six](i graciously admitted defeat in the face of managerial apathy. i accepted my diminishing responsibility as i set about my regular duties, visiting desk sides and dealing with the various whims and fancies of the user base. in one way it was a relief to detach myself from any view of the perpetually turning cogs of the rollout. i engrossed myself in some other issues which had come to plague the user base, most notably a problem visiting reps had experienced with their laptops and smartphones failing to maintain a stable wifi connection in the office. i made my way past some familiar faces as i strolled around intrepidly, laptop in hand, waiting to catch the moment when the wi-fi would drop. just as the signal dropped, my investigation was put on hold as one of the sales managers caught my attention. his artificially whitened teeth seemed to surrender every line of imperfection under the light as he smiled his well-practised salesman smile. as he casually enquired about the rollout, i deflected his attention towards angie as the new go-to person. i was only in a consultant capacity as needed. his smile took on a slightly apprehensive expression; i knew full well that bhit had sung my praises right from the start. to hear this dramatic change in events appeared disturbing. maintaining a professional demeanour, i simply assured him of my belief that the project was in capable hands… the first time i’ve ever flat out lied on the job. he disappeared back into the hustle and bustle of the office, leaving me to my wifi investigation. an oddly airy wednesday afternoon surged into view. its felt clean and clear. we could at long last breathe a hearty sigh of relief. angie and roland had disappeared off for what seemed like ages. the absence of their black auras had left a dramatically spacey vibe, like we had all just surfaced from some colossal ocean depth, finally able to drink in some of the bountiful fresh air. its taste was like a cool breeze amidst some arid summer heat wave. it was a relief to actually hear our own voices again! the drone of insipid chatter from the finance wenches had been the only aural accompaniment of recent days. their meandering discussions on male pop sensations 20 years their junior, various coffee recipes and deeply particular insights of certain male employees that these aging, portly women found attractive made for a percussive din, the only moments of reprieve as angie’s led her menopause group for their twice-daily starbucks fix. of course, she would leave roland on guard-dog duty! still, we now had an opportunity to let our guards down. with a secretive half vocal whisper, qbg was eager to catch up on the latest rollout-gossip. her face contorted in disbelief as i confided angie’s actions. i was just barely loud enough to be heard outside our conversation, but just loud enough so to ensure bhit was in earshot. he barely flinched while i concluded my full update to qbg. in one way, i didn’t care who heard me anymore, so long as bhit did. but it felt good to get listened to, as if my account needed to be heard by someone. “there’s only a month to go… shouldn’t something more be happening by now?” as the week trundled towards its closure, angie and roland made frequent trips to the higher floors for rollout meetings as its beavered away in their duties. i waited for consultation requests from roland, sometimes even publically inviting him to check anything he wanted with me, through as an agreeable manner as i could muster. roland refused to ask for help, but in reality, i think i was happier without having to endure this pair’s attitude and negative manner. my working life seemed basic and simple again, just the way i like it. well, of course with the regular admonishments of angie! morale was long gone, but there were our own little private worlds to disappear of to. the biggest casualty was the ghost server that mafg and i had acquired, built, loved and later valiantly rescued from its janitorial doom. it stood poignantly next to roland’s desk – the three-item to a desk rule apparently mute given roland’s status. it was now clearly being held prisoner, like a hostage whose captivity had broken them down, sympathising with their kidnapper and taking on a new persona to mirror the evil twisted nature of its jailer. the beige box was coated in the alienesque slime and goo that oozed from roland’s skin, like spiderman’s evil doppelganger shooting acidic goo from his palms. the dymo label which had so proudly identified the ghost server by its hostname, “itsgho01” had been forcibly removed as if to eviscerate some evidence of its history. it left a white rectangle, obvious against its discoloured skin, with scratches and scrapes surrounding it akin to an animal’s claws. two weeks passed by, all news of the rollout went untold. roland appeared to be busily toiling in another part of the building – we were quite happy to be relieved of angie’s underling. monday morning, i was training qbt in the fine art of replacing an old atx pentium 133 motherboard in an desktop that she had retrieved from a research department. a donor packard bell from the rear of the it cupboard had already been looted for some other parts previously, its casing battered and bent. however, luckily, an entire motherboard and cpu remained. it was this we were transplanting to the distressed research machine, its rare and irreplaceable exclusivity commanding the utmost care and attention. the anti-static wrist bands seemed to complicate the procedure as its plastic-coated coil snagged on various parts of the metal chassis. we were happily bonding in our moment of isolation, catching up on each other’s hearsay; it had been the first time i had been able to relax with someone at work for a while, qbg it seemed could make a suitable replacement for mafg! our mother’s meeting was almost at a close when our a stony faced facilities monkey, clad in dirty green jumper which seemed to evidence hard toil, appeared in the doorway with an aged disapproving look. “jon6?” he mumbled. “there’s a truck turned up with loads of laptops. where are we meant to put ‘em?” his manchester accent echoed from the hallway through the opened it cupboard door, his frame slightly obscuring the overhead lighting. his accent clearly demonstrated the fact that he was far from home, like a lone warrior holding his own in some foreign land. “right here i guess, there’s some space at the back!” i said, motioning to an isle mafg had previously emptied towards the end of his tenure. his told-you-so smile accompanied the shake of his head, “what, all of em? you know there’s about 250 of the things?” convoyed to the scene of the crime, the facilities monkey purposely shuffled me towards the articulated lorry that had arrived in the yard, standing like a bruised battle tank just returned from war. its rear doors were flung open to reveal box after box after box, adorned with the familiar dell logos, as a team of facilities workers scrambled to unload them. “you better figure out where we’re going to put these double quick” he commanded, thrusting a manifest into my hands. i could see my name planted firmly at the top of the document’s recipient list. i knew right then that my evening had just been squandered by whoever’s administrative oversight had caused this turn of events. of course, i knew full well it had to be only one person’s doing! the lobby of the building was decorated with an oversized clock face which hung above the main security desk. its appearance had a stealthy corporate double-meaning. on the one hand, visitors would be impressed with such a bold artistic statement. on the other, it reinforced to any tardy employee that they had been caught red-handed, their arrival time electronically indelibly stamped on their permanent record as they would swipe their access cards. to add to this crafty corporate purpose, this oversized clock always seemed to be a few indistinct minutes faster than almost any other clock that existed. tonight, it took on a new role. it sarcastically emphasised my rapidly vanishing evening as i walked pump-truck after pump-truck of dell branded boxes to their temporary homes. neither angie or bhit were anywhere in sight to mediate the situation. repeated appeals to helpdesk to locate their whereabouts went unanswered. in the end, some sympathetic facilities manager had yielded to my plight and offered three temporary rooms to hold the laptops. these were now crammed floor to ceiling with dell boxes. my clothes smelled old from my efforts; prickled with box-dust and the stale smelling air of the rooms i had been afforded which had sat unused for some time. i packed away the last box, finally leaving the building at 9pm. my disentanglement from the project, as prescribed by angie, seemed to have been suddenly and majorly rehabilitated in this single dramatic move. i had clearly stated in my project plan that these deliveries should be conducted in batches of 50 at a time; we didn’t have the space to deal with 250 machines – as this very evening would attest. this detail, i’m sure, had made it into angie’s rewrite of my project plan in verbatim. i know i had even seen it. what’s more, with only two weeks to go, building 250 machines in that time was no mean feat! what had roland even been doing this whole time? this blunder, which felt a little too obvious, seemed to signify stage two of angie’s sabotage. **previous** [pt1: a new world order]( ) [pt2: safety first]( [pt3: the it induction from hell]( [pt4: undercurrents]( [pt5: how to make friends and...]( [pt6: marking territories]( [pt7: one friday to rue them all]( [pt8: best laid plans]( [pt9: its one step for man]( [pt10: ...and one step back for its]( [pt11: bring home the solider]( [pt12: who needs minor victories...]( [pt13: dawn of a new nightmare]( [pt14: rules of engagement]( [pt15: bring out your dead]( [pt16: the greatest trick the devil ever pulled...]( [pt17: who's the king?]([previous]( &gt;vp: airz! come up to my office i need to borrow a laptop. i looked down at the loaner laptop pile. one was left. i smiled as i picked it up. it was the worst laptop we own, not by specs just by smell. as i walked up to the vp’s office, putrid laptop in hand i thought of all the time i’d wasted attempting to clean off the smell. days of my life down the drain. entering the office i handed off the laptop to the vp &gt;me: last one left …. lucky. &gt;vp: actually sit down airz, i need to introduce you to our new business consultant. i looked at the lady to the vp’s left. she looked at me and smiled. &gt;con: hello, i’m business consultant. here to make everything run as smooth as silk. &gt;me: oh, pleased to meet you. good luck with the … silking? &gt;con: hahaha, a humorous manager. how … rare. the vp looked up at me, he looked odd. oddly happy. &gt;vp: i think we’ll send business consultant down to you first. &gt;me: sorry, what? &gt;vp: business consultant will spend a little while down in it just trying to improve things. &gt;me: improve things? everything is running… smoothly… silkily? &gt;con: ooooh nice! does everything tie up so nicely with you? she gave me a broad smile. i didn’t bother to acknowledge it. i was on a war path. &gt;me: we’ve a 100% uptime, everyone has a working computer… &gt;vp: don’t worry, i know you’re a team player. &gt;me: name one thing, that we could improve on. challenge laid down. i stared down at the vp, his mind was searching and finding nothing. i smiled, a winning trap. &gt;con: certainly seems like you can handle the hardware side of things, what about the it-user relationship? surprise attack, side stabbed by the female assassin in the room. &gt;me: we’ve a great relationship. &gt;con: not yet we don’t. i looked down at the table searching for coffee, to double check i wasn’t hearing things, but no coffee was around. &gt;me: sorry? &gt;con: well have you got a review system in place? for feedback after tickets are completed? &gt;me: errr… the vp’s eyes lit up, his mouth started to work again. &gt;vp: yes! a review system. for example, i’d give you a 1 out of 10 for this laptop loan. it smells like…. &gt;me: its the last laptop we have i’m afraid. plus you made it like that… &gt;con: don’t worry airz, it’ll be fun looking at the business in different ways together. i looked over at the vp, i smelt something bad…and it wasn’t just the laptop. &gt;me: errr, do you want a copy of my protests in writing now…. or should i just skip a step and shred them? the vp looked at me, his eye’s daring me to continue. &gt;con: hahaha. don’t worry vp, he’s a funny one. i think consulting will go fine. &gt;vp: i don’t think that was a joke, i'm not happy with employees speaking to me like that. &gt;con: oh, good!

[next]( i teach cle (continuing legal education) classes on lawyers and information security from time to time. i enjoy teaching and get credit for the classes. theoretically, there’s a chance at business development as well, but that’s a mixed bag. this is one of those stories. i’m sitting in my office, doing some administrative work while waiting for a conference call with a customer to start. my cell phone rings, with a local number that i don’t recognize. unknown caller:”hello. is this lawtechie? did you teach a cle on security?” me:”er, probably. why?” unknown caller:”we have that file scrambling virus. john said you’d be able to help us” me:”i don’t know which john you’re talking about.” unknown caller:”john is one of my associates. he took your cle” me:”good for him. look. i’m up against a deadline today. i could talk to your it people tomorrow and walk you through your options” unknown caller:”no, no. this is an emergency. all of our files are scrambled” me(starting to think that unknown caller’s voice is familiar, but i can’t place it):”well, if you want me to drop everything, that’s an emergency rate and we’re not inexpensive” unknown caller:”i was thinking you would do this as a professional courtesy. we don’t have an it person so we’re flying blind” me:”i see. you want me to drop my paying customers to help you because we’re both lawyers, right?” unknown caller:”well, you should have a good reputation among your fellow lawyers” i think i know who this person is. i’ve got a grin. me:”i think we may have met in the past. about six years ago, did you have a client named $oddball_client_name in a contract dispute?” unknown caller:”probably. $oddball_client_name has been a client for years. why?” me:”i thought i recognized your voice. back then i tried resolving a dispute and you threatened me with sanctions, even after i granted you two continuances.” unknown caller:”so, are you willing to help me?” me:”as a professional courtesy?” unknown caller:”yes” me:”nope. i’ve got your professional courtesy right here. figure it out yourself.” my grandmother called me at work to day to tell me: &gt;"my don't touch has a 9 on it" [this is the screen shot i got her to send me]( i intentionally created "don't touch" for all the standard ipad apps that she found confusing (stock market, newsstand, itunes, etc....) turns out she dragged one of her slot machine games in there and it's been accumulating notifications for a few days. not really much of a tech support problem but it was pretty funny when she called me and said "my don't touch has a 9 on it" i'm proud of her. she didn't touch it! i didn't realize just how much i'd thrown myself into work since my ex-fiancee left me. i've been closing 600+ tickets a month since march, plus all my projects and emergencies. the next closest person is averaging about 275 or so a month. the bosses have said the number of tickets i do is too damn high. - - - - - tuxedo jack and craptacularly spignificant productions - present - i will find you, hr will end you, and i will laugh - - - - - 13 june 2014. a friday to end all fridays, that one was. my boss / coworker and i were dealing with daily tasks; he was working on an exchange migration for a new client, and i was busy making up for the slack our less-than-erstwhile tier 1 and 2 helldesk operators were leaving (between the two of them that day, they closed 33 incidents; i closed 58 on my own thanks to [the power of the contents of my desk]( - /u/airz23, [eat your heart out]( plus working on our barracuda's spam filters and setting up a few allowed senders on it. "hey, $boss," i said, spinning in my swivel chair towards him. "we got a problem. cryptowall e-mails got through the spam filter today." he didn't look over. "when and to whom?" "a few hours ago, and to some of our most pants-on-head stupid clients," i retorted, flipping my right-most monitor to him and pressing ctrl+plus a few times to increase the font size in the rather long list of e-mail recipients who'd gotten the spam. sure enough, his eyes widened, and he expressed his displeasure with a string of expletives that called the company's owner in from his corner office behind the wall next to him. "send out an e-mail instructing people not to open that to the admins at each company - " "let me stop you riiiiiiiiiiiiiight there, boss. not only did i just do that, but i added it to the blacklist in the barracuda, and i'm remoted into the most critical clients' boxes as well as their replay servers just in case someone opens one of the links - " as i said this, i noticed the newly opened "open files" section from computer management in one of our bigger (also quite gullible, lacking in common sense, and obscenely rich) clients' fileserver / dc was flickering quickly enough to give an epileptic a seizure. with a smirk, i looked up the machine that that user was connecting from and remotely ipconfig /release'd it. the flickering slowed and stopped, and i shrugged. "problem half solved. get $minion_1 over there and let's have him clean up that machine. i don't want it on the network until it's clean properly." sure enough, a few minutes later, the users who'd been accessing files in that server called and stated that they'd been corrupted. we loaded up replay, mounted the restore point, and started copying back the corrupted data from the backup. the restore completed successfully, we turned back to our machines, and continued working. a mere half-hour later, the phone on my boss's desk rang, and the caller was from that company. "uh, the files are still corrupt." "that's odd. we restored them from backup. let me look..." i flipped open the open files window, which had been behind a bunch of other rdp sessions, and blinked in astonishment. another user had opened the same e-mail, and this had reinfected the shares we'd restored, and to an even worse degree! i kicked that user off the network and phoned $minion_1 with strict instructions to ban both users from the network until further notice. at the same time, i started composing a new e-mail to that site's admin and forced a new gpo on, then psexec'd a gpupdate /force to every machine on the domain. "jack, i don't get it. the admin forwarded your e-mail to everyone here, saying not to open the e-mail, and the second user said it was a legitimate accident that she opened it. she thought it was something she expected from a legitimate dropbox user." "i don't care. normally, i'd make sure they're canned... but mike restocked my coffee this morning, so i'll be okay." i locked the users out of ad, then over the next hour, i not only restored their data, but sent out an e-mail to everyone at that site from our administrative account, stating that under no circumstances were they to open that e-mail or anything like it. if they were in doubt, they were to call me immediately on my desk line, and i would work with them to make sure it was safe. i stated that two people had already infected their machines that day, and while i can understand one or two, a third would result in immediate hr referral for disciplinary action. i left the office that day, drove home in rush hour traffic and sweltering heat, and proceeded to down a bottle of malbec, then passed out. saturday morning, i woke up to my phone ringing just after seven am. the answering service put a call through to my cellphone, despite my explicit instructions not to - and me not being on call - and i made it eminently clear there would be retribution on monday when i talked to my boss before talking to the client on the other end. "none of our files are opening," the woman on the other end said. "we thought you cleaned this up yesterday." "we did," i grumbled, falling out of bed and stumbling to my home office, through only a mild hangover. "let's see what's going on." i pulled up my remote access console, then remoted into their file server. sure enough, every file on all but two of the shares was encrypted. i politely excused myself, then tapped mute on my cell, and started swearing like mad. i pulled up the properties of the file, and then the details tab showed me the owner... at which point my eyes opened a bit wider. "let me call you right back," i said, firing up outlook and my softphone on my desktop. after looking in a folder to verify the information i wanted was there, i activated the call-recording feature, then dialed the woman who called me back. "so. you're right, the files are encrypted. apparently, a third person infected their machine with cryptowall after we cleaned everything up. they did so by opening the e-mail, after we told them to... a good hour after we told them not to, and after not one, but two e-mails were sent out to warn people about this, and from the look of the ntfs metadata, that person was you." "no one ever sent me any e-mail!" "let me stop you riiiiiiiiiiiight there," i said, flipping open outlook again. "i've got two read receipts here, both timestamped, that said you read the e-mails. one that the admin sent out, one that i personally sent out. you opened the e-mail afterwards, and then opened the infector on your machine... at..." i remoted to her machine and found the infector file, which indicated it had been running for just over 12 hours. "five-thirty pm." "um..." "so i'm going to do a few things here," i enunciated through the haze of early-morning sleepiness and the slight hangover i had as i locked her ad account and rebooted her machine, which she'd been remoted into with logmein. "i'm going to pull the list of files you've destroyed, i'm going to make an estimate on the time the restore's going to take, i'm going to kick off the restore, and then i'm going to conference-call my boss, your boss, your head of hr, and give them the information i've found, which clearly states that you did it." "sure, i opened the e-mail, but i didn't break the files, and you can't prove it!" "well, the ntfs metadata will prove you did, but this call's recording will do the job just as well." i smirked. "texas is a one-party state, you realize - and this call may be recorded for quality of service." she hung up, i started the restore, and i e-mailed the mp3 file of the recording to the three people i said i would, then went back to bed and slept for a few more hours. - - - - - tl;dr: you're once, twice, three times an end-user. - - - - - [everything else i've done is here. enjoy!](this is a bit of a long one, but believe me, it's worth it. i'm in the it department for a mid-sized utility company. we're a small department of three (a coworker, the it director and myself) so we all wear a lot of hats. a year or two ago we installed a new voip phone system. one user in particular, a secretary of sorts for the electrical department, uses her phone nigh constantly because of customer calls coming in and then making calls out to the crews. she has a wireless headpiece for her phone to ease the strain. she also has what might be courteously called a "brusque" manner of speaking. about a year ago, she called up our department with complaints that her phone was "dropping calls". no problem, we say, we'll check it out. there's only a few things it could be, right? i check the switch logs and see nothing suspicious in the port as far as errors, dropped frames or anything like that. the config on the port also looks good. cable tester results look good for her connection. phone is still fairly new, so we decide the most likely factor is a bad wireless headpiece since we've had trouble with them before. we swap that out, everything seems good for a short bit, but soon she's complaining again. we check all the same things again and this time decide maybe it is the phone itself. we've got spares, so we swap it out. every few weeks she calls up complaining and as you might guess, try as we might literally nothing works. we run a new cable to her workstation. we move her to another switch. turn off auto-negotiation on duplex speeds, replace the phone again. we finally feel like we've isolated and done everything we could do. the only factor we haven't changed is the user herself. we all chalk it up to her "brusque" attitude toward customers and assume that people are just hanging up on her. last week, my coworker gets a call from the user. she explains that she's determined the cause of her phone ills: every time she gets an email on her personal account on her iphone while talking on the phone, the line goes dead. as soon as he can, my coworker calls me up and we howl with laughter over the diagnostic. there's literally no connection between the iphone and desk phone. we don't even provide wifi for our users. if she's getting data on her phone, it's her own personal mobile connection. we enjoy our chuckle and hang up, not even bothering to investigate. later, my boss comes by my office and while talking, i tell him of the call. he has a good chuckle too and is about to dismiss it, but then something makes him say: "man, wouldn't it be crazy if that was actually the problem?" to which i reply, "yeah, but obviously it's not." "but what if it was?" so i spitball what might be happening. maybe, maybe somewhere the shielding is off the cable and receiving the email makes the the iphone have a brief spike of electromagnetic interference that somehow momentarily disrupts the connection? but no, it's too outlandish. still, my boss has got my interest piqued and i decide to check it out. i hustle up to her desk and tell her i want to check this out, because it's so crazy. i call her desk from my mobile phone, and then have her send her personal email account a test message. the phone pings its notification noise to signal it's got the email, and *son of a bitch* if the line doesn't go dead. i flip out, but have enough presence of mind to see that the line hasn't gone dead, only become muted. my mind races, then grasps on a half-remembered fact. didn't people used to phreak phone systems by using specific frequencies? and that notification ringtone was pretty flat and electronic sounding... "change your notification ring! i have to check something out!" i splutter. we repeat the test, and sure enough, with the new notification ring, the line stays connected and unmuted. somehow, some freak chance of tech has matched some touch tone in our voip phone system to the exact same frequency on the user's iphone and she was inadvertently phreaking her own phone to mute whenever she got an email. i admit the phreaking diagnosis might not be 100% for sure, and that it might be some kind of weird audio overload instead, but there's no denying the ringtone was causing her phone to mute. she's not had any problems since. i humbly admitted to the user that i hadn't believed her and that this was one of the craziest solutions to a problem i've ever encountered in it.hello everybody. i'm back on nightshift this week which mean that i had some downtime to browse some old tickets and chat logs. which led to me re-discovering one of the more amusing requests that the internal it help desk has received: tonight's cast: * steve: the head of it for site lingo. * william: internal it tech. used to work for steve directly before joining internalit. ---- incident: #24601 from: steve (site lingo) message: left my pants at home. could you bring them to me? ---- incident: #24605 from: steve (site lingo) message: the black ones. ---- incident: #24608 from: steve (site lingo) message: they're on a hanger, left hand side. ---- my coworkers watched these messages come in with a mixture of amusement and confusion. finally, one of them could no longer resist the temptation to respond. ---- re: incident: #24612 from: william (internal it) message: sorry boss but we don't do pickup or delivery. ---- turns out the messages were intended for his wife but the internal it desk was somehow being cced them. steve didn't realize that we were receiving the messages as well because he had long ago created an email filter to hide the "you have created a ticket" auto response that was sent out every time we got a new incident or request. how steve managed to include both our address and her address in the same message without realizing it though remains a mystery. more of my stories can be found [here]([previous]( it was the start of my third day of my week off. i expelled the memory of what happened at the hospital from my mind. the jumpsuit from the previous day in hand i walked up to my temporary place of work. carefree was waiting for me as i entered the building. he gave me a huge smile. &gt;carefree: thanks again for helping out redcheer. &gt;me: oh, no worries. i didn’t really have anything else to say after that, so i just smiled and waited. &gt;carefree: so about chasing those cables in the roof, i don’t think you should go up there anymore. not after the accident anyway… &gt;me: oh, are you sure? i even brought the jumpsuit back! oddly i felt disappointed in not being able to go into the roof. it was something to do. &gt;carefree: yeah i’m sure. don’t worry too much about the jumpsuit. he looked down at the jumpsuit in my hand. shock registered on his face. &gt;carefree: wait… is that blood on the front of the jumpsuit? &gt;me: haha oh that. luckily that's just apple and black current juice. hospitals really don’t have the selection of drinks you’d expect. &gt;carefree: oh. well anyway, its probably for the best if you keep out of the roof… i agreed, so the conversation seemed to be over. i kept walking into the office. as i entered i was caught by one of the designers i hadn’t met before he was wearing a scarf and had his hair fashioned just so. &gt;scarfy: hey! are you the tech guy? &gt;me: yeah, that's me. &gt;scarfy: oh great, just to make sure we’re on the same… page. whats your name? &gt;me: airz! nice to meet you…. ? scarfy gave me a look, as if expecting me to continue talking. eventually he just smiled. &gt;scarfy: anyway airz i’ve been having trouble with this usb. could you come take a look at it with me, please? &gt;me: sure thing, sorry i didn’t quite catch your name… &gt;scarfy: oh don’t worry. everyone’s new to you, we only have to learn one new name. we made our way over to his area, and he showed me the usb in question. &gt;me: this… is just a pile of broken chips. &gt;scarfy: see airz, i had a file on there and the usb stopped working yesterday. someone told me you could take out the memory parts, and put them in another usb and it would start working. you weren’t here then so i thought i’d give that a try myself. i looked down at the remains of the usb. it looked like it had been hit with a hammer. repeatedly. &gt;me: this is wrecked. &gt;scarfy: but airz! i’ve got an important file on there. i looked at the chip carefully, the memory seemed to be cracked. in about ten places. &gt;me: no. no chance. i’m afraid this one’s beyond repair. &gt;scarfy: how long airz? &gt;me: sorry? how long….? i gave him a confused face. the most confused face i could muster. &gt;scarfy: how long would it take you to fix it? given no distractions. &gt;me: unlimited time, and unlimited resources? still probably never gonna happen. &gt;scarfy: come on airz. just give me a sensible amount of time. i seriously didn’t know what to say. it literally couldn’t be done. i don’t do magic. &gt;me: okay fine. ten days, and a mountain of cash. scarfy looked disappointed at that. &gt;scarfy: oh airz, not worth it. may as well just download it again. &gt;me: sorry… download it? you mean you’ve got a backup of the files you want. a user that backed up his own files. i was internally jumping for joy. &gt;scarfy: yeah. they’re online but the site is super slow, it’ll take at least an hour. i stared down at the smashed usb on the desk in front of me. a smashed usb all to save an hour? &gt;me: wait you said this broke yesterday. you could have just downloaded them last night. &gt;scarfy: yeah that's true airz, but i thought you’d be able to just get them back on the usb… i stared at this man waiting for him to realize how broken this usb truely was. nothing. &gt;me: okay… well better get downloading. i wanted to add his name to my newly minted “doesn’t understand logic” list, i didn’t know his name though. &gt;scarfy: thanks for trying anyway airz. &gt;me: mmmm no worries. whats your name again, sorry? &gt;scarfy: haha, i never told you remember?. i thought about letting his name thing go. not today. &gt;me: oh.. i have to know your name, so i can put your name down when getting you a new usb. &gt;scarfy: oh okay, i’m scarfy. pleased to meet you airz. scarfy. the man who’d flood his home to get a jet ski out of his garage. [next]([previous]( ***** please check out the comic of the last story [here]( ***** as i get my office and i smile into my coffee. bigp was right, a free employee i’m not paying for, whats not to like? i’d been told redcheer was starting monday, no one in it had been told yet about the new employee. i decided it was time to cheer everyone up. &gt;me: everyone, hey! the techs turned their heads from the computers. they didn’t look too hostile. &gt;me: on monday we’re getting a new employee down in it! i smiled around the room, to let everyone know i'm pleased with this development. the smiles i received in reply cheered me. &gt;solitaire: oh excellent, he can help us keep up with the christmas rush. &gt;me: she…. and what christmas rush? i took a sip of coffee, christmas was usually a quiet period. the word “she” perked up the ears of the single men in the office, as well as the pantsuit. &gt;pantsuit: another woman, is working the day shifts? &gt;me: yep. pantsuit looked pleased at this development she even did a small fist clench and mouthed “yes”, which was odd. &gt;solitaire: so what’s her specialty? &gt;me: oh, she’s quite new to it. the mood in the room dropped. like a brick. smiles where wiped off faces everywhere, except pantsuit’s. &gt;me: but.. but she’s a fast learner! she’ll be able to help in no time. &gt;solitaire: well i’m not training her. looked what happened last time. as i looked back over at itsec i realized he hadn’t turned out that badly. even if the ticket scalping almost took my head. still probably best not to repeat that way of teaching. &gt;me: pantsuit, you seem pretty pleased to get another woman to work with, mind training redcheer a little? &gt;pantsuit: wait... redcheer… that’s her name? &gt;me: yeah, she’s pretty nice. pantsuit’s smile had gone, she looked serious again. &gt;pantsuit: no. sorry. i can’t train her. &gt;me: but why? you’ll be a great teacher! &gt;pantsuit: no. no i don’t think i want to teach *redcheer* i looked around the room, no one seemed keen on wanting to teach a new person. i took a sip of coffee, **just force someone to teach her** it screamed. i looked up from my coffee cup, pantsuit was closest. (and she never really had problems) &gt;me: pantsuit, i’m afraid you’re going to have to teach her some stuff… &gt;pantsuit: why?! because i’m a woman? put the only two women together is that it? &gt;me: wa… wait… wha…. no? you realize there are lots of women in this office right? i'm not putting the only two women together. colourblind looked between me and pantsuit. &gt;colourblind: why don’t you do it, airz? i wasn’t sure if he was saving me… or condemning me. &gt;me: i’m too busy managing everything. can’t you do it? colourblind didn’t say anything, he just looked annoyed. i looked around the room, no one looked keen. &gt;me: really… no one? &gt;colourblind: no one can. its the christmas rush… &gt;me: what is the christmas rush?! &gt;colourblind: just… teach the new hire, okay? i knew the christmas rush wasn’t a thing… but i couldn’t prove it, and i had no coffee left. [next](**edit: sigh, i could *literally* kill myself** ;-) &amp;nbsp; i’m a fairly new redditor and i’m still amazed of all the supreddits. of course there is a tales from tech support! a bit of background; originally a software developer, but after a year working for a small company right after my degree, i realized that i would never be top dawg coder. infact, i hated the long long hours and unrealistic deadlines, so when i got the opportunity 9 years ago to work as an it administrator/tech support, i jumped ship and never looked back. i’m working at a big danish municipality with ~8000 users and computers and working both 1. and 2. line support (municipalities aways have to save money, hence the double job function). so, this was a couple of years ago. i get a call from a user that can’t login to a new system that she and two colleques have gotten access to. **phones rings** &gt;**me:** it, this is boef &gt;*user:* hi, my boss sent an email explaining how to login to the new system with pictures and everything, but i still can’t login. the login window is… like…. not responding. &gt;**me:** right, what’s the name of the system? &gt;*user:* xxxxsystemz. can you somehow see if my pw or username is wrong? &gt;**me:** tell you what, let me just reset your pw and give you a standard one which you change when you enter the system. your pw is now xxxsomethingcool. &gt;*user:* thx! (i can hear her tapping the keyboard), nope, sorry, it doesn’t work &gt;**me:** are you sure it’s the right pw? (don’t we all know….) capslock is not on? remember the letter that was supposed to be capital? &gt;*user:* yes!! i’m sure! but something is weird about the login prompt. it is as if it’s frozen. you should fix it since you made it! (tone of her voice is now annoyed) &gt;**me:** we didn’t develop the system, your department bought it without our consent and expected us to support it, which we won’t. we will only help with pw resets, the rest is up to your super users and the company you bought it from. &gt;*user:* oh…… &gt;**me:** but since you are so sure about your pw, i’ll just reset it again and make a new one. might be a delay from serverside. the new pw is xxxsomethingcool. &gt;*user:* hmmmm, no sorry, but it just doesn’t work! the login prompt wont allow me to enter anything! &gt;**me:** uh……… ok, what’s your computer’s id number, i’ll remote in. (10 secs later i’m remote controlling her pc) &gt;*user:* see what i mean?? i do everything i’m told in the email! &gt;**me:** ………………… &gt;**me:** you are trying to log into a screenshot. my [last story]( was a bit of a downer so i thought i'd share a good one. this one also takes place at the $university. several years back i deployed new computers to the library with windows 7 on them. now, most of the library staff took to the new os without issue as they'd been using it at home for some time, but one librarian - our head librarian - was still used to xp so the new os was a big adjustment for her. knowing this in advance i expected to receive some extra calls from her about basic usage items. *some* extra calls. instead, over the next few weeks she inundated me with multiple calls daily with issues like "how do i mute my speakers?" or "my screen is too dim." or "why can't i find ms word?". as you might guess, some of the calls i received were actually related to the new os whereas the rest were unrelated but triggered by the upgrade because she didn't understand that windows doesn't actually control things like the volume knob on her speakers. now... $headlibrarian (hl) is a friend who, in spite of living in want of technical prowess, is actually very intelligent, willing to learn and very good at what she does. this i respect so i was happy to extend her extra patience as i never had to answer the same question twice. nevertheless, after two weeks of calls my patience was beginning to wane and it occurred to me that most of her questions could be solved by a simple google search. so i decided on a new tactic the next time she called... &gt; me: lordpaddington here. hey, $headlibrarian, what can i do for you? &gt; hl: hi. i'm wondering if you can help me with something, i can't figure out how to set my email signature in outlook. i sighed a little. this is exactly the kind of non-os-upgrade-related question i'd been getting from her since the upgrade. &gt; me: you know $headlibrarian, this the kind of thing you could find out for yourself with a simple google search... &gt; hl: really? but it's just so much easier to call you. &gt; me: be that as it may, looking this sort of thing up in google is the better way to go. now, i'm going to help you with this problem, but the next time you call me with an issue like this; if you haven't checked google first, i will hang up on you. &gt; hl: you wouldn't. *her tone was flat and clearly unimpressed.* &gt; me: trust me $headlibrarian, i have no qualms about dishing out tough love, i will hang up on you if i think it's necessary. but never mind that, here's how you can update your signature. *i proceeded to walk her through updating her signature.* &gt; me: there you go! pretty easy eh? &gt; hl: thanks! &gt; me: now remember, next time be sure to look your issue up in google before calling me. &gt; hl: okay. *i could tell by her tone that she didn't quite believe me.* fast forward a few days - the longest interval i go without hearing from her for a while and i'm beginning to suspect my encouragement to use google might have actually worked. but the next call i got from her proved me wrong. &gt; me: lordpaddington here. hey, $headlibrarian, what can i do for you? &gt; hl: hi lordpaddington. i did something to my speakers and they came unplugged. can you come fix it for me? &gt; me: $headlibrarian, do you remember what i said to you about what would happen if you didn't check google before calling me about issues like this? &gt; hl: you wouldn- i hung up on her. it was cold-blooded of me and i felt awful doing it, but it was the only way she was going to learn. 30 seconds later she called back. &gt; hl: you hung up on me! *she sounded offended, but i think she was more shocked that i'd actually done it.* &gt; me: i told you i would. now, did you check google? &gt; hl: no. but i- i hung up on her again. this time i was sure she'd be pissed. 5 seconds later... &gt; hl: stop hanging up on me! *she was angry* &gt; me: listen $headlibrarian, when you call me with obscure questions about the internal database structure of your library catalogue, where do you think i get the answer? you are always impressed that i seem to have such amazing knowledge but you must understand that google is the lifeblood of my work and, like you, i've spent my career seeking out information through written media. now, you are a librarian, your job is to manage knowledge and teach students how to search out that knowledge. put your own skill set to work and apply your ability to acquire knowledge to this simple problem. she was dead silent. i took a breath. &gt; me: now look, i'm not mad. in fact this conversation is the moment i've been waiting for with you so i'm actually quite happy. just believe me when i say that you can do this. just do a google search and i promise you will find the answer in half the time it takes for you to call me. she took a deep breath. &gt; hl: okay. but can i call you back if i can't find the answer? &gt; me: absolutely, and provided you can prove to me you've done due diligence in looking up the answer for yourself, i will not hang up on you ever again. i promise. &gt; hl: okay. &gt; me: let me know how it goes. we hang up. i take a deep breath and pray this doesn't get me fired. five minutes later the following email arrives (this is the actual email: pasted in from outlook and anonymized). from: $headlibrarian sent: thursday, august 16, 2012 9:34 am to: lordpaddington subject: i did it!!! i did it! i can't believe it actually worked!! i googled "how to plug in computer speakers", found some instructions and plugged my speakers into the green hole-thingy in the back! it was so easy! thank you. i emailed back: "welcome to freedom $headlibrarian. you'll like it here." it's been 3 years since that day and now when i get support requests from her it comes in the form of an email containing the answer she found on google and how she's having trouble with one of the steps. consequently, our professional dialogue has gone from hand-holding to learning together. best. day. ever. ~lp **edit:** oh my gosh you guys; this kind of a response i was definitely *not* expecting. i can't begin to thank you enough for your up-votes and kind words of support and perspective. thanks especially to the person who gifted gold, as a new reddit user, i'm still trying to figure this all out! i once managed a black-tie dining restaurant and one day my boss looked at me and said, "*lordpaddington, with every decision you must work toward setting others up for long-term success, failure to do so will invalidate you as a leader.*" it's one of the rules-of-thumb i now live by and what motivated my actions that day with $hl.a user called in a panic, they had a virus and the fbi wanted their information to start an investigation. i laughed, out loud into the phone, the user did not take that well. &gt; me: just cut of the internet and i'll send someone out to look at it for you. &gt; user: *in a peeved tone* good, you do that this isn't a laughing matter, obama's out to get all is christians you know and the fbi work for him. &gt; me: ok, i'm sure obama will understand if you cut you internet off for a bit. she mumbles something about doing it right now, i message one of the field reps that i know is nearby to go by and check her computer for me. *** the rep gets there and calls, normal procedure to update me, he's trying not to laugh as he begins talking to me. &gt; rep: hey did you tell her to cut her internet? &gt; me: ....off, i told her to cut her internet off until a rep got by to look at it for her. he busts out laughing and i hear her in the background ranting about how no one is taking this seriously. &gt; me: what's so funny? he calms down enough to inform me that she did indeed cut the internet off, with a pair of electrical snips. &gt; me: i don't find as much humor in that as i should, i... which cable did she cut? &gt; rep: all of them, except the power, she just unplugged it, but she cut the coax coming in from outside, all four cat6 cables.... &gt; me: did you remove the virus? the rep sounds like he is almost in tears now, i can her a bit of contagious humor in her rants now. &gt; me: well, is the virus gone? &gt; rep: yeah, it's gone i closed the popup window, the internet explorer popup window, it was a web page popup as.. &gt; me: well sod it all.... for once i hang up on the person calling me... the rep texts back that he got her straightened out and i get to explain to two managers why the virus server didn't detect the infection on a users computer. *inna waiting room waiting on an x-ray, figure this was more fun than answering work emails*it rule one: your coffee is golden. users coffee is bad. in it you’ll often find yourself holding a hot delicious brew whilst looking down at a computer with a liquid retention problem. &gt;“the fault here would be the coffee you’ve spilt all over it.” you’ll find yourself telling the user. **this conversation can go one of four ways;** &gt;1.the user denies ever spilling liquid on his/her computer. the evidence to the contrary is contested heavily, with an argument ensuing. the user then loudly proclaims your incompetence to the office whilst storming out, drips of liquid from the computer leaving a trail that you will *eventually* have to clean up. &gt;2.a bewildered user insists that you “just fix it back to how it was.” inevitably this user’s computer hard drive will have taken the largest sip of the coffee, thus rendering the hard drive inoperable. your attempts to contact the user to find out the contents of the hard drive will unfortunately fail. alas the user is so lost without his/her own computer that basic phone and email use has been temporarily forgotten. &gt;3.rarely a user of class arrives. they hand over the computer with grace, accepting they made a mistake and praying to the gods of recovery that you help them in their time of need. naturally fate deems these users too competent to use it services often. &gt;4.occasionally a rich user will arrive. they will toss down their computer with reckless abandon. the computer itself is usually a high-end model. being from a rich home, these devices usually have orders of magnitude more liquid then the cheaper counterparts as if the user himself challenged the device to work through a deluge of water/coffee/milk/etc. these users are busy people, they won’t have time for a repair, infact they’re so busy they’d usually rather not bother even paying you, as paying takes too much time. **to avoid these incidents happening in your workplace you could attempt the following:** &gt;1.issue everyone desktops. lock away the towers in a sealed container. —luck usually conspires against the it department that manages to lock away desktops, usually in the from of a manufacturers fault that requires every pc to be shipped back, therefore rendering the entire week of setup (to lock the towers away) useless. &gt;2.attempt to seal liquids away from users. — usually takes the form of signs informing everyone about the lack of liquids allowed near computers. these signs are quickly vandalised, however can be effective if you find the office busy body and allow them to enforce it. watch out for a user revolt/coup. &gt;3.try to enjoy the cleaning. — as you’re looking down at the third laptop of the week that needs to be dried and smells oddly of yesterdays socks try to remember, you’re getting **paid** to do this. attempting to pawn this job off to the lowest member of the it team will seed disloyalty. avoid disloyalty. &gt;4.enforce a zero expectations rule. — telling users, if the magic smoke has exited the device no amount of corralling will get it to go back in. unfortunately most users want results, not rules, so expect arguments, many many arguments. if you do manage to resurrect a computer that has taken a drink or gone for a swim, congratulations! you can now look forward to that zombie computer haunting your department forever. trust me. it’ll be back. [rule two]( a request came in on friday last week that 2 computer room's equipment needed swapping urgently. they are swapped at great speed with our amazing team pulling a massive effort and the important room is ready to go at the end of the day. we are told the non important room will have new occupants friday this week so we are inaging them today. this is where the person who is in the important room decides, without warning, that they must now use both rooms this week. even though it was agreed the non important room is out of action until friday. they went strait to our line manager and put in a complaint that the room was out of action. all i can say here is that i'm really glad we have a fully traceable helpdesk system. i spent 5 minutes with my line manager showing them the requests and agreements. all i am left with at the end of this is annoyance at the person who complained. they knew what was going on and how long it would take so could only have been trying to make us look bad. i just don't understand.qbg and i worked long and worked hard. machines were building while machines were unwrapped while machines were repacked - this time with larger address labels as per angie’s demands. the previously arid air infected by roland seemed more pleasant now that angie had declared he had "far more pressing duties to attend to". that didn't stop angie's persistence in micromanagement. each visit brought a new list of vices which had to be adhered to; her elephant-like memory seemed to retain every minor piece of misdirection she spluttered, her leathery face and tongue breathing fire at the slightest transgression. qbg and i pulled overtime on wednesday/thursday. our thanks came with a company-sanctioned pizza on one night, followed by an impromptu trip to the local chinese takeout the next. we both worked diligently for our cause until sometime on friday afternoon when the last batch of laptops sat imaging. the it cupboard looked like a bomb site. discarded baggies, hastily recorded cd-rs with various drivers on them, several cardboard cups which once contained cheap, cost effective canteen coffee and shreds of ill-cut tape and inners littered the floor. i sat on the trolley, gently rocked myself back and forth, thoroughly shattered as qbg lounged on the chair. our hands were grubby from the manual lifting, but we were finally done. we still had no idea if our plea for clemency from bhit was the real reason for roland’s absence, but were glad of the break. the last laptop completed its imaging process as i struggled to my feet. after loading the correct user profiles, we loaded the last box onto the trolley. we turned the lights out on the it cupboard as we rolled out the door which clanged loudly, echoing through the lifeless corridor as the electronic lock whizzed, sealing the cupboard with a tomb-like finality. as i pushed the trolley towards the mail room, again filled top to bottom with our efforts, the conversation turned to the conference next week. angie's plan of having a support presence seemed unnaturally forward-thinking, yet seemed to be yet another construct of some great demonstration of incompetence. we had no real idea of what we were expected to do there and we still had another 50 machines to image as reps waited. qbg and i had also realized that our unanticipated team-building time had come to an end; a valuable insight we would have never gotten had angie not interfered in the way that she did. but mired with her constant micromanagement, we were glad it was all over - for now. another monday morning! the rain and sleet smacked my windscreen as i could only think of the same old mantra, “i hate mondays!” its had arrived early at the conference centre to set up. our support booth spanned four tables which had been strewn with all manner of support-related paraphernalia. it looked like someone had raided some long-forgotten box of promotional material which now served to entice passers by. a sizable gazebo stood behind the dubiously supported makeshift tables housing the secondary support area. when i arrived, i found angie mid-lecture as some helpdesk underling, borrowed for the purposes of the day, had met her disapproval in some way. her shrill, demanding voice was evident even over the noise of the waiters and waitresses igniting several water heaters in anticipation for the impending delegates. angie’s constant barking continued up until our official open time of 10:00am at which time she scarpered to make-nice with some apparent acquaintances. it always amazed me to see her personality and body language shift so seamlessly when interacting with anyone who wasn’t, well, us! almost as soon as the hall opened, our first delegate arrived at the helpdesk brandishing a very familiar laptop bag. the delegate bore all the hallmarks of a vintage salesman; his suit was worn, distended around his stomach which showed obvious patronage to many miles behind his rep-mobile on motorways. placing the bag on the table, he stressed with a clear but jovial tenor voice that he had received it the previous week but was having problems with it. i ushered him into the back of our support area. our it setup seemed to impress him. the ghost server hummed proudly atop a stack of plastic boxes while stations demarked with chairs and table space offered spare network cables and power supplies already connected and waiting for their prospective tenants. “it’s like mission control in here!” the delegate quipped. with a confirmatory laugh, he added, “we have lift off!” the delegate presented his laptop. as i hooked it up, he withdrew a shabby blue-covered notebook, filled with scribbling, bits of paper and bound by a rubber band from the depths of his suit. peering through the frames of his rounded spectacles, he declared that he had a number of problems. he reeled off each entry on his list, as though sermonising from his blue notebook. the software, though it could open, was unable to load profiles or remember preferences which, though meant nothing to me, meant the world to a marketing guru such as this man. it also seemed to failed to synchronise in any way with the central database. while scanning through the laptop, i had also noticed mcafee was failing to update and the image distinctly lacked any installation of ms office. the realization that roland had indeed fudged the image was all too real. this was polarized by the sight near the helpdesk tables at 10:15. the queue seemed to extend to the far corner of the hall, all said the same thing. the rickety tables seemed the final barricade on the front lines as reps, brandishing the same laptop bags, came to voice their ails. tensions ran high as the word spread among the queuing reps. it had blown it; they’d screwed the pooch and messed up big-time! dissent spread quickly into the queue. our borrowed helpdesk guy was buckling. he was ill-equipped to deal with demand of this magnitude without the simple escape route of simply logging a call for escalation. i relieved him with the instruction to find angie. in the meantime, all we could think to do was accept laptops back en-masse and deal with the fallout later. the rear support area filled as some 200 machines lay piled as portrait of the enormous blunder. angie’s eventual reappearance was complemented with another bout of her ranting and raving; despite her inability to offer another solution, she stormed off in anger leaving us to somehow organise transportation of 200 laptops back to head office. two sales and marketing managers also appeared, demanding explanations and reasons for this mother of all fuck-ups. our borrowed helpdesk guy and i loaded the laptops into a hire van for their voyage back to the office. our drive back to the office through the rain seemed dark and depressing. the rain reverberated off the large metal hulk of the van only dampened by the cloth of the soft laptop bags. the only thing to look forward to now was another drenching skirmish through the office yard to return the laptops to their holding cells. **previous** [pt1: a new world order]( ) [pt2: safety first]( [pt3: the it induction from hell]( [pt4: undercurrents]( [pt5: how to make friends and...]( [pt6: marking territories]( [pt7: one friday to rue them all]( [pt8: best laid plans]( [pt9: its one step for man]( [pt10: ...and one step back for its]( [pt11: bring home the solider]( [pt12: who needs minor victories...]( [pt13: dawn of a new nightmare]( [pt14: rules of engagement]( [pt15: bring out your dead]( [pt16: the greatest trick the devil ever pulled...]( [pt17: who's the king?]( [pt18: now that's what i call a sticky situation]( [pt19: throw the dice]( [pt20: cardboard city]( [previous]( as i took gulps of coffee i considered my options. who would have the answer? i couldn’t choose between the two candidates. sure redcheer had this job created for her, but notie seemed so much better equipped. the head of hr saw me staring at the wall trying to choose between the two. she walked over. &gt;headhr: airz, great news!

well - you have a test hd pvr, we replace that for free. the three other stbs, plus the two modems are at your charge with standard discount. what about your phones?" &gt; giles: "all three are dead, but i only need two replacements." &gt; bytewave: "they were too recently upgraded, they'll be full cost i'm afraid. surely you have insurance for this?" as i ask, i look at the logs for all his devices. they all went dark simultaneously, in the evening two days ago. &gt; bytewave: "well, i'll make sure we get this done today, but i need to get the skinny here! home invasion, lightning strike or what?" &gt; giles: "yeah, big power problem. my surge protectors were conveniently disconnected and all my valuable electronics plugged directly in outlets when this went down. tvs, monitors, computers, ps4, even my frigging espresso machine died. the service call will have to be for the weekend, electrical work to be done first... and new locks." ... &gt; bytewave: "seriously, full story, now!" he sighs. &gt; giles: "things haven't been great with my girl. she kept saying i spend too much time 'playing with my toys' and not enough playing with her, whatever. she knew about my hobbies and i wasn't going to change my whole life just because we moved in together. few fights, then she just told me to choose between her or my toys. i was tired of it." &gt; bytewave: "so you handled that with tactful care to end things cleanly after a reasonable conversation about your irreconcilable differences, i assume?" &gt; giles: "i said 'toys, b****!', flipped her off and said she should find a new place by the weekend. then i blasted bad religion's 'i love my computer' on all the sound systems." &gt; bytewave: "i see. your *electrician* ex-girlfriend if i remember correctly? how'd that work out for you?" i grin teasingly. &gt; giles: "she stormed off to pack up her stuff, but as soon as i had to go for errands she unplugged my surge protectors, plugged everything to outlets and messed with some of them, then did some witchcraft on the electric panel and killed everything dead. not sure how, but it was essentially torn out of the wall. then she took a large hammer to my drobo, my sub-woofers, games collection, and the mini bar. she did spare the refrigerator." i look at him with a mix of confusion and horror. &gt; giles: "eh.. hippie who cried about clubbed seals. had a thing about not wasting food. she plugged it in my ups." ... &gt; bytewave: "well, i'm sure police will take *that* into account. wow, man, that's a hell of a pain in the arse, but it's a clear cut case, your insurance will cover everything?." &gt; giles: "my insurance won't cover 8 terabytes of data loss, soooo much stuff lost. plus i'm probably under insured for this level of damage, i'm assessing but i can only get 50k reimbursed." &gt; bytewave: "deep sympathies regarding data loss, i know how painful that is. at least she wasn't a firefighter, so your building is still standing, right? if you ever date one of them, maybe try some nice couples therapy? ... okay, you're set for replacements on sunday 1400-1700." he thanked me with a nod and left me to ponder about the vulnerabilities of my own home setup. i should get a nice secure server room one of these days. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](there's an hardware provider down in the states whom i must speak to once in awhile, mostly because their product is often defective and they're the only ones with the tools to confirm before i escalate - sometimes i need to email them evidence to get a confirmation. one day i'm talking to a guy there named tony lane. like everyone who works there, his full name happens to be 7 or 8 characters long, but i never thought about it. who questions the name someone introduces themselves as? admittedly, the last guy i talked to over there last was named john bass and the one before was i think gary dole, but coincidence, right? until he replies to my email... ... &gt; bytewave: "uh, tony, that email i just sent you.. was instantly forwarded to a sebastian jezierski, and you replied with that account. soo.. do i call you tony or sebastian?" &gt; tony: "oops. actually, my name isn't tony. it's sebastian, my bad. i wasn't supposed to reply this way." &gt; bytewave: "... either is cool with me, but i kinda want the story here." &gt; sebastian: "well i wouldn't tell normally but given it was my mistake, if you'll keep a small secret... yeah, sebastian. the company assigns us short and simple names. so that we spend less time when we have to give out our email addresses or introduce ourselves, call length is metered and all. it works pretty well, usually." and there i stand in silent awe by the fact he isn't the least bit surprised or flabbergasted that his employer is asking him to... lie about his name on every single call to shave off four seconds. it takes me about that long to regroup... &gt; bytewave: "... thank you sebastian, sorry for asking." i was still startled, but what is there to do with a revelation like this? beyond surprise, for once i had nothing up my sleeve.

[all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](sadly my first tale here is not my own, but was shared by a co-worker this morning. he received a call from our engineer claiming that windows was trying to delete his computer... he promptly walks into the office to find that no matter what the user clicked on, the "are you sure you want to delete x?" dialog appeared. without much thought he ran a quick virus scan, but nothing came up. he then suggested rebooting the machine to see if anything changed. as he went to reach for the power button, he noticed something... the user was using a laptop seated in a dock, the screen was open, and his was phone laying on the keyboard. the weight of the phone was just enough to press the edge down onto the delete key... he moved the phone off of the keyboard, and miraculously windows lost it's interest in digital genocide.so i work at a relatively small software development place, usually focusing on making web-based software-as-a-service solutions for individual customers. as such we're often asked to help with general tech support and database management. allow me to set the scene: it's early on a monday morning, everything is quiet and everyone is going about their usual monday morning routines, committing changes to live sites, catching up on easy tickets and the like. suddenly, the silence is shattered by the shrill sound of the telephone ringing. it gets picked up and i kind of zone out again, carrying on testing my current bit of work and listening to music. my interest is piqued when i hear my co-worker exclaim "the server is what?". everyone stops what they're doing and looks up, my co-worker on the phone has suddenly gone quite pale and wide-eyed. as it turns out, the customer's database server has been quietly smoking for the past half an hour or so, and someone finally realised that servers should not be smoking. but of course they wouldn't do the logical thing and turn the server off, oh no, they calmy and collectedly called us for a 5 minute ambling chat (this is quite normal for this employee from this firm), wherein they calmly drop the bomb that the server is currently smoking and if it isn't too much trouble if we could perform a off-site backup via remote desktop quickly. **tl;dr:** server starts smoking, customer leaves it for half an hour before thinking to call someone[previous]( fracking builders. &gt;gbuild: airz, we want out of the web filter. &gt;me: sorry, what? gbuilder had an annoyed expression on his face, he exasperatingly explained. &gt;gbuilder: when you hooked us up to the internet, all our computers go through your company filter, which blocks out words we builders search for all the time. i tried to think of anything our web filter actually blocked, almost nothing. &gt;me: er, what do you mean? the web filter doesn’t block keywords. &gt;gbuilder: well say we needed to look up the right screw…and we wanted to mate it with a wall, well your filter would block that search, because “nail and screw” are apparently “bad”. &gt;me: no… it wouldn’t, we only blacklist sites, we don’t search for keywords. the builder sighed, he didn’t seem that keen to end the conversation. i think he just liked talking. &gt;gbuilder: look, you’re really slowing us down with our prep. i think we should take this to upper management. can you schedule a meeting with your boss? &gt;me: i am the boss of it. the answer for “can you not go through the blacklist” is no. i thought about the sites on the blacklist and wondered what builders would need to access gambling or porn sites for. the builder did not looked pleased with my response. he pulled out his mobile phone and rang the vp. within moments the vp was inside my office. &gt;vp: airz, gbuilder. whats going on? &gt;gbuilder: airz has connected us up to the internet for our site office, but its being filtered so we can’t get the work done that we need to. the vp turned to me, his smile slowly growing. i thought i’d best get my side in. &gt;me: they’re not being filtered, only porn and gambling sites are blacklisted, as per company policy. &gt;gbuilder: we can’t search things like mating, and hammering. it makes the internet useless for a builder. &gt;vp: airz, you really should get rid of that nasty filtering. i thought about our companies internet setup. i smiled a little. &gt;me: okay, i can do that. the head builder started smiling, the vp however looked slightly confused. &gt;me: only problem is, all the websites they visit will be tracked… the smile dropped off the head builders face. vp’s confused face suddenly look much less confused. &gt;gbuilder: that's unacceptable! i can’t have people tracking what we do… &gt;me: why not? the head builder looked angry, his eyes started searching for a good response. &gt;gbuilder: trade secrets! we can’t have people being able to track how we do our craft. &gt;me: building things isn’t a craft. &gt;vp: i really think we should all take a step back… airz do you **really** want to know what builders look up? vp gave me a knowing look. &gt;vp: sometimes people work a little better when they’re not *stressed*. …. …. …. about someone looking over their shoulder. i was surprised the vp was taking this approach. it was oddly compelling. &gt;me: i er… guess we could work something out. did i just get convinced by… the vp? i need a coffee. [next]([previous]( i sat in head of hr’s office. looking around at the odd poster choices. half dystopian sci-fi half tropical beaches. strange. the head of hr sat opposite, behind her desk. she was giving me a resigned gaze. &gt;headhr: airz. i heard your little speech. just a tip, i would never swear at hr employees. they know every hostile workplace law backwards. you’re lucky they know you’re trying to help. &gt;me: oh. yes. swearing…. bad. my ability to form sentences was hampered by the fact i actually thought the hr employees in question needed a good swearing at. &gt;headhr: its not easy being in hr you know… the head of hr’s head turned from looking at the beach posters to my right over to the dystopian ones on the left. &gt;me: no. i imagine it’s about as fun as it, sometimes. &gt;headhr: human resources has it worse. trust me. i looked at the beaches on my right. i chuckled, and started to leave. &gt;headhr: don’t believe me? my day starts early when everyone comes into hr and by hand to submit their holiday leave forms. &gt;me: aren’t they… submitted electronically? the fact that “holiday forms” were considered bad. i couldn’t help but chuckle again. &gt;headhr: they could. but they don’t. they come here, to hr. always early in the day, to submit them, and whilst doing so they tell us about all their plans. how much fun they’re going to have, the tales they hope to come back with. i’ve heard enough holiday plans to start a travel agency. &gt;me: you don’t like talking? in it you get two types. the ones that don’t say a word and ignore you, or the ones that complain. i’d love to talk about holidays, that sounds relaxing. i looked again at the beach poster on the wall. i laughed… &gt;headhr: relaxing. trust me, once you’ve heard of all the great fun they’re going to have you’ll start wondering what you’re going to be doing during those weeks, then it hits you. you’ll be here. again. the head of hr stared forlornly at the beach poster. &gt;headhr: after the morning holiday planning session, you get to the complaints. two employees, always still half fighting walk into hr with respective bosses. everyone just looking at you to sort out their problems. no matter how fair you are, everyone always hates you just a little more after those meetings. head of hr looked at me. was she looking for sympathy? …. she was looking in the wrong place. &gt;me: in it, not only do we have to sort out everyone's problems but they *also* want us to come to them…. &gt;headhr: then comes the afternoon, you get people ringing hr just looking for jobs. you’ll tell them we advertise them in various places, but they won’t listen. they’ll tell you they need a job badly and then comes the story… head of hr’s eyes darkened and she started looking towards the dystopian posters. &gt;headhr: its always sad. you want to help, but you can’t. you’re literally forced to tell them the same thing as everyone else. but do you know the kicker? &gt;me: er… &gt;headhr: they’re usually lying. her serious face, her shock at the lies, i started laughing. hard. &gt;me: have you heard the excuses they give it? my screen cracked…not because i punched it but because of a manufacturing fault. my laptop got viruses because it didn’t pay off the hacker community. trust me, it’s worse. &gt;headhr: oh yeah? head of hr looked at me intently. &gt;me: at least 100 times worse. she started to smile. her entire chair swiveled round to face the beach poster. &gt;headhr: oh… good … at least someone understands then. head of hr seemed happy. i wasn’t though… bad cop rumbled. better get coffee i thought. ***** [next]( **new** comic [here]( full credit to /u/artzdept and /u/wuggy. discussion for the comic is [here]([previous]( as i stood in a crowd of designers and thought about a way to describe shoes i wondered if all jobs turned out this way. probably for me, they would. inspiration, i needed inspiration. i looked around for anything that could help. nothing. not even a poster was on the walls. &gt;me: shoes to me, define the man. i looked around the room, everyone seemed oddly interested. &gt;me: if on the street you see a man with no shoes, you don’t think what a cool guy. no! you’re reminded about homelessness. however if you see a man with great shoes, you envy his success in life. scarfy sat open mouthed staring up at me. i couldn’t think of another word to say, so i sat down. &gt;carefree: now that was excellent airz! …. carefree continued to chat about the design aspects, i tuned out after a while. i was happy just picturing the odd look of confusion and pain on scarfy’s face. ***** near the end of the meeting carefree opened up the floor for general questions. a designer with dreadlocks put up his hand. &gt;dread: what happened with the internet yesterday? carefree looked to me, i realised this was turning into a forum session. &gt;me: it went down, because water got into the line. &gt;dread: it was down for almost an hour, how is that acceptable? i looked over to carefree, waiting for direction on how to answer that question. &gt;carefree: i think we should be thanking airz, for getting the internet working again so quickly. the dreadlocked man looked a little sheepish after that rebuke but recovered quickly. &gt;dread: i saw you airz, wrapping a box outside in plastic. didn’t you know plastic bags are banned in this office? i wondered where the dreadlocked designer learnt my name from. i decided i didn’t care, about him or his opinions. &gt;airz: unfortunately, in this situation plastic is the easiest way of waterproofing the problem. &gt;dread: i think we should find a more sustainable way of waterproofing. i really didn’t care if he could find a way to do it without plastic. the internet was working, that's all i cared about. scarfy looked over at me with disdain on his face and decided he wanted to comment as well. &gt;scarfy: i agree with dread, we really shouldn't be sacrificing the environment, for internet. imagine all the toxic chemicals we could save if we could find a better way of doing things. i think sustainability is the key here at the office, polluting our surroundings with plastic and making us dependent upon plastic is damaging. i honestly didn’t know what he was trying to say. oddly though other designers were nodding their heads in agreement. carefree looked concerned. &gt;carefree: yes. i’ll get airz to look into it. for the environment. the meeting broke up after that, most of the designers left to start work again. carefree signaled me over. &gt;carefree: we gotta get rid of that plastic bag or there’ll be a riot. &gt;me: its literally the only thing keeping the internet up… &gt;carefree: try to think of a more sustainable solution?

"the [education department of state] won't let me log in to see my final marks!" "as in, you can't log in, or the marks are not there?" "i can't log in!" "oh, is your password ok? are you entering everything well?" "well, it's asking me for my student id, but i just graduated and i can't use that anymore!" "have you logged onto this website before with this number?" "yes..." "so it will still be the same number" "but i just graduated! the school doesn't use the id anymore!" "have you actually tried logging on with it yet?" *long period of silence...* "oh, it works now, all good!" this is why i drink.sadly in most workplaces and especially in call centres, it's not unusual for management to play hardball with sick employees, and it's all too common that it works. even the best job security still requires you to do your part. turn in doctor papers, get your illnesses documented, etc. but what happens when the nature of your illness prevents you from realizing you were ever sick? all too often you lose your job without even realizing what's happening. not here, not anymore. years ago, a frontline employee at my telco with many years of perfectly adequate employment slowly started behaving erratically. his name, andrew, started popping in senior staff's coaching reports. he randomly gave incredibly implausible diagnosis to customers. i listened to a call where he ranted lengthily about ufos when a customer's node was down. colleagues had already noticed he was very withdrawn and seemed to have stopped washing his clothes and all conversations with him ended in non sequiturs. then, andrew sometimes just got up in the middle of his shift and walked out. soon after, we noticed he started sometimes coming in on days he wasn't scheduled to work and took calls without pay! most critically, he insisted all was fine in the world; if anything he had started looking at *everyone else* suspiciously like if something was wrong with *them*. it was obvious something was seriously wrong with him and the union steward told his manager in writing he needed to be granted extended sick leave immediately and that the medical office should order an independent expert diagnosis of whatever afflicted him. scumbag manager instead focused on the fact he sometimes walked out of his shift without warning. any union employee can do that with mere notification at a moment's notice - an email will do - and it just gets taken off your sick days/hours - no biggie. but leave without *any* warning, and it's a fairly severe offense that rapidly escalates to suspension or being fired for cause. obviously the guy's sick though, no manager could possibly hold it against him, right? ... &gt; bytewave: "senior line, bytewave, you may send me your ticket." &gt; andrew: "oh, nevermind... i have to go. boss seems angry." what? i look down, i can see his desk from senior staff's upper half-floor. his manager is talking to him. he had a customer on the line, he actually sent me his ticket and then he just... hung up out of the blue and followed the manager (!) next to the manager's desk was a reliable and trustworthy guy. i get his extension and have him on the line in seconds. &gt; bytewave: "thomas, your boss is coming to his desk with andrew, i'd like you to keep this line live a minute and listen to what's going on. andrew shouldn't even be here by now, we're all worried. i'll erase this call from the recording software afterwards." thomas complies happily. within a minute, it's obvious what's happening. not only is his manager berating him specifically about the fact he recently left the floor without warning, but he says the magic number "5 times", grounds for 5 disciplinary letters, exactly enough to fire someone for cause. andrew clearly doesn't even understand what's going on from what thomas tells me in hushed tones, but he says he's *very agitated*. this is an obvious case of wrongful termination, any arbitrator will give us this one straight up, especially given the union had formally recommended he receive independent medical analysis. but it's way too risky when the guy is convinced all is fine in the world and may end up saying he left voluntarily. best force the issue. i dial the floor's union steward, mute him, and conference in building security. &gt; bytewave: "senior staff, priority call. we have a very agitated employee who must be taken to a secure room temporarily. suspect serious medical issue, please alert emergency services immediately." while the scumbag manager is still explaining what the letters in his hands mean, three building rent-a-cops walk into the floor like their life suddenly has purpose. it's not everyday they get to do something other than use the outdoor cameras to zoom on cute chicks walking down the street. [yes they really do that...] they swiftly take andrew to holding over the manager's protests, any medical crisis is *supposed* to trump management's say so. twenty minutes later paramedics and police are all over it, while the union steward has dragged the manager into the director's office. soon after, andrew is on extended sick leave and under care - against his will sadly, but his condition required it. we hadn't forgotten that management had been given written notice two months ahead of time about the problem, and much less what this specific manager tried to do with the info. plenty of grounds for a grievance. fast forward a year, the grievance is granted in arbitration, and the union's health and safety vp now has power to order medical examinations on advice of the council if management fails to act on such a recommendation - and the offending manager has been relegated to an obscure low-level position where he can do no harm. he's in charge of letters about contract changes notifications to customers - still too good for him, but at least out of my sight. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](friday 16.30 the clock in my office was ticking notoriously slowly. with sheer willpower i urged it to go faster. weekend i thought. the clock refused to move faster. annoying thing. i turned my attention to my blank inbox and queue. perfect. looking out into the department i could tell most people were waiting for me to leave. i too was looking forward to it. just a little longer. *bing* an email popped into my inbox. i frowned at it, and hoped it was spam. &gt;“my computers making weird noises.” - secretary. i read then re-read the email. it looked like a monday job. future airz could take care of this, i thought to myself. i quickly replied urging the secretary to turn off the machine and go home for the weekend. back to staring at the clock, which i could have sworn was going backwards. stupid thing, i bet it was cheaply made. *bing* another email! i’d grown tired of the constant flow all week. who sends emails on friday after three? sadistic b@#$#@#ds. &gt;“just wondering, can i get a new keybo....” should i just reply with a single line? i debated with myself. i decided a single word was more efficient. no. smiling to myself that i’d been so productive on friday afternoon i went back to harassing the clock with my stare. it defiantly wasn’t working. i considered replacing the clock entirely. *bing* three! three emails after 4pm on a friday. what the hell? since i was a model employee i opened this one as well, mentally noting that i deserved a pay rise. &gt;“i’ve lost my phone” -messy. oh darn. an email that actually requires attention. i frowned at the uncompromising clock and walked into it to find messy. **** messy was the newest employee of it. he seemed to have some non specific relation to someone else at the company. he always dressed extremely professionally, but he had this air of mess about him. his hair never seemed to be under control, he always had sauce of some kind on his face. yet oddly his suits always remained spotless. it was weird. arriving at messy’s desk i was inspired by how much clutter he’d managed to acquire whilst only being at the company a few weeks. &gt;messy: i swear i had my phone at lunch, and i had it when i got back to my desk. now its gone. &gt;me: have you tried calling it? messy had the receiver in his hand, he bashed his number so quickly into the keypad i could tell he’d been recently practicing. a lot. i was tempted to inform him of the redial button, but reconsidered as i saw his clearly determined smashing at the buttons. clearly stress relief. &gt;messy: it’s ringing but i cant even hear the buzz. i swear i haven’t moved from this spot. messy was throwing papers everywhere searching for it. i looked up at the clock in the department. it was already nearing 5 pm. what a good clock. perhaps i should replace mine with this one, i though to myself. &gt;me: i guess i’ll help. i got to my knees and started looking below the desk, whilst messy attacked the top with a passion. below his desk was a myriad of different objects. i even found a half eaten bagel, which i moved away with the end of a pen. &gt;messy: so thats were that went! messy looked down at the bagel i was dragging across the floor with my pen. he grabbed the bagel shoved it in his mouth. my face must have shown my disgust, he quickly justified his actions. &gt;messy: don’t worry, its fresh. it was yesterday’s morning snack. messy joined me on the floor as we searched. i tried to stay far as far away from the dirty old bagel that was hanging from messy’s face as possible. eventually after much searching we gave up the hunt. at this point most of the office had realized i wasn’t leaving, and gave up all pretext of “working hard” and just left. &gt;messy: darn it. it’s a new phone too. what am i gonna do now? &gt;me: ahh, can you think of anywhere else it could be? at the shake of messys head i had to shrug. nothing could be done. i wandered back to my office and looked up at my office clock again. 4.30. what the hell clock? i tried to justify leaving, since the other clock said 5. i couldn’t do it. my clock didn’t say 5. i sat back down at my computer dejectedly. one email was sitting waiting for me. four! i thought to myself. four emails after 4 on a friday! this was getting outrageous. &gt;“hey it, i turned the computer off. even unplugged it. it’s still making noises.” - secretary. huh. that is weird. i decided to call the secretary herself but she’d apparently heeded my earlier message to go home. i hiked up to her desk myself to take a look at the computer. it wasn’t making a sound though. shrugging, i decided i may as well take it down to it. as i carried it downstairs i heard the distinctive rattle of something wrong. something loose. entering the it department i caught messy just about to leave. &gt;me: give your phone one last try. you never know. messy grabbed the nearest phone and absolutely hammered the numbers into the keypad. the entire desk shook as he smashed down on it. as soon as it started ringing the computer in my hands started to rattle and vibrate. &gt;messy: i hear it now! &gt;me: it’s in here. passing messy the computer he looked at me confusedly. then proceeded to crack open the case. his phone was sitting in a hard drive bay. &gt;messy: huh... i shook my head as messy left for the day, wondering how he even survived in the real world. i didn’t have much time to ponder it, as it slowly dawned on me that my weekend must be starting. i entered my office to collect my things and looked gleefully up at the clock. 4.31. &gt;me: seriously! screw the clock, i thought to myself as i collected all my belongings and marched out the door. 4.31 is close enough to 5 pm on a friday in my mind. [previous]( -------------- as i started walking over to see colourblind, my coffee cup whispered to me. it had a devious plan to level the playing field. &gt;me: everyone wants everything to be fair. i said that out loud, to no one in particular. a few techs looked up from the desks, but the competition meant they didn’t have time to diagnose the nonsense i was saying out loud . not with a weeks holiday on offer. i got back to my desk and looked at the queue of tickets that hadn’t been picked up by anyone. it was empty. **new email** &gt; *due to the competition employee’s may not for the next week throw tickets back into the queue after taking them.* — airz, head of it. i smiled. time to make some tickets. i looked at colour-blinds ticket queue he had two open tickets. excellent three spaces to fill. **new ticket** &gt; *a tech needs to cross match every asset our internal asset list with the physical locations of the assets* - estimated time **60 minutes** physically checking every computer in the company, that might take a while… **new ticket** &gt; *a tech is needed to clean out every dust trap, in all the servers located in the server room.* - estimated time **60 minutes** just getting the keys for every rack in the server room would take hours. i took a sip of my coffee, mercy was probably the best approach. **new ticket** &gt; *one idea for the it consultant needed, anything at all.* -estimated time **60 minutes** i knew it would take about 3 seconds to think of an idea, but the other two would take probably days. i released the demons straight onto the it queue, sure enough colourblind’s account took all three tickets straight away. i then changed the settings so no one could re-dump tickets into the queue. i took a sip of my coffee. i smiled. fair did feel good. —————————— the afternoon began passing very peacefully, as i sat down at my desk to my late afternoon coffee, i dreamt about a world without jobs. it was weird. a knock at the door woke me from my thoughts. &gt;itsec: boss, hey. &gt;me: haha, you don’t have to call me boss down here. &gt;itsec: could i have a chat? since coffee was the only thing on my schedule, i invited him to sit down. &gt;itsec: so, umm i saw you sent, solitaire and hockey home… &gt;me: yeah, they where pretty stressed. &gt;itsec: you know how i came here, and i’ll admit didn’t know much about… computers and stuff. i took a sip of my coffee, where was this going? &gt;itsec: well, solitaire helped me a bunch. he made it so i could pick out tickets before they became available to other people, that way i could do the jobs i had knowledge of… &gt;me: wait what? &gt;itsec: i didn’t know how to do a bunch of things, so every ticket that came in, i’d have a 30 second window to take it before it would be available to everyone else. that way i could just take the ones…. &gt;me: so that's why every ticket starts its life on 30 seconds! i took a sip of my coffee. i couldn’t tell if it was angry, bitter or impressive coffee. &gt;itsec: yeah, the timer… anyway i’m just telling you because i realize i should be taken out of the race for the week off. since i can’t do everything, and its sorta cheating. &gt;me: mmmm… every ticket you get first pick of? &gt;itsec: i didn’t take all the ones i could do, just needed the leg up so i could be *semi* useful. i looked down at my coffee. it smelt good and honest. &gt;me: take the afternoon off. or whats left of it. &gt;itsec: and make sure you take me out of the running for the competition. its really not fair… now that i think about it. &gt;me: mmm, okay. now go home. i sat back in my chair. huh. its actually quite peaceful. ________________________ [next](reading [this story]( has just reminded me of my old fix-it script. we all know users never actually try restarting their pcs before calling us and lying to tell us that they have! this beings back memories of a place i used to work at where there were problems launching software every few days. back then, everyone on win2k or xp sp 1 - pcs on for weeks at a time with applications open for days at a time. due to this, i used to get inundated with support calls and used to psexec a batch file to pcs to "fix them". users were given warning to save everything ahead of time and then off it went. the contents of this batch file are as below: title computer recycle v1 cd \windows\system32 dir route print ipconfig /all type shell32.dll net view arp -a netstat -ano shutdown -r -t 00 essentially, go to system32, run a bunch of pointless crap to make the user think their issue was being fixed, then reboot! this little "toy" used to fix 8/10 problems on that otherwise stable network. on the occasions where it didn't work, we knew a helpdesk member was required and dispatched one immediately. to my knowledge, this is still being used today - nearly 7 years later, or at least was last year when i consulted for them briefly on a voip router upgrade. **edit: a huge thankyou to whoever guilded this :)** [previous]( i was annoyed, and not the good kind of annoyed, the “i’ve just spent half an hour on hold” kind of annoyed. the red headed lady was still sitting next to me. &gt;redcheer: so any other good ideas for my winnings? i had enough of being on hold. i could not care anymore, no internet was worth this. &gt;me: i err… pffft, nah. i can’t think of a good one. &gt;redcheer: fine. you know what? no coffee for you today, thats my winnings. i looked over at the break room, coffee would make this go faster. i considered dashing over and making a quick cup, i knew the operator would be back while im gone though. its a curse. carefree made his way over to me, as if sensing my distress. &gt;carefree: airz, any eta on when the internet will be back, the designers are getting antsy. &gt;me: no idea i’m afraid, i’m on hold. &gt;carefree: you look frazzled, give me the phone, go take a break. &gt;redcheer: no coffee though. i looked over at the break room, without coffee it wasn’t worth walking over. i decided instead i’d step outside, and let the rain and cool air refresh me. the red haired lady decided she’d follow. hearing the rain, breathing the sweet air i felt a little better. seeing clearly again i looked over at the communication pit outside the office. &gt;me: whats that…. plasticky thing coming out of the ground over there? &gt;redcheer: mmmm no idea. the rain was coming down hard, i ran over to the pit. a bunch of cords were coming out of the pit and into a plastic container, then hoping over the fence of the property and making a beeline for the communications room. the container was filled with rain. &gt;me: huh. i poured the rain out of the container and looked into the plastic hell. connections everywhere. i heard a shout from inside. &gt;redcheer: i think they’re saying the internet is working again airz. i looked down at the plastic container in my hands, and the wire strung across the front of the building. not buried, not covered, just strung. this was just… i put the container back on the ground and made my way inside. &gt;redcheer: no, no it just stopped again, weird. the plastic was slowly filling with rain again. &gt;me: i need some plastic bags and a bunch of tape. &gt;redcheer: oh, we don’t really do… plastic here. i thought about the time she told me they didn’t do plastic cups here. seemed like a similar situation. &gt;me: seriously though, i need plastic bags and tape. &gt;redcheer: seriously to you. we don’t have plastic bags. i can get tape. &gt;me: ahhh i’ll go ask carefree, can you get the tape? &gt;redcheer: you know, after being in the rain i was gonna let you get coffee to warm up, but now… still no coffee today. i walked over to carefree and asked about the plastic bag situation, he said they didn’t have any. i felt a little bad. &gt;me: i’m going to have to go to the store, to get some plastic bags. &gt;carefree: should… i stay on the phone? &gt;me: probably a good idea. as i walked to the store, i realized i couldn’t physically get any more soaked. i thought about going in and asking for just some plastic bags, but it felt wrong not buying anything… &gt;me: one coffee, and some plastic shopping bags please. &gt;storeowner: sorry, a coffee… and? &gt;me: just a few shopping bags please. i pointed down at the shopping bags, the owner was very confused. &gt;storeowner: sooo you want the coffee in the bag? &gt;me: er, no. i just want a few bags. &gt;storeowner: sorry… okay. the owner then proceeded to make the coffee, and then puts the coffee cup into a shopping bag. &gt;me: thanks. could i get a few more bags please? the store owner then takes the coffee which is inside a bag, and places it inside another bag, which he then places inside another bag… &gt;me: errr… thanks. i tried to smile as i held my coffee surrounded by 5 bags. i tried to sip…. plastic was in the way. i took my coffee out of the five bag protection. as i walked back to the office i saw my coffee slowly getting weaker and colder from the rain. i shouldn’t have taken it out of its plastic protection. getting back to the office, red haired lady walks over with some tape and a mug. &gt;redcheer: airz, you're soaked. i brought you a coff... she looked at what i was holding and just handed me the tape. &gt;me: thanks. she stormed off. i didn’t have time to work out why, i decided the internet needed fixing. pronto. i went outside with my plastic and tape, poured the water out of the plastic container again, then covered everything in plastic and tape. i added layer upon layer. as i walked back inside, i could see the internet had indeed started working, i saw carefree still on the phone to the isp. &gt;carefree: oh, it looks like its working now. should i stay on the phone? i took the receiver out of his hands and promptly hung up. &gt;me: you look frazzled. go take a break. i smiled, and got one in return from carefree. i looked down at my coffee and took a sip. problem solved. everything was good. right? [next](i used to work for an engineering company. but of course there were folks in finance and other infrastructure departments who were not familiar with technology. the entire it department was in a locked area. about half the company was in a locked area of one kind or another because we did classified work for the government. standard operating procedure for us. each closed area had an alarm keypad and door combo keypad next to the door. most areas also had a phone hanging on the wall next to the door so you could call the person you wanted to see to let them know you were at the door. no doorbells, not workable given the size of the locked areas and the fact that there could be over 100 people in there. the manager of the it department had her office outside the door. so some woman had to come see someone at the helpdesk one day. she had to pick up a laptop or something. so she’s told where the door is and to use the phone to call the person when she gets there. she shows up, fails to see the phone hanging next to the door but sees the alarm keypad. she punches in the guy’s phone number on the alarm keypad and starts yelling into the alarm keypad. wtf. the manager was in her office and came out to see if she could help the dingbat. the fallout from this was that the manager jumped down the neck of the helpdesk staff to be more user friendly. we had to move the phone 6 inches closer to the door. put a huge sign with big red letters and a big red arrow that said phone on it. put a bigger sign on the door with everybody’s extension on it. all because this one woman was too stupid to recognize a phone and use it properly. i initially planned to post this only to /r/skyrimmods because it's very niche, but it's really a tech support story too. i used to do quite a bit more side-work as a for-hire general purpose it guy. few years ago, i no longer needed as much money and raised my rates to ensure my workload would be lessened and what was left was more profitable. i had some faithful customers who kept relying on me as needed. recently, on that basis, i got the most fun private job i was ever offered. &gt; customer: "yeah, i remember all the times you helped me out. last time we were chatting, you mentioned you played skyrim and stuff. i googled the email address on your business card. you don't just play, do you? you're a known modder?" &gt; bytewave: "i suppose i am, yes. i've contributed to some projects. mostly [step]( what can i help you with?" &gt; customer: "i just love this game. i tried modding it on my own but it crashes all the time now. i need a professional. just emailed you my load order." ... 330 mods, 220 esps. that's a very heavily modded game, those only stay stable if you really know what you're doing. the scripting engine for that game is incredibly temperamental. throw too many mods at papyrus and you end up with more ctds than playtime. it's the big secret to modding skyrim. you need to be aware at all times of what scripts will be running and keep it light if you want a stable load order. scriptless mods don't really hurt - my skyrim install is over 50 gigs because of heavy textures and yet never crashes. &gt; bytewave: "yup, i see the problem. papyrus overload. need to make some choices here. your worst problem is the amount of scripts running while you're in combat, bet you ctd often when casting spells?" &gt; customer: "suspected as much, and figuring that proves you're the guy i need. look i'd like you to build an install up from scratch, i just emailed you a list of what i can't live without, and what would be nice. then you rebuild the install on a ssd i'll give you, and you test it - heavily. like, do a completionist playthrough, this isn't a rush thing. look for little issues and fix them. once you're confident everything is pretty much right and up-to-date, hand it back to me. and for the love of god fine-tune the enb, i can't get everything to look right everywhere, i'm so tired of trying to do that." ... the email in question lists dozens of 'critical' mods. everything from voice-activated shouts in dragonspeech to interesting npcs. texture and weather mods. enb calibration. thankfully the must-have list was actually rather light on papyrus-heavy mods, and most of it was entirely compatible with [step, a project i'm well familiar with.]( it's the core of every of my own skyrim installs. i contribute there some under another name. &gt; bytewave: "modding an install this size alone takes quite a few hours. testing it properly is the kind of thing only true hobbyists put in. a completionist playthrough on skyrim takes a couple hundred hours. we're also going to make a few compromises, i have script-light alternatives for a few of your mods. but you know my new hourly rates, given how big a job this could be, are you sure you.." &gt; customer: "yup, don't really care. i'm retired now. not taking any money to heaven. your new rate, no matter the hours if the quality is there." ... i was just about to tell him that since i love playing that game and it was a big contract, i was willing to slash my usual rate but... well i'm only human. he's ready to pay full price, i'll take it. told myself i'd focus extra hard to make it utterly kickass to make sure he got his moneys' worth. and i did. i can't know what other modders managed to pull off, but i doubt there are as many skyrim installs that are as expansive yet stable than the one i built him and then tested for two months. much fine-tuning during the test phase, but at the end, i thought it was damn close to perfect. was wonderful because i had not only gotten paid for modding and testing a game i love, but also got to use the work for my own use as the basis of my new skyrim install. it was both the biggest contract i got in years and yet one of the most fun - even though like with any skyrim load-order this heavy, there were dozen of minor issues i had to pick apart one by one. everyone who ever saw a briarheart with invisible torsos or crashes around sky haven temple will understand. i did troubleshoot installs before for my own enjoyment, and it was incredible to know that this time around i was being generously paid for it. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!]([previous]( an it meeting with the vp, what wrong did i do to deserve this? the vp had decided against my strong objections to implement an it competition for who could complete the most tickets. &gt;vp: this competition will measure who is the fastest it person at the company, it will run for one week. you can choose any ticket in the queue, and you may have up to 5 open tickets at once. &gt;itsec: won’t some tickets take no time and others hours? &gt;vp: airz will assign every ticket an expected time, and we’ll monitor who is doing the harder and easier work. &gt;solitaire: when does the competition start? the vp looked kindly over at solitaire. &gt;vp: monday! remember the winner will receive one paid week off. &gt;me: sorry what? we never discussed a prize… the vp looked at me and smiled. it was pure evil. &gt;vp: gotta motivate the troops. the vp walked into my office, and asked me to follow. &gt;me: a week off, very generous. however won’t it cause chaos fighting for tickets? &gt;vp: you’ll just have to assign fair values to each ticket… &gt;me: and how do you expect me to do that, without completing every ticket before handing it over to the department. &gt;vp: simple. the vp opens up the ticketing software. &gt;vp: see it has this expected time drop down menu now. so for this ticket… **new ticket** &gt;*my password needs resetting.* — marketing lady &gt;vp: we would select the 10 minute option. i looked down at the drop down menu, six options where available. ten minutes to one hour, in ten minute intervals. &gt;me: errrrr, what about things that take you know… longer then an hour? or an unknown amount of time. &gt;vp: everything is fast in it, nothing takes longer then an hour, everything is structured. &gt;me: wanna bet? the vp didn’t answer so i decided he meant yes. &gt;me: try this ticket… **new ticket** &gt;*the internet is broken, we’re pretty sure its the isp* — accounting &gt;vp: that’s easy, just call the isp and get them to come fix it. i smiled, this was going to take hours, i quickly did a ping check of accounting, they where on the network, the network had an internet connection. &gt;me: so you’d start with… the vp picked up the phone and handed it too me. &gt;vp: ring the isp! after waiting the requisite time, about 20 minutes we got onto a tech from the isp. &gt;me: just wanted to check our internet is up. &gt;isp: sir, do you get internet pages loading? &gt;me: yes. thanks for your time. i didn’t want to mess too much with our internet because i knew it was working, but the twenty minute wait was proof enough that some tickets take and unknown amount of time. &gt;vp: airz! give me that. the vp snatched the phone off me. &gt;vp: our internet isn’t working, and you fools need to come down here and fix this s&amp;%$. &gt;isp: sir, we need you to run some basic diagnostic…. &gt;vp: no! we’re our own internal it and they promise me that…. &gt;me: vp!!!! &gt;vp: airz if you’re going to distract me while i’m fixing stuff get out! &gt;me: the internet is working! i…. &gt;vp: get out!!! the vp seemed genuinely mad, i didn’t want have to put another it staffer though what i thought was an exercise. so i pushed the hangup button on the phone. &gt;vp: what are you doing?! i needed them to come here. &gt;me: the internet is working in accounting. &gt;vp: no, the isp hasn’t sent someone out, how is it magically working now? &gt;me: did you ring the staffer to make sure it was actually the isp’s fault? &gt;vp: errrr…. the vp lost a lot of his anger after that. he decided to call the staff member. &gt;vp: hello this is it, we’re ringing about the internet problem. &gt;acc: oh my god, you’re so slow! i submitted my ticket exactly 37 minutes ago. what the hell were you doing? &gt;vp: i … do you know who i am? &gt;acc: someone down in it? &gt;vp: this is the vp, and i’m calling to solve your internet problem. &gt;acc: oh…. the silence on the phone lasted about 20 seconds. &gt;acc: its fixed. &gt;vp: what do you mean, its fixed. &gt;acc: you must have fixed it. good job vp. you’re the best. the vp smiled when he heard that. he hung up the phone. &gt;vp: see… 38 minutes and its solved. &gt;me: err… &gt;vp: no job takes over an hour. &gt;me: are you sure its solved though? the vp didn’t answer he just left. with a week’s free vacation on the table and whole bunch of tickets to rank i was going to have a “fun week”. [next](working as tech support for a large company with many remote workers. one of the reps called with problems with his broadband. we had sent him a new preconfigured router which he should have been able to plug in and go. he called after not being able to get a connection, we go through all the usual diagnostics and reach the point where i need to ring the broadband supplier. (uk telco, begins with v, can't spell phone) we join our hero on the second call after all diagnostics have been done by the first call and all that was needed was a appointment for bt to come out and check the line. cs = customer service rep &gt; devish : so can we organise bt to come out then please? &gt; cs: i just need to check a few details please, what is the username and password you are using to access the router. &gt; dervish: currently it's set to admin and admin, that's not the problem, we can access that page, the adsl light is on solid so it has a synced, the problem is happening when we give the users credentials, which we know to be correct &gt;cs: ok, i just need to check a few more things, what address are you going to to access the router? &gt; dervish: currently connecting to it on 192.168.0.1 &gt; cs : i'm just going to ping the router to check it's online. at this point the call has been going on for 20 minutes, i figure it's best just to let him get on with it. &gt; cs: ok, i've pinged the router at 192.168.0.1 and it's responded to the pings so we know the router is online. ??? &gt;dervish: sorry, did you just say you pinged the 192 address? from your computer? &gt;cs: yes, and it responded so we know the router is online, it must be some other problem. &gt;dervish: so you pinged 192.168.0.1 from your computer and got a response. are you sure that that is the customers router? &gt;cs: oh yes, there was a bit of a lag but the router is definitely there. at this point there were a few incredulous questions to determine if i really was hearing him correctly, yes i really was, he did think that pinging 192 from his computer would somehow find the customers modem. i then decided that i couldn't cope with any more diagnostics and arranged the bt visit and got off the phone quick. we have a strict policy for *all* employees. your company e-mail address is [firstinitial][middleinitial][first6oflastname,orentirelastnameif6orlessletters]@[company]. so al b. clayton = abclayto@company and dan e. fish = defish@company. no exceptions for anyone, no matter who you are. the nephew of someone in top manglement started work yesterday (nepotism... it will never die), and his email is hijack@company. [not his real email, but the real one is equally embarrassing. must keep things anonymous.] i got an angry e-mail from his uncle asking for it to be changed. i replied to uncle i didn't create the policy, i merely obeyed it, and his nephew's e-mail is what it is. uncle didn't like that answer apparently. he just woke me up at 3:30 a.m. (well, where uncle is it's 6:30) calling my company-issued cell phone to burn my ear about it. that phone is supposed to be used for emergencies only and i've never been called at night on it before. i was polite -- don't want to scream insults at top manglement -- but now i'm awake and pissed. my boss already said that no exceptions will ever be made to the policy. it is set in stone. back to sleep... or trying to anyway. grrrr. update: found out two crucial facts. (1) my boss is a relative of the company president, so he'll never be fired. smart man, the president, to put a highly qualified relative in charge of the it dept. (2) the nephew has asked for his middle name not to be used, which has left him with a much more palatable e-mail address. bossman approved that, since we have people with no middle name so he can still use his ironly inflexible system of naming. so this is a thing that started at the $bigboxstore i was a bench tech at, and it's carried forward for years now. this isn't *just* the usual "here's a funny story" or "god this user is stupid" story, this is about making stuff better. spread this theory around, because it's awesome, and it works. $bigboxstore runs a private forum where techs across the company can interact easily to get help and tips whenever they run into problems they can't solve on their own. one such thread was an asking "is xxx from drd a member on these forums? we just got a hard drive back from drd and the customer wants to know how to thank you." where the xxx was the tech's initials, and drd is the data recovery place that we send dead hard drives to for forensic data recovery. xxx responded with "i like swedish fish" - and the customer mailed him a large quantity of swedish fish as a thank you. from this point on it became proper etiquette to "expedite" a forensic data recovery with the inclusion of candy in the package sent out for recovery. we would see drives sent with candy coming back in half the time of one sent without candy. customers would look at us like we were crazy when we told them "we can expedite this $250 recovery for $3 of candy," but they would usually say yes, because "if it worked it was only $3 and if it didn't, it was only $3." ---------------------------- flash forward a couple of years: customer of mine breaks the cmos battery mount off their mobo. get my hands on the computer pull the board, get the rma lined up with the mfg just to see if they'll do it. the mfg's normal turn-time is 2 weeks (my customer was unhappy about this, and i basically tell the customer that they only have themselves to blame - there are definite perks to being your own boss). i have a brain wave and think "it can't be **only** $bigboxstore employees who like free candy" so i toss a big bag of assorted candy into the box and ship it off. 3 days later i get an email from the mfg they've received my rma. next day i get an email saying my board is on it's way back. next day, receive bnib motherboard. holy shit, it totally works. customer is beside herself to get the computer back so fast, and i was stunned. ----------------------------- later that year i have a watercooled rig die. the pump blew catastrophically, psu get's flooded with coolant (non-conductive), and it's the only thing that dies (probably from the pump blowing). this time i decide to document it. get the rma lined up with the psu mfg, and send it out with a big bag of candy and a friendly note. comes back a little over a week later with a brand new psu, even though mine got soaked. ----------------------------- a different customer has a psu that dies from a dr pepper getting dumped through it (luckily the psu caused the dr pepper to re-direct out the back of the case and nothing else died) . send it out with candy and a friendly note. get's rma'd without issue - i even get an email thanking me for the candy. ----------------------------- so seriously guys, let's make sending candy out with stuff the norm - as most of us know, it is pretty thankless, so getting free candy is a pretty great way to treat each other better, because a little bit of candy goes a long way. ----------------------------- [edit] thanks to the person for the gold. i've never gotten any before.i worked on a project running two different systems at different security classifications so the users had two machines and two monitors (one for each machine). we received a call from a user stating that they were not able to copy and paste files. the user was right clicking &gt; copy on the mouse on one system, unplugging the mouse from one machine, plugging it into the second machine and then trying to right click &gt; paste. so i worked as a repair technician for a couple years. we had contracts with local schools/businesses that had company phones, computers, tablets, and other tech devices to provide tech support and/or in-house hardware and software repair. one day we got a call from a man saying that he accidentally forgot to take his work phone out of his pocket before he jumped in the ocean. now if you've ever dealt with liquid damaged devices, you know how dodgy they can be as far as getting them back up and running. sometimes they'll get a drop of liquid in them and will never be able to come back on. while sometimes they'll be lost at the bottom of a lake for a week and all you have to do is dry her out and put a new battery in and it works good as new. so this guy calls and i tell him the procedure- do not try to turn it on or charge it, immediately power it down and take out the battery and let it sit for one to two days. &amp;nbsp; guy: ok i can definitely do that. also, i read online that putting your phone in rice can help water damaged phones. me: nothing is guaranteed when it comes to wet electronics. but rice can absorb moisture pretty well. which is why sometimes you'll see it in salt shakers in diners. guy: seems kind of strange, but ok! i'll bring her in in a few days. &amp;nbsp; couple days pass. and a man walks in to the front counter holding a large looking object (we have cameras that display their view from the back where the work benches are). i think maybe some guy wants us to fix a printer or old computer or something. i walk up front and recognize the mans voice as the one who jumped in the ocean and i immediately think *oh for fucks sake* &amp;nbsp; guy: well i read some stuff online about keeping your phone in rice and i couldn't imagine how that would work. huh. well i guess you let the tech guys keep doing tech things. i'll tell you what, keeping this thing plugged in for two days probably ran my electric bill up a bit! he proceeds to open up a **rice cooker**, steam pouring out of the top as if he just unplugged it, and fished out his phone from the bottom of a 4 inch deep sea of steamed rice with a pair of tongs. &amp;nbsp; tl;dr- guy gets phone wet. looks online for help, says to put phone in rice. guy puts phone in rice...in a rice cooker...for two days nonstop. &amp;nbsp; **edit**- wow i had no idea this would get this much recognition. thanks reddit! just wanted to clear up a couple repeated questions: 1) no, the phone did not work. we tried to save it but we were ultimately unsuccessful. funnily enough, we actually saw that the most damage inside the phone, as some of you pointed out, was from the ocean salt and *not* the continuous steam. saltwater leaves a very specific type of corrosion on the electronics, and if anything, the steam and pressure may have actually 'washed' some of it away (albeit causing many other problems in the process). 2) yes, the old (uncooked) rice trick does actually still work. does it work very well? meh. are there better options? absolutely. if you're in a pinch and don't have quick access to silica gel packets/silica-based cat litter, or a repair shop, then it's your best bet against saving anything. 3) yes, this story is 100% real. you have to understand the sheer level of incompetence that people *still* have with *computers*, which even though they've been in people's homes for 20+ years, we still get all of these horror stories in r/talesfromtechsupport. now translate that to smartphones, tablets, and laptops, which have been around for less than half of that. you'd be shocked at the things we saw every single shift, week-in and week-out. this one was obviously the most insane and was the first to come to mind- but don't worry, i have more stories to tell! whenever i get some time after work i'll try and write up some more :) cheers!okay this is by far one of my fav stories and i tell it at work often as a 'tale of woe and caution'. the scene. my retail, that also does tech support for our stuff, store. sunday afternoon about thirty minutes before close. the players. (and yes the details are important). tsv (me) a 5‘2 size 00 chick. darren (customer) easily 6‘4 muscled guy. looks like the stereotypical bodyguard sort with his black on black suit, shaved head etc. guys biceps are as big as my head. jeff. coworker playing 'captain of the ship' in the tech area. the game. dialogue is paraphrased but the gist is correct. so i'm doing my thing fixing user error issues, the occasional software restore, and so on. oddly quite for a sunday. but whatever. jeff: hey tsv do you think you can take one more before you go (i was supposed to be off the floor in about five minutes to go do some paperwork that was actually done so yeah i could) tsv: what's up? jeff: got a guy with a phone that was broken needs to replace it. no appointment. tsv: sure. bring him on. jeff brings over big guy. huge guy from my pov. i firmly invite him to grab a seat as it's the only way i can look him in the eye (for those that don't read my retail stories i'm partially deaf so half my hearing is lip reading) tsv: hi, i'm tsv. dude: darren. (not real friendly, but not pissy tone) tsv. nice to meet you darren. jeff tells me your phone was broken, sorry to hear that. let's get you set up with a new one. okay (yeah this is how the company makes us talk) darren kind of nods, pulls out the phone. now this model has a glass front and back. both are shattered. total spider web. he hands it to me and a quick look shows that it won't turn on and the external liquid tags are screaming red. yeah it's dead, time to bury this dog. tsv: i need to take this in the back for just a moment okay. darren nods again and i notice that his lip is shaking. dude can hulk smash me like a fly and he honestly looks like he's about to bawl. over a phone. wtf? so i make quick work of going to the back, popping the back off the phone, get the serial and look up the warranty and part. i put the phone back together as best i can, pop out the sim and put the unit in a static bag for the moment in case any glass decides to pop off. back to the floor i go. tsv. okay darren. i was able to get the serial and my system shows that you have (warranty thing) so a replacement is just $50. since you have att transferring your number will be a breeze since it's on the sim card. i have you out of here in just a few minutes. darren: okay (pulls out his wallet and hands me cash). what about my numbers and photos and stuff? can you get those? tsv: (i hate this part it never goes well) unfortunately the phone is very water damaged and won't power on so there's no way for us to retrieve any information i brace myself for the yelling darren: my wife is going to kill me. she's an ex seal. she's good at killing people when she needs to. she's going to (cue a swear word filled rant that would make colin farrell blush. mostly directed at himself. some at the universe in general.) darren: i'm an idiot. she told me to back up the photos. she said folk's phones get stolen in vegas all the time. she kept nagging me so i said i did it. she's going to find out i lied and they will find my body in like a hundred pieces. i get him to calm down and tell me the whole story, half out of a perverse interest and half because he clearly needs to confess his 'sin' and i'm the priest. he's not yelling or anything so okay i'll listen darren is ex military and the last of his buddies was getting married so as a bachelor party they went to vegas for the weekend. it's not uncommon as we are in la. you can drive up pretty easy or find a cheap flight almost any time. the night before they were out drinking etc and the phone took a drop into a stone bottomed fountain. now why was darren so flipping out. it wasn't over the phone but the data. see darren was the (generally) happy father of a baby boy. a three week old baby boy who popped up a little early so the mother in law came to help mom so darren and the boys could have their party. how nice etc. but before he left, mom had reminded him to back up the photos, the only photos of darren jr, to the computer in case something happened to his phone. she had reminded him several times but he was too busy thinking about vegas to be bothered. and yes darren told his wife he did it. and now she was going to kill him. having seen darren i'm a tad worried about a woman he's scared of. now our company has a backup/sync service that if all goes well will save your stuff nightly. i figure what's the harm in checking if he had it on. there's a part of it that does save photos although it's not on by default. i don't tell poor darren about it because i don't want to get his hopes up. darren: (finally out of steam) oh well, it's my fault. time to face it like a man. tsv: that's the spirit. your wife will be mad but i'm sure she loves you and will forgive you, after a lot of grief of course (this actually gets a chuckle). and he's only a few weeks old, you have plenty of time for taking more photos. darren: yeah (not quite convinced he's not a dead man) i ring him up for the phone, power it on. get to the screen for him to log in. at this point he just thinks he's setting up the new phone like normal. and what to my wondering eyes do appear. but a backup made the night before his trip. tsv: well that's interesting. there's a backup listed in (our system) for your phone. last updated thursday night. darren: i don't remember doing that. tsv: you probably set it up when you first got it. that was months ago so it's easy to forgot. plus it runs on its own so you don't have to do anything other than plug your phone into power. it might just be contacts and notes. but why don't we try it. can't hurt. darren: okay if you think we should tsv: (knowing the camera roll is on by default if full backups are) i do. jump ahead about five minutes and the phone reboots to load whatever it just downloaded. darren: hey all the apps i had are there. tsv: waiting to download but it knows what to get darren: if it knows that could it have my photos? tsv: let's look. he taps the gallery app. darren: those are my photos. old photos. wait those aren't as old. those are the photos. you saved my photos. you saved my life. darren is so thrilled he jumps up and grabs me and hugs me. remember he's got a foot and a good hundred pounds on me so he literally lifts me off the ground in the process. i thought my lp guy was going to explode. darren realizes about a split second later he probably shouldn't have done that and puts me down and steps a noticeable space back. he thrusts his hand out to shake mine. darren: you just saved my life. literally. my wife is an ex seal. tsv: so you said. i'm glad it worked out. now be sure to back up those photos when you get home darren: yeah i learned my lesson. i'm never lying to my wife again. tldr: guy drops phone with very important photos on it into water. had lied to wife about them being backed up. i look like a goddess cause i get them back via online backup service he didn't know he had set up. man vows never to lie to wife again. my job is done. [previous]( every year. every darn year they host a christmas party. as i walked onto the executive floor, i wondered how i got roped into planning the yearly christmas party. i remember being in my office, then a nice lady stopped by to chat about the christmas plans, then suddenly i'm on my way to planning meetings. if i were not a man of science i'd say it was witchcraft. the nice lady saw me walk in the meeting room door. &gt;nice: airz! you made it. &gt;me: yeah, about being on this committee... &gt;nice: i'm so glad you joined. we can work together to make this the best christmas party ever. as i wondered how you could have a committee with only two people, i looked into her eyes. they were hypnotic, it was odd. nice too. &gt;me: oh.... can't wait. i smiled, it felt odd to smile without coffee nearby. &gt;nice: what should the theme of the party be? &gt;me: theme, theme... i had no experience with parties. usually i expect a fully stocked bar, some music and perhaps food. theme was an entirely new concept. &gt;nice: it would be nice to have a theme, that way everyone can dress up. &gt;me: oh. i looked into her eyes again. the stared back at me expectantly, unlike coffee they actually wanted something from me. &gt;me: how about... prince and princesses? or just a color? maybe everyone could come as their favorite drink? &gt;nice: no no, they all seem to generic. i want something fun, something new. she started staring at me again. &gt;nice: oh my! &gt;me: what? &gt;nice: we should have an it themed party. &gt;me: it theme? &gt;nice: everyone can dress up as computers or printers. you can judge peoples costumes since you're an expert on the subject. &gt;me: haha, maybe we could think of another idea... &gt;nice: i really like this one. i think it'll be a winner. i looked at the nice lady. she seemed genuinely excited. i could have said that a company filled with user's like ours wouldn't appreciate an it themed party, but the words got lost in her eyes. &gt;me: er... if you think so. &gt;nice: great! you'll be an awesome judge. although as a host you better have the best costume. as she poked her tongue out teasingly i felt an emotion bubbling up from the inside. it was warm. is coffee an emotion? [next](i’m an information security consultant, telling some clients what they need to do or implementing those solutions. i did an risk assessment around 2 years ago where we looked at the standards they were trying to meet, scanned their networks for vulnerable machines and looked for missing controls and weak practices. anyway, we found a bunch of high vulnerabilities, validated almost all of them, made a detailed report with some recommendations, which we offered to do for them as an additional engagement. i went on to another engagement, then another firm and forgot about them. until this week. my cell phone rings. i answer and get a barrage from it director andy and compliance director cheryl. it’s not unusual for me to have impromptu calls from clients where they expect me to know them by voice, so i often listen and hope to figure out what’s going on and who it is by context. 45 seconds into the conversation, i figure out the client. i’m torn between telling them to never bother me again and seeing if there’s some current work to get out of them. i figure it’s time to tell them that i’m no longer working for the same company and neither is my old boss. andy:”figures. who should we talk to?” me:”well, the report should be self explanatory” cheryl:”can you explain why the same findings came up in the tests from this year?” me:”that could be that you didn’t remediate the issues.” andy:”that’s why i can’t stand consultants. we do these tests and nothing gets fixed.” me:”i was thinking the same thing. why aren’t you fixing anything?” cheryl:”why we fixing things? wasn’t that your company’s job?” me:”er, no. we likely suggested that you fix some stuff. we most definitely offered to implement our suggestions, but you decided to save money and do it yourself. then you likely decided to save time by not fixing it at all.” i figured there wasn’t much chance of getting some business out of it, so i ended the call. i work as tech support for a web-hosting company. the other day, my co-worker (one of those corn-fed country boy type guys) was taking a call from a customer who was complaining about his website loading slow and having php and other syntax errors (web coding is not in our scope of support. we just support the servers and hosting, not web design issues). (btw all our servers have identical specs and run at blazing speeds ) customer: your server is slow and makes my website run slow. i want to be moved off my crappy server and be put on a better one. tech: well, you see, sir, our server is like a bucket. customer: ??? tech: well, we provide you with a bucket. it's scrubbed clean, sturdy, and doesn't have any holes in it. what you put in that bucket is up to you. if you take that bucket and fill it full of poo, you can't come complain to us that you have poo in your bucket. we didn't poo in it. if you take your bucket, and dump it into another bucket, even if it's a bigger bucket, its still going to have poo in it. if you request it, we can dump out the bucket, clean it, and give it back to you empty, but it's not our job to turn your poo into gold. he noted a little later he was contacted by quality control (who had listened in on his call) "although that was a good analogy, we would like to discourage comparing our customers content to poo" i thought he did a great job. edit: fixed a typo edit: march 2015 an update on this.. bucket guy has been promoted to supervisor. before you start, this story can be skipped if you're looking to just read the saga's etc. i looked up from the security desk. it was hell. on recommendation from the vp i was to spend some time at the security desk. &gt;“you can’t manage someone if you don’t know what they do” the words rung in my ears as i looked down at my coffee. it was instant. the news quickly spread around the buildings, it had desk right at the entrance. apparently an it member being at a desk accessible to the masses meant it was an it help desk. i hate it help desks. much like the instant coffee, everyone expects instant solutions. a young bearded man appears. &gt;young: hey i’m from sales on floor two. could i get a keyboard? &gt;me: … this is a security desk. &gt;young: you’ve got a keyboard there, can i have that one? &gt;me: no, its attached to a pc. again this is a security desk. &gt;young: okay. i seriously need a keyboard though we almost don’t have enough. &gt;me: just send a ticket down to it. &gt;young: you’re head of it right? &gt;me: yep. &gt;young: cool, well now you know. okay. cya. i look at my coffee for strength. its instant. an older employee arrives &gt;old: so could you get me a new password? &gt;me: sorry a new password for? &gt;old: i think im locked out of my email. &gt;me: oh. i looked at the guy and he seemed stressed, i decided to help. &gt;me: whats your username? &gt;old: blah @yahoo.com &gt;me: oh i mean your work email. &gt;old: no i can get into that. its just the security questions on my yahoo account, to reset my password i need to answer them. &gt;me: oh well. sorry i can’t help with that. &gt;old: whats my wifes second name? darn it… who the hell knows that? &gt;me: seriously i have no idea. &gt;old: should i ask my wife? i look down at my coffee for the answer. the instant answer would be… yes. i feel like its a mistake but i never argue with coffee. &gt;me: yes. [next]([previous]( friday midday the bigp smiled at the room as he announced his latest project. i looked in horror at the powerpoint. **school mentor program** i reached out to the water in the middle of the table and poured myself a cup. remembering i’d already said *no* to the idea i started to relax. &gt;bigp: this year the school has given the children a choice in profession. i looked around the room and saw the head of hr beaming with delight. i decided to sit back in my chair and slow sip water. &gt;bigp: we offered the children places in hr, sales, cleaning …. the bigp droned on about the different opportunities he’d offered the children. i started to zone out, water didn’t have the same focusing abilities as coffee. &gt;bigp: all that being said…. the bigp paused for dramatic effect. even i decided to tune in again. &gt;bigp: these are the positions the children picked. a graph presented itself on the screen, each department was listed out in a table, with the number of children who wanted to go to it in a column next to it. i read the first line of the table: hr - 0. i looked over at the head of hr. she wasn’t happy, i feared she may cry. reading the second line of the table: cleaning - 1. i was a little confused a child would pick that… i guess people like different things though… it - 3. wait. what? my glass of water started to shake. &gt;me: oh.. .bigp, these are just the students choices right? &gt;bigp: oh yes. three students selected your department, so that’ll be quite a handful. i tried taking a sip of my water, but it wouldn’t stop shaking. &gt;me: i’m afraid it… can’t have kids around. we’re a little too busy. &gt;headhr: nonsense. i’ll come down and help if you need the extra hands. i looked over and caught head of hr’s eyes, they looked pleadingly at me. &gt;me: i think perhaps we should make those kids pick again, or send then to hr…. it isn’t really a good environment for kids, its very boring. &gt;bigp: nonsense! look how quickly you’ve taught redcheer. you’ll have those kids writing programs by the end of the two weeks. the sound of redcheer’s name had made the vp look up in alarm. &gt;me: **two weeks!** i … thats…. so.. i tried to take a sip of water to calm myself before continuing, my hand however had revolted. &gt;me: i don’t think children and it mix. so i don’t think i want them in the department. vp looked sneeringly from the other end of the table. &gt;vp: kids are great with computers. if you’ve any trouble headhr will be right down to help. don’t worry. &gt;bigp: plus we wouldn’t want to disappoint three children would we? the bigp gave me a knowing look. i decided not to respond. i looked around the room, head of hr was smiling directly at me, vp looked oddly happier. i sat, annoyed. with a glass of... water. [next](so i'm in the office, busy with some back end admin work, when one of the graduates pop's his head into the office. &gt;graduate: hi, my phones not working. &gt;me: ok.. what exactly is the problem. &gt;graduate: it won't turn on since this morning, since i dropped it. &gt;me: wait, you dropped the phone and now it won't turn on? &gt;graduate: yeah, it's a bit of a mystery.... i kid you not, he actually said that. it was a personal device anyway, and i was trying to be nice, but damn. i just sent him in the direction of the apple store. but still.. *it's* *a* *mystery....*please excuse my formatting, first post on this sub so a little **background:** i am in no way considered an it guy, i am just fairly adept at sorting through most issues, and i have also picked up a lot from seeing my father do it work for some of his friends (some of their problems make me cringe, example being one of his friends downloads everything he sees) so i know my way around a basic set of issues, and as such i have become the resident it guy for my floor. now for the story: i live as a freshman in the dorms on campus and despite being on a floor full of honors students, many of them are more inept with tech than my grandmother. one day a guy from my floor (who will be referred to as fm) came to me with an issue i haven't seen before, and i've seen some pretty dumb things. note that he is adamant that he can do anything so he ~~googles~~ bings (he uses ie too) all of his issues....you can see where this is going &gt;fm: i'm hoping you can help me with an issue i had recently, i tried to fix it but it didn't work. &gt;me: sure, what's up? &gt;fm: well my laptop was running really slow recently and i tried a fix i saw on the internet but it didn't work. &gt;me: (preparing to run all the malware scans) what was the issue? &gt;fm: my laptop (about 4 years old) was running really slowly so i tried something recommended on the internet, i poured water on my keyboard. &gt;me: .....what?!?!?!? why in the world would you do that, you are smart enough to know that water and electronics don't mix! &gt;fm: but people on the internet said it worked.... &gt;me: ok just let me see your laptop and maybe we can fix this. he then proceed to bring me his laptop and hover over my shoulder as i cleared my desk of arduino parts and immediately remove the back plate of the laptop and looked inside (he was shocked to find out that laptops can come apart). what i saw was a ton of dust and no moisture, and looking at the front of the laptop i notice that on the surface of the machine there was no way for the water to get down into the internals because the keyboard is one solid unit, at least where he poured the water. i told him i would need a few hours and he will have his laptop back, in full working order. after he leaves i take a can of compressed air i had and blew out a massive amount of dust, put the backplate back on, and went about finding his slowness issue. after running a malware scan i found a massive assortment of malware, its like he clicks on every pop up he sees and agrees to any download, and after it was all cleaned off the thing ran 10x faster than when i received it, who would have guessed? i then did him the favor of hiding ie and installing chrome, where i set google as his homepage. he should be much happier now with his working machine. i also set a password that he got to pick for windows because he didn't have one. after he got it back he went happily on his way to continue his netflix addiction without even saying thank you. i should start charging people **edit** holy crap this post blew up, didn't expect this for a tale of idiocy **edit 2** i am amazed that my half-assed, untrained it work has received over 1000 upvotes, thank you tfts **edit 3** holy crap, thank you kind redditor for the gold!i'm the assistant it manager for a sales facility, meaning i work with a group of computer illiterate folks. yesterday, i get paged for immediate assistance in the finance office - as in "**ironballs to the finance office immediately!**" why they couldn't have just dialed the extension for the office, i don't know. i get down to finance, and the lady who manages all the finance paperwork is in a tizzy. the gm is in there, and they both launch on me at once. she's unable to get into her computer, it's been down for two days (why didn't you call on monday?), it's imperative that she get into it now! we're losing sales, and it's all your fault!! i leap into action! this is the moment i was born for! this is the situation where all my training, skills, and experience come into play! this is the time when i will save the company. i sit down at her desk, reach down, and...press the power switch. the machine boots up, gets to the login screen, and i have saved the day. i am an it god. *edited to add the quote to keep jooiiee from going off the deep endit's monday morning. i am in early to set up a bunch of noobies with their fancy corporate gear. i'm usually very prepared and have kit ready to go by thursday evening/friday morning at latest. however, thanks to bmfh, our long-standing policy known to all department heads of it requiring 2 weeks notice of any new starter so we can obtaining and set up new gear is summarily binned. of course, i find this out friday evening and need to scrounge up four new laptops and get vodafone to live up some sim cards double quick for delivery monday morning. i'm literally imaging the final machine when my induction group enters the room. i've had no time for tea or coffee, yet i'm expecting salvation from a sympathetic co-worker at any minute. still, best foot forward, i meet my delegates with my usual optimistic smile and my "welcome aboard" handshake. only, the air is about to darken. the familiar stench of putrid an old woman with too much perfume enters the room. she walks straight to the back of the training room and takes her seat next to a young woman. out of the corner of my eye, i see the young woman attempt small talk to no avail. i get started and i'm giving a brief introduction to the company it. i can't help be but distracted by the icy stare of bmfh piercing me like a lazer. as i duly hand out prescribed equipment to my delegates, she watches my every move as i dart around the room ensuring everyone gets a new toy. laptops in bags, phones and chargers in the pocket, it's a little like christmas morning. in my haste to get my late-attendees set up, it seems i've inadvertantly packed the wrong chargers in by mistake. after bringing it to my attention, before i could get a word out, bmfh hops to her feet to investigate the situation. holding the end of the offending charger and staring at me, she silences the room with an authorative "well?" before even being able to offer either explination or promises to make amends, she takes phone and charger from noobie and walks for the door, with "come with me!" after a solid dressing down, i walk bmfh down to the stock room where she watches me hunt around in a spares box for any combination of phone and charger that would fit. after rejecting my first three finds as unsuitable due to being slightly scuffed, she demands i instead use my company blackberry as suitable replacement. rather than enduring her wrath any further, i oblige, kitted with charger and wave goodbye to my lovingly customised toy of awesome. we re-enter the room; like a freshly scolded schoolby, i duly hand over the blackberry to noobie who feels mixed between "oooh awesome, this is better than that rubbish nokia you tried to give me" and instant pity as she totally knew what just happened. endeavouring to continue the induction, my noobie starters felt compelled to keep any and all kit-related questions to bare minumum. not the most ideal situation i'm sure you'll wager. by the way, where is that coffee? we make it to 12, bmfh's face looking like she's gnawing her teeth more and more throughout the session. salvation; the facilities lady arrives with delegates' lunch and coffee. blimey, i need a coffee. yeah... bmfh has other ideas. we break for lunch. i'm making pleasant small talk with some of the noobies - a standard tactic in making them feel "comfortable" with support. the queue for the coffee jug disipates and i walk with one of the noobies to go get myself some salvation in a cup. just as i pick the cup up, bmfh appears by my side. she again orders me outside. she starts with stating how lunch is for the delegates only; though no it's not! it's been sop for god knows how long to have a working lunch with the new delegates to chinwag, talk shop, correct any misunderstandings, whatever. however, new policy as of right now, i need to return to my desk where bmfh will watch me complete some meandering tasks she has for me. my co-workers are initially confused by my presence when i should be in induction, but on seeing the red-faced snaggletoothed hellhound, quickly understand. she insists we look at the queues... well, i'll look at the queues, she'll randomly point to various call tickets and demand why they haven't already been dealt with. this carries on for the next 30 minutes after which i mention i need to get back to the induction. for one glorious moment, i thought i may have been off the hook, as bmfh began wagging her finger at another lowly employee who had dropped a mouse on the floor. back upstairs, half the delegates have gone missing. it seems that our departure to some had signified the conclusion of the induction. a frantic run-around the various departments and 20 minutes later, we were a full team again. still no coffee. maintaining my professional demeanour against all odds, i politely carry on with crm and best practices. the crm training goes down like a slow slaughter. every step requires clarification courtesy of bmfh, like she's picking out every little thing and re-explaining it to the group. a one hour segment turns into a two hour bloodbath and everyone has just run out of happy. best practises i cover in 20 seconds with "there's a laminated card in your laptop bag about best practices, password lengths, etc. read it good luck". after the delegates have left, bmfh decides to reel off at me what a terrible job i've just done and how "if this is how inductions are performed, it's no wonder it support are a joke!". ok i've had enough. three days of this b****, monday morning, no coffee, she's on her fourth cup, i react! i just said "firstly, it would have gone a lot easier if you hadn't had landed me with four delegates i wasn't expecting needing me to run around and scour kit up from somewhere. secondly, this is not indicative of how inductions are usually run at all! and i resent your opinion that the support department is a joke". oh... no... you... dit'int.... she exits with a calm and collected look... yea ok... i know it... i'm fkd now. and where is my damned coffee!?!? **the coffee** i ran into mr. surei'llbringyouacoffee no good lying git co-worker who i thought had my back. i just said, "dude... you said you were going to... " my sentence was cut short when he gave me a complete insight into the morning's proceedings. after helping me haul ass scrambling some extra kit together, he had taken my cup from my drawer, filled it with some lovely hot brown coffee and was on his way upstairs. but... unbeknownst to him, he was being hunted! as he turned for the stairs, the bmfh had towered in front like a black-clad ss officer standing in front of a little girl in a pink dress. demanding to know where this coffee was headed, this was where she had learned of the it induction. in between dressing down my colleague for god-knows what and observed him as he duly tipped away my lovely coffee and placed my mug directly into the dishwasher, she had decided that she had to be a part of this induction. as i left for work that evening, i knew i had incurred the wrath. i knew something was coming. what, i don't know... more of the same? my job? us it'ers are very dispensible. my thoughts only revolved around one thing... i need to get my cv in shape![previous]( i sat with coffee in hand, a smile on my face and the now defunct plans for the workplace on my desk. i thought about framing the plans… could make a good picture. i settled back into my work routine. oddly happy. ***** a few weeks later as i was hanging my new picture the phone started ringing. &gt;me: blast it… putting down the frame and nails i walked over to the phone. &gt;me: it… &gt;vp: airz! the vp’s cheery tone put me on edge, i wasn’t used to talking when he was in a good mood. &gt;vp: just a quick warning, the word “outsourcing” has been thrown around my office a lot recently. &gt;me: outsourcing?…. i was confused, what was the vp trying to say. &gt;vp: yep, oh gotta go. &gt;me: but,... it was no use, the vp had already hung up the phone. i looked over at the other it staff, they all looked happy, for now. about a minute later the phone ringing brought me back to my senses. &gt;me: hello? oddly i’d hoped it was the vp calling, i had so many questions. weird. i normally hate the vp calling. &gt;bigp: airz, its the bigp. come about an hour early for this weeks heads of department meeting. the bigp seemed happy to tell me this news. &gt;me: okay, whats this about? &gt;bigp: oh i’m attending this week, and we’ve a lot to get through. a lot to get through…. &gt;me: a lot to get through? &gt;bigp: haha, so eager. don’t worry, on friday everything will be made clear. the bigp hung up the phone. it was monday. [next](this one is going to be short and sweet. about 17 years ago, i used to work for a small isp where our roles were everything. sales, support, retention, crm, administrative support.. it wasn't a bad gig working and we had a lot of fun. i remember taking a call for a new user who was signing up for internet. i can't remember if it was for adsl or dial-up. we go through the whole process of registering her, name, house address, billing through cc, plan setup. we then got to the creation of the account, which would also be her email account. the conversation went something like this: &gt; $ncoch: ok, we are almost done. now let's pick out your username and it will also create your email email account. what would you like it to be? &gt; $user: i don't know, what can it be? &gt; $ncoch: it can be anything, a combination of your name, or what ever you like. please remember, however, that it will be your email aswell! &gt;$user: oh, ok, i have the perfect one... can you make it **happyhooker**? &gt;$ncoch: *stares at the screen bewildered* now, at the time, i was 18 years old, and didn't know much of the world, so you can appreciate what was running through my mind. &gt;$user: hello?... are you there? &gt;$ncoch: yes, sorry... ok! so just to clarify your email account will be *and i proceeded to spell it out* h-a-p-p-y-h-o-o-k-e-r-@localisp.com? &gt;$user: yes! that's perfect. needless to say, to this day, out of the thousand email accounts i had created for that company's client base, it is the only one that i will forever remember. edit: typos[previous]( the queue stretched out the door as i arrived back at it. normally people never came down to see us, unless they wanted something done extra fast. colourblind saw me get back into the office and ran over. &gt;colourblind: thank goodness, your back! oh huh. &gt;me: why is… there a queue? its 10am on a monday. i looked at the line carefully, it didn’t seem like an angry line. in fact, people looked happy. &gt;colourblind: they all want, stuff? &gt;me: what do you mean, they all want **stuff**? colourblind just shrugged, so i made my way over to the waiting masses. first person in the line was a lady with freckles and a big smile. &gt;spotsmile: hey! you’re the it manager… right? &gt;me: yes. her eyes started to look around the office at all the it equipment &gt;spotsmile: i need to borrow, some stuff. &gt;me: stuff? perhaps she didn’t know how to say laptop? &gt;spotsmile: okay, so… this years christmas party is it themed right? so i just need a few it props. &gt;me: sorry… you want to borrow it equipment, which you’re going to take… to a party? i took a closer looked at the line, it was filled women. &gt;spotsmile: whatever stuff you can spare. &gt;me: no. spotsmiles face dropped, she looked rather shell shocked. &gt;spotsmile: no? i just need… maybe, a laptop? to carry round, or even a box thing? &gt;me: no… just…. i decided the entire line needed to hear, so i spoke much louder. &gt;me: no. everyone get out! you can’t take it equipment to a party. are you all out of your minds? as if realizing what a terrible idea the women started shuffling out of the office. except one. i looked her dead in the eye, she looked tough but, i wasn't in the mood to argue. i just wanted coffee. &gt;me: no…. no, i don’t have any spare it equipment for the party. the lady who’d stayed gave me an odd look. she wore striped glasses. &gt;stripe: i’m not here for that… remember that computer you took from head of accounting? yeah… i'm gonna need you to give that to me. &gt;me: sorry… who are you? &gt;stripe: the computer. now? &gt;me: but seriously…. who are you? ***** [next]( please check out the comic [here](one of my favorites... my company deals with some highly complex software that is a huge pain in the rear to install and configure properly, and can take several days to get it working properly with all of the servers, db connections, middleware, etc. so one of our more synaptically-challenged salesguys out in the field was due a new setup to use as a demo environment. one of the techs spent a couple of days building and verifying the environment - he does very thorough testing before shipping so he won't have to try to troubleshoot anything remotely. shortly after receiving it, salesguy calls the tech: sg: hey, that new machine isn't launching the software properly. can you fix it? tech: i tested that thing 5 times before i shipped it - did you make any changes to anything? sg: no, i swear! i didn't change anything. i just turned it on, launched the software, and nothing happened. will you take a look? so tech logs in, and spends a good 2 hours troubleshooting. after much trial and error, he notices than an entire folder is in the wrong place - what should have been in c:\app\software was now in c:\app\software\data. moved it back &amp; now everything is happy. tech: so i found your problem - looks like a folder was moved. are you sure you weren't doing anything to the machine? sg: no way man. they were down a level, huh? i bet the files probably just fell during shipping. you should pack those machines a little more carefully.background: 4 years ago i quit my part-time evenings &amp; weekends it job. yesterday i was working late trying to finish some designs before heading home. at 7:15pm my office phone rings. to reach my line you need to dial from an internal phone or fight with the auto-attendant through 3 levels of menus regarding what kind of engineering support you need. it was after-hours but i answered anyway. we have a small number of large clients so i figured it was important especially since it was an external number. &gt; **me:** hello, **onthemf** speaking. &gt; **$salesguy:** hi **onthemf**, this is **$salesguy**. this is urgent, i need you to fix my vpn right now. &gt; **me:** i think you have the wrong extension. &gt; **$salesguy:** no, you setup my computer and now the vpn doesn't work. i need it fixed immediately. &gt; **me:** sorry **$salesguy**, you've reached **$engineering_department**, not **$it_department**. &gt; **$salesguy**: no, **onthemf**, it's **$salesguy** from **$client**. you setup my computer. &gt; *suddenly it clicks, i remember $salesguy now. he worked for a client of my former employer, $it_company. 5 years ago i responded to a ticket about his e-mail not working. if i recall the corrective steps were to enter his e-mail address and password into the outlook account wizard.* &gt; **me:** sorry, i haven't worked for **$it_company** in almost 5 years now. who connected you to this number?

[previous]( bigp was the boss, probably best to aim high on this call. &gt;bigp: airz, hello. enjoying the new employee? i occasionally forget how fast the bigp is, he apparently remembers everything. &gt;me: er, actually i called to talk to you about that, we’ve had a bit of a problem. &gt;bigp: mmm? i glanced out the door where itsec was sitting staring at the ground, head in hands. did colour-blind teach him that pose? &gt;me: the head of accounts…. &gt;bigp: he actually just called me, praising your choice of employee. redcheer made quite the good impression apparently. the bigp sounded pleased, and i started to worry just how much bigp knew... &gt;me: er… well as you may have heard, we took the pc from the head of accounts. unfortunately the hard drive was subsequently destroyed. &gt;bigp: so.. when you say destroyed… &gt;me: redcheer, smashed it up. i’m unsure if it was maliciously, or just stupidity. however i do think she is reconsidering her place… here. to be honest her lack of judgement is gravely disturbing. bigp sighed into the phone. i looked out the door. redcheer was drinking coffee she seemed, happy? &gt;bigp: so the hard drive is gone? completely? &gt;me: yeah. no chance at recovering it, the platters are all broken in thousands of pieces. bigp sounded like he was thinking into the phone. he oddly didn’t seem angry. i could feel justice coming though, i hoped he wasn't too harsh. &gt;bigp: mmm well, no big loss. hard drives don’t cost that much right? lets chalk this one upto too much enthusiasm. i heard you needed to securely wipe that drive from head of accounts anyway so - mission achieved. &gt;me: isn’t that sending a terrible message to the company? i was expecting blood. i was getting…? &gt;bigp: she’s two hours in on her first ever day in it. lets cut her a little slack. &gt;me: we actually had someone come down to it trying to take that computer. &gt;bigp: really?! who? &gt;me: stripes… the bigp sounded fairly calm, but with an odd edge to his voice. &gt;bigp: mmmm, did she say why? &gt;me: nope. just demanded it. &gt;bigp: oh okay. doesn't matter now. bigp hung up. i frowned, that wasn’t… what i expected. whilst still staring at the phone, it rang. &gt;vp: airz. come upto my office now, please. oddly cordial. i thought to myself as i got up out of my chair. grabbing a coffee i made my way up to vp’s office. as my hand reached out for his office door the vp’s secretary stopped me. &gt;vpsec: airz! oh i wouldn’t… annoy him too much today. &gt;me: the vp? why?… he seemed oddly nice on the phone. &gt;vpsec: just a warning… my hand pressed down on the handle, i walked into the office. vp was smiling at my entrance. &gt;vp: airz! so, glad you could make it. &gt;me: er.. hello vp. [next](month 6. the site takedown. it's the only real satisfying activity that i have as a web developer. working for a lawyer that does pr/marketing/web development business with other lawyers allows me the opportunity to take down a lawyer's website. the hilarity that ensues when a lawyer finds out their site was taken down is....indescribable. but i'll try: &gt;boss: "hey captain, i need you to take down these websites today." &gt;me: "ok." &gt;boss: "yeah they haven't paid their bills in a couple of months and i gave them more than enough time to get back to me and they haven't so take'em down." &gt;me: "no problem!" zd and i tackle the effort. we split this task of joy so we could both get a little taste. afterward we sat back and waited. and waited. the phone rings, caller id lets us know whose client this was gonna be. this was the corporate lawyer (cl), he's mine. &gt;me: "hi this is captain, of [company]." &gt;cl: "hi yes this is [corporate lawyer name and firm], my site is down." heh heh. &gt;me: "ok, hold on one second." damn right i was putting that shit on speaker. zd gives a thumbs up. &gt;me: "um yes, your site has been taken down due to non-payment." have you ever done a "whippet"? same brain tickle and high telling a corporate lawyer his services were cancelled due to non-payment. &gt;cl: "what?! no! you put my site back up right now!" he said it with the same whiny tone i hear from the kids in the childrens therapy center all day. &gt;me: "i'm sorry, but i can't do that. you have to talk to boss and pay your bill. would you like me to transfer you to him now?" &gt;cl: "no! tell him i'm not paying my bill until he puts my site back up!" logic...failing. rage...consuming. must press mute to laugh. &gt;me: "um that's not really how that works, i can put you in touch with boss right now and you can sort this out with him." &gt;cl:"fine!" i transferred the call, intercommed the boss, and let him deal with mr. cranky-pants. later, i asked boss if he paid and if i should put the guy's site back up, boss said no. just threats. it was seemingly uneventful, but then later... phone rings. corporate lawyer. speaker on! &gt;cl:"now you fucking listen to me! if you don't put my site back up i'm going to sue you personally and the company. do you understand me?" he was saying it through what sounded like clenched teeth. he's gone full potato. getting cursed at justifies me hanging up the phone....if i wanted to. &gt;me:"well you do what you need to do, sir. i still can't put your site backup." &gt;cl:"you can, you just won't! do you know who i am?!" mute on. ok, need to stop laughing. stop! i motion to zd to stop laughing too. ok...ok. mute off. &gt;me:"yes sir, i saw the bio on your site...when it was up." he hung up with what i can only imagine was a force strong enough to bounce off the receiver judging by the bang, followed by the sound of fumbling, and a second attempt to actually hang up. [first post]( [&lt; previous ]( [next &gt;](i work as a level-1 helpdesk support person for a very large company, mostly taking internal-employee calls, and today, this happened. &gt;me: thanks for calling $company, krozard speaking. (insert script/opening stuff here), how can i help you today? &gt;user (u): yeah i can't get into my $program, as soon as i launch it, i get a message that says something about a file that's hiding or something &gt;me: can you please read me the error message exactly as it appears? &gt;u: well...i wouldn't really call it an error message, because it's still on my screen &gt;me: (trying to figure out the logic behind that) well...can you read me what the message on your screen says? &gt;u: &lt;exasperated tone&gt; i _told_ you, it says the file is hiding or something &gt;me: can you please send me a screenshot of the error mess- &gt;u: it's not an error, because it's still on my screen! &gt;me: can you send me a screenshot of the message on your screen? &gt;u: sure! &lt;proceeds to send a screenshot flawlessly, without the need for instructions of any kind&gt; it was a very easy fix that simply involved re-logging into the network.. oh, and on the screenshot, it said "error: file not found, please check your network path." it's calls like these i wish i could be sarcastic as hell...the error message said error in it, but it's not an error because it was...on her screen.../facedeskthe elevators were not working. the air conditioning was occasionally working. the building manager was ‘working hard’ all day, although no results were ever forthcoming. unfortunately this state of affairs was causing friction in the office, work had slowed to a crawl. it, due to the lack of functioning lifts could only work on equipment on site. this led to a number of extremely angry complaints, mostly revolving around extended wait times. &gt;sales-manager: how long?! the sales manager had a particularly harsh tone of voice. it was like a death metal concert, very loud and screamy. i attempted to explain the problem again using my calmest voice, she heard nothing. after a full five minutes of continuously being cut off, i hung up. &gt;me: i’ll probably regret that. i mumbled to myself as i sank further down in my chair. the list of current jobs was growing steadily. it was larger then i’d ever seen it. a knock at the door startled me out of my gloom. &gt;pant suit: boss, the ticket list... &gt;me: it’s so long. yes. &gt;pant suit: you know why? pant suit went on to explain, the current protocol was to put signs onto the broken computers since we could not move them back to the department. apparently people were completely ignoring the signs, using the broken pc’s, finding them to be broken and submitting **another** ticket. &gt;me: so... how many computers are **actually** broken? &gt;pant suit: only about 10 or so. &gt;me: just move them away to a storage room till we get lifts back. pant suit seemed agreeable and hurried off to various departments to go hide the broken equipment. i sat back in my chair and cherished the thought of hitting delete on so many tickets at once. my dreams never came to fruition. i got a call. &gt;sales-manager: is this what you call a solution?! trying to just hide the problem? the torrent of abuse that spewed down the phone drowned out all my hopes of a fun ‘deletion party’. sales manager’s rage equaled that of a steroided man learning that his gym was closed for the day. &gt;sale manager: .... and don’t think i’ve forgotten you hung up on me. &gt;me: listen... sales manager didn’t. &gt;sales-manager: i’m not letting pant suit leave till you send someone up to fix the problem. my efforts to explain that pant suit could probably fix the issue herself fell on deaf ears. i heard in the background sales-manager ordering pant suit to sit and wait. &gt;sales-manager: send someone to fix this, *now*. she hung the phone up on me. a hostage situation? i started trying to find the tickets sent from the sales department, to make sure i had the correct equipment to fix it. another knock at the door startled me for a second time. &gt;messy: boy, she was loud. we could hear that whole conversation all the way out here. &gt;me: i think the air-con is out in sales again so they’re going a bit nutty. &gt;messy: weird how everywhere else the air conditioning is broken but here it’s... fine. i laughed to myself as i looked towards the it plant room key. alas the building manager had recently lost his copy. &gt;me: yeah, weird.... &gt;messy: so i was wondering, can i take that call? &gt;me: err, they’re fairly mad. &gt;messy: don’t worry, i’ll fix it. messy strode out of the department with a confident smile. i relaxed back in my chair, reconsidering messy as an employee, he did seem up for anything. it was only a few minutes later that my phone started ringing. &gt;messy: she won’t stop shouting. also i may have forgotten my tools. i could hear the screams of frustration in the background. sales manager demand the phone from messy, who didn’t even put up a fight. &gt;sales-manager: he couldn’t fix it! says he needs to go get parts. why didn’t he bring them with him, airz? why?! i’m sick of waiting for it to get its act together. these two can’t leave until this is fixed. &gt;me: you can’t hold people hostage. just let pant suit go and messy will go get the parts, it’ll be fixed soon. &gt;sales-manager: let them go? no. send someone else up with the parts, make sure they’re competent. send redcheer, she’s good. &gt;me: redcheer isn’t here... &gt;sales-manager: still!? how long does a holiday take. i didn’t really know the answer to that. redcheer’s idea of communication was to request leave with a question mark on the time period. &gt;me: what parts are needed to fix the computer? &gt;sales-manager: do i look like a tech to you? work it out. she hung up. the sound of the phone being slammed into the receiver made my head recoil. that wasn’t very nice, i thought to myself. looking around the office, i considered just carrying up a new computer. it wasn’t worth it. too many stairs. i decided to just go face sales manager myself. she had clearly gone off her tree. after walking the flights of stairs and arriving in the office i realized the problem. it was boiling. everyone was boiling. sweat was dripping from all the employees, it was like working in a volcano. fans weakly pushed air about the place, hot horrid air. wet towels were being liberally applied to foreheads, ice had become a trade-able commodity. &gt;sales-manager: finally, took you long enough. get to work. sales-manager pointed at a computer with a broken sign, my two techs sat meekly nearby. &gt;me: i can’t, i don’t have the parts. &gt;sales-manager: oh for goodness sake! the sales manager’s face scrupled up, clearly about to launch into another tirade. &gt;me: messy, pant suit. please leave and get on with your work. &gt;sales-manager: they’re not... &gt;me: go! i had cut off the sales-manager and waved them out the door. messy, who clearly had a thing for sticky situations wanted to stay, but pant suit was pushing him out the door. as i watched them leave sales-manager recovered. &gt;sales-manager: i cannot believe this. that computer has been sitting here broken for hours now! is this what you call service? &gt;me: calm down. &gt;sales-manager: no. the sales department had stopped, even in the boiling heat people seemed gravitated towards friction. oddly sales-manager didn’t continue, she seemed to just run out of steam. i could understand, it was just too hot. &gt;me: now listen, do you want the air conditioning fixed? &gt;sales-manager: what?! no. i want this computer fixed! &gt;me: oh, ... we can’t do that until we have the lifts working. good bye. i swiveled on the spot and started marching towards the stairs, whispers of air conditioning and working swirled throughout the office as i walked away. &gt;sales-associate: you can fix the air conditioner? many pleading eyes looked at me, like starved hyenas being offered a juicy piece of meat, all hoping for one thing. only the sales-manager didn’t look hopeful. &gt;me: i can, you just need to get the key to the plant room, flick the mains switch on the air conditioner to “on”. &gt;sales-manager: no! it is useless and never fixes anything. this computer has been broken for..... clearly mad with power the sales-manager went off on another rant about it and its flaws. i didn’t stay for its conclusion, i pushed the door open and left. when i arrived back in my office my phone was already ringing. &gt;sales-associate: my manager has banned us from calling it, but ahh... where exactly is that “mains switch”. i gave the sales-associate as detailed instructions as i could, it was fairly distinctive. after the call i sat back in my chair and took a sip of coffee. no calls from sales anymore. sweet. my phone rang about half an hour later. it was from the sales-manager, i could hear the sounds of soothing air conditioning in the background. &gt;sales-manager: sometimes people say things in the heat of the moment.... i got a little er... hot headed you know? &gt;me: sure... was this ... &gt;sales-manager: sorry, about that whole thing. an actual apology! i hadn't ever heard one so i couldn't be sure. i decided to be nice, since she'd given me the rare gift of an apology. &gt;me: i’m just glad you’ve cooled off. &gt;sales-manager: so... you’ll fix it when the lifts are working? &gt;me: that’s the plan. how civil, i thought to myself. i was almost tempted to go fix everything in that department now. considering how much more reasonable salesmanager was being. plus she did give me an rare real apology..... maybe i *should* fix all their stuff. &gt;sales-manager: you don’t happen to know where the switch for the lifts are... do you? nope. nope, nope, nope. \**ring*\* \**ring*\* &gt;me: you've reached technology, this is tjmaster, how can i help you? &gt;t: i need help! i can't get to my email! &gt;me: alright, could you look to see if... &gt;t: ..i'm actually in a hurry, class is starting, could you just come take a look? &gt;me: it would actually be.. &gt;t: oh, gotta go, sorry, bye. ..really? might as well see if i can remote into their system. aanndd, it's offline. i suppose i was going to that building soon anyhow, stopping by really wouldn't be a hassle for me. &gt;me: i'm here to see what's wrong with your email. &gt;t: oh, great! it's right over here! monitor? ...off. printer? ...off. computer? ..off. red light on powerstrip? (not important, those lights never work.) &gt;me: it looks like there's no power to your desk? &gt;t: is that why i can't get to my email? ...these people are teaching our children!yesterday i got a work order from corporate, telling me to call a store and tell them they are doing their invoices wrong. the problem? apparently someone in the store didn't know how to post invoices and was deleting them instead. then called us to complain because their invoices were disappearing.the case had been sent up to corporate to investigate since l2 didn't see any obvious problems either. so i call the store, and let them know what corporate had found. the person on the other line was the one that handles the invoices, and she swore she didn't delete anything. i remote into the server, and there's an invoice waiting there to be posted. i ask the user to post it, so i can see what the issue may be. she hit the d key. the key that, on this page, is the shortcut for delete. she thought it was short for display(it clearly says on the page (d) delete). i had to work hard to keep myself from laughing while i was wrapping up the call. but i did have a good laugh when i hung up. first post, so please be gentle! i work for a large pc manufacturer, doing technical support on contracts for business customers, and the occasional end user, and all of the systems that i support are business class. last week i spoke to a customer out of pa who spoke exactly like rocky balboa. he starts by telling me that his monitor on his laptop won't change brightness. after more coaxing more info from him, it sounds like he recently reinstalled windows. sounds like a driver issue with the hotkeys. i start to direct him to download the drivers, and ask which version of windows he's running. windows 7 home basic. now none of our business class pcs come with that. in fact, we offer professional on every one. remember, he's got the *rocky voice*... &gt; **theopholus**: sir, where did you get this copy of home basic? did your company require it for some reason? or maybe school? how did this happen? &gt; **rocky**: yeah, well uh, i got it and installed it myself. &gt; **theopholus**: why didn't you just use the version that came with the system, windows 7 professional? &gt; **rocky**: 'cause i use it at home. it's hard to argue with that logic. at least it was just a driver, and we got it installed and working. working for the $bigboxstore yielded enough strange issues that nothing surprises me anymore - well, computer related stuff doesn't. i happened to be working the counter one day at the beginning of my shift when... a friendly old guy (fog) brought in his fairly new desktop and said that it wouldn't boot up today and he was wondering if i'd take a look at it. i plug it in and it fires right up. he says "you must be magical" and leaves happy - i like this guy already, because whenever i don't feel like explaining how i fixed something to a customer i just tell them "i'm magic." he comes back a few hours later. toting his desktop alongside him. i'm now confused. &gt;fog: well, i got home, plugged everything back in, and it still wouldn't boot up. &gt;me: define "wouldn't boot" for me. &gt;fog: well, i push the button, everything twitches, then nothing. no beeps, no lights, nothing. this guy actually answered all my follow ups before i asked them - he has to at least know something of computers. awesome. so i quickly hook it up back up and it boots like a champ. i shut it down, test the psu, check for loose connections, nothing. it's perfect. it's a year old (ish) and there's no dust, no nothing. i pronounce his computer fine, and suggest maybe try moving the plug that his surge protector is plugged into. either a different plug on that outlet, or preferably grab an extension cable and plug it in on a different circuit, because maybe there's something wrong with his house's wiring (wouldn't be the first time). i also add that if he'd like we can send a $specialist out to his house to diagnose it there, but it's x amount of dollars. &gt; fog: no, no. **i'm** going to get to the bottom of this. &gt; me: well, if it still doesn't work and you have to come back, bring everything you can with you. surge protector, peripherals, monitor, whatever you can carry. it's a slow day and this is a weird one - i like weird. he seems more than happy with this, and leaves. comes back a few hours later (very end of my shift), and $bigboxstore is quite dead. this time he has a cart filled with stuff and a grin on his face - he's sure we'll get it this time. so about 20 minutes later we've got his whole desk wired up on our counter, and a little bit of an audience - my coworkers in their infinite boredom wanted to see the weirdness going on in my department. so i start stepping through everything end to end, everything checks out. power strip is good, power cable is good, everything's plugged in, hit the power switch - *twitch* what the hell?! so i unplug everything except the power cable and speakers from the back of the computer, and plug in my trusty kvm on the usb only (since it worked earlier). it boots up, hear the windows log-on sound, shut down using the keyboard. plug his monitor in. boots up. plug in all his usb peripherals. boots up. plug in his ps/2 keyboard. *twitch* what in the actual hell?! after i'm done scratching my head, i run my hand down the keyboard's cable... there's a nice warm spot right on a discolored bend in the cable. &gt;me: you wouldn't happen to have a pull out keyboard tray on your desk, would you? &gt;fog: how'd you know? &gt;me: there's a short in the cable right here. point to the bend. have him feel the warm spot. --direct quote-- &gt;fog: *well, i'll be a mother fucker!* you are magic, because i'd have never thought of that! i crack up laughing because friendly old people are the best. pack up all his crap, sell him a new keyboard and send him on his merry way. tl;dr customer is a mother-fucker, and i'm a sorcerer.i arrived for work the next day, this time fulfilling my morning's requirement for coffee before leaving the house. i was on the late shift, so i could afford the luxury of adding breakfast. for some reason i was unpreterbed by the events yesterday offered. i arrived to find a deathly quiet it department. sadly, i had begun to expect this when angie had imparted her usual words of wisdom on some poor unsuspecting fool. i duly logged into my pc, fired up touchpaper and began the arduous task of setting up some appointments for the day. i was surprised to hear a new type of noise from angie's direction. rather than the snarling voice of satan demolishing yet another soul or the heavy bleak silence that accompanied her stare, there was banter and the sound of humans talking. i looked over to see angie discussing in depth the virtues of a nearby starbucks with some finance hag. on the one hand we were all pretty shocked that angie seemed to be demonstrating a more human side to her character. though given her affiliation with finance hag... see, it support and finance were situated directly next to each other. some time ago, we had all been segregated into offices beautifully adorned with departmental monikers which happily contained our respective messes and existances. at some point, some middle manager in a fit of synergetic genius decided to implement an entirely open-office strategy and had all walls removed. as far as i can see, it served to merely underpin the adage of "good fences make good neighbours" and that destroying the efficiency of aircon in the height of summer only adds to tensions. finance had repeatedly become irritated with its occasionally "walking through their area" as they would usually have varying currencies hanging around for traveling business reps - it seemed walking even near their area was suddenly deemed a security risk - and were constantly angered by the fact we had a lot of foot traffic and a lot of equipment which invariably made its way to us. really - it support does not suit open office, especially next to finance hags. suffice it to say, there had previously been a blowout and it support were mandated by up on high to keep a three desk distance from any finance team members (a problem as they were forever encroaching on our space, with temps, filing systems and new layouts meaning we had to constantly move and shrink). simiarly, they had enforced a three-piece rule, whereby you could only have three pieces of equipment on your desk at any time. as the average monitor and system unit accounted for two of these, you can imagine what a struggle this was should anyone show up with a non functioning laptop and accompanying projector/home router/printer. our constant commandering of any post-room space and the need to create a pc-den in the stock cupboard was a testament to what a poor relation it support really was in the company. though our jobs were now more difficult, in that we had to maintain a presence outside whilst actually getting to work in a cupboard was a constant struggle, we all remained cooperative and chipper in our existances. nevertheless, angie was evidently on first name terms with finance wench. with pleasantries exchanged, off they set to the local coffee emporium to embark on their self-made challenge of attempting every single combination of coffee type they could think of - not forgetting the ominous stare at support personnel as she passed. finally. the coast was clear - we could take a breath. being the last one in, my colleagues were quick to ask "jon6... have you read your email yet!?"... well, no actually... and there it was. retribution, the storm of the bmfh's reign was upon us! angie had decided that during the course of the day, she would be performing ticket reviews on an individual basis. middle-aged family guy (mafg) was on the early shift. he had obviously already been the meat grinder, angie's special treatment. of course, we were now fixated on his response to find out what went down. it soon became clear when he relented and maximised his ie window to reveal several jobserve results. wow, it went that well then? mafg wasn't a slacker, not by a long shot. in fairness, there were slackers, but he wasn't one. and it looked like the wind had been knocked well and truly out of his sales. he began to tell us how angie had spun her web. she had a printed list of his open tickets and several examples of his closed tickets. she had initially allowed him to dig his grave so it seems with a few innocent cases, until launching into an all-out pincer move to demonstrate terrible goings on within his daily work. this invariably was forcing him to reopen old tickets she was dissatisfied with, despite no suggestion from the customer of that being the case. that's when it hit me. as he talked about the meeting, the fact that things were printed (angie has no idea where the printers even are), the fact that she was able to search the ticketing system for tickets at all... it's obvious. there is a mole... that's all there is to it... someone here is working against us all. someone had to have provided angie with a method of retrieving closed tickets. someone has to have shown her how to use the printer. the cloud of suspicion was very much there. i knew it... and i could sense, maybe some others knew as well. is there a traitor in our midst? after our team post-mortem of angie's impact to date, we were left deflated and totally unmotivated. we returned to stare into the bleakness of the computer monitor, hoping that salvation lay within. i duly opened my outlook calendar. sure enough... jon6, tickets review at 13:30..... right at the start of my designated rota'd lunch break... ok angie... you foul smelling b****... it's on... **so, did this really happen?** yes. this is an as-accurate as i remember account of a bitch manager from hell that i endured over a 15 month period. the story indicates a much shorter timeline, but i only have time for so much writing! in reality, angie micromanaged to death several its initiatives, cost a few people their jobs and was an overbearing terrible person. all of this led to her ultimate, er, promotion… **how many parts are there going to be?** to be honest, i had no idea when i started writing how many parts there would be. i just started, initially thinking 3-4 parts at most. as i found people started enjoying it, i just wrote more. in truth, angie was such a nightmare that if i took to time to recount every single thing she did, there would have been near on 500 parts! at some point, given i have other commitments to adhere to, this needed to end sadly. i decided to steer my writing towards the ultimate conclusion of angie’s reign. **are you a writer?** nope. not professionally. i’ve never felt compelled to sit down and write anything this novelistic before. i’ve been writing lyrics for years and used to trying to fit syllables to beats, restrained to only a few available lines to get the point across. i play metal though – so like anyone cares about the lyrics, so long as there’s a few cleverly picked crowd pleasing lines. re-spect - walk! **i suspect he is in reality, british.** yep… sorry about that :) **why didn’t you just quit?** it had been my third it support role. in reality, there’s no such thing as a nice it support role. they’re all disturbingly hostile places to be and i would urge anyone to get out as soon as possible; it's a slow suicide by telephone. my take on it support is that it is the one area that’s simple to get into, but difficult to dig out of. managers like angie are just all too common in this field. if i had just quit, as i managed to prove to myself when i did change jobs, moving from one dead-end support role to another resolves nothing. it’s just the same thing, different place! **...go to her boss? explain how she's impacting negatively on productivity, and on your team's mental health** there is such a thing as crapping in your own back yard. no upper manager wants to be bothered by some troublemaking runt from some low-end support role going on about how much he hates his boss! it’s a fast track out the door, i can assure you. **the bbc should just go ahead and turn these into a show.** hahaha, i am open to offers! **i would have flipped my desk and said "f*ck it, i'm done" i am amazed with your amount of patience throughout this matter.** i was brought up to be very patient. but, the fact i had a mortgage to pay, a car to keep running various other responsibilities, i couldn’t be that flippant about it. ** i don't understand why the entire department doesn't walk out. that would get the attention of angie's superiors.** this is a rather hollywood ending, but the reality is, everyone has bills to pay. i’d wager such a bold move would fall foul of its forerunner when this reality would dawn on everyone. in truth, we were all jobhunting, though! ** 3 seconds!** do i owe you a new spring for your f5 key? **i love you, jon6!** awww, shucks! **if this series ends up with a tree-fiddy joke i'll be both angry and impressed** you don’t know how tempting this was to put up - even for just five minutes! though i hope it didn’t end that way for you! **so, just to be clear, this all took place in the mid-late 1990's and jon6 was 20-22 at the time, correct?** it’s safe to say i was about 22-23, and this was around 2000. i don’t want to say much more than this though, anonymity and all! **how does it feel to have so many people hanging on your every word jon6?** odd! but i'm pleased i provided such entertainment - and i hope i didn't get anyone in trouble with their bosses! **i feel like chelle at the beginning of portal 2. all that hard work, and the feeling of victory at escaping the inhuman clutches of glados, only to find yourself back in the pits of hell once more. the evil thing is still alive and kicking, and you'll have to deal with her all over again.** luckily i never crossed paths with her at all after that. but it’s the one big lesson of the corporate world. credit travels up, blame travels down. the higher you are the harder it is to fall. **guys... guys. we got to the end. we did it.** we sure did… my large diversion from doing coursework has also suffered… i’m envisaging a very hard easter weekend ahead to catch up. but i’ve enjoyed writing for you guys! **misogyny loses my sympathy** i would hate to be thought of as someone who hates women. for one, they’re lots of fun ;) ok i admit, i had to google "misogyny". the correct british vernacular is "male cheuvanist pig" joking aside, i feel an explanation may be required to this line of questioning. my account describes the situation endured by all at that time; i tried to paint a picture of the characters involved as best i could. where you can define your own definition, i would welcome you to do so. in some cases, my brief description of “quiet blonde girl” should be enough for you to paint your own picture. however, angie and her gang were such an uncommon, abnormal collection, i felt that to not describe their mannerisms and neurosis would have done them an injustice. similarly, roland’s rat-like appearance just seemed to burn anyone who set eyes on him. bhit, i think, was also subject to rather unrelenting description. i’ve had some excellent female colleagues, managers and so forth so i would hate for it to be assumed i have a problem with women in power. apologies if you thought otherwise! **previous** [pt1: a new world order]( ) [pt2: safety first]( [pt3: the it induction from hell]( [pt4: undercurrents]( [pt5: how to make friends and...]( [pt6: marking territories]( [pt7: one friday to rue them all]( [pt8: best laid plans]( [pt9: its one step for man]( [pt10: ...and one step back for its]( [pt11: bring home the solider]( [pt12: who needs minor victories...]( [pt13: dawn of a new nightmare]( [pt14: rules of engagement]( [pt15: bring out your dead]( [pt16: the greatest trick the devil ever pulled...]( [pt17: who's the king?]( [pt18: now that's what i call a sticky situation]( [pt19: throw the dice]( [pt20: cardboard city]( [pt21: the rollout from hell]( [pt22: fallout]( [pt23: epilogue]( a tale from years ago. back then, i was still relatively new on tech support's senior staff at the telco i still work for. nowadays here, you can have 1-on-1 chat-based tech support in 3 clicks, and it's pretty standard industry-wide. back then, the company was just exploring the possibility of expanding beyond phone-support, and eventually orders came down from the vp's office on how to set it up. then, my ex-boss told us what would happen with a frown. a nice-looking portal would go live on our website, but it would be just a skin for a irc chatroom. people would come in, write about their problems, and some frontline staff reading them *while simultaneously taking calls* would direct them to either call tech support for the harder issues or type solutions if seemed like a quick fix. &gt; $colleague: "so, there will be some kind of system put in place to ensure customers' can't see each others' requests and our frontline staff's answers, right?" &gt; ex boss: "no... just a irc chatroom with a skin. we have to leave it wide open too, it's not like we can only let +v people ask a question." everybody in the room either facepalmed or stared at the table. &gt; $colleague: "you can't be serious." &gt; ex boss: "i know, they'll be chatting with each other and some will get angry and stuff, but our staff will be in there, and there will be a bot able to automatically kick for obscenities and such. the directives came up from up above, i can't do much, and it's just for a trial period." &gt; bytewave: "could we at least moderate the channel and have customers first pm a moderator/employee with their issue? once they seem rational about their situation, give them +v?" &gt; ex boss: "no, that'd be about as ineffective as using only pms altogether." &gt; bytewave: "and what's wrong with that? only using pms? why would we want a chatroom where they can talk to each other?" &gt; ex boss: "the vice-president expects that in a crisis, such as a significant outage, we can be substantially more effective. users asking redundant questions will realize their issues are already answered and will..." &gt; bytewave: "okay, sure, in the best of worlds. but this is not going to end well. angry customers will work each other up, there'll be rants, stuff will go public, people will hold us accountable for things outside our control, and i'm sure i'm just scratching the surface." she basically agreed with us, but it was out of her hands. the chatroom and the web interface was being designed by internal it, and the actual interactions with customers were to be handled by frontline staff below us. tsss was simply supposed to help them with tough calls about chat-based technical questions. but we all left the room knowing no good could come out of this. ... some weeks later once this was live ... my boss came to my desk looking crushed after reading the piece of paper in her hands. &gt; ex boss: "look, there are a few customer complaints with the new chatroom, some threat of a lawsuit, other stuff. can you look at the logs for the last two days and tell me if there's anything we need to be worried about? one of our employees filed a grievance about it too - there's also a redacted copy of that in this file. so please, send me your findings in writing and cc the union steward?" ... i was surprised that she didn't ask me to come to her first. technically, her request was perfectly proper, but it's rare that supervisors don't at least ask for a heads up before we send work product to the union. so i guessed she *wanted* what would follow to happen. i looked at the logs, not surprised one bit how badly it went wrong. customers were spending more time reinforcing each others' belief that our support was horrible because they had issues, than trying to get them fixed. since there's all kinds of people out there and they are less inhibited in a chat room than they are on the phone, there were insults, swears, all caps and even threats thrown around liberally. i made a call and learned frontline staff 'moderating' the 'experiment' were still waiting on official instructions on how to react when customers were being abusive - and that so far their instructions were only to 'escalate to legal any situations where criminal threats or admissions are relevant'. this was being treated like alpha testing even though real customers were on the other end and it was on our official website. in short, they allowed any disgruntled customer to visit an open chatroom where the 'moderators' were supposed to let anything slide unless a customer issued *direct threats*. moderate 'i'll kill you' but do nothing if they merely said 'i wish you die' ... with our logo on top. the time i spent looking at those logs truly hurt my faith in humanity. i say this despite having manned frontline phones for two years. the stuff in that chatroom was insane. the employee who had filed a grievance had to deal politely with customers implying she'd be sexually assaulted, all over a 4 hour network outage she had no control over - because the threat was 'indirect'. people in there were at each other's throats too - like in any poorly moderated, angry irc chatroom - and then blamed *us* for the resulting chaos. this thing had just been rolled out, but even the early adopters went in there willing to lash out at just about anyone. there were customers with rf issues threatening lawsuits in writing if we didn't fix it remotely even though their problems were due to unapproved/untested splitters in their own houses. customers getting into catfights with each other because they wanted to do *something* whenever we weren't responding quickly enough. customers working each other into 'joint lawsuits' plans at 4am when we weren't around (nobody had ensured the chatroom would be closed when the staff was offline). employees threatened or mocked for adhering to the project's ridiculously strict policies. even one instance of two customers starting to cyber in the damn public tech support chatroom. the stuff i read in the logs made me lose my cool, so i wrote one of the angriest emails of my career. our union guarantees a fair degree of job security, and my boss did specifically request i cc the union stew. union employees have the luxury of being able to speak the truth to power without consequences - as long as we're right, at least. so late that night - while being paid at overtime rates - i spent two hours crafting a huge wall-of-text - longer than any tale i ever published here. i sent it to my boss, the department's director, the union stew, the union executive, and ccc'd the employee who put in that grievance calling the whole thing a farce, amateur hour, and a serious threat to both the corporation's and the union's interests. i generously copy-pasted lengthy parts of the crazy stuff written in that chatroom. i knew i was taking chances by sending an angry email this broadly, but it still worked out. before business hours the next morning, union execs had a talk with upper management, and within the day, the chatroom was offline and they were working things out, including the grievance. for almost two years afterwards, we simply had no chat service. once we launched one again, it was strictly one-on-one, and serviced by dedicated employees who weren't multitasking. that's the only way to do it properly. it shouldn't need to be said, but never put multiple angry customers in the same chatroom before you've even had a chance to address their issues. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](i work service desk at a law firm. the most common calls i get are "how do i do [x] in [office application]." generally, i have the answers ingrained in me, but occasionally i'll get a new one and have to google it. today, i had an attorney call in: attny: "how do i change text direction in excel?" me: "one moment" *proceed to search google for "change text direction in excel"* attny: "are you googling it? i'll beat you." me: "i have the steps..." attny: (interrupting) "i do too, " *proceeds to read the steps from google.* "thanks." *click* [edit: formatting]i'm busy wrestling with a situation that has just cropped up as our main printer has suddenly and catastrophically failed. the phone is glued to my ear as i'm talking to the suppliers engineer as he's instructing me to do an engineer reset and perform various other tasks. it's not a simple thing. up to my desk sidles my favourite sales drone, a girl called sara (not her real name). she patiently waits for five minutes and the second the phone goes down, she speaks. &gt;sara: you busy? &gt;me: extremely. we've lost the printer and i need to get it running or the paperwork run will have to be done manually. &gt;sara: i've got an urgent issue. one of the suppliers is asking for a volume of material used in our product that they ordered. can you look at it please. &gt;me: you can send it to me, but i doubt i'll get time to do this today. &gt;sara: it's super important as this is part of our contract with them. if we don't supply this information, they'll go elsewhere. &gt;me: right now, if i don't get this fixed, no product will be made next week. losing 300k is a bit more important than potentially losing a customer. send me the details and i'll see what i can do. after condemning the printer and picking a new shiny one, i sat down at my desk and wrote a quick script in our app to produce the required report. i gave sara access to this and went up to see her. &gt;me: ok, i've written you a function that will allow you to respond to these messages yourself. you don't need to do anything technical, simply click this icon, enter their email address in the top field, add the quote numbers in the box below and click go. &gt;sara: what does it send them? &gt;me: it gives them a breakdown of the volume of materials in each item and for each quote and as a whole. it also adds that the volume is weight / density based and therefore might not be completely accurate however it's the best we can manage. a week later: &gt;sara: i need to send out some material volumes again. can you... &gt;me: use the icon i gave you. &gt;sara: but i don't understand how it works. &gt;me: you don't have to. just follow the instructions and you'll be fine. two weeks later: email from customer, forwarded by sara. &gt;material volumes request. please can i have the material volume for the following delivered products please... i reply to sara with: &gt;me: please use the app i wrote for you. &gt;sara: but you're the technical person. i don't understand this whole volume thing. &gt;me: ??? needless to say that i emailed her, copying in her boss and the md with instructions and where the demarcation line between her job role and mine was.extra! extra! hot off the presses - user commits unbelievable act of stupidity! that's right folks, it's time for another round of "america's funniest computer users"! our user heroine today is a billing specialist - one of the lovely middle-aged women in the doc's office who verify your insurance and convert the doctor's diagnosis into billable codes. she's also completely clueless as to how a computer works. we yanked her old tower (finally killing off another xp machine), and dropped in a new one last night. we reconnected her existing dual monitor setup and left a note to call us in the morning to get any old files or programs we missed migrated over. on the phone this morning, as we're copying her bookmarks over: &gt; user: "by the way, sgtk, my second monitor isn't working!" &gt; sgtk: "ahm... it looks like it's connected and detected, plus my remote access app is showing me two monitors. are you sure it's not working?" *i move the mouse to the second screen* &gt; user: "it's just showing the mouse over there - it's not bringing up any information on the second monitor." *blink* &gt; sgtk: "ah - the monitor's working fine. you just haven't put anything over there yet." &gt; user: "i... haven't put... how do i do that?" *blink blink blink* &gt; sgtk: *as i demonstrate* "err - you just need to drag a window over there." &gt; user: "ooooooooh. i forgot about the dragging..." if you'll all excuse me, i need a coffee refill. i work for a rural telco troubleshooting internet, tv, and phone issues. there is a customer who is so unbelievably stupid i thought she was just trolling us the first few times she called in. i am going to paste in an internal ticket word for word. you can feel the tech's frustrations... &gt;customer cannot display webpages. **** shows modem offline. asked customer to look at modem, customer says she does not know what that is. describe modem to her, she locates ***. ask her to power cycle, she says she does not know how to. tell her to unplug the electric cable, customer says she does not know what that is. advise electric cable is the only cable plugged into a wall outlet, customer says she doesn't know what that is either. tell her its the only one that looks different than the others, customer claims she doesn't know anything about wires.... &gt;okay, what lights are on? customer says no lights are lit. modem must not be powered up. ask customer to look at her wall outlet, she says she doesn't know what that is. &gt;ask her if there is a power strip, she says she doesn't know, ask her if there is a strip of things with plugs. yes. &gt;okay, is there a red switch? yes. ask her to push it, she asks me how to do that. tell her to literally press it with her hand, and then she finds an ac adapter that is not plugged in. &gt;customer managed to plug it in, and the modem worked properly. ugh.so today was my first day at my new job: part time as an in-store tech for a big-box tech support company (take a guess). it happened to be an extremely busy day, so they immediately put me to work on data transfers. simple stuff- pull the old hard drive and transfer user files to the new one. one of the full-timers stayed with me and had me walk him through the process for the first computer (i have no previous job experience in this field, so they were understandably cautious). 100 gigabytes, pulled off an old but still functional drive. easy as it gets. after windows reported it's success, i open up the user file on the new computer to double check. contacts: empty. desktop: empty. downloads: empty. documents, music, pictures- all empty. finally, i reach "my videos". sure enough, just short of 100 gigs in that file. all of it porn. i turned to the tech supervising me. "...someone actually paid $100 for a data transfer... just to save their porn?" he smiled sadly at me, and replied: "welcome to tech support, kid." this was about...oh... 12 years ago, in my tech support days. i get this call from a lawyer in nyc, and his computer is down for the count. he has a next business day warranty, but this is friday night. so his parts won't ship out until monday, arrive until tuesday, and i told him he'll be getting a call from a contracted repair technician on tuesday. &gt;"i have a next business day warranty, so i am going to need it fixed tomorrow." &gt;"yes sir," i empathize, "i understand, but the next business day, since we're after the cutoff for the weekend, is actually tuesday." ugh...lawyers &gt;"fine, then i am going to need a loaner system." &gt;"i'm sorry sir," i apologized, "but loaner systems are not logistically feasible. we cannot offer those, and do not have those to offer. even if we had systems in your area, they would be unlikely to have the right software loadout and files for you. so we just do not offer that service." i really don't think he's stopped to consider how hard it would be to offer loaner systems. &gt;"let me make this more clear to you," he was getting angry now, "i am a lawyer, and i have a next business day warranty, and i will get my system fixed tomorrow or i will get a loaner tomorrow." &gt;"once again sir, i'm sorry, but you won't. there is no one here who can make that happen for you." &gt;"i am a lawyer, i cannot be without my system, fix it tomorrow!!" &gt;"you are a lawyer, correct sir?" &gt;"yes." &gt;"did you read your service contract?" ...pause... &gt;"my system isn't getting fixed until tuesday, is it?" &gt;"correct sir." &gt;"but i can't be without my system for three days." &gt;"then you should have bought two of them sir."**$csr_user:** my call center display says i logged in at eight fifty nine, that's not right! i logged in right at eight today. i'm supposed to be logged in at eight, and if i'm not i'll get in trouble. is there anything you can do to fix it?

scarfy had a bewildered look on his face. he wasn’t sure what to make of this suddenly nice redcheer. &gt;scarfy: my… er… my… scarfy’s eyes looked like they were attempting to calculate what was going on. &gt;scarfy: my computer isn’t connecting to the network properly, its got internet… but i can’t connect to other computers. &gt;redcheer: don’t worry, *i’ll* have that fixed in no time. redcheer opened up cmd. then typed in help. she started reading the options. &gt;scarfy: i’m kinda busy…. airz can you just…. &gt;redcheer: no! i have to learn! i stood behind redcheer, scarfy looked nervous. i decided redcheer reading the help command in cmd wasn’t the best use of time. &gt;me: hey redcheer, maybe you should look troubleshooting steps up on the internet. &gt;redcheer: mmmm might be quicker. i’ll learn what this does later. redcheer then clicked open the browser. it had been minimized at the bottom of the page. &gt;**job website** &gt;*jobs for designers* redcheer stared at the screen for a few seconds. she finally found the words. &gt;redcheer: wha….? &gt;scarfy: look, just… i can’t… the both looked at each other, i wasn’t really sure what was going on. the silence was palpable. &gt;redcheer: airz, can… you fix the rest of this. i gotta… go. redcheer stood up and just walked away, she looked oddly shell shocked. scarfy looked at me, as if waiting for something. i decided to take redcheer’s seat and start fixing the computer. &gt;scarfy: arn’t you going to go make sure she’s okay? &gt;me: what? i was confused. however my confusion about why scarfy’s computer wasn’t playing nice with the network was swiftly cured. a second window was open behind the job search. &gt;**ways to search anonymously** &gt;*ten ways to make sure no-one is snooping on your internet* i looked down the list. it was filled with terrible ideas. &gt;me: you didn’t actually follow this list did you? the first item was downloading a “secure” program. the entire website looked like where virus’s are born. &gt;scarfy: well i didn’t exactly want to spread that i was searching for a new job did i? i looked at the processes tab. it had 150+ processes running. yep, it was infected. &gt;me: i think you’ve managed to get this pc infected. it’ll have to be scrubbed. &gt;scarfy: before you start that, go look for redcheer. &gt;me: huh? she was here a second ago. scarfy stood up, swung his leg backwards and forward (lightly) into my shin. &gt;scarfy: go! … not wanting to get kicked again i walked away from the infected workstation. when i looked behind me scarfy had a smile that said “see, told you kicks solve everything”. his eyes however, only held sadness. i never did get back to the infected computer. i did leave a note for the returning tech though. [next](i work for a mobile phone chain in australia, just to give everyone reference. the average busy day, mild tech support, sales and the rest. in a lull i sit at one of the desks and before long a call comes in. me: " yada yada store, this is yada, how can i help you?" c: "oh good, i was just at &lt;another branch&gt; and the guy there was just down right rude and unhelpful." m: "sorry to hear that, i would love to help you. so what is it you need to do?" c: "so, i have these golf clubs" m: "uhm?" c: "and my friend said they would sell real quick on e-bay" m: "okay?" c: but the guy at the other shop wouldn't do it!!!!! m: im sorry sir, do what?

c: i need to sell those clubs to get the money to go to melbourne next week! m: uhh....... i am really sorry but i can't help you with that sir. c: you &lt;expletive&gt; are all the same. i am going to go change to my phone to &lt;competitor&gt;. *slam the phone* i just sat there flabbergasted.so here's one i thought you all might get a kick out of. a new guy started in my office a week ago. he sits in the cube next to mine, he's a vet and has served in iraq and afghanistan. i think he's a nice guy, kind of laid back for someone who just got out of a war zone. he seems to know his stuff, fitting in nicely. well today i'm sitting in my cube, it's after 5:00 pm which is considered after hours for most of our clients. this is important because in some cases if we have to escalate an issue it wont be attended to until the next business day, especially for one of our clients that has a no exception policy for some crazy reason. with the holiday weekend, that means something coming in tonight wont be addressed until at least wednesday. so i'm sitting there wrapping up a ticket and i hear him catch a call. he reads the script for our crazy client (no exceptions) and starts troubleshooting with the caller. i hear him go through the steps and he decides he has to escalate the ticket. he tells the caller that given the holiday weekend, he may not hear back for at least four days. just then i can hear the client screaming at him on his head set. i stand up and i look at him, he's sitting there cool as a cucumber fiddling with a rubiks cube while this caller screams at him. he casually tells the caller this, "please, i've been in iraq and afganistan. i've had people trying to kill me every day for the past six years. raising your voice to me like that will not get your issue attended to any faster. i can put in an email to the head of the level 2 department, but if he decides you have to wait until wednesday, there's nothing more i can do." the caller seemed to calm down and my co-worker just smiled, "that's alright, i'll send that email now. have a nice day." i learned something very important today, you don't know how bad you've got it unless you've had your life on the line, makes the stuff i've had to put up with seem so trivial now. that and it's possible to be a hardcore bad ass and still be polite and maintain your dignity. hey tfts! i'm a ltl;ftp. i used to work for a walk in phone and tablet repair centre for #koreantech, and have since moved on to another line of walk in tech support, but this story is about back then. i frequently got strange customers and issues, but this is one that's always stuck with me. a customer walks in about half way through a standard day of work, sits at my desk and tells me her problem. we'll call her broken phone lady (#bpl). bpl: "i've noticed that my phone has been getting really hot and slow recently! can you fix it?" i tell her i'll do what i can, take her phone and scan her imei in to our systems to check the warranty is still valid. when the system brought up the details of her phone, i noticed two issues. the back case of her phone is for the 3g model and has the logo of #fruittelco, yet the system says she should have the 4g model from #oxygentelco. i shrug it off and begin the physical inspection of the phone whilst asking her for more details about her use of the phone. after talking with her, i notice nothing out of the ordinary with what she was telling me, but notice something didn't look right about the back of her phone. the camera and flash seemed discoloured, and the plastic was flat and missing details. on closer inspection, i realised it had melted. uh oh. me: "excuse me a minute, i'm just going to talk with a technician." i walk in to the back and bring the phone to my manager. my mind went straight to worst case scenario and thought the phone could have possibly overheated intensely and melted the back. after a quick inspection by both of us, he tells me to go back out and ask if the customer was aware of the damage at all. me: "we've noticed there's some melting on the back of your phone, were you aware of this at all?" bpl: "oh! i forgot all about that. it shouldn't be a problem though." me: "sorry? what happened?" bpl: "a while ago i forgot i left the stove on and put my phone down. when i came back to it, the back cover had completely melted! but that shouldn't be a problem, i bought a new back cover." i thank her for her honesty and inform her that her phone is 100% out of warranty. she took it suprisingly well, and left without causing a scene! so, i originally submitted this story as [a comment]( on the [crack laptop story]( and more than 20 people thought i should submit it as a main story, so here you go. a few years ago i worked as a repair technician at a popular, name-brand computer store, and the specific store i worked at was in a suburban area well-known for a high concentration of rich bitches (and their rich dick husbands and rich twat children). you may have seen a movie starring lindsey lohan that was based on the high school that serves this particular area... one day, a woman came in with a laptop. this woman was fully decked-out in that particular combination of gaudy jewelry and name-brand clothing that is meant to tell the world "i'm richer than you, so shut up and do my bidding, serf," but actually it just screams "i married my husband for his six-million-dollar inheritance and now i'm blowing both the money and the pool boy." i assume you're familiar with this type of person – the type that thinks that listening or paying attention to directions is so clearly beneath her station in life that even asking her to do so is a waste of her time. before she even got to the counter, i noticed the snowboarding sticker on the lid of the laptop. it stuck out, because it was totally discongruous with the rest of her belongings. so i wasn't surprised when the first words out of her mouth were "i bought this laptop for my son" – most of these people would buy a laptop for each of their children by the time the kids were in middle school. and the next words out of her mouth were "and he says it doesn't turn on anymore." the laptop was a year or two old, and appeared to be in pretty good shape – a little bit of scuffing, no obvious damage – but any time we had a computer without power, we were supposed to double-check for liquid damage before we quoted a repair. so i excused myself and took the computer to the back room and opened it up. sure enough, there were some remaining residue spots and even a few drops of water left inside the machine. but that's not what caught my attention. on that particular model the keyboard is built into the top panel of the housing, so you have to remove the entire panel and keyboard to open the machine. as i pulled the panel off and turned it over onto the workbench, some little greenish flakes fell out of somewhere. i looked closer at them. they looked strangely... familiar. i took a hard look at the keyboard... especially the edges around the keys, where dust and hair get in. more green flakes seemed to be trapped there. so i took a can of compressed air, put the nozzle up to the back side of the keyboard. a ton of green flakes flew out all over the workbench. i was starting to get an idea of what might have happened to this computer. so i dipped my finger in the drops of remaining liquid inside the computer, raised it to my nose, and sniffed... which confirmed my theory. this kid had been smoking pot, and i don't know if he was rolling joints on this keyboard or what, but over the past couple of years he had managed to get at least *an entire bowl* worth of ground marijuana trapped in his keyboard. and the spilled liquid that had fried his laptop in the end? *bong water.* nasty, funky, grody bong water. i showed my discovery to the other technicians, and we all had a good laugh. one of the newer techs asked me "so what are you going to tell her?" i thought about this for a moment. this lady was *not* the sort of person who would react well to having a retail keyboard-jockey tell her that her son was up to no good. the more i thought about it, the more i thought "...hell, if this lady were *my* mother, i'd be using every form of chemical escapism available to me, too!" so my course was clear. i blew the rest of the bits out of the keyboard, wiped up the weed that was all over the bench, reassembled the thing and took it back out front. "i'm sorry, ma'am, but it does appear that a glass of water must have been spilled near the laptop. under these circumstances we do have to ship the laptop out to be fully rehabbed, and it will not be covered under warranty. the cost to get this laptop working again will be $755, and we could have it ready in about a week." she didn't even flinch; she paid without hesitation. i never told her what i'd found. wherever you are, bro, i hope you survived high school. **tl;dr: rich bitch mom brings in son's laptop, full of weed and fried by spilt bong water. i do the kid a solid by wiping away the evidence.**while this is not official tech-support, i figured you guys would like to hear a truly happy tale. it involves technology, babies, and cookies, so it has to be worth it. at my firehouse, we check and install child safety seats. enter new parents we'll call dirk and amy and their adorable two day old daughter emma. now dirk is not letting one iota of this child's first week go undocumented. i can only imagine what's on the camera. dirk had done an excellent job of installing emma's child seat. in fact, it only needed a little bit of tightening. while i went over the paperwork, dirk asked if he could use the restroom. i showed him to the restroom, and returned to the vehicle for mom and baby were playing happily. mom took it upon herself to get the camera to take some more pictures of baby emma. dirk returned from the restroom to see mom taking more pictures of baby emms sleeping. "honey, the camera wouldn't take any more pictures, but i used that format thing to make more room," said mom. all color left dirks face. i honestly thought we were going to have to load him in the ambulance. he broke out into a cold sweat and did everything he could to contain his panic. that card had in fact contained all of the photos from birth until now for baby emma. i thought the man was going to cry. in fact, upon seeing his reaction, mom realized what she had done. before this lovely couple started yelling at each other, i told her "turn off the camera right now." i explained to him that the pictures could likely be retrieved even though the card had been formatted. his response was one of incredulity. he did not believe that was possible. i retrieved my laptop, inserted their sd card, and proceeded to recover all but a couple of the photos from the birth of baby emma until their visit to the fire station using some sd recovery software i'd used before. in the end, marital harmony was retained, baby emma's first days will survive in pictures, and my whole crew was treated to a couple of boxes of thin mints and a half gallon of vanilla ice cream. tl;dr mmmmm..... thin mints cookies and vanilla ice cream. hello! my first post in this subreddit, though i've been lurking for awhile. i'll start off my saying i work at an authorized dealer for a cell phone company. basically we are our own company, but only offer the services of a single nationwide cellphone provider. we have over 50 locations and i am the single it guy. i take care of 280 computers, logins and passwords for over 400 workers and make our logins/passwords for all our demo phones in the stores as well as several other tasks. so... this takes place about a year ago. it falls within my realm as it support so i'm hoping this fits well. there i am at a book signing, its around 7pm so most of our stores have another hour to go before closing. my cell phone rings, the id says it's a manager of one of our stores about 250 miles away. i shall call him $cowboy. $me: "this is armantes." $cowboy: "armantes... we got our ipad stolen. are you near a computer?" $me: *looks around* "i am nowhere in the vicinity of a computer. what do you mean your ipad got stolen? is there security camera footage?" $cowboy: "i'm looking for it now. i need you to track the ipad though. are you seriously not near a computer?" i remember suddenly we have a store location at the particular mall i'm at for the book signing. $me: "oh! yeah! gimme two minutes, $cowboy!" i run to the store. new guy is behind the counter. "hey $newguy! i'm your computer guy. i'm going to shanghai one of your computers to track a stolen ipad. call $yourmanager if you have a problem with it, she knows me." he gives me a confused look and decides he'd rather not deal with me. i log on to icloud and the tablet is turned off. i relay this to $cowboy. i set the alert, ping, lost, practically every setting i can. i go back to my book signing in peace now knowing it's probably not going to amount to much of anything. i get home around 11:30pm, check my email and don't see any updates so i go to bed. i lay, toss, turn and eventually get back up at 12:30am and decide i'll check the find my iphone portion of icloud. i don't expect to see much since no new e-mails have come through. i log in. tablet is offline. i grab a drink of water. i sit back down. "loading...." ipad pops online...at 12:45am. i get the email with an address. i log the address into google maps, go to street view. well that looks... interesting (in a "this is totally a drug house" kind of way). i google the local police dispatch number and give them the case number i had gotten from $cowboy and get forwarded to the officer on duty after a generous 45 minute hold. $cop: "what can i do for you?" $me: "hi! this is in reference to case number xxxxxxx. i'd like to report an address that was pinged from our ipad." $cop: "absolutely. what is it?" $me: "1234 badsideoftown lane, x city and y zip" $cop: "oh...really? i know that house. it's not a good place. thanks for the info. what time will you be available tomorrow if we have any questions?" $me: "i wake up at 7am, but i generally don't get to my office until 8am." we exchange numbers and i go to sleep giddy in the fact, for once, icloud came in somewhat useful. i shall interrupt the story now by saying throughout the night $cowboy had been texting me and he was ready to go down to the house, revolver in hand and take back his store ipad. i informed him i already let the cops know, but if he wanted to do a stakeout of his own i wasn't going to stop him, only that i said it would be an awful idea and i highly suggest he stays home and goes to bed. *8am* i take my first step (literally) into my office. my cellphone rings, it's $cop. $me: "morning, detective! what can i help you with?" $cop: "hey armantes! just wanted to let you know i just produced the warrant to the occupants of the house. turns out that you giving me evidence of something being in this house was all it took for the judge to sign off. there are (pause for effect....) a lot of goodies here. i'll call you later if we're able to confirm your ipad is here." turns out this house had been used as a meth distribution point. there was a very large sum of cash, large crates full of science equipment and scales, drugs and several stolen electronics. unfortunately due to ongoing investigation of drug trafficking we still haven't gotten our ipad back. oh! $cowboy did end up going to stake-out the house. an officer found him at 3am, gave him a warning that the people in the house have been known to shoot at cops for just knocking on the door. $cowboy left a few minutes after he heard that tale.[previous]( another pda dropped dejectedly down on my desk. it’s screen cracked, its owner non fussed. &gt;saleshead: can you get this back to me by this afternoon. i’ve got a very dull offsite meeting to attend… &gt;me: this is the third screen you've cracked this week! saleshead looked down at my exasperation with a look of boredom. &gt;saleshead: they’re really easy to break. sorry for using the device you gave us. geez. &gt;me: three screens. in a week! i looked over to the rapidly dwindling spare screen pile. &gt;saleshead: just give me the forms, okay? &gt;me: surely after two... i looked down at my hand in awe, holding up three fingers. saleshead started to look slightly annoyed at my antics. &gt;saleshead: what do you care? your not even paying for the screens. &gt;me: first it was in your pocket and broke, then it was accidentally dropped and broke. what happened to this one? i slid the forms across the desk. &gt;saleshead: seriously. why does it matter? my department pays for all the screens i break. stop going on. &gt;me: it’s not the cost. it’s the time! every screen takes time to replace… &gt;saleshead: pssh. time. how long does it even take? &gt;me: at least 20 minutes. saleshead stood back up with a smile, a look of triumph. she finished filling out the form an started to leave. &gt;saleshead: complaining about only 20 minutes. sheesh. saleshead shook her head at me as she parted. &gt;me: three though. **three** saleshead turned around to see me wide eyed holding up three fingers. &gt;me: in a **week**. [next]([previous]( ***** after seeing the demountable site offices that looked like mini caravans parked outside our main building, walking in for my first day i was excited for the new year. perhaps it would finally get the space it deserves, i thought looking around at our cramped department. getting to my office, i relaxed in my chair. however not a moment later the phone rang, picking it up i heard the gruff seasoned voice of a builder. &gt;gbuild: is this it? &gt;me: yeah, you’ve reached the head of it. &gt;gbuild: oh excellent, i was wondering if you’d connect up our site office to the internet for us. i smiled at the thought of getting to see what was actually inside a site office. &gt;me: sure thing, i’ll be up in half an hour. i grabbed a long patch cable and cable ties, while attempting to figure out the nearest network port. upon arriving at the site office i knocked on the door. silence greeted my knocks. i attempted to open the site office, the door swung open. no one was inside. the entire office was pitch black, someone had covered all the windows with ply wood. my hand reached for the light switch. **flick** nothing. no lights. no power. brilliant. i sighed, and tried to fumble my way through the office, with just the light from the door. it was impossible, things were everywhere… upon evaluation i decided it was too dangerous a task to climb over the desks and chairs in almost pitch blackness without a flashlight/torch. i turned to retrieve one from my office. ***** walking into my office, my phone started to ring. perfect timing, i thought. &gt;gbuild: yeah, hello. its the head builder again. you said you’d be half an hour, its been forty five minutes and you’re still not here. what’s happening? &gt;me: oh i was just out at your office, there is no power. no lights or anything. &gt;gbuild: we’re still trying to figure out how to get power, for now we need internet working… i started getting an odd feeling. &gt;me: i’m getting a torch/flashlight so i can pass the cable into your office through the…. side ports? without falling over. &gt;gbuild: cool. can you get that done by lunch? i wondered how long i could stretch out putting a cable through a hole, and a window… probably to next year if i really got my snail pace going. &gt;me: yeah… grabbing my torch and wondering what builders were going to do with internet but no power or lights i make my way back up to their offices. getting to the builders site office, i realise yet again that no one is around. odd. i pass the cable through a hole in one of the plywood “window covers” and through a window of our main building and into a network port. the end of that cable i plug into the switch that is sitting on one of the desks. done. ***** i smile, and sit down on the chair in my office. job well done, i thought. immediately however, the phone rings. &gt;gbuild: yeah, it’s me again. you’ve run a cable for the internet i see, but it doesn’t work for our systems, without power… &gt;me: well it wouldn’t, the switch its plugged into needs power to run. the internet however is connected. &gt;gbuild: seems useless without power. i sighed into my phone, this builder didn’t seem that smart. &gt;me: yep. &gt;gbuild: you’re in charge of getting all the it stuff working right? &gt;me: yeah, thats generally our department. &gt;gbuild: okay, well none of our it equipment will work without power, so can you organize someone to come out and connect us up with power. so our it will work. i was close to just hanging up the phone… &gt;me: no. &gt;gbuild: but.. i didn’t hear the end of that sentence… the phone was already on the hook. [next]([previous]( as i walked away from my first “job” of the day, i looked over towards the break area. a steaming unclaimed cup of coffee was sitting on the bench. did someone make it for me? &gt;scarfy: airz!, o0oh can you come back and help me with the printer? i looked forlornly over at the printer area, my mind screamed at me to say "no" to anything to do with printers. &gt;airz: er… i’ll just grab a cup of coffee. then i’ll work out whats up with the printers. &gt;scarfy: oh, that coffee on the bench is free, one of the other designers made it for me, you can have it. a coffee, still steaming, is now mine! i was internally screaming “yes”. after i grabbed it i walked back over to scarfy’s workstation. &gt;scarfy: okay airz. so when i print it gets this error. do you know anything about printers? i took a sip of my coffee. it was instant. i felt a distinct lurching in my stomach. &gt;me: oh huh. would it be rude to throw away this horrible excuse for coffee? scarfy got up from his desk, walked over to the laser printer. i followed him to the print area. &gt;scarfy: well even if you're not a printer expert, i’ll show you what i do normally hopefully you’ll have some other ideas. scarfy then lifted his foot off the ground, swung it backwards then flung it forward with great force straight into the side of the printer. the kick bounced off the plastic and made the entire unit slightly shudder. &gt;me: woah! scarfy. what are you doing? &gt;scarfy: sometimes a good kick and it’ll start working. i looked down at the printer before me. poor little guy, he’s been abused like crazy. i kinda felt sorry for the printer, just a bit. &gt;scarfy: well, i’m all out of ideas. so what would you do now? the printer beeped helplessly up at me, “save me” the printer was probably shouting at me. &gt;me: you know what scarfy? you should get to downloading those files you wanted and leave this printer with me. poor printer. scarfy decided that was good enough for him and walked away. i looked down at the struggling device. lets see whats wrong with you…. the screen flashed an error code when i tried a test print. printers were no fuss, with easy to read errors. &gt;**error code: xxxxxx** excelent i’ll have the poor thing up on his feet in no time, i thought as i started walking over to the computer. **search : error code xxxxxx** &gt; **results: general fault** general fault. how specific. i started reading the various things that are usually associated with the error. &gt; broken fuser, broken rollers, broken motor, power fault, main board fault, clogged drum, damaged drum, feeder unit jam, feeder unit general fault, gearing jam… oh for goodness… literally the entire printer was listed under the “general fault” heading. i realised i’d have to open up the poor guy and see what was happening inside. printer maintenance. not usually my forte. scarfy decided he’d come take another look at how the printer was going. &gt;scarfy: so, any luck so far? &gt;me: er, just narrowing down the things it could be… i cracked open the paper feeder and opened the unit doors. scarfy took a seat, and decided he wanted to chat. &gt;scarfy: i had a printer at home once… &gt;me: oh … what happened to it? i looked inside, i started spinning the drum. seemed to spin okay. &gt;scarfy: well at the time i had a girlfriend, and one time the printer broke. i moved it off the desk and gave it a kick, and that didn’t work. &gt;me: haha, you know kicking these things probably isn’t great for the calibration. usually doesn’t help that much either. i looked at all the rollers, they all seemed to spin fine. &gt;scarfy: trust me. a swift kick sorts out more problems then you’d expect. anyway the broken printer wasn’t working, and my girlfriend got really mad. she ended up throwing it into a drywall. massive dent in the wall. pretty spectacularly though the printer didn’t fall out of the wall. everything inside the printer seemed to be working reasonably well… i started putting things back into the printer. &gt;scarfy: i plugged it in though… started working while lodged in the wall. &gt;me: sorry, you saw a printer lodged in a wall, so you thought…. i’ll just go plug that in? &gt;scarfy: i had a hunch. plus it printed what we needed. i put the trays back into the printer. closed everything up and pressed test page. &gt;me: haha…. fair enough. i was skeptical… i looked down at the printer. i had done literally nothing except pull it apart and put it back together. the test page printed successfully. weird. &gt;scarfy: i ended up leaving it in the wall. the printer worked at that exact spot for a few years after that. i clicked test page again. &gt;me: so it stopped working eventually? &gt;scarfy: well eventually it ran out of ink and when i replaced the ink and put the printer back in the hole in the wall, it just didn’t wanna work anymore. the printer started letting off distressed tones. i didn’t know if it was a protest to the story of printer torture, or an actual problem. i looked down at the screen. error code xxxxxx f***. [next](*or how i thought i was removing my own access before getting fired.* years ago, i used to do outsourced tech support. on one of the accounts i supported, i administered accounts on mainframes and the applications that were on them. most of the time we get requests from hiring managers or supervisors to give or revoke access to either the mainframes or an individual application. once in a while we'll receive a request to revoke access for a user from an auditor (i.e. employee no longer works but id is somehow still in the system etc.). so i was happily administerin' along when i receive the following ticket: &gt;please revoke access to [application] for the following user: prodigaltoast [my id] at the time, i was more than a little worried. the particular company i worked at was in the process of downsizing and laying-off staff. the mood was quite gloomy during that period, especially seeing our floor, which once had ~450 tech support agents, down to half that size. so was i *really* being asked to revoke my own access, and was this in preparation for firing me? i hesitantly brought it to the attention of my team lead. &gt;**me**: ummm, **team lead**, can you take a look at this ticket. &gt;**team lead**: sure. hmmm, just looks like a standard revoke request. &gt;**me**: take a look at the user. &gt;**team lead**: uh? ....oh. ummm, are you getting fired? &gt;**me**: am i?! &gt;**team lead**: i don't think so...let's have **team manager** look at this. &gt;**team manager**: hmmmm...are you getting fired? &gt;**me**: am i?! &gt;**team lead**: i didn't fire him... &gt;**team manager**: i'm pretty sure only i can fire him, i think... &gt;**me**: did you?! &gt;**team manager**: it would be a dick thing to do to make him revoke his own access before we escorted him out of the building. anyways, what do think we should do about this, prodigaltoast? &gt;**me**: well, technically i could just revoke my account and it wouldn't really change anything. because i have administrative rights to the mainframe the application resides on, i can just go re-activate my account whenever i need specific access to that application. in the end, this ticket is basically a 2 minute waste of my time. you know, as long as i’m not being fired. thankfully, the ending was anticlimactic. it was a pretty useless ticket, and i assume it was because of some automatic audit thing, but as an administrator i was exempt from those audits, so i never really figured it out. my notes for the ticket looked like this: &gt;[my id]: revoked access to application for user [my id] &gt;[my id]: resumed access to application for user [my id] to confirm user [my id] had been revoked. sorry if this rips off the story about waiting for the web developer but i couldn't resist posting it. someone came into the store. they asked me if i could go grab the the person in charge of building custom computers(common mistake). &gt;me: i'm the one in charge of custom pcs &gt;$cust: haha very funny. you aren't old enough to know about building computers. go find me the person in charge of custom pcs. &gt;me: i'm not joking i really am in charge of custom pcs &gt; $cust: no you're not. you're wasting my time and i would like to speak with the owner. i went and grabbed the owner(who is also my neighbor so we're on a complete first name basis) and the conversation went as followed. &gt; $owner: can i help you? &gt; $cust: this kid here is insisting he is in charge of custom pcs and won't get me the real one. he's wasting my time. &gt; $owner: he actually is in charge of custom pcs. &gt; $cust: no he's not, i already had this conversation with him. go get me the person that's really in charge of custom pcs. at this point the owner just asked the customer to leave &gt; $owner: ma'am if your going to waste our time here i'm going to ask that you leave. &gt;$cust: neither of you are worth my time anyways. i'll go find someone who knows what they're talking about. she then left and gave us a terrible review which we replied to and got removed. tl;dr there's software defined hardware, and customer defined employmentmy first story + my background: [followed the guide, literally]( &amp;nbsp; just had this call 10 min ago: &gt;**me:** it, this is boef &gt;**user:** hey. i’m missing my up and down thingy (scrollbar) in my outlook inbox, but i got it in my sent

running windows 7 -closing ticket edit: wow did not think this would get so many upvotes. thanks guys. lolseveral years ago i was running a 1 to 1 at a k12 school in the us. 1 to 1 deployments mean every high school kid gets a laptop. i was managing 6,000 macbooks and 40 servers, as well as 2,000 or so mac desktops at the time. one day my boss calls me and the conversation goes like this: boss: hey zaphod, we have a serious issue and you need to address it right now me: ok, boss what is this serious issue? boss: your co-worker derp-da-derp-a-lot printed out the master password list for the local admin accounts and left it on his desk, and a student stole it. me: grrrrreeaaat. so, basically i need to reset 6 local admin passwords like right now? boss: yes, drop whatever you're doing and do it now! me: no problem boss i will have it fixed with in the hour. i hang up the phone, whip up a script in bash to reset the local admin password, but i make one fatal mistake in my haste. i forget to output everything to /dev/null, so everything goes to standard output, ie the system.log. my mistake, under pressure, plus i thought no way a high school kid knows unix. i find this out, fix the script, redirect all output to /dev/null and the password in the script stops getting logged. so, the password is on clear text but only on several hundred machines. ok, no problem i am going to send a command out to wipe the system.log file and clean up my mess. since to change the password i had to set a password in a script. this was back in like 2008, and let's say now my scripting behavior is a bit different now. :-) during this small window some kid had been sifting through the console looking at every single log file. somehow, picked out a string he thought looked like a password, and bam he had local admin access to the machines. so, i start doing detective work and use a dummy receipt system. basically look for a file or string that exists and if it does, touch another file to "stamp it" with a dummy receipt, and then build a database of machines based on that file to see what accounts have been promoted to admin accounts. sure enough this one student's user account was synchronized to a lot of macs and sure enough his account was always being promoted to admin. i gathered my evidence, called the student into my office. socially awkward kid, but actually quite brilliant. i asked him why he was violating the aup (acceptable usage policy) and that i had proof he was giving himself admin rights. he broke immediately. i didn't even have to threaten the kid. he spilled his beans, i asked him if he pulled the password form the log, he said yes. i asked him if he had ever used unix before, he said no it was just figuring it out on the fly. i told him i wasn't going to turn him in, and that i will just forget the incident ever happened. he asked me why and i said you're too smart to get expelled or suspended. however, you need to take your brain and use it constructively. what do you want to learn the most on the computer? he said he wanted to start a programming club and develop games in python. next week i rolled down to the storage facility and grabbed a compaq dual xeon server, with a raid 5 controller and 3 hard disks in it and like 4 or 8gigs of ram. it was one of those spend your budget money or lose it deal (government, am i right?) and they had been sitting there since i started working there so about 2 years had passed, and those servers had been collecting dust. they had no os on it. i come into his building with the server on a flat bed. i said here is your development server. here are the rules. you cannot plug this into our network, my network manager will shut this box down immediately, do you understand? yes, he replied. second rule, this server has no os on it, so you must choose what os you want to put on it, and you have to support it yourself. you cannot call help desk for help, and it has to be legit, either open source or someone buy's an actual license. i understand, he said. 2 years later the kid graduates and gets a full ride to boston college. he also wrote the advanced math curriculum his senior year. he did a bunch of stuff in python and latex. oh i also turned him into my mole. every time some kid talked about hacking he would email me and tell me what they were trying to do. i haven't talked to him since, but i bet by now he is graduated. pretty smart kid, hope he succeeds. him getting expelled or suspended or even in trouble may have damaged his record, which may have damaged his chances at a full scholarship. mind you, i was working for an impoverished school district, a lot of families in that district were below poverty level. edit - fixed formatting sometimes it is good not being the iron fist ruling, over authoritative dick head system administrator, but sometimes you gotta do that to get your point across. i was lucky enough to realize the situation and actually put this kid's smarts to productive use. i hope he has a bad ass job right now. edit #2 several of you have expressed interest in the fact it was an impoverished school district and they all got laptops. let me explain to you how budgeting works in public education. the state you live in sets a budget, and according to your size, and your location, you get x amount of dollars every year. now, additionally you can get federal money as well on top of state money. the budget is then broken down into categories. you have budget for staff, which covers their wages, benefits, and so forth. capital outlay is the part of the budget you spend on technology, desks, renovations, and so forth. it cannot be used for salary, the government does not allow you to do so. furthermore, the government has a thing called erate, which i believe is regulated by the fcc. it forces companies who join such a program to lower their prices for schools, and allows schools access to technologies through this program. the school i worked for, which i no longer do work there, decided they wanted to go 1 to 1. with macbooks being about $900 a pop it wasn't too much out of the question. you only have a little bit of savings with a desktop, since you must also pay for keyboards, mice, and monitors, and they require more power. a laptop is 1 plug. the school was about 60 buildings and 30,000 students. the laptop program was at the high school level only, which was 6,000. you have to realize a lot of these kids never even ate their first meal for that day until they came to school. i grew up lower middle class and i thought i had missed out on certain things in life, and that i was a bit under privileged compared to all the other kids i went to school with. i didn't realize how selfish and self centered i was until i got this job. i worked there for 5 years running their laptop program. i got a bike for christmas, and while my family was unable to ever take me on international vacations, or cruises, we at least got to go to the lake for vacation. these kids have nothing. it taught me how privileged i was. giving them a laptop is awesome. sure, some kids will squander their opportunities and not care, sure some will just get by and not take full advantage of it, but some kids will put it to good use and get full scholarships to good colleges and come out on top. that right there makes it completely worth it. **edit #3** it is possible the kid read this post. i am not going to say who my employer was, or where it was because i believe anonymity is the best. i would hate to have anything backlash and reflect poorly on the school system i worked at. plus now i work back in the private sector and have learned it is really just a professional courtesy to keep your mouth shut. i will update if it was really him. **update** the student in question has in fact found this thread, and i have been messaging him via reddit. i have told him i won't reveal his name, my name, or the schools name for anonymity reasons. i think it is best kept that way. he also reminded me of a few other exploits the students found and used which i forgot about. the ard agent bug (apple's fault) which allowed you to run apple script with escalated privileges, ie sudo. then we had a package that had a self healing auto update, and i had to have one folder in that package writable (bad developer) and we managed application usage by file path. so, once students figured out they could drop games in this folder they did. to remedy this i switched off the write bit in posix and then just download and repacked the whole package manually every time an update came out and just redeployed said package. i'll have to admit i was impressed by how adaptive and smart a few of the students were. they made me pay for my mistakes. plus, it is impossible to test every aspect of security with out a security audit team. that is why companies have and contract out it security people to audit such things. i also changed my whole approach of imaging and managing the macs after a lot of these issues. the student in question is finishing up a computer engineering degree currently. glad he made it to a good school.hi all, &lt;?php include 'inc/longtimereaderhead.php'; ?&gt; this is my first post here, so let me know how it went. -- first ticket of the day, i leaned back in my chair staring at the screen in front of me. the ticket was from a woman in accounts, we'll call her pa(pedantic accountant)for short. as usual, the ticket was short and vague. &gt;pa: keyboard doesn't work. please fix. i took a sip of my tea. too hot. i sighed as i walked up the stairs to accounts, wired keyboard under my arm. as i walked in, i was met with pa pacing back and forth across the room, almost jumping on me as i walked in. &gt;pa: thank god you're here! i've got a report due in two hours and i need my computer working! &gt;me: have you not got the report backed up somewhere? &gt;pa: i don't have time for that rubbish, just fix it now! i sat down at the users pc, staring at the login screen. i tried to press one of the keys, but it didn't budge. confused, i tried pressing another. after doing the highly technical 'qwertyuiop' test, i confirmed that all of the keys were stuck. &gt;me: have you had this keyboard long? &gt;pa: no, i only had it yesterday! you people in it messed up everything when you put in that new computer. what was wrong with my... &gt;me: have you spilt anything on this keyboard since yesterday? &gt;pa: no! i never keep drinks near my keyboard. i glanced at the bottle of water next to her keyboard, and she quickly grabbed it and stuffed it in a draw. i looked closer at her keyboard, and saw a clear / off white substance under all of the keys. with great difficulty, i pulled up on the keys and looked at what was beneath it. &gt;me: what the f€$k did you do to this keyboard? &gt;pa: well, i found the keys were too wobbly so i put some superglue underneath them to stop them moving so much. i stared at her for about 10 minutes, before plugging in the new keyboard, picking up the old one and letting her manager know that she shouldn't be within 100ft of glue. or a keyboard. -- how did i do? it's my first tale here, so let me know if something isn't right. tl;dr user doesn't like the movement of keys on keyboard, pours superglue on them to stop the wobbling. edit: whoa, i'm blown away by the response! i was expecting this to drown and fall off the /new :d thanks everyone!so, i work for a small msp and we happen to support a local golf club. said golf club are always meddling with their network and plugging stuff in to things and generally exposing themselves to the outside world. those are stories for another day though. today i get a call from them. i'll be **me:** and they'll be **sec:**. &gt;**me:** good morning this is *companyname* how can i help? &gt;**sec:** hi, this is the secretary from *localgolfclub*. we have no internet? &gt;**me:** hi there *nameofsec*, let's get this sorted. so after 10 minutes or so of turning things off and on. she says this. &gt;**sec:** could this be to do with the stewards, they got internet put in to their building today. *isp* were up on our building too. &gt;**me:** okay, lemme pop over and have a look. now this is starting to sound suspicious. thinking maybe the isp had dislodged something whilst putting the new line on for them, i went over. **nope.** isp had come over, **snipped this businesses line** and moved it over to a residential property. so we go over to the stewards house, and they're complaining that they're getting a bunch of phone calls from people asking for the golf club. so *isp* has well and truly buggered up this business. they've said it could take up to 3 weeks for them to come out and repair it. for a business that takes orders over the internet, this could be quite disastrous for them... welp. i guess i'll get on with trying to get this 4g modem hooked up to their system...[rule one]( it rule two: everything is it. no exceptions. i’m not sure where this trend started, but if you’re part of a competent it team suddenly everything will be your job. the job creep will start innocently, with a phone call. &gt;user: hey, i’m not sure if this is strictly it, but... this conversation is usually instigated by one of the following four people: 1. the user that inexplicably calls it for everything. you’ll be bombarded by inane questions, things that have nothing to do with it at all. all attempts at pleading with the user to **not** call for the fourth time in an hour with non-it related questions fall on deaf ears. eventually your crumbling sanity may cause you to snap at said user. don’t. that would cause the filing of a hostile workplace suit. they’re expensive, you can’t afford it. 2. a user that cannot explain precisely what the problem is, he’ll use it language but in odd ways. (example: yeah, the thing is bleeping, ever since the internet died yesterday.) you’ll try to tease out what specific device he is referring to, unfortunately his skills outside of describing its colour as white have disappeared. eventually you’ll give up and walk to his/her desk. 3. occasionally a user of substance will call. they’ll tell you useful information that isn’t specially your job, but that is useful to know. usually this information is about a fire in a server room or suspicious person blatantly stealing computers. the urge to shout at the user because they should have called either the fire brigade or security may be high. don’t shout however, at least they called **someone**. you’ll probably only lose *half* the server room/computers. 4. sometimes a problem tangentially related to it will call. people will ring it trying to order desks or stationary claiming since these products are essential to the function of their equipment they should have the ability to order it from one central location. attempts to forward the call onto the relevant department will be met with ire. if the following situations have left you disillusioned with the fate of humanity, don’t despair. the following ideas may disrupt the flow of these calls to your desk: 1. filter all it calls through an automated system. these systems annoy everyone, therefore call volume overall will drop. less calls, less non-it calls. — unfortunately your department would now be closer to a bad telecommunications company then an actual helpful service. moral may plummet. lock department windows. 2. attempt to define it tasks through contract negotiation. — beware the phrase “other related tasks”. 3. remove all phones from the department. establish email support only — if you thought people could be vague or obscure on the phone, you’ve never read a long winded seven page email who’s purpose is spread evenly throughout the paragraphs. after 10 minutes of bad grammar you’ll be wanting the sweet release of calling, even with its abuse. 4. allow techs to hang up at any time in a call, no questions asked — … if you’ve managed to land in a department that only deals with pertinent calls, congratulations. your quota for good stuff happening is used up for life. example/story - &gt;user: hey i’m not sure if this is strictly it, but we get a stapler attached to every printer? they keep going missing. &gt;me: sorry, no. we don’t deal with staplers. expecting the user to apologise and hang up, i was rather surprised when he continued. &gt;user: no, i mean physically attached. like with a chain. &gt;me: try calling maintenance. they’ve got chain, and drills. they’ll probably attach it to a desk near the printer. &gt;user: no, no i want it attached to the printer. so can you come do it, now? if you don’t have a stapler, don’t worry, i think i can find one before you get here. &gt;me: ...?! no. we can’t do that. call maintenance. &gt;user: cool. see you soon. the user hung up. he rung angrily the next day, when for a second time his stapler went missing. apparently it’s loss is my fault. i now can't sleep because of the guilt.continuation on the previous xmas party planning session [previous]( __________________ i looked around from my coffee-less existence in the party planning meeting room. i decided coffee was next up on the agenda. i looked over to nice. her eyes deep pools of coffee. &gt;me: coffee time i think. &gt;nice: we need to choose the food though. i got up from my chair. coffee doesn’t wait for food choices. &gt;me: we can discuss it while getting coffee. &gt;nice: but then people will hear, its meant to be a surprise. i looked down at the coffee-less desk. &gt;me: surprise, about the food at a christmas party…. kidding right? her eyes looked conflicted, but glorious. &gt;nice: oh, of course… she smiled. my day was good. i picked up the grinder from the executive floor break room. it was an expensive model. &gt;nice: so what are it foods? &gt;me: it foods? i don’t think any exist. the coffee was being pushed through the machine. soon. &gt;nice: well police have doughnuts… so it have… &gt;me: errr… i looked down at my coffee. i took a sip. coffee was a food group right? &gt;nice: toast! &gt;me: sorry, a toast? i held my cup up in the air, ready to toast whatever nice wanted. &gt;nice: no no, silly. toast. its an it food staple. i looked down at coffee. then back up into nice’s eyes. incomparable. _____________________ &gt;nice: music also needs to be decided, something it themed. &gt;me: when you think it, what music to you think. i took a sip. insights into the mind of the non - it world. &gt;nice: techno! &gt;me: er no, we can’t have a christmas party with techno. &gt;nice: but it has tech right in the name. &gt;i looked wildly around the break room, everywhere but nice’s eyes. &gt;me: tech… no. as in, no tech listens to techno. the negative attitude of the no’s hit home. nice’s eyes, normally such nice dark coffee, now looked watery….. a knock at the door interrupted my thoughts of apologies. vp’s secretary was standing at the door. &gt;vpsec: i couldn’t help overhearing you have a music problem. nice shook off the oncoming tears and looked up at the vp’s secretary. a small scowl formed. &gt;nice: no, no. we’re fine. we got this, everyone will be surprised at the party. vp’s secretary smiled, and looked over at me. &gt;vpsec: airz, don’t you have a new suggestion box. might be worth people filling with music ideas….. &gt;me: i think that was for…. vp’s secretary gave me a look. &gt;vpsec: all ideas are welcome in the idea box. right? &gt;me: err…. &gt;vpsec: don’t worry i’ve already got people to spread round the news, to send all music ideas for the christmas party to the new anonymous suggestion box. i looked down at my coffee. i took a sip. &gt;vpsec: oh and nice… nice looked back into the eyes of vpsec. &gt;vpsec: i know you like techno, so put as many good tracks in the box as you like. &gt;nice: but… the surprise. &gt;vpsec: for a company christmas party….. really? ___________________________ [next]( i'm at a consulting company, doing information security stuff. one of our customers is a regional bank. they've decided to take third party security seriously. for the unfamiliar- any large entity likely trusts third parties, like vendors or business partners with valuable information or access, so making sure those third parties are also secure enough is important. the way this usually works is as follows: our client sends the vendor a 50-100 question questionnaire with yes/no answers and spaces for more elaborate answers. the client then selects 40 or 50 of these vendors for a site visit, which usually takes 4-8 hours. since the bank doesn't have a lot of it or infosec staff to spare, they hire our consulting firm. i've been assigned a bunch of these visits- fly out to city x, sit down with the vendor's compliance, it, hr and other staff, ask them a bunch of questions, walk through their operations and data center, then fly home. generally, i'm not a typical auditor. i realize that nobody does this perfectly. what i'm really afraid of is the liar- the shop that claims to have everything locked up tight and they're really doing nothing. that puts my client at the greatest risk. so, i'm in a city i never thought i'd visit, like kansas city, riverside, california or conshohocken, pa. office parks, mid-line hotels, chain restaurants and rental cars. the consultant's life. i'm auditing a company that handles fairly sensitive data for our client. every question in the questionnaire was answered 'yes' without much explanation. that's a red flag. i decide to probe a bit more. me:"tell me about your dlp (data loss prevention) solution" head of compliance:"our it director can answer that question" it director:"we use a best of breed solution. it blocks all sensitive data from leaving our network" me:"i realize that dlp systems require a bit of tuning to find the sensitive data that your shop deals with. how long did it take to implement?" it director:"just installed it and went. fire and forget." me:"that sounds great. what kinds of data does it block?" it director:"all sensitive data" me:"so, social security numbers?" it director:"of course" me:"what patterns are you looking for?" it director:"any that contain sensitive data" me:"maybe my accent is getting in the way of clarity. social security numbers are 9 digit numbers, usually written in sequences of 3 then 2 then 4. are you looking for all 9 digit numbers traversing your network, or just 3-2-4?" it director, looking annoyed:"all sensitive traffic is interrogated, then blocked. we get alerts." me:"that's amazing. on all your networks, including the guest wireless?" it director, still annoyed and bored:"of course" me:"ok. have you seen an alert for 567-68-0515? that should have traversed your network twice- outgoing and incoming in the last few minutes." it director:"what?" me:"i emailed myself richard nixon's social security number, out of curiousity. from your network. maybe you should change the answer in the questionnaire on dlp to 'no'. are there any other areas you're not so sure on?" needless to say, the rest of the audit was a bit more fun. this happened yesterday: user called asking to "borrow" some zip ties. all i have is the 8" length, which she also already had, but she said she needed about 14". &gt;me: ok, just put two of them together. &gt;user: how do i do that? &gt;me: ...put the pointy end of one into the square end of the other. &gt;user: ok then how do i connect them? &gt;me: ... she could never figure it out and had to get someone to help her.many of the tales on this subreddit are stories of the frustration of clueless users, short-sighted bosses, and basically anything that arises from working in an industry where nobody else really understands what you do. i thought i'd share a different sort of story - the only time i really wasn't sure what to do ethically. i'm still not completely sure i handled this properly, but screw it i'm not going to bother with a throwaway. i had several clients i supported long-term, to the point where i almost became another employee. these were engineering firms, and while they didn't understand all the technology, they understood the value of preventative maintenance, taking care of equipment, and the it itself was typically pretty low-stress. some of the employees would request my services for their personal computers, which is how this story starts. i'm at one of my best clients, and their senior engineer, a man in his 70's, approaches me. i've known him for years, and even met his family at a few company functions. he has a few daughters, and a son - all in their 30's and 40's. here's how the conversation went: * "my son has recently passed away, and i'd like you to help recover some of his files". * "sir, i'm very sorry for your loss. what can i do to help?" * "when going through my son's estate, the most recent copy of his will, which was updated about 2 years ago, has a significant portion of his assets going to his best friend, and not to anyone in the family. we found some files on his laptop we can't open, and thought they might have some clues as to why he made this decision - maybe a journal or something. we always thought we were close with him and are really perplexed as to why he'd disinherit us. the friend seems just as surprised". * "sure, i'll be glad to take a look at it, although depending on the security there might not be anything i'm able to do (i'm thinking truecrypt, etc). * "no problem - whatever you can do" so, i get the laptop, and go home. when i power it up, i see in c:\program files\ are the files in question. archive1.rar, archive2.rar, etc, through about 7 or 8. someone had obviously been doing some digging - who the hell checks program files for rar files? anyway, they vary in size, from say 2gb to 5gb. try to open them up - and of course, password protected. as rar's are known for their rigorous security, i figure i'll have this job done in 5 minutes or less. i grab some random rar password decryptor, and get the password. i open the files, and - they're all filled with - gay porn. most of it is pretty vanilla, but there's a little bit of light bondage and watersports. no journals, personal files, or anything else - just porn. as i work my way through archives 4 and 5, i realize that the file names are all now "john and i doing x" - not the names you'd see from a porn site. great. so, as i realize that i'm looking at the amateaur porn of a dead man who was obviously in the closet to everyone - it dawns on me. the "friend" was really the boyfriend, which is why he was named in the will, and for whatever personal reasons, the son / boyfriend don't feel comfortable coming out to the guy's father, even in death. now's probably a good time to mention that i'm only 19 at the time, and that i also happen to be bisexual (i was completely in the closet at the time, i still am to my family). so now, instead of dealing with a simple file recovery, i'm faced with lying to an important client about his dead son, or outing a dead son and boyfriend - with photographic evidence. fuck. i decided i'd pull the laptop's drive, and search for deleted files, in the off chance the son had a note or journal or letter to his dad that might somehow help the situation. i found nothing helpful - it seemed that his computer was solely for web browsing / online banking / porn. nothing helpful at all. fuck. i thought about it for a while, and decided that the boyfriend was fully capable of disclosing this information if he chose to, and that the son obviously wanted this information secure, and that it wasn't my place to disclose it. however, this still left me in a tricky situation with the father. i couldn't tell him, "sorry, i wasn't able to open the files", because he'd simply find someone else who could, and might not be as discreet as me. somewhere down the line, the boyfriend and son would still be out, and the father would know the homegrown porn existed. no, i had to lie about it in such a way that the father would be satisfied, and not pursue the issue. i pick up the phone: * "hello, it's paracelsus, i've got some news" * "really?!? did you find anything? a journal, notes, anything at all?!?" * "no, i was able to decrypt the files, and i could see why your son wanted to keep them secure. it turns out that he had downloaded some bootleg software and movies off the internet. it's not a big deal, but they can contain viruses and be dangerous to the computer, so you'd want to keep them protected. i'd suggest deleting them, or at least not trying to open them". * "ah, that makes sense. my son was always really good with computers, and i could see him messing around with stuff like that. thank you for letting me know - the last thing i'd want to do is try and open them and mess up his computer. you didn't find anything at all, paracelsus?" * "no, sorry, i even ran a full-drive search for deleted files, just in case there was something in another location. i didn't really find any personal files at all". * "wow, that's thorough! thank you for doing that! how much do i owe you?" * "oh, considering the circumstances, nothing at all... i'm sorry you didn't find what you were looking for, and for your loss." **tl;dr i lied to an old man to keep him from finding his dead, gay, closeted son's amateur porn collection, and kept the son's boyfriend in the closet in the process.** hello! first time poster so play nice, just received this phonecall at the pc repair shop i work at. it went a little something like this: me: hello, *name of our company*. how can i help? customer: oh, hello. erm, i've just turned on my laptop and i don't know how to connect it to the broadbands. i get this call quite often, the gentleman sounded elderly so i gave him a little sympathy. me: okay, are you wanting to connect wired or wirelessly. customer: well, i tried using the yellow cable, but i can't find anywhere to plug it in. this is where my suspicion started, but i thought he might just be getting a bit confused. me: right, well let's just try wireless; what operating system are you running? customer: microsoft me: okay, so windows. do you know what version. (pause) customer: well when i press the button down the bottom left, it says windows95. *sound of face slamming against desk* further conversation discovered customer was using a 17 year old laptop with no ethernet port (only modem for dial-up) and no wireless capabilities to try to connect to his 'broadbands'[previous]( sitting down at my desk i contemplated the upcoming call. two techs destroying equipment, is 100% a fireable offence, however both were not on my payroll. this felt like a call for the bigp, but the vp is probably searching for a way to get rid of both because his budget would look better. calling bigp was mercy. calling vp was death. i was the judge. my hand hovered over the dial. redcheer knocked on my office door. &gt;redcheer: sorry again. about the whole hard drive thing. &gt;me: i’ve heard your apologies. however i can’t reprimand you properly because you’re not on my payroll. redcheer took a deep sigh. she looked slightly upset. &gt;redcheer: screw up **that** bad, huh? i didn’t… know. apologies again. &gt;me: well it’s not me you’ll have to apologise too. i gotta call the bigp. redcheer's face looked disappointed in herself. &gt;redcheer: that’s probably for the best. perhaps i don’t know enough about it to be helpful. i looked over at the sad redcheer, it seemed odd for her not to be smiling. itsec walked up behind redcheer and stood at the door. &gt;itsec: er… i’m really sorry too boss. i didn’t realise that wasn’t a ruined hard drive. i thought it was wrecked. i should have checked. &gt;me: wait, but if you thought it was ruined, why replace it in the stack with a new one from your own collection? &gt;redcheer: that… part was me. to be honest, itsec didn’t have anything to do with it. can’t we keep him out of it. i gave them a questioning expression as i looked between the sullen redcheer, and the downhearted itsec. quite the troublesome pair. &gt;redcheer: itsec showed me his hard drive drawer and told me if i ever wrecked a hdd, to replace it with one from his desk. he was just trying to help. &gt;me: i see. &gt;redcheer: so please airz. ring bigp, but leave itsec out of it. it’s not fair on him. my mind wavered between bigp and vp. mercy, or death? [next](we have a 'special' user, you know the type. everything has to be 100% functioning in the manner that they are comfortable with, or else it's broke. if it takes more than a day, they cc everyone including your mom talking about how unhelpful you have been and requesting more assistance for their "major problem". which it never is. well, they were having a "major" issue where a secure website was making her click two options in ie in order to load, and this was disconcerting to her. i create a chrome shortcut that loads the website normally because this is how others go to that site. all fixed, right? i immediately get a message from her about how it is still doing the same thing. i go to their desk and realize they totally ignored my message about the chrome icon and are still trying to use ie. i show them where the shortcut is, which was difficult because they have 50+ shortcuts on their desk, but this is not acceptable because they "don't trust google". i don't like arguing, i just want to fix shit, so i go back to my desk, only change the desktop icon to ie, and wait. sure enough i get an email thanking me for fixing their problem. a few days ago $boss contacted me about her sudden inability to export reports to pdf. i strutted into her office, as i am wont to do, and asked what was up. &gt; **$boss:** it goes through all the steps of exporting but when i export to the usual network path nothing is there. i've tried restarting the program and the computer but it still doesn't work. &gt; **me:** all right, let's try exporting locally. maybe there's something wrong with the network. the export dialog popped up on the screen for a moment and appeared to do its thing but nope, still no report. &gt; **me:** i don't have this problem so let's log in as me and see whether that fixes it. alas, it did not. at least we'd confirmed it was isolated to one computer. &gt; **boss:** do we need to... reinstall? *violins shrieking in the background* &gt; **me:** it's likely something got corrupted so it's probably the easiest solution. just let me know when you don't need your computer for half an hour or so. an hour or two later i was sitting in her cushy chair happily reinstalling $software along with adobe reader, just in case. 15 minutes later i was banging my head on the desk; nothing had changed. then i realized something.... the dialog popped up *for a moment*. the software in question is a buggy as hell mess so it's usually the first thing i blame for a problem. it's become a dangerous habit to assume any problems with that software must be caused *by* that software. but what if...? &gt; **me:** hey, $boss, doesn't the export usually take a few seconds? &gt; **boss:** you're right! now it disappears almost instantly! &gt; **me:** okay, we've isolated the problem: your export is messed up. i'll see what i can find. after digging around for what seemed like an eternity i found the problem: windows update kb3102429. a harmless-looking little thing that "supports azerbaijani manat and georgian lari currency symbols in windows". apparently that little *optional* update causes crystal reports to have a stroke on pretty much every version of windows &lt; 10. $boss is running 7.... i uninstalled the update, rebooted the computer and voila, all good. aside from the pile of my hair scattered across the floor anyway. $boss promised me a nice bottle of something for christmas as thanks. yay. tl;dr: if crystal reports suddenly can't export to pdf run "wusa /uninstall /kb:3102429" from an admin-priveleged command prompt and reboot. edit: corrected some typos and inserted others.[previous]( nice and defiant watched carefully as i outlined the procedure for getting new mobiles and pda’s connected up to the companies wifi. i was rather nervous about getting them to help out, however i needed the extra hands. &gt;me: okay, everyone ready? any problems come and get me. &gt;defiant: problems?! this’ll be a cake walk. as i opened up the doors, to let the people waiting flood into the meeting room, i saw the slight twinge of fear cross defiant’s face. he finally realised he had to deal with real users. after spending an inordinate amount of time attempting to connect a users phone without being able to touch it. i was getting particularly frustrated. &gt;me: just, give it here. i’ll get it connected in one minute. &gt;frustrating: it’s a new phone, i really don’t want anyone else touching it. sorry. i started to daydream about snatching the phone, and throwing it against a wall. i realised i should kick frustrating out before he shortens his phones lifespan anymore. &gt;me: okay, unfortunately without being able to physically touch the device i cannot connect it to our network. &gt;frustrating: just give me the instructions. i sighed. we’d already had three attempts. is that not enough? &gt;me: okay first go to settings, no… not .... the one with wifi, the…. ugh just … **settings** i wasn’t being clear. i knew that. i couldn’t help it, my patience for frustrating had gone. i looked to my counterparts. nice was slowly setting up phones, defiant however looked like he was struggling. &gt;defiant: it seems your device doesn’t actually have wifi. this is *just* phone. it’s got a black and white screen, so it can’t do internet. &gt;no-en: yes. i want wifi. &gt;defiant: no… this phone, its to old for wifi. &gt;no-en: please yes. install the wifi. just as my mouth opened to intervene, frustrating had a breakthrough. i was forced to turn back to frustrating. &gt;frustrating: i made it! i’m at wifi settings. &gt;me: okay when it scans, can you see the company wifi network? &gt;frustrating: scans? &gt;me: turn the wifi on. then show me the screen. frustrating started mumbling about this process taking such a long time. &gt;frustrating: oh…no. i lost it. &gt;me: just show me the screen. frustrating eyed me up nervously. he still didn’t angle the screen towards me. &gt;frustrating: this **is** a new phone. top of the line, it sure cost me a pretty penny. i’m just not sure i’m ready to share that experience with…. well… phone-less mortals. yet. &gt;me: phone-less mortals… i was stunned. frustrating still refused to show me the screen. i decided to just tell him to leave. he refused. &gt;frustrating: i think you’re just not the right tech. i’ll try that one… frustrating pointed to defiant, who was slowly realising the reason he couldn’t get through to no-int was a language barrier. he tried speaking slowly and clearly. it didn’t help. never does. &gt;defiant: i - am - sorry. we - can - not - help - you. &gt;no-en: phone wi-fi? no-en was still attempting to hand the phone to defiant. defiant tried hand signals, he pointed at no-en phone and made a cross symbol with his hands. no-en just looked more and more confused. frustrating turned and spoke to no-en. &gt;frustrating: @##$ @&amp;# @#&amp; **non- wifi** @##$^ @^# @. &gt;no-en: non-wifi? no-en looked very sad. he started slowly walking away, almost mournfully. i stood shocked the frustrating had *helped* a situation! frustrating looked down at defiant gleefully. defiant sat, nervous about another non english speaker, after hearing him speak whichever language no-en spoke. &gt;frustrating: can you help me set up my wifi? realising frustrating spoke english defiant broke out a massive smile. defiant reached out to receive the phone from frustrating, almost gleeful at the opportunity to help. &gt;frustrating: yeah… i’d rather you didn’t. you know… touch it. as i beckoned to the next person in line to the desk, i heard a thud and turned to see defiant’s head had hit the desk. &gt;defiant: god help me. [next]([previous]( friday. my final day at the design company. i was going to miss this place. as i arrived i looked around for something to do. i realized i still hadn't re-imaged the harddrive of redcheer's pc yet. the red haired lady found me looking down at her computer. &gt;redcheer: time to get it up and running? &gt;me: that's the plan. want to help? redcheer smirked and held up another hard drive. she handed it off to me. i looked at the label. the size was much better. &gt;me: you know, i think i'll miss this place a little. &gt;redcheer: haha you're not out the door yet. its only the start of friday. as we slowly reimaged the machine i saw how much redcheer had learnt this week. she was basically doing the entire install herself. &gt;me: you've got a knack for this... &gt;redcheer: haha, ive done it before. she gave me a wink and settled into installing the programs. evenually we got around to the design tools. &gt;**authentication error - cd key invalid** &gt;redcheer: woah, what... this key worked yesterday. annoyance bubbled up inside. we'd forgot to deactivate the old keys. &gt;me: we, may need to put the old harddrive back in. &gt;redcheer: no, no... i like this new one. it's got space! &gt;me: haha, don't worry. it's going back afterwards. as i pulled apart the computer i wondered why the corporate key had run out of licenses... i explained to redcheer what had to happen to get the computer to work, we needed to deactivate the keys. then reactivate them on the new harddrive. after deactivating the licenses on the old harddrive, we moved to them over to the new harddirve and continued installing. &gt;**authentication error - cd key invalid** &gt;redcheer: whaaaa? &gt;me: might need some time to reset the key. &gt;redcheer: bleh, i give up. its not like i'll really need these tools anyway. i looked over at the authentication error. it was pretty annoying. i felt like giving up too. &gt;me: okay, we'll we have to wait till the authentication server is updated.... so... coffee? &gt;redcheer: yeah. after coffee we can install some tech stuff! &gt;me: sorry...? redcheer gave me a smile, it was almost patronizing. &gt;redcheer: so i can increase my skills in tech! &gt;me: what... programs? &gt;redcheer: all the tech ones! it was at that point that i realized as far as she'd come.... she wasn't quite it yet. [next](so. i get out of class today and pull out my phone and find i have 14 new messages from one of my neighbors. i listen to the voicemails (my phone is set to not allow more than 10 voicemails from a person due to size) and its one of my neighbors wanting tech support on his car. i'm good at the software side of computers, i'm okay at the hardware side, and i'm good at cars that aren't over complicated. (eg cars made before 2000.) i call him and we start talking. &gt; me: what's up? &gt; him: well, my car won't start and i was hoping you could look at the computer and see if it has any error codes you can read. now, cars use a not quite proprietary port that only cars use for getting into the car's computer, on top of that you often times need a book to find what the error codes mean. i used to have a cable but i lent it to one of my cousins about a month ago and haven't seen it since. (which is fine by me.) &gt; me: i can't do that. &gt; him: why not? you're good at computers, you're good at cars, why can't you fix the computer in my car? &gt; me: i don't have the cables to do that. &gt; him: oh come on, can't you just look at it? &gt; me: you're paying me for this either way. (normally, if i can't fix it or at least point them to someone who can, i won't accept money, food, yes, money, no.) &gt; him: okay. just get over here. so, i drive over and pull up to his garage and i see his early 2000s mustang (not sure of the exact year, but i can tell the era). he's under the hood looking at things. i walk up behind him. &gt; me: any luck? he whips up real fast and smack his head on the hood. he recoils in pain while i try to keep from laughing. &gt; him (rubbing his head): no. i think it may be something wrong in the programming. so, i go through my normal troubleshooting for cars. takes about 20 minutes. i then realize it's one of two things, one, the computer is dead, or, two, the wiring is cut somewhere. i tell him and he starts grumbling about the only mechanic he trusts retired. (in my area there's a guy who does mufflers, a guy who does bodywork and there were 4 guys who were full service. the first sucks at his job, the second just retired, the third doesn't take new customers right now, and the fourth has a 2 week wait list unless you want to pay obscene amounts of money.) &gt; me: okay, wait, what was he doing when it stopped being able to start? hindsight being 20/20 i should have asked him that to begin with. &gt; him: i was cleaning the engine compartment. &gt; me: you take anything apart? &gt; him: yeh, almost everything. i walk over, grab the manual, and open the fuse box. sure enough, the fuse that goes in there for handling starting the car was missing, i go over to my car, pull a spare fuse out of the glove box (my car blows fuses occasionally, often times leaving me without headlights) and grab one of the appropriate type. i plug it in and tell him to start it. it fires right up. he gives me a $20 and i tell him i'm just really glad it wasn't the computer. he agrees and we discuss the fact that though computers in cars are a thing, you have to have special equipment to do it. he said okay, and i left. tl;dr: always check the power supply.[*previous tales from dishonest used car dealership*](/user/36055512/submitted/) &gt;“you gonna be out at your girlfriend’s this weekend?” &gt;“yeah, we’re having a huge party. you should stop by, it’s going to be rad.” the raver and i were in the break room at dishonest used car dealership eating lunch one scorching hot friday. his girlfriend lived on an island west of the city, far enough from civilization that they regularly had parties enormous enough to be sort of “generally known” among the weird, misfit kids who hung out at the sketchy dive bars up on the hill with all the gay bars and strip clubs like i did. after a couple incidents with people being creepy at their events, including a young lady who pulled a knife and started waving it in peoples' faces, they had instituted a “friends and family” only policy to limit the number of randoms showing up. of course, this had managed only to increase the mystique of these giant events among the freaks in the city, and in all likelihood there were even more sketchy people than ever invading the island on these occasional friday nights in the summer. as for me, i’m pretty solidly an introvert - parties are not really my thing - but having made it out to one or two, i did have to admit they knew how to have a good time. &gt;tr: “how about you, you seeing that photographer girl this weekend?” the photographer girl was a young lady i had gone on a couple dates with. as you might guess from the name, she was a professional photographer, and quite a good one at that. better yet, she was a redhead who liked whiskey a bit too much and had a hot temper, which is a pretty killer combination. &gt;me: “yeah, i got conned into going with her, her friend, and her friend’s boyfriend to some movie tonight.” &gt;tr: “double dates. yuck. unless it’s going to turn into, like, something kinky, count me out.” the image of a sweaty, crystal-hanging-from-his-neck post-coital the raver in my head, i decided i wasn’t particularly hungry anymore and excused myself from the table. &gt;me: “well, i probably need to go back and clean up whatever horrible attempts at english colossal redneck has vomited onto today’s invoices.” &gt;tr: “let me know if you’re coming. last ferry is at midnight. just remember, this is a friends and family thing, you know?” &gt;me: “got it.” *** &gt;“uh, your temperature gauge.” &gt;“yeah, it does that.” i was sitting in the back seat of an old forest green grand cherokee, eyeing the gauge cluster nervously. as we drove across the bridge from my weird neighborhood on east side of the lake to the core of the city where our evening’s movie was playing, the gradually-climbing temperature gauge on the jeep kept catching my eye. &gt;me: “that’s not normal. you might keep an eye on that; these four-liters don’t like to be overheated. i tell you what, if you like i can have one of my techs look at it and i’ll throw you the friends and family discount.” this was surely going to win some bonus points with my date, offering a discount to her friend’s boyfriend. &gt;the boyfriend: “yeah, well, it’s fine. it’s just ‘cause it’s hot outside. i’ll just add some water if i have to.” &gt;me: “yeah, but even with it 100º out, it shouldn’t be getting that warm. i’ll bet you have a coolant leak somewhere. it’s probably an easy fix - there’s a valve for the heater that cracks on these that will slowly leak coolant, and it’s an easy job. i had to do it on my own cherokee not that long ago.” &gt;the boyfriend: “i know cars. it’s fine.” &gt;me: “alright. not to belabor the point, but these four-liters like to blow head gaskets if they get too hot. i just don’t want to see an easy fix turn into a big repair, you know?” &gt;the boyfriend: “i’ve dealt with mechanics before. all you’re going to do is charge me to fix a bunch of things that aren’t broken and rip me off.” okay then. my date gave me a look and rolled her eyes. she leaned over and whispered in my ear. &gt;photographer girl: “he’s a dipsh!t, just let it go.” i nodded. photographer girl had a theory that conversation between guys is less about exchanging information and more about establishing a domain of knowledge and skill where you can be the dominant party in the room. the older i’ve gotten, the more i think she might have been right. by the time we got to the movie theater on the other side of town, the temp gauge was pegged at the maximum of its travel. as i bailed out, the miserable stench of an overheated car wafted over my nose. it’s a combination of a greasy gross smell from all the hot oil and a sickeningly sweet pancake syrup smell from hot ethylene glycol. usually there’s some melted rubber smell in there too. it’s the smell of death. we watched the movie, and the movie was bad and i hate movie theaters and jesus christ popcorn is expensive, but it was two hours of not having to talk to mr. bad attitude, so maybe in the long run, it was worth it. afterwards, we all conspired and decided we wanted to spend the night out on the island at the raver’s party, so i got in touch with him to confirm our appearance. we drove toward the ferry terminal, but on the way, someone in a lexus was apparently too busy chatting on the phone and managed to tag a semi, bringing the whole freeway to a screeching halt. we sat in the jeep, air conditioning barely able to keep out the sweltering heat. by the time we got moving again, the temperature gauge was back at the top of its travel. we managed to screech onto the 10:00 ferry. the boyfriend pulled onto the boat and we piled out. by now the death stench was different - hot grease, but no sweet glycol smell. in all likelihood, the boyfriend had run his jeep completely out of coolant. i thought about saying something, but i suspected that my commentary would receive a similar response to earlier, so i kept my trap shut. 30 minutes later and the ferry pulled up to the dock on the other side of the water. the boyfriend put the key into the ignition of the jeep, turned it, and the poor jeep hesitantly started up. it was making a *sad* noise. to my highly-calibrated ear, it was clearly running on five cylinders, and the new vibrations coursing through the vehicle suggested the same. this was an unhappy engine. the only solace was that i was sure soon its suffering would be over. we lurched off the ferry, making it about five miles outside of town on some long-forgotten side road before we encountered a steep hill and the poor old 4-liter decided it just had had enough. it conked out and we stalled and rolled back down to the bottom. the boyfriend tried repeatedly to get the engine to start again, but to no avail. i went around to the front of the jeep and he popped the hood. i was immediately struck with a wave of heat rolling out of the engine bay. at the back of the engine bay i spied a small black valve with a conspicuous crack seeping green fluid. as i suspected, the heater control valve had indeed cracked, slowly vacating all the engine’s coolant onto the ground. i grabbed a rag and popped open the radiator cap to be greeted by only smoke and steam (note, don’t do this unless you’re one million percent sure there’s no coolant or water in there. you will burn yourself and die). this engine was, in the words of my colleague colossal redneck, “f*ckin’ dead.” the boyfriend tried filling the radiator from a gallon jug he had in the back, but the sad old 4-liter was having none of it. i contemplated making the hike all the way back to the ferry terminal, but it was already 10:45. the last ship of the night back to the mainland left port at 11:30, and there was no way we were going to cover five miles of hilly territory with two ladies in heels in 45 minutes. it looked like we were stranded until morning. immediately the histrionics started. &gt;the boyfriend: “i thought you were some kind of ‘car guy!’ how come all of the sudden you can’t get a f*cking car running?” before i had a chance to interject, photographer girl jumped to my defense. &gt;pg: “look, dipsh!t, he told you this was going to be a problem four hours ago, and lo and behold, the heater thing has failed, just like he said it would. and when he spoke up about your sh!t-ass car overheating, you opened your dumbf#ck mouth and told him to shut up. so *you* killed your car, you idiot child, and now we’re stuck out in the middle of f#cking nowhere on some sh!tty island! good work, einstein!” i made a mental note not to ever try and argue with photographer girl, because it was clear she would demolish me. while the three of my companions were arguing, i ducked to the side, pulled out my giant old brick of a smartphone and surreptitiously sent a text. &gt;me: “hey, dude. you know that big-ass hill about five miles out of town on the way to your girl’s place? we’re broken down at the bottom of it. can you come rescue us?” &gt;the raver: “yeah, man, i know right where that’s at. let me get things square here and i’ll be on my way. i’ll text when i’m close.” it was now time to do the *star trek ii* thing: sitting on my ass trying not to grin while everyone else stuck on the side of the road bitched at each other. maybe some attractive lieutenant would ask me how i beat the kobayashi maru test, a.k.a. how in the hell did i ever manage in one sitting to eat two entire plates of the colossal nachos at the korean karaoke bar behind the ford dealership. “i changed the conditions of the test,” i’d say. “i ate one plate, and when no one was looking, i got so blasted drunk that i threw up in the bushes outside, and then i ate another one.” captain material, right here. the following half hour can best be described as a crescendo of anger and shouting as my three compatriots tried to yell themselves into some kind of solution to our situation. photographer girl suggested we call a tow truck, but the boyfriend didn’t want to pay the many hundreds of dollars it would cost to bring his dead jeep back to the city. my date’s friend wanted to call a taxi, of which there were precisely zero on the island. the boyfriend waffled between making everyone walk back to town without him to summon help and just making camp for the night on the side of the road. in either case, he categorically refused to depart from his jeep. after a few rounds of heated debate, the three realized that i hadn’t said much and that i was just leaning against the dead jeep, playing with my phone. the boyfriend sauntered over and got in my face. &gt;the boyfriend: “what the f*ck are you grinning at, asshole?” &gt;photographer girl: “maybe he’s looking at your stupid f*cking face.” &gt;me: “it is pretty f*cking stupid.” i couldn’t resist. but, before i had a chance to let everyone in on the plot and spoil the surprise, my phone lit up with a text. the raver was just around the corner. &gt;the boyfriend: “what the f*ck? is this asshole for real? you’re just sitting here texting while we’re all trying to figure out what to do?” &gt;me: “yeah, pretty much.” what else was i going to say? rage lit in the boyfriend’s eyes and he pulled a fist back, but before his badly-telegraphed assault could completely miss, his girlfriend grabbed his arm and restrained him. in a split second, he shook her off and wound up another punch, but this time he was distracted by the clatter of an ancient diesel volkswagen coming up from behind. it was the raver. i walked over to the approaching car. &gt;the raver: “‘sup, f*ckwad.” &gt;me: “hey, sh!thead. thanks again, man, i owe you big time.” the boyfriend’s face was incredulous and he gestured toward the raver as his voice raised to an entirely new octave. &gt;the boyfriend: “now who the f*ck is this f@ggot?” at this point, the boyfriend had burnt every last bit of sympathy from any of us. even his own girlfriend was shaking her head at him. the raver hollered over his direction. &gt;tr: “c’mon now, man, you need to, like, chill.” &gt;the boyfriend: “f*ck. you.” the raver turned back to me and gave me a look. &gt;me: “yeah. we’ve been listening to this sh!t all night. i’m gettin’ real f*cking sick of it.” i hopped in the back seat and hollered over to my companions. &gt;me: “this is our ride, folks. get in or be donner party 2.0.” the ladies hopped over to the decrepit jetta, and after a moment of consideration, the boyfriend shuffled over behind them. the raver strolled around to the passenger side of his car and opened the doors for the ladies, but before the boyfriend could pile in as well, the raver held up his hand to stop him. he looked over at me for confirmation. all i could do was shake my head. the raver turned back to the boyfriend. &gt;tr: “naw, man. this thing is, like, a friends and family deal.” and just like that, the raver slammed the doors shut, hopped into the driver’s seat, and we took off. the last i saw of the boyfriend was him standing in the middle of the road, arms raised to heaven, shouting “what the f*ck” over and over. *** three hours and an unbelievable amount of whiskey later, photographer girl’s friend got a text that the boyfriend had been rescued by a county sheriff and was on his way back to civilization. he was furious with her that she had abandoned him on the side of the road and left a many-texts-long tirade exactly to that effect. the words were hideous, accusatory, monstrous, hateful. the friend was obviously distraught and went and showed photographer girl and me the spew of vitriol that was flooding her cell phone’s screen. she asked what she should say in response. photographer girl put her hand on her friend’s shoulder. &gt;pg: “text him back whatever you think he deserves.” the friend nodded and smiled and sent him back but a single letter: &gt;”k.” she turned off her phone and together we all laughed and drank cheap whiskey and listened to loud music until the moon itself was tired and slipped down to bed below the sea.hi tfts, first time i felt i had something relevant to post: the ups at a remote office failed its self test and reported a bad battery. since the office is in another country, we ordered a replacement from our usual retailer, but had them deliver it directly to the location. installation was to be handled by a contractor who works for the whole building, not just our office. so he offered to come in saturday morning to exchange the battery, and we would shut down the server before, just for safety. we were told that the battery had arrived earlier this week, so i confirmed to the contractor that i would shut down the server and he could replace the battery saturday morning. cue phone call from the remote office this morning: &gt; **office**: hi, you know that battery thing that got delivered this week? how expensive was that? can you order another one? &gt; **it**: why, what happened? &gt; **office**: we had ordered some stuff from [electronics retailer] for a test weighing *(remote office does recycling-related things, so sometimes they weigh packages for customers like [electronics retailer] just to be sure that they are invoiced for the correct amount of packaging to be recycled)* and those arrived the same day as the battery. &gt; so someone took all those packages to our "weighing lab" since they were all electronics stuff, and after weighing we sent the packages back to the retailer. &gt; **it**: so the battery... &gt; **office**: ..went back to the retailer along with the other items. and apparently they had already arrived back at the retailer *(in remote office's country)*, who didn't know what to do with the battery and sent the package on to their head office *(in our country)*. &gt; **it**: *(laughs)* ok, so `maybe` we will get it back from them, but in the meantime we'll order a new one for you. i guess i'll also tell the contractor he won't be needed this saturday after all. don't worry, we have another ups here that needs a fresh battery soon, so if we get it back we'll use it for that one. **tl;dr** hi, that ups you ups'ed us? can you ups us another one because we ups'ed it away!i came across another thread that reminded me of this quick story that i will share with you. background info; i am a network admin for a k-12 school district with roots in helpdesk and regular break fix. a while back a teacher came to me with her chromebook so i could show her how to perform some task she was having trouble with. i happened to be working on my chromebook at the time, so i closed mine, grabbed hers and opened hers up... nothing. "that's odd," i say, pressing the power button. "that should have woken up by itself." still nothing. assuming the battery is dead, i unplug the charger from my chromebook and plug into hers. the charging light quickly turns from off, to amber, to green. indicating that the battery is fully charged. the next few minutes i spend doing things like repeatedly opening and closing the lid, pressing and holding the power button, as well as any other button i can find, shaking it, flipping it over, all to no avail. the teacher had to get back to class, so i asked if i could hold onto it and see what was happening; she had assured me that she was just using it with no issues. i decide to crack it open since i had done just about everything i could from the outside, and the battery was internal. i open the bottom cover, ensure everything visible and accessible is secure. then leaving the chromebook standing on its side because the bottom was open, i hit the power button. it works! well, i'm not sure what happened there, but it seems to be working now. so i close up the bottom panel, put everything back to normal, open the lid and...... nothing. "what the hell?" with the lid of the chromebook open, i lift it up, and shake it, thinking something is loose or moving around in there. suddenly it turns on, all by itself. "oh boy," i think to myself "this can't be good." thinking there is something metallic or otherwise conductive inside the chromebook bouncing around, i proceed to once again take it apart. this time i go further, removing components completely from the machine. over the course of the next hour, i learn more about the internals of this particular model chromebook than i ever cared to know. not finding anything obvious, i decide i should try powering it on again, so i put back only what is necessary to start it up. once again, on it's side, i press the power button, and once again it comes to life. "alright, great!" i say. i carefully lift it and tilt it back to it's normal orientation, and as soon as i set it down, the screen goes blank, it's off again. no response to power button, nothing. leaving the lid open, i proceed to pick it back up to turn it over, and the screen comes to life. "ok..." i say nervously. i place it back down. dead. at this time, i'm thinking that when the laptop is twisted or strained in a certain way, its causing something to break or lose connection, so while i hold it in the air, the laptop once again powered on and responsive, i start twisting it and putting pressure on the base in different spots. it has no effect. the chromebook is still on and working perfectly. i place it back down and poof, it shuts off again. thinking the feet are the stress point, i start to lift it up slowly and when the pressure is relieved from the feet, the chromebook comes back to life. "what in the hall is going on here?!" but then i notice something i hadn't caught before. every time this chromebook comes back to life, it goes back to the screen it was on when it died. so it's acting like its going to sleep and waking up each time. then it hits me like a ton of bricks. these chromebooks use a proximity sensor like a magnet to detect when the lid is closed or not, vs a button or switch. when i closed my chromebook, i set the teacher's chromebook on top of mine. her chromebook was detecting my chromebooks lid, therefore making it think the lid was closed, to it went to sleep. two hours wasted, but it's a lesson i won't ever forget. i hope you enjoyed my story as much as i enjoyed telling it.[previous]( defiant sat on the other side of my desk. i stared at the computer, waiting for something interesting. ticket queue - empty. &gt;defiant: ugh. i’m so bored… how do you stay sane? &gt;me: don’t worry. something will come up… at that moment the ticket queue shuffled another ticket into existence. my hand moved to click it… &gt;defiant: w… w… w… wait! lets make this ticket more interesting, okay? &gt;me: ?! &gt;defiant: if i can complete the ticket, without help from you… you have to buy me lunch. i smiled, and considered. defiant a spark of genuine interest, almost worth the price of lunch. &gt;me: what happens should you lose? &gt;defiant: me… lose? defiant scoffed, and jumped up from his chair to look at the ticket. **urgent** ticket - i need to get my files off my laptop and onto a usb key for a flight this afternoon, but i’ve no usb ports. -sassy defiant started chuckling to himself. ***** walking up to sassy’s desk, defiant was in a much better mood. &gt;defiant: so should we get lobster or caviar for lunch? &gt;me: ... &gt;defiant: why not both, right? i’ve never had either, but i hear they’re nice. defiant and i arrived at sassy’s desk, she was looking frantic. a laptop sat in front of her, her new desktop pushed to the side. &gt;sassy: ahhh, i need these work files, before i leave… but nothing’s working &gt;defiant: you just plug in the usb drive, into the slot… and copy over the files. sassy clicked on the folder, and the computer slowly show its contents. very slowly. defiant grabbed the usb key off the table, and attempted to drag and drop the files, however the usb didn’t show up. &gt;defiant: huh? &gt;sassy: the usb ports on that side don’t work! only the usb on the back does! defiant went to plug in the usb key in the back. however that port was already taken up by another usb drive. defiant went to unmount it… &gt;sassy: no! dont! that’s my ready boost! if you unplug it the computer will be *super* slow. &gt;defiant: we need the port though… sassy crossed her arms and shook her head. &gt;sassy: you can’t have it. i’m video encoding. if you unplug it, my movies won’t be ready for my flight. sassy pulled out a new ipod. she smiled down fondly at its white scroll wheel. &gt;defiant: okay… then… we’ll transfer all the data through the network to another computer. then copy it. &gt;sassy: mmm okay. defiant smiled victoriously. however one ethernet cord later... &gt;defiant: why doesn’t the ethernet port work? &gt;sassy: oh yeah… that died when the usb did. i think. i wanted to ask what event precipitated the usb’s and ethernet dying, but i settled for watching defiant’s increasingly worried face. &gt;defiant: okay. sassy. what **does* work on your….. *computer* &gt;sassy: mmm actually only the back usb port… i think… defiant thought for a second. his eyes started to glaze. &gt;defiant: nope. i’m sorry. i can’t get your files onto the usb drive. &gt;sassy: but i need those files for work! i can’t believe this, i have to leave for my flight soon, you can’t even get my…. defiant had stood up off the chair. i quickly took his place. the mouse hovered over the unmount readyboost button. &gt;me: you need these files for work? &gt;sassy: yes, but you can’t stop readyboost or the movies won’t encode in time….. unmounted readyboost. &gt;me: stop being silly sassy. you **need** these files. sassy was in shock. as i copied her files over to her usb. i clicked on her video encoding, the complete time had doubled. &gt;sassy: bu… wha… &gt;me: okay, copy complete. i was smiling as defiant and i walked back to it. defiant looked gloomy again. &gt;defiant: that was hardly fair… i didn’t know you could *just* tell users to stop being silly. &gt;me: you’ve still a lot to learn… so. what are you buying *us* for lunch? did we decide on lobster or caviar? [next]([previous]( i went searching for redcheer, i was too annoyed to do any actual work. i just started opening every door. i found a bunch of rooms i didn’t know existed. i found a storeroom which had an entire case of coffee. i considered it my heaven till i realised it was all instant. eventually i opened the door to a room i thought was a broom closet. redcheer sat inside. it was a broom closet. &gt;me: what… are you.. doing in here? the red haired lady sat with a two computer tower setup inside, surrounded by brooms and other cleaning equipment. &gt;redcheer: oh airz!! finally. i was looking for you, didn’t anyone tell you? &gt;me: they told me you were looking for me, but why are you in a broom closet? &gt;redcheer: oh.. i was working on getting my computer back up and running. i looked at the scene before me. two computers had been setup side by side in a tiny space… &gt;me: why, again did you choose a broom closet to setup in? &gt;redcheer: i think a design meeting is on today. i didn’t want to be distracted. anyway take a look at what i’ve done. i knelt down and looked at the two screens in the small space. &gt;me: haha, i was forced to go to that meeting for you. &gt;redcheer: was it fun? i opened up the start bar on one of the computers, many design programs had been installed. &gt;me: not too bad. apart from the annoying dread and scarfy. &gt;redcheer: oh, what’d they do? this was probably the already working computer, i moved my attention to the other screen. i opened the start bar. &gt;me: just complaining about my fixes. &gt;redcheer: they did what?! i looked up at redcheer’s face, she seemed oddly incensed. the start bar of the second computer on the other hand, did not incense anyone…. it was perfect. &gt;me: which, pc…. is your one? redcheer smiled at me. she seemed happy i couldn’t tell which one she’d imaged. &gt;redcheer: that one is. it’s good huh? after you didn’t show up, i called our usual tech and he talked me through the basics. pointed me to some good websites and stuff. &gt;me: haha i didn’t show up, because i didn’t expect you to be hiding in here. &gt;redcheer: well telling people to tell you i’m in the broom closet kinda defeats the purpose of hiding in the broom closet. i couldn’t really argue that point. i was happy i’d found redcheer, work’s less boring when there’s someone to talk to. &gt;me: your pc… it’s perfect. you even transferred the license keys over, this must have taken you all morning. an small error popped up in the corner of the screen. &gt;**low disk space** &gt;you are running out of disk space on system (c:)… uh huh. &gt;redcheer: yeah that keeps happening. &gt;me: not great. i opened up the properties of the hard disk. it was full. completely full. i remembered back to when the original hard disk was broke. i never looked at the capacity of the disk redcheer had put in to replace it. the replacement disc, wasn’t big… &gt;redcheer: can you fix it? &gt;me: don’t worry. i've got this. i started mentally planning pulling this disc out, replacing it with a new larger one and reimaging the entire thing. &gt;redcheer: what did dread and scarfy complain about at the meeting anyway? &gt;me: oh nothing much, they just want no plastic bags on the internet line… i thought about asking redcheer to do the imaging, after all she’d done a good job with this one. i decided against it, it was my job after all. &gt;redcheer: oh, yeah dread has a thing about that. don’t worry. i've got this. she gave me a massive smile, and dragged me out of the broom closet. as i walked away from the closet, i saw the low disk space error pop up in the start bar again. poor computer. [next]([previous]( i look down at the tea placed in my hand. &gt;me: tea? another heads of department meeting was starting around me. &gt;vp: tea? i looked down at the liquid in my cup. i took a sip. &gt;me: yep. tea. &gt;vp: nice you see you’re being so considerate of the new security manager. &gt;me: i didn’t ask for…. the words stopped coming out of my mouth as i looked over at the vp's secretary. she was mouthing **just go with it** at me, from behind the vp’s shoulder. &gt;me: ahem, i didn’t ask for such a delightful tea, i sure am glad i asked for it. the vp’s secretary smiled gave me a thumbs up and left the room. the vp looked at me oddly. almost calculatingly. &gt;vp: mmm, seems you are becoming a real team player airz. lets hear what our new business consultant thinks of it. &gt;con: yes, well after implementing the new review system we’ve had some good results. i took another sip of my drink. the word good didn’t cover it. glowing perhaps. &gt;vp: so what’s next? &gt;con: i think people are a little afraid of speaking out against it. so we’re opening an anonymous review system. anyone can post inside with ideas, complains, suggestions. i looked down at my drink. this wasn’t coffee, i wouldn’t stand for it. &gt;me: a complaints box? really? &gt;con: no darling, no. an ideas box. &gt;me: okay firstly, darling. complaints shouldn’t be anonymous, how can we fix a problem if we don’t know where its happening? &gt;con: just try it. for me. &gt;me: for what?! &gt;vp: i thought you where turning the corner with a team focus airz. &gt;me: i… i looked over at the vp's secretary, outside the glass window. she mouthed **go with it**. as i stared down at my tea and realized none of the meeting rooms were soundproof i decided to go all in. &gt;me: i can’t wait to see how this goes. i gave the best smile i could muster with tea in my hands. &gt;vp: oh, and we’ll get those it keys off you to cut for security. i looked to the tea for strength. my smile wouldn’t falter. even as i burnt to the ground, i’d smile. [next](hi all, so brief overview i work at my universities computer store/ repair desk; and ect. let the tale commence! so i'm at the counter when a middle aged woman comes in and states &gt; lady: "i got a computer here and you need to help me install office" &gt;me: "sure thing did you order it through us?" &gt;lady: "yes, shouldn't you know that?" do you think i can memorize every order that comes in? but regardless i go out back and get her computer, on the receipt i see a ticket showing her computer had also been prepped, so a random password was set to the system. and recorded on the ticket for a first login. &gt;me: "here you are ma'am if you'd like help installing office i can assist, but you're going to need to change your password upon logging in. so i'm going to do [task] while you do that" &gt;lady: upon being handed her receipt with her ticket/password "what's this my receipt" doesn't look at it and begins crumpling it up "and where am i going to install office; here? you want me to stand?" &gt;me: "don't crumple that it's not just your receipt, it's also your password. and yes installing office takes about 15 minutes." &gt;lady: "how was i supposed to know this had my password on it?" anyways she gets logged in and changes the default password. but then i took over to help connect her to the school's wifi. &gt;lady: upon my opening network connections "what are you doing there? how was i supposed to know how to do all this by myself, all the it help in my department is busy" &gt;me: "i'm just connecting you to the internet. you'll need to login with your school credentials." &gt;lady: as she's logging in "what's that, the mouse just moved, my last computer had this problem. that's why i got this one" &gt;me: "you're letting your wrists hit the trackpad while typing. it's not the computer." &gt;lady: "oh no, so am i going to always remember to keep my wrists from touching it?" &gt;me: "yes, or maybe you could get an external keyboard from your department" &gt;lady: "ok i work in it, so i should be able to get one." it took a minute for what she said to sink in, but then i thought. wait she works in it and has no idea how to install a simple piece of software? and she claims no one else in it can help her either? but aside from the obvious questions going through my mind the rest of the install went the same way. i click something and she questions how in the world she was supposed to know how to [accept terms and agreement] or other equivalent task. after she left i looked her up in the system, and she's gotten a new computer every year from the department on the claims that her previous one was "broken". at that point i let my head hit the counter with enough force to measure on the richter scale. tl;dr how am i supposed to know how to post this? it's the post button you say, well how was i expected to know that?i am a semi retired, semi burnt out old tech working through my declining years in a small rural town. in a small town you take on just about anything and i was called to one of the local pubs to work on a video game. it was a cabinet that used s dell pc with a custom program. i was called in because there was a connectivity problem, the game needed to connect to a server to update the games performance. i replaced the faulty wi-fi card. it was a simple repair and i would not normally mention it on this forum, but i had to re-enter the wi-fi settings. this pc had no keyboard or mouse, so you used one of the "shotguns" to shoot at the screen to select the keys on the on screen keyboard. did i mention it was a hunting game? so with a huge grin i quickly shot in the settings and the job was done. tldr; a dream come true, i got to program a pc with a "shotgun"!i work in a school. i love my job. the staff and i get along great. i require that if they need assistance that they email me at helpdesk@organization.org. yesterday was april fools and here are some of the tickets i received. * the tab button is not working. i wanted a bottle of soda so i hit the tab button to start a tab but nothing happened. how do i fix this? * could you help adjust my abacus???? - math teacher * i can't figure out where to plug my wireless printer into my laptop. can you help? also, i can't find the button that says "click" or the one that says "select". * i only have five bars for a wifi connection. can i get more? * my computer says only "administrator can unlock it" where is the key and which hole do i stick it in? * do we have insurance on computer crashes? what is the deductible? need to file a claim. * how can i get the justice system to prosecute the internet for killling grammar? it is a capital crime. -english teacher * i didn't save my document and i turned off the computer, can you retrieve it? * what is the plural of "mouse"? are they mice or mouses? or should i use meece -english teacher * do you know an exterminator for the mouse? it seems to be eating my words and leaving droppings. -english teacher [previous]( roll out the line of managers stretched to eternity. each eagerly awaiting a pda to be handed out to them. i sighed louder each time a device left the room. &gt;acchead: oh, yes! i’ve been waiting for this… the accounting head gingerly scooped the device from my hard. he lovingly stared down upon its glowing screen. &gt;me: any questions about your new pda? &gt;acchead: not really. does it have a name? i handed over the box that came with the device, the model proudly displayed in large writing across the front. &gt;acchead: no, not a model. i mean, like an individual name. &gt;me: its a pda. just call it, pda. acchead held the stylus deftly in head and gently poked and prodded at the various icons. &gt;acc: pda stands for assistant, yeah? &gt;me: sure. i sighed loudly, watching another manager leave swiftly with two boxes in hand. &gt;acc: assistants should have individual names. they’re like helpers. &gt;me: mmm, if you’ve got no questions…. i held my hand up to gesture the door, hoping the hint was obvious. the head of accounting slowly turned and headed towards the door. he looked fondly down at the pda in his hand. &gt;acc: sally. i think i’ll name you, sally. i sighed loudly as he exited. ***** a few hours later the eternal line of managers had turned into more of a drizzle. drips of people came to collect devices, it was much less stressful. i’d even managed to control my sighs as people left. &gt;acchead: help me! help. sally’s in trouble. the head of accounting rushed into it, he was holding his pda like a baby. redcheer rushed over to see the distress accountant as i emerged from my office. &gt;redcheer: what’s happened to sally? &gt;acchead: she’s cracked her face open! she fell down some stairs! the colour drained from the faces of the people listening in. redcheer looked on high alert, ready to pounce. &gt;redcheer: oh god! where is she??! &gt;me: give it here… i held out my hand and took the head accountants pda from him. the whole of it looked confused. &gt;redcheer: what are you doing?! &gt;me: this is sally. he named his pda. i held the pda in the air for everyone to see. its screen smashed completely. oddly the office went from alert and alarmed to calm and non caring in an instant. even redcheer swiftly sat down, looking bored. &gt;acchead: i don’t know how it happened. one minute it was in my hands, then … it was at the bottom of the stairs. &gt;me: you dropped it. &gt;acchead: drop sally?! i would never. i stared incredulously down at the head accountant, who meekly mumbled. &gt;acchead: any chance of getting it fixed? &gt;me: we’ve spares, luckily. however you’re gonna have to fill out a few forms. ***** as i handed the head accountant his second pda of the day he looked down at it with fond adoration. &gt;acchead: i think i’ll name this one sally 2. &gt;me: … &gt;acchead: no you’re right. that’s weird. this one will be sarah. as the head of accounting made his way to the it door, i picked up his old and broken pda. i flipped the device over to pull out the battery. on the back cover scrawled all that way across the device in large letters. **sally** &gt;me: headacc! what the hell is this?! he was gone. i let out an involuntary sigh. [next](so my coworker, who was also a tech support, recently quit his job at our company, so we had a new job posting up on our company website for a new it support person. on the posting there is a apply now link that is actually an email link (the "mailto:xxxxx@somecompany.com" format) that the applicants use to send their resumes straight to my manager's mailbox. because we got some applicants in the past complain the link didn't work because they didn't know it was an email hyperlink, we added some instructions underneath the apply now link on every posting in big red, bold text that basically says that if you don't use a desktop email client like outlook, then copy and paste the link (right click the link and copy shortcut (in ie) or copy email address (in chrome)) on to your gmail, hotmail, whatever other email service you use. most people understand that and send in their resumes just fine. but one day, this guy with a really thick accent (can't tell from where, but it's really thick and i can barely understand him) called the reception and complained that he cannot apply for the it support position and that the link is broken. the receptionist that answered the call forwarded the call to me (because everything it related goes to me for some reason), and i answered the call (note that i work at an internal helpdesk, so i don't get any external clients calling unless it's our vendors or something). so the conversation goes something like this: &gt;$guy: hi, i try to apply for the it network technical support position on your website but it is not working. &gt;$me: did you click the apply now link on the posting? &gt;$guy: yes, but it doesn't work. &gt;$me: can you tell me how the apply now link doesn't work? &gt;$guy: i click the link, and error appears. &gt;$me: and what does the error say? &gt;$guy: something about the "default mail client is not properly installed" &gt;$me: *95% sure his email client isn't set up* then what email service do you use? gmail? &gt;$guy: yes, gmail. *sigh* &gt;$me: the apply now link is actually an email address. if you use gmail, read the instructions under the apply now link on how to copy the email and paste it in gmail. $guy doesn't understand and repeats the same thing about how the link doesn't work and something about sending it to another email address in our company. i repeat the same thing and tell him to follow the instructions and send it again. he gives up and says he'll try again and hangs up. i thought to myself: if you can't even solve your own it problems, how are you going to solve the it problems for our staff? a few days later, i asked my manager and he said he didn't get any email from $guy. guess he still didn't figure it out.a while back, my company sent me to our uk office, just outside of london. i was to be there for a month, do some training, see how things were run, and help with one of our call centres. one of the consumer support guys was on the blower with a guy on the east coast, and was reading out a registration key to him. three, one, five, niner, lima, yankee, and so on. he says yankee and the guy frigging lost it, and started going on about independence, parties that involve tea, the queen and so on. we're all having a good chortle over this, and the rep transfers that call to me. 'hello, this is whiskey06, how can i help you?' 'one of your guys called me a yankee' 'i see. sir, do you have internet access?' 'yes, of course!' 'please open up a browser, and go to the googles' 'ok' 'now google the nato phonetic alphabet, please.' 'ok i have it, what am i looking for?' 'read me the phonetic pronunciations for the letters f, q, i, and y' 'foxtrot, quebec, india, and... (sigh) yankee.' 'anything else, sir?' 'no, thank you, but it's always nice to speak to another american, you never know who you're going to get these days' 'sorry sir, i'm canadian.' transferred him back, and the support rep got him sorted.i work as one-man it for a small company. a coworker walks over to my cubicle and drops a laptop on my desk. "hey, hutacars, this is my personal laptop and it doesn't work. i spoke with [your non-it boss] and he said i could give it to you to fix since i do company work on it." "well generally i don't support non-company hardware, unless it's something work-related that's not working, like your vpn. what's wrong with it?" "i dunno, it crashed." "so it just doesn't turn on at all?" *thinks hard* "no, it just comes up black." "so it's the computer itself that isn't working, not something related to work?" "yeah." "okay... since it's not a company machine, i unfortunately can't fix it." "but i use it for work!" sigh.i work in several small offices with a consulting firm. there are no shortages of stories, but here's a quick one that happened recently. following a recent sale, mr. sales sent an e-mail to a couple customers with some remaining stock. attached is a .zip file said to contain photos from the items that must be sold. our short story starts, already in progress: &gt;sales: are you in the office today? &gt;it: yes (i'm two doors down from him) &gt;sales: could you come over here for a minute? &gt;it: sure... i walk over... &gt;sales: hr says i just sent the network drive to the buyers from the sale! &gt;it: let's take a look... &gt;sales: maybe i'll just forward it to you instead... i go back to my desk and wait. as a small business, hr is included in the customer service e-mail address, along with accounting, marketing, and a couple dedicated customer service people. eventually, as he comes and goes a couple of times, the e-mail comes in. it's a normal .zip file with several photos. we walk downstairs to try to see what hr was concerned about. &gt;hr: see? the entire network drive can be accessed straight from this e-mail! she had the .zip file open and was clicking on the network drive directly from the explorer sidebar. we've been on windows 7 for three years now! almost gave sales a heart attack, but at least we got a mildly interesting story out of it!one of the many stories from my time as a level 1 and 2 tech support for the education department. here is one with me and a female primary school teacher **teacher**: [*almost in tears, hyperventilating*] help me please! **me**: what can i do for you? **teacher**: well one of my kids was being naughty so i threatened to put him in the naughty corner. he then threatened that he would hack my computer, and he bloody has! **me**: what do you mean by hacking? **teacher**: he's broken the computer and given it all viruses! he's refusing to tell me what he did. [after managing to get a word in, i remoted into the computer, turns out the kid had inverted the colours and changed the language] ...smart kid. i work part time in a call center where we do both client-care and technical support for our client, a mobile carrier in north america. on the weekend i'm one of the few supervisor in charge for the care/loyalty department in our relatively small center, on week-ends we don't usually treat second level escalation because we're not enough on the floor but in this case i decided to take care of it because it seem so far fetched and also because the complaint was against one of our agent, and we don't like these escalations untreated and prefer to take care of them ourselves. so, yesterday i get a call from one of the live supervisor on the floor who's speaking with $luckycustomer who's claiming that we have provide him with $1000 as he was promised by a technical support agent the evening before. the customer is not clear with the details to the supervisor and request that we listen to the call. usually we can't, being a contractor only our own internal calls are available. lucky for him, the tech support agent is one of ours so the call is already available for listening. i ask the 1st level supervisor to put the customer on hold while i investigate the call. (this is what i can recall from the 30+ minutes call) &gt; **$luckycustomer** : i'm tired that your application always shows big data discrepancies, my phone shows me that i'm at 7.97gb while your app only shows 7.44gb. i never get the automated warning in time. &gt; **$generousagent** : well it's not a very big discrepancy, it's only 50mb. &gt; **$luckycustomer** : hum, no, it's half a gig. &gt; **$generousagent** : *laughing* not at all, after the decimal it's megabytes, in this case only 53mb to be exact. &gt; **$luckycustomer** : i don't think so, no. i'm no idiot, i work it and my brother is an engineer, we both can confirm to you that it's 500mb, you're mistaken. &gt; **$generousagent** :let me speak to your brother, i will explain it to him, actually go on google and if you can prove me that 7.44 and 7.97 is close to half a gb we will give you $1000, the call is recorded. &gt; **$luckycustomer**: what did you just say? $1000? &gt; **$generousagent** : yes, if you can prove that, we will credit your account for $1000 dollar, you just need to prove it which is impossible. &gt; **$luckycustomer** : alright, just let me get something *customer puts the agent on spearker phone and comes back with something to record him*, say that again? &gt; **$generousagent** : if you can prove us that 7.44 and 7.97 is close to half a gb we will give you a credit of $1000. &gt; **$luckycustomer** : alright, like you said, the call is recorded, i also recorded that part. i'll be calling later to claim this amount to client care. &gt; **$generousagent** : like, i said, it's impossible. but if you do prove it, send us the proof and we'll apply the credit. &gt; **$luckycustomer** : ok, thank you and have a good day. &gt; **$generousagent** : have a good day. i'm sitting there, listening to the call and having to find a way to tell the customer that there's no way we can apply that sort of credit from a promise from an overzealous agent who doesn't understand decimals very well... i took the call and basically told the customer while he was right the agent had no authorization to offer this type of credit... in the end i had to set up an escalation from our highest level available in the center. i guess **$luckycustomer** will probably get his credit and i'm not sure how long **$generousagent** will keep his job. the vp’s voice rung in my ear as i turned up to an unfamiliar workplace for the first time. i’d been told to look for ways of intergrating two it departments, whilst simultaneously getting to know the new staff we’d just acquired. i put on a large smile on my face as i entered the it department. it actually looked quite tidy and orderly, two it staff looked up at me from there desks as i entered. &gt;greyit: you must be the new hire. &gt;me: new hire? no, i’m the it manager from the company you’ve just merged with…. &gt;youngit: merged, ha…. i looked around and spotted an empty desk, so i walked over to put down all my stuff. the two men in the room seemed to watch cautiously. &gt;me: so …. mentally i screamed at the vp, who’d taken the manager from this office and placed him in charge of my own for a few months. this place felt completely foreign. &gt;greyit: so newbie, today i think we’ll start you with cleaning out the storage closet. &gt;me: ahem sorry, you must be confused, i’ll introduce myself. i’m airz, i come from the company you’ve just merged with. i’ve come to manage this office for a while and work out how to better integrate this team as we move you over to our buildings. youngit looked startled at the announcement that they’d be moving, greyit however was steely eyed. &gt;greyit: okay newbie, introductions first then cleaning. i’m greyit and this is youngit. the closet is over that way, anything you want to throw out just run it past me. okay? it was as if he was trying some mind trick. i looked at him blankly, wondering if he was just perhaps just thick. &gt;greyit: hello? … newbie the closet is that way. he waved at me like i was the thick one. i decided it had to stop. &gt;me: okay, stop calling me newbie. i’m currently the manager of this office, now unless you want to be assigned the cleaning duties i’d lay off. youngit smirked at greyit, who looked taken aback that someone was standing up to him. &gt;greyit: you’re the newest member of this office. it’s tradition to call the newest “newbie”. &gt;me: unfortunately that tradition stops when that person is your senior. &gt;greyit: senior!? i’m older then you. i sighed, and decided not to rub the fact i meant in position in his face. he clearly wanted to be a boss, or at least boss someone around. &gt;me: okay, where’s the ticketing software? &gt;greyit: youngit, you show him the ropes. i aint got time to show round a newbie. he shook his head and got back to whatever he was doing on his computer. i decided to just let him go. youngit smiled at me as he walked over. &gt;youngit: okay, so this is your email, and this is the knowledge base where you look up any problems, and now we just wait for a call or someone to walk in the door. &gt;me: which program runs your tickets? &gt;youngit: tickets? what are tickets? greyit finally decided to spin round on his chair. he looked at me angrily. &gt;greyit: we don’t do tickets here. people come to us with problems, newbie. &gt;me: stop calling me newbie. &gt;greyit: well when you learn how an it department runs you wouldn’t be such a newbie. i refrained from reprimanding greyit on calling me a newbie, making a huge fuss over something so small on the first day never bodes well. i turned back to youngit. &gt;me: so, no tickets? youngit looked confused but shook his head. &gt;me: oh … &gt;youngit: don’t worry we have emails. youngit opened up the email client, the list of emails already in my inbox was staggering. &gt;youngit: when you complete a job, just hit reply all and type done into the reply. that tells us all you’ve ‘done' the job. &gt;me: i’ve already got 57 emails. isn’t this a new account? &gt;youngit: it gets resent every job it hasn’t completed every few hours. so we don’t miss any. i could already think of a hundred things wrong with this system. youngit seemed to relish in explaining every aspect of it though. i let him talk. eventually a lady walked into the department, youngit prompted me to take the inquiry. &gt;fright: oh, hello. are you new? &gt;me: yep. what can it do for you? &gt;fright: my computer won’t print. just errors continuously. &gt;me: i guess lets go take a look. i started to make my way towards the door, but fright didn’t seem to move. &gt;fright: don’t worry, i’ve brought it down. &gt;behind fright a desktop and printer combination sat on a trolley. it looked like someone had taken great care to bring every cord with it. the trolley was loaded with various cords and adaptors. &gt;fright: hopefully i’ve got the right cords, i sort of need this done quickly. &gt;me: next time, maybe leave it all in place and we’ll come to you…. greyit shouted at me from across the room. &gt;greyit: wait, airz. stop. i’ll take this one. he rushed over, and stood between me and fright. i was so surprised he’d called me airz i decided to just let him. as i walked back to my desk i listened to the end of the interaction. &gt;greyit: sorry about that, so you’re not printing? don’t worry we’ll sort this out. &gt;fright: what did that other guy say about coming up and not having to bring everything to it? &gt;greyit: he’s the newbie, doesn’t know what he’s talking about i’m afraid. no, no the best way to get things done quickly is the it department. i mean think about it… thats where all the fixing machines are. fright seemed to accept that as fact and smiled as greyit spent his time plugging the computer in. i stared with incredulity at all the inefficiencies. i seemed to be in shock for a while and was only brought out of it when youngit brought me a coffee. &gt;me: youngit, is everything diagnosed down here? nothing is ever done on the floor. my question however was answered only moments later as an exhausted secretary pushed a massive full height printer into the department. she gave it one last shove through the door then exclaimed loudly. &gt;exaustsec: printer for floor 2! it’s out of ink or something, again.[previous]( nice was smiling brightly as we walked back to my office. &gt;nice: woo. that was great! it's always good to get some work done. what's next for today? &gt;defiant: great?!?! defiant was scowling as he absentmindedly rubbed his forehead. he didn't seem to enjoy the help desk. &gt;nice: let's do some stocktaking! that's so anti-social maybe even you'll enjoy it, defiant. &gt;me: stocktaking...mmm.. my eyes drifted over to the store room. it was fairly tidy. &gt;nice: yeah, there's got to somewhere that needs cleaning. &gt;me: er. nah. i think everything's clean. i caught a glimpse of the "cleaning closet" filled with old it equipment, with no where to go. i decided not to mention it. &gt;defiant: we could just check everything is in the right place. &gt;me: cleaning should wait... tickets first. i dove to the computer searching for a ticket to distract everyone. nice however had spotted the cleaning closet. &gt;nice: woah. look at this room! it's a mess. &gt;me: dammit. i reluctantly walked over to the closet. whilst walking i spotted solitaire teaching hesitant about bastion hosts. i wondered why i couldn't have such a good non-energetic student. &gt;defiant: wow. look at all this old stuff. &gt;me: we probably shouldn't disturb it. it all needs throwing out, but we've been ordered to keep it. all this old stuff is a cursed. nice started looking through the boxes. defiant started inspecting all the old computers in the room. &gt;me: defiant, didn't you want to avoid physical stuff? i can go get some fun tickets.... &gt;defiant: nah, it's okay. this is fun. i frowned as i looked around at all the cursed it gear. abandoned hardware from projects that failed or stalled. &gt;me: man, this place is... &gt;defiant: awesome. &gt;nice: dusty? &gt;me: ... depressing. eventually nice and defiant convinced me to help clean. i wasn't enthused. i send defiant down to get some boxes from recycling so we could box and label equipment. i half expected him to return empty handed, knowing the cleaners. however surprisingly he arrived back with an entire cart of boxes. &gt;defiant: those cleaners tried to convince me they got a rebate for cardboard. &gt;nice: wait, ...do we get a rebate? &gt;defiant: haha, hell no. i still can't believe they tried fast talking me. i'm the fast talking king. i laughed at defiant but tried to stifle it with my hand. luckily he didn't notice. we started working &amp; slowly we worked our way through the room. &gt;nice: hey, what's this? &gt;defiant: it looks cool. i examined the box they were holding. it was filled with palm 3c's. &gt;me: old pda's. junk nowadays. &gt;defiant: can i... have one? i shrugged. i was surprised when defiant reached in and the first one he tried to turn on sprung to life. he took the pda and a charging dock and excited plugged them in. he started playing with it immediately. &gt;nice: pretty retro. what can they do? &gt;me: mostly just a diary, maybe document reader. nice stared at the device almost longingly. &gt;nice: can i... &gt;me: just take one. nice took one with a dock and quickly ran off. i smiled as i looked around the tidy room. job done. i decided the curse of the old equipment had lifted with the clean. ***** the next day i sat in my office watching defiant happily tap away with his new (old) toy. &gt;me: yesterdays cleaning wasn't so bad, normally that room leads to headaches. &gt;defiant: yeah! it was great... defiant went back to busily tapping on his palm. i decided to check my emails. my inbox was filled. **new email** it, i've seen the events manager with a new it device thing. it has a screen and stuff. looks useful. when do accounts get them? --accounting head. **new email** airz, nice was showing a large screen diary yesterday. she said she got it from it. would it be possible to get one also? --marketingj &gt;me: fantastic. i dreaded the future calls to it to get various programs working on the now ancient palm's. i started to prepare a generic reply, however i was stopped by a knock at the door. &gt;solitaire: hey airz, i noticed defiant here has a palm. i was wondering if i could also get one.... &gt;me: i knew that room was cursed. i should never have touched it. &gt;solitaire: sorry? what? my mind screamed "burn them all" but my body just shrugged. [next]( it apprentice - supporting over 1200 users so im sitting here at my desk reading reddit when a user comes into the office saying the new managing directors pc isn't working.. she is panicking and screaming.. so this is how it went.. user: u- me: me- u - help he is getting angry and his pc wont work... me - ok.. have you made sure its plugged into the extension lead properly.. u - of course i have im not an idiot me - okay ill come over now. so i get up from my desk and walk over to the md's building.. sure enough it was plugged in, i have a look at the extension lead and notice the light was no on.. (the occasionally blow a bulb) i then trail the extension lead back and i find its not plugged into the socket. whilst doing this i have the md watching my every move and for someone that is 16 i find it intimidating.. me - urmm.. the extension lead is not plugged in.. u - oh right.. md - this was a test to see how fast you react to emergencies.. you can now leave. so moral of the story, he may be a managing director of a global company but he doesn't know how to plug an extension lead in.. md= managing director not doctor for infomy telco is currently testing 1gbps links for deployment sometimes this decade - maybe. in our labs, and our internal network, we're already testing these. it's sweet but... &gt; boss: "hey bytewave. i got an automated email from systems (internal it) saying you tripped an alarm. could it be related to our private server? here's a copy." &gt; bytewave: "you're kidding me. unrelated. this is the alarm that was set up a decade ago after someone seeded torrents from frontline's tech lab and then another tried to literally send spam from their workstation, remember?" &gt; boss: "... oh yeah. i didn't know we still had that. it's volume based right?" &gt; bytewave: "yeah... based on numbers that seemed right a decade ago. now that we have a 1gbps link, hitting the target takes like 2 minutes." &gt; boss: "yeah... i guess it's okay for frontline but.. anyhow, whatever you sent or received was dozens of gigs. i don't mean to pry but..." &gt; bytewave: "pry away. remember during the last network outage, when you asked me to troubleshoot off-books an alarm system - for which i have no training and is not a product we sell? that i somehow fixed anyway?" &gt; boss: "yeah. thanks again for that." &gt; bytewave: "i did it by reading on the thing on wikipedia. using a test phone with a sim from our competitor, evilsatellite. if they knew we could only fix something thanks to them, they'd have a damn commercial about it. anyhow, i figured we should keep a copy on our server from now on - with the new drives, there's plenty of space." &gt; boss: "a copy of wikipedia?" &gt; bytewave: "yes. [i downloaded wikipedia.. in both languages]( our portal has already been updated with links. it's not that big for the amount of useful info it has - we have a few spare terabytes. i put it on the non-raid drive and on a 128gb thumbdrive. so, you're saying it tripped an alarm at systems? when they gave us 1gbps connections, did they intend for us to use it or just stare at speedtest.net and drool a little?" &gt; boss: "you did right. but i can't tell systems it's on our shadow server. i'll tell them we put it on a thumbdrive for emergency purposes, and all will be fine. thanks." &gt; bytewave: "systems might be happy, but i'm not. you don't give me a 1gbps link and then call my boss the second i actually use it. mind if i take down the automated usage alerts for our department?" &gt; boss: "... sure, that's really antiquated.. but what could we do about it? that's run by systems right?" &gt; bytewave: "i have my people at systems. let me call gregory." [gregory was first featured in this old tale.]( &gt; gregory: "systems." &gt; bytewave: "hey greg! bytewave, tsss. i need to know how that old in-house alarm for overuse of the internal network works." &gt; gregory: "hey man! it's just an alert sent pretty wide if any workstation at any department that falls under tech support or sales reaches 40gb up/down within a 48 hour period." &gt; bytewave: "that's actually less unreasonable than i feared, but with the new 1gbps links senior staff has it's been accidentally tripped without valid cause." &gt; gregory: "just by senior staff or frontline too?" &gt; bytewave: "just us." &gt; gregory: "kay. taking your accounts and your labs out of the alarm. both tsss and sss. do you need me to raise the cap too?" ... if only there were twenty guys like gregory at systems, internal it would actually function without a hitch... &gt; bytewave: "nah, cap is fine for frontline. thank you for taking us out the list, man. see you at lunch." boss nodded looking very happy. now i get to actually use and test that damn link without alarms. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](this was back in the days of me being a code-monkey for a company about 4 years ago. the cio, who was a well-established idiot, who daisy-chained a raid into a constantly failing server drive, was known for not knowing crap. they have a massive home-brewed server, when the size of the organization could easily survive on a single server rack if properly configured. an org with less than 30 people has a dedicated, in house exchange server, with the cio's homebrewed spam filter in place(oh boy, i got stories about the failure that pos was).... back-ups were done monthly, and were kept in the same room. mainly, the whole thing was designed to fail. even just on the hardware side, the cio was an idiot. on the software side, he was an even bigger idiot. he claimed to be a .net guy, but he was actually a vb5 guy. everything he wrote, vb. hated c. so, cio decided to build this online tool where clients would be able to create their own ads. the whole tool was a disaster that used a grid system like "battleship"... anyways, since i was the smartest code-monkey, i got the 'privilege' to alpha the pos. sample data was given to us in a word document to input into an ad. which i did. 20 minutes later, boom, alarms everywhere, people scrambling, children screaming, dogs and cats living together! finally, one of the programmers ran to me. "did you just put a high-bit character into the new ad tool?!?!" he said accusingly. i said "i copy and pasted the text from the word doc." apparently, word docs have an 'end of line' character that's invisible, and is considered a 'high-bit' character, which caused me to escape the ad tool's text input, meaning the rest of the text string i copy/pasted in was being read as code, not a sentence to merge. yeah, they tried to pin it on me until i pointed out most our customers use word, and would've copy/pasted in 'high-bit' characters eventually. tl;dr sanitize your inputs!blah first time poster, blah blah blah user... having worked as an it support person during move in, my favorite was the dad who was upset because he couldn't set up his server in his daughters room. (our networking team was always aggressive about blocking rouge servers on the network). cast: ad = angry dad me = me &gt;ad: why am i not allowed to set up my daughter's computer in her dorm? &gt;me: *thinking that he means a desktop* you are allowed to set it up sir, just make certain you follow the getting started guide that we put in her room. &gt;ad: i did, then if stopped talking to the network. why??? (snipping out the long rant about how much he's paying for his daughter to attend) &gt;me: *thinking that he didn't bother to read the instructions, and rather than belabor the point, i decided to follow him upstairs to help* ad walks me in and points to his daughter's "desktop computer", which is actually a server rack, complete with a couple of servers, a network switch, and what i believe is a decent raid array. &gt;me: um sir, you're not allowed to treat your daughter's dorm room like a server closet. that will have to go. **note**: daughter is sitting on her bed during this time surfing the facebook on her laptop. &gt;ad: *sputtering* do you know how much money i'm paying for her to go here?? &gt;me: money has nothing to do with this. you can't do this and it will have to go. &gt;ad: f&amp;+= you! at this point, rather than argue, i decided to let campus security take care of this and walk out. i call the special number we have for security and inform them of the situation. an hour later, i laugh quietly as he is hauling several boxes and an empty server rack back to his truck. turns out, he saw that our campus had access to internet 2 and thought that he could just plug his business server up to our network and instantly have faster data speeds without having to pay for it. tl;dr: daddy will gladly pay for his daughter to join a sorority, but is too cheap to pay for his own server room. one day at my telco, a new low-level suit asks me a favor while i'm getting a coffee refill. &gt; new suit: "so, i need to send a few faxes but these machines hate me, hah. senior staff, right? can you help me do it?" &gt; bytewave: "yes i am, no i can't. rules are a bit strict. handling the faxes of management is part of the job description of the union secretaries, i'm sure hr explained all the intricacies when you took the job? you'd be getting your first grievance in your first week. go see one of them, they'll be happy to." &gt; new suit: "oh, right... i tried, it's just they're on this seminar this afternoon, we're all out, so obviously there's nobody to handle it." &gt; bytewave: ".. it's a fax machine. if my cleaning maid calls in sick, i can still operate a vacuum cleaner. what can be so complicated?" mistaking my morbid curiosity for an interest in helping him out, he beams and pulls out six letters and.. a *series* of voided cheques?! &gt; new suit: "yeah i really need to move all my stuff to this new bank account, and you know how it is, paymaster wants a copy, old and new banks, credit card company, bills..." &gt; bytewave: "hang on, i thought this was at least work-related..." .... &gt; bytewave: "nevermind, now i'm curious. why do you have six voided cheques in hand and..." i look carefully at the letter he's hoping to fax along... it's a nicely formatted explanation followed by his contact information, account numbers and everything related to identification at six different companies. the six are identical copies! &gt; bytewave: "... i'm going to advise you to send a different document to each company that handles your financial business. i'd like to say something like "this is how identity theft happens..." but it really isn't. nobody wakes up and thinks it's a good idea to send their account numbers and everything from their sin to their parent's names as proof of id on the same page to six different companies. now, why on earth did you make six copies of the exact same void cheq.." and then it hits me. oh. &gt; new suit: "well i need to send it to six places, i have this post it with the fax *codes* for each." &gt; bytewave: "you know what, we're now miraculously enough talking about something that falls under my job description." &gt; new suit: "oh! so you can help me with this?" &gt; bytewave: "sort of. it falls under technical senior staff's purview to ensure everyone who talks with customers about technical issues have the required grasp of the technologies involved at their level for the services we provide. usually it's frontline techs - but still. i can't send your faxes but i have to ensure you get a class on the basics that you seem to direly need. a remarkable amount of complaints management gets are from people who can't operate their faxes and someone in your position needs to understand the technology, as it's almost always due to their equipment." &gt; new suit: "oh, thanks, but i really don't care about that stuff, i just need these six faxes sent. thank you, i'll wait for the secretaries tomorrow." &gt; bytewave: "i'm afraid it's not exactly optional, in a case like this. i can get someone to sit with you to cover the basics you'll need in your job discreetly - or i can file a coaching report that the director will have to review later. it's much easier for everyone if you're.. eager to learn. sorry, just my job, you'll understand..." &gt; new suit: "... oh well i guess it's true i don't know much about this stuff. so, what, we head to the training rooms?" &gt; bytewave: "no, i have stuff to do. i'll have someone from our team with you, we should be able to do this by six." ... and so a little later a tired suit sits in class learning why you don't need to use six void cheques if you want to fax the same one six times... &gt; most junior guy on senior staff: "... and so the first iteration of the technology that closest resembles what we use today came with with xerox' magnafax in 1966... ... &gt; ... and therefore only a single copy of input contents is required, as it is then converted into a bitmap and transmitted through phone lines as audio-frequency tones... as a copy, multiple inputs of the same document are of course unnecessary... he told me the next day the newest manager listened but looked like someone who had been sentenced to hard labor and was counting his minutes to freedom. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](firstly, thanks to /u/nerdguy1138 for prompting me to write this after seeing my flair! now, i hope this fits in this sub... so i’m not really in tech support, but i think this counts as at the time i was managing the development and roll out of a new piece of software, sort of a halfway house between customer and dev. - quite enjoyable actually. if you are in the uk then you may have seen the adverts on tv and in the press about pensions auto enrolment. for those who don’t know, basically if you earn above a threshold your employer must put you in a pension scheme and must contribute to your pension. simple concept yes? yes it is but the actual rules behind it are horrifically complicated. the developers guide is over 200 pages long and increasing. [here for more info if you have a week to kill]( anyway in the uk the tax year ends on the 5th of april and starts on the 6th of april, at which point the thresholds for auto enrolment change. depending on your assessment date, depends on which threshold you use. so if you are paid monthly (1st to 30th of april) your assessment date is the beginning of the month (1st of april) so you use last year’s figures, unless you turn 22 in the month and your birthday is on the 6th or after in which case you use this year’s figures. there is much much more to it that this however…. with me? or bored yet. i’ll carry on anyway. a customer [g] phoned last april, your narrator is [cl] &gt;[g] the system has used the wrong figures &gt;[cl] ok let’s talk through the scenario. (i then spend a good 20 minutes taking down key dates, salary, age information etc., and doing the calculation manually) &gt;[cl]no it’s right, because you assess on the 1st of april it has used the correct figures &gt;[g] but today is the 22nd of april &gt;[cl] yes it is &gt;[g] so we need to use the new figures] &gt;[cl] no, use the figures on the assessment date &gt;[g] put i pay them at the end of the month &gt;[cl] that’s fine, but the assessment date is the 1st, i.e. in last year &gt;[g] i don’t care, i want to use this year’s figures &gt;[cl] you can’t &gt;[g] i want to because then i don’t have to put them in a pension at this point alarm bells ring, they want to fudge it to avoid paying employer contributions (1% of salary i hasten to add) there followed an extensive call with me re-iterating i wouldn’t change it, in which i uttered the phrase ‘no, i will not change it to make it illegal’. they complained all the way up to director, who all backed me (which was nice) and fudged it anyway **edit** so yes they told me they were going to fudge it anyway, and if i had any faith that the regultor would get round to looking at it yes i would report them - they will be audited shortly so it will come up (regulator is tpr not hmrc) **edit 2** everyone saying report him - it's a her:) [previous]( walking over to the pc that was the focus of everyone's attention. what secrets do you hide, i wondered. i grabbed a new coffee and connected up the computer to a screen. colourblind finally looked up from his chair. &gt;colourblind: what, do you…. think is on there? colourblind’s curiosity hadn’t died. good. &gt;me: er, i don’t think i even want to know. &gt;colourblind: what if it’s, good? his eyes had lost their sad edge, they now shone with dreams of the possibilities. i got up from my desk to get a hard drive with the company images on it. as i came back to the spot where the computer lay, i noticed that had been turned on. colourblind looked guiltily up at me. &gt;colourblind: sorry. i couldn’t help it. but look…. **no boot device found** &gt;me: what the…? &gt;colourblind: lets look in the bios. in the bios we stared at the screen, which told us no hard drives were plugged in. &gt;me: maybe the board died on the hard drive. i grabbed the screwdrivers from a nearby desk and cracked open the computer. &gt;colourblind: airz? did you pull this thing apart before? &gt;me: nope. i looked at the empty drive bays. no hard drives. &gt;colourblind: how did? &gt;me: er…?! i looked frantically around the office. how did a computer work upstairs, then only 15 minutes later, not have a hard drive? &gt;colourblind: f*#$ &gt;me: yep. [next](so, this is a story my boss told me yesterday. he went to a client who was having wireless internet connectivity issues. he checked out all three of their computers, they were all connected wirelessly but the connection was a bit hiccupy. after a while he figured out that all the computers in the office were connected to the internet via the printer. it's one of those printers that lets you connect to it so you can print from a device without having to go through the router or anything. so, apparently, this printer was doubling up as an access point for the network. everyone went through that to get to the router. of course, none of the users realised that's what the problem was. once the printer's wireless details were removed from every machine, and they were all connected to the router again (which, strangely, had a far weaker signal than the printer), everything returned to normal. and i imagine the little men inside the printer that make the miracles happen stopped having frequent panic attacks.this is a little more recent than my previous posts: back in the 1970's we had a tandem machine (that was never supposed to fail, and really didn't) with 8 processors. everyone in the machine room seemed to have an **evil aura**. whenever anyone got close to the machine a message was printed on the system teletype machine (yeah, 110 baud). the message said something like *"processor 5 failed"* followed by a time stamp. since this system was redundant as all get out, the only thing that anyone not in the machine room noticed was slightly increased latency in responses. when the area around the machine was vacated, another message was printed: *"processor 5 is operating"* again with a time stamp. this was a really new installation (less than a month since startup) so we called the manufacturer's tech support. the support tech immediately replaced the processor 5 boards (as we expected he would), but nothing changed. out of curiosity, all of the non-tandem techs were standing around watching. processor 5 would resume operation only when everybody left the immediate vicinity of the machine. after several hours of diagnostics (which passed when no on was close to the machine, but failed otherwise), complete with snide comments from the audience about *spooky action at a distance*, the support tech found a slightly bent pin on one of processor 5's sockets. he powered down processor 5, straightened the pin, restored power and restarted processor 5. it worked, even with the audience standing right next to the machine. this was a mainframe type installation on a raised floor. the raised floor had not been installed properly. the weight of any individual standing near the machine was enough to flex the floor causing the connection to fail, followed immediately by the error message. shortly afterwards, we got a new assembly for processor 5 under warrantee. i wasn't there at the time so i don't know how much was replaced, but we never had that *evil aura* effect on the machine again. as far as i know, the floor was never re-adjusted - we just lived with it.this was the query we just got from a client who just got their ssl cert renewal invoice. i pulled up her invoice from last year and the email comms between her and our sales guy. "we are adding your ssl certificate to your final invoice. please note that this is an annual charge. it needs to be renewed before july 28th, 2015" it was clearly labelled as an annual fee on her invoice as well. so i asked her, in spite of this, why she thought her ssl cert should be permanent. &gt; "certificates don't expire." excuse me? &gt; "i have had my degree since 2004, imagine if i had to pay for that to be renewed every year or i could not practice marketing. it is permanent." we explained that this is a normal practice and that every single ssl cert provider will bill the same way. she accused us of taking advantage of people who do not understand tech and has now shut down her account with us. flabbergasted, to be honest. or: how the interpreter saved his boss' butt it's the early 21st century and one of my first jobs as "freelance it &amp; media guy" is with a local pr company. mostly working on their first website (yay, future!) and fixing various user problems. really basic stuff, but i was a newbie in many areas making stuff up as i went along, so it fit. in late summer the cto of a japanese tech company was in germany to attent an exhibition/trade show, and meet a couple of investors. our company had been working to become the official pr agency for the japanese tech company for europe, and they got the cto to meet with our boss and project leads here before the show. the cto was carrying a laptop that had all the important files for the presentations on it. i was told the laptop simply went black in the middle of the meeting and wouldn't come back on for a while. when it finally did boot again, there was a boot error and the cto declared the laptop was broken and the data gone for good. my boss sent for me to have me take a look at the machine. i saw the error message (mbr broken), and said that i might be able to get the data. &gt; shouldn't be that hard, i just use one of them linux live-cds to boot the machine and copy the files to one of our laptops over the lan and that was when the translator said &gt; are you mad? the cto of a high tech company has just declared the machine beyond repair. do you have any idea how much it will offend him if some lowly german computer nerd can prove him wrong that easily? &gt; so would you rather not holding your presentation than being helped? who's the mad guy here? &gt; i'll think of something, now please leave us. you're not needed here. my boss nodded and i went back into the makeshift it office, thinking to myself how unreal that just had been. 10 minutes later the translator entered my office, laptop under his arm. he told me my boss would be taking the cto out to lunch now, and that he [the translator] had convinced the cto that those new laptops might have a sort of internal backup system that could be accessed in case of emergency. &gt; i basically dropped a couple of buzz words, and he had to agree unless he wanted to admit that he doesn't have a clue. i was sent here to give you instructions, but i guess you know what to do better than me." we both grinned. he continued: &gt; now this is important: it must look like it was a really difficult job. it must look very... technological. wires, tools, hardware parts, etc. oh, and take apart the laptop! can you do that? i nodded, and he excused himself to join out bosses at lunch. booting the machine using a linux live-cd worked like a charm; finding and copying the files was child's play. so while the data was being copied over the network to another laptop, a co-worker and i started "technologizing" the office. we removed the side panels from the desktop pcs, put a bunch of cables here and there, got the tool boxes and broken/outdated hardware parts out of the closet and put them onto a desktop-turned-workbench, put the networking stuff into a place where one could easier see all those pretty leds, etc. and for a final touch we put a soldering iron onto the desk right next to the cto's laptop. it was horrible and beautiful at the same time. 2 hours later our boss and the japanese guests came back from their meal, and the translator came by to ask if everything went ok. it did. he then ushered his boss into the room. the cto scanned the room, then saw the remains of his laptop spread across the workbench, with the soldering iron next to it. he turned to his translator and they exchanged some words. the translator then told me: &gt; please hand him the new laptop. don't say anything, just nod a bit. i did as instructed. the cto opened it up, the presentation was already waiting to be started. there was not a single muscle moving in his face. he close the laptop, nodded towards his translator (not me) and then left the room to get back to talking business with my boss and the project leads. later i was told that during lunch the cto had phones his company and ordered a currier to fly to germany asap to bring a new laptop with the presentation, data etc. (keep in mind this is early 2000, and we are talking huge amounts (for that time) of data, uncompressed videos, etc. so "just ftp that stuff overnight" was not an option). said courier would not make it in time for the presentation the next day. our company would later get to do some business for the japanese company, so "mission accomplished" i guess. a few weeks later we got a package from japan, in it mostly pr stuff for the marketing guys to play around with, etc. but also a small box labeled "for it". in it was a soldering station and a card that read &gt; we noticed you have a very old soldering iron. we gift this new japanese one to you so you may fix computers more efficiently in the future me: this is x019 user: i moved my monitor and now nothing works me: alright. is your monitor on? user: no. me: is your computer on? user: no. me: ... is your power strip on? user: how do i tell? me: is the light on it on? user: no. me: is it plugged in? user: umm. where does it plug into? me: the wall is usually a good place for that. user: uh. okay i got it. i had just plugged it into an open spot (on itself). me: alright. well let's turn that computer on then. user: it says "start windows normally". me: alright, hit yes. user: yes? me: sorry. use your keyboard. hit enter. on your keyboard. user: it's working! me: sweet. let me know if you have any more problems. --end call-- tl;dr such power many work compute wow how does strip?there are some things in life you just can’t train for. cooling is a very delicate thing. managing heat can be difficult at the best of times, but when your datacentre is in an office building, shit can hit the fan quickly, and when that happens, you just have to improvise. it was the middle of summer - 40 degree days (celcius), blistering heat, high humidity. we had two airconditioning units for the datacentre; a big one and a small one that was about half the size. i referred to this as n+0.5 as the big one was new, and the small one was old, and thus most likely to fail. we’d always planned to get a third one, the same size as the big one. the designs were drawn up and it was quoted on, but cash flow at a startup is light, so we banked on the big one, and hoped for the best. &gt; /u/wizbam : *this summer .. hope was not enough.* the environmental sensors went off not long after the unit’s management console stopping responding to pings. i ran to the plant room with that hope in my heart, but that hope was quickly pissed away as i nearly unrinated in fear. the room was quiet. ac2 was dead; its corpse smelt like burning. the air temperature in the dc went from 24 to 26 in five minutes. with that rate of change it would be over 40 degrees within the hour. we had about an hour and a half before the servers would reach shutdown temperature, and probably two hours max before the switches and routers shut off. we’d be screwed if it got that far, but our customers would be worse if their drives melted down. if that wasn’t bad enough, when the airconditioner blew, it took out a whole bunch of circuits with it. namely, all of the additional power outlets around the room. /u/haakon666 and i gathered in a huddle to decide the plan of attack, and after five minutes of discussion, orders were issued. 85 minutes to shutdown temperature. we sent every non-critical staff member to malls in every direction with $100 and one instruction: buy as many fans as you can carry. i ran off to a hardware store to buy as many 15a extension leads and power boards as i could, and left /u/haakon666 to shut down all non-critical servers, while the other two techs called as many of our customers as they could to let them know the situation, and strongly advise they shut down anything non-critical also. the ceo called the ceo of our airconditioning company and pulled the trigger on a purchase order that said ‘it doesn’t matter what it costs, come in and build right now’. their office was an hour away, and the portable chillers they were bringing took half an hour to assemble as they were in pieces. 75 minutes to shutdown temperature. our scout missions all returned about the same time. /u/haakon666 and i ran in different directions with high-amp power cables, and proceeded to barge into every office we could find and steal their power. the people who questioned us were glared at and gruffly told it was an emergency, followed shortly by us storming off and looking for the next outlet. with the power cabling complete, phase 2 was about to begin. i don’t know how many fans there were. there would have been about 10 people on the fan mission, so … a lot. we broke the power cables out into power boards, plugged in fans, and opened both the doors, directing air down the aisles and along the row to the exits. a wall of heat spewed out into the hall. it felt like getting hit in the face. it was 46 degrees now. we didn’t have much time. the building airconditioning in the office and the hall were doing little to stem the flow of hot air, and the lobby began to heat up. we opened the doors to our office, to every other office, and when they started to heat up too, the fire escape. unfortunately, this did little to stem the flow. the hot air that the one remaining ac was sucking back in was getting hotter, and in turn it became less and less effective. /u/haakon666 and i dedicated what little time we had remaining to helping the larger customers determine what they could safely shut off, and unplug anything redundant. the heat was overwhelming, suffocating. we took turns in the room, as long as we could stand it, before tagging out and taking a rest to rehydrate. i thought i was going to throw up. he looked somehow pale and overheated at the same time. 55 degrees. the servers would be reaching failure temperature soon, but there was nothing more we could do; we sat, and watched the fans spin aimlessly. all we had left was the waiting game, and the waiting game sucks. at that moment, four airconditioning techs ran through the open doors, each pushing a 7.5kw portable chiller. i’d never been so happy to see anyone in my life. they plugged into the waiting power outlets, and with a chug they sprung to life. heat exhaust conduits two feet wide snaked their way down the aisles and out the door. and for the first time in what seemed like forever, the temperature began to drop. we were saved, but this was a temporary measure; the units had buckets in them that needed to be emptied frequently, so we took turns emptying them down the sink. the other ac team had gotten to work shifting our new 20kw unit in, and they were all hands on deck for as long as they had to be to get it online. the temperature had dropped to a not-respectable but totally liveable 28 degrees. no hard drives crashed. only two servers hit thermal max, and they shut down gracefully in response. i went home early that day. dehydrated, exhausted, and 100% out of fucks, i was no longer of use to anyone. someone asked why i was leaving. all i could manage was one word. “no”. *to be continued..*i promised something nice for /u/tannerleaf so here it is :) &amp;nbsp; i work for a small it company that manages big law firms and car dealerships. we still cater to our older home users, not wanting to toss them away now that we've gotten a bit larger. &amp;nbsp; one of these people are very old (80's to 90's) and he usually mulls about without any issue. when he calls us, it's like a train hitting a wall, going 90 mph. for instance, one time he called and screamed at me as i could not escalate his call - it was very busy, and he wanted to *warn us about cryptowall, as seen on the sunday paper*. yes, we know about that, we were dealing with two outbreaks of crypto as he called, funny enough. but that's not the point here... &amp;nbsp; the point here, is that this man always tries to be helpful, but has absolutely no idea what he is doing. but, at his age and still being able to function on his own with his computer? sounds good to me. &amp;nbsp; one day he calls us, as he is having an issue with wordperfect. something happened, and then he found he couldn't use his mouse. he sets down the phone and crawls under the desk, and then you can hear him audibly groan from a distance before he comes back and tells us that he's unplugged everything by accident. &amp;nbsp; so, this requires an on-site visit. they're expensive, but he doesn't seem to mind. and it is way better than him being on the floor at his age. we get an appointment set up for him, but i'm told by hr that the day chosen was actually his birthday. &amp;nbsp; fast forward to that day, and i've bought the cutest card i could find, and had everyone in the office sign it. i sent my tech on his way, and it went like this: &amp;nbsp; &gt;tech hands $user the bill for that day's appointment, as he wasn't able to e-sign the agreement. &gt;$user signs bill. &gt;tech takes bill back and smiles, and then pulls the card out from wherever he was hiding it. &gt;$user takes the card, cries, hugs my tech and then calls us in the office. &amp;nbsp; this user is, as stated, old. he repeated a few times about how happy he was, and about how all of his friends were dead along with his family, and that no one would have known it was his birthday. he cried to me on the phone, shouted a big thank you to all of the techs that i had listening in, and then offered to beat up any older clients if they ever gave us any lip. &amp;nbsp; it was undoubtedly the most adorable thing i've ever had happen at work. &amp;nbsp; *on a side note, he called us the next day to tell us the speakers weren't plugged in. as a courtesy, we went back free of charge, only to find he hadn't turned on his speakers despite clearly laughing and scoffing at the idea and saying, "what, do you think i'm an idiot? of course they're on!". he felt silly, but we still love him anyway.* **edit: thank you all for helping me get this formatted correctly! ;u;**i work for health insurance company on the east coast and have been part of the tech ssupport group for going on 7 years now and this is my first "are you kiding me" tech support moment that i felt like posting... this story takes place on a warm sunny saturday morning, we were working all week on upgrading the vpn software on the new wave of laptops we just got. my boss (we will call him barney as to protect his real name just incase any of my fellow people find me on reddit) gave us a list of things to troubleshoot while setting up said computers. well barney was in a meeting with the ceo and a bunch of the other directors and they all wanted the first wave of new laptops. all of them were setup and working for each user as of friday afternoon when i left at noon. they were going to be picking them up before they left for the day.....or so i thought saturday morning roles around and i am woken up to the sound of my phone going off at 6am. after answering the phone it was barney, panicing. i tried to calm him down to find out what was wrong but barney was in full panic mode freaking out and sounding like he was going to have a heart attack. i talked to him for about 10 minutes until i figured out the issue....and it was a big one.... the new laptops were not working at all, the compuets wouldnt let them log in and the directors had no idea why. so i called our ceo (i didnt volunteer, i was basically told to because barney was having a break down). after speaking to our ceo (i will call him hermin), hermin was no help at all after almost 20 minutes of trying to ask him what the problem was. he just kept repeating "it wont connect, i am really disappointed". i tried to walk him through the setup and he keeps saying that the computer is asking for a windows key...so right there i know something isnt right. then hermin just begins getting really mad and then he slips out the words "god dammit obama"....now i am holding back my laughter with all of my strength and tell him i will make my way to the office. ok so now at this point i drive into the office (which is 45 minutes away). so i dont even get dressed just jump in the car and drive off to the office. when i get there i finally get to the 5th floor and find my way to my work area and then i see it...the 6 laptops sitting on the tech cart with a giant sign that says "directors laptops" and each was boxed with the different directors name on a label on both sides and top of the box so it was easy to read....they didnt take the correct laptops.... heres when it gets good....i then have to call hermin back and explain to him what the problem is. that basically whoever grabbed the laptops, gave them the wrong ones. i say im sorry for this mixup and tell them that they have to switch them out. the ones they have arent even setup with windows yet (hence the windows key screen...). hermin then begins to get really mad at me, and below i have laid out the convo for you: hermin: "well i am the one that grabbed these, so you are saying i took the wrong ones? how am i suppose to know which ones are the right ones?" me: "where did you take them from? we had them on the tech cart in the support area with a sign on them. they had each directors name on the box because we set them up based on how you wanted them" hermin: "this is ridiculous, where was that cart? i dont know where the tech support area is!" me: "but you said you grabbed the laptops your self, so where did you take them from?" hermin: "dont get smart with me!" me: "sir, i am only trying to figure out how to correct this mistake please dont think i am insulting you in anyway. i just want to know which ones you took" hermin: "well we are all without working computers now, this is entirely your fault" me: "barney is in charge of this project not me, so please talk to him regarding this" hermin: "you need to bring us these laptop asap! otherwise the directors will be unable to answer emails or contact clients" ***this is false as each one has a work phone which has access to their email*** me: "ok where are you? do you want to come into the office so i can give you the correct laptops and show you how to connect to the network?" hermin: "we are in atlantic city" me: "thats a 7 hour drive for me..." hermin: "start driving.." *click* at this point i call barney back and flip out, i am not driving 7 hours to give thme laptops because our ceo is a moron. barney is begging me to do it and i tell him that this is the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard. after screaming at barney for another 30 minutes i hear my phone ringing, its hermin. hermin: "are you going to drive them to us?" me: "are you joking sir? i understand you need the laptops but thats 7 hours of driving all because you took the wrong ones. this is ridiculous of you to demand this and i just cant do that" hermin: "so you arent going to do this then? we need them! if you dont do this on monday we will have a meeting about this with all of the directors." me: "that is fine with me, i will explain to them what i explained to you" hermin: "see you monday and if they all agree with me, we will be letting you go that after noon" *click* monday rolls around and at this point im ready to lose my job because our ceo is a fool. my manager barney is really upset and freaking out as we walk into the conference room. all of the directors and the ceo are in the room and hermin is at the head of the table ready to yell. we sit down and he starts saying that this situation could have been avoided. after listening to the garbage roll out of his mouth i stand up and say the following: me: "ok let me start off by saying that we took an entire week to do this last minute upgrade for you. we spent many hours setting up your laptops and upgrading your vpn systems with the help of the networking team. with that said i would like to say sorry but not for myself but for our ceo." hermin: "what did you say?!" me: "since you are so hell bent on firing me i would atleast like to explain this situation to everyone in the room so please allow me to do that" hermin: "ok fine!" me: "we setup your 6 specific laptops and tripple checked that they all worked before we were ready to give them to you. we also put them on a cart in our area with a bright yellow sigh that said these were your laptops as well as labeling each one of them based on the user. then we left them in the middle of the room so they would be easy to find. i got called at 6am because someone grabbed the wrong laptops. this is not my fault, then i was blamed for this and told to drive to atlantic city where the conference was that you all attended to give you the latops, which to me is unacceptable. you do not pay me enough to drive that far out of my way because of someone else screw up." at this point hermin's face is turning bright red with anger, but he holds back until i finish. me:"i have pictures of the tech support area that day as well as access to the cameras for that floor. after further review it shows hermin going into the tech support closet and taking out fresh unopened laptops which didnt even have an os on them, he told me on the phone he didnt know where the tech support area was but the camera's show him walking right past the main room to our closet. he then threatened to fire me over his own ignorance." hermin: "how dare you!" just as i was getting ready to be thrown out of the building, one of the other directors stands up and says "this is not your fault, this is hermins"...like the voice of an angel... hermin: "these pictures have to be false there is no way i missed them" me: "you did, and i also have you on our call system saying you had no idea where the tech support area is, if you like i can play that back for you" director 1: "its fine, this is clearly not your issue and we will let it go. sorry about the confusion." me: "thank you for understanding, but just so you are all aware this ill be going to hr before the end of the day" hermin: "how dare you" i walked out of the room, sent an email to hr and had a meeting that day. by the end of that week i had a formal apology letter form the ceo as well as the directors all of which saying that i did an excellent job. point of the story:stupid ceo took wrong laptops, blamed me, blamed obama, and wanted me to drive to atlantic city with 6 laptops. edit: sorry everyone for the really terrible typing i sent this from my phone so there is a lot of fail in it..but the story is still there. i am entirely way to lazy to go back and edit this to sound like an adult typed this rather then a 6thgrader but.....laziness is a hell of a drug [previous]( ****** redcheery and i finally got her wound cleaned up and started packing away the equipment. &gt;angryf: oh for f*%$’s sake. the shout rang out over the entire office. everyone stopped working, i wondered why… then i realized he’d sworn. loudly. &gt;redcheer: huh, looks like our famous designer is having trouble. &gt;me: famous? i went back to packing away the equipment, everyone else was still frozen. &gt;angryf: tech - man! get over here. it took a kick from redcheery to get me to pay attention, i normally don’t respond to “tech man”. i walked over to the angry man, he was in a rage over his computer. &gt;angryf: its not f*%$ing work… the red headed lady had followed me over, and cut angryfamous off in the middle of the sentence. &gt;redcheer: swearing! especially at people that are trying to help, will not make your computer work. &gt;angryf: well its not doing what i need it to do. i looked down at the machine it had completely frozen. &gt;me: mmmm looks like we’ll have to try a restart. &gt;angryf: wont work, this f*$…. the red headed lady gave angryfamous a sharp look. he corrected. &gt;angryf: i mean this… bad computer has stalled like three times today. &gt;redcheer: oh, doesn’t matter. its got a red sticker. that means it’s one of the ones that’s about to be replaced with those new ones. the red cheery lady pointed over to the new machines, that had just been upgraded with water pumps. &gt;angryf: oh sweet, lets go get one! as a group we made our way over to the desktops all lined up on a random desk. angryfamous picked up one of the machines. &gt;redcheer: no, not that one! that’s my one. &gt;angryf: i like this one, and i’m pretty busy, i need to get back to work. angry famous started walking back to his desk with the computer. &gt;redcheer: but i’ve bonded with that one! i’ve bleed into it. &gt;angryf: i don’t care. tech-man, come help me plug everything in. it was at this point i realized famous hadn’t even bothered asking my name. i wasn’t keen on him. i looked over at my red haired helper, she did seem genuinely upset about losing her bonded pc. &gt;me: don’t worry redcheer, it’s just a computer. &gt;redcheer: but… i bleed into that one. we had a bond. &gt;me: well it was only a little bit of blood… **crash** the crashing sound was of a brand new computer being dead dropped from a standing position. &gt;angryf: awww, yuck it **actually** has blood inside it? &gt;me: well no. it’s been sanitized. we don't just leave blood in a computer. &gt;angryf: oh… angry didn’t seem to know what to say after that. he walked over to the desk of pc’s and looked at the others. i walked over to the pc on the ground. no visible damage. i picked it up off the floor. &gt;me: okay, lets go get this setup for you. &gt;angryf: no… i don’t think i like that one anymore. &gt;me: why not? &gt;angryf: i don’t really want a dropped one. just… the worst kind of person. [next](an old story from my frontline days. i was still really new, maybe two months in. &gt; bytewave: "welcome to technical support, my name is bytewave, how may i help you?" customer introduces himself and i make the id. very polite older gentleman, with what i recognize as a south african accent. &gt; mr. opoku: "i'm sorry to trouble you, this used to be so fast but the internet is slow now... quite slow. is there a problem these last few weeks?" i'm already running diags, no loss, 8-9ms pings, pretty clear his connection is fine. speed test just to be sure... &gt; bytewave: "please open your browser, we'll go run a speed test to make sure there's no issue on our end." he agrees and there's a long silence. &gt; bytewave: "okay, in the address bar i need you to type www... &gt; mr. opoku: "sir.. but there's no address bar yet! it's... slow now. used to be fast. it will take longer for this to open." i chuckle on mute. normally support ends pretty much here but he's nice. it's his first call to us ever. and his account dates to the days canada was welcoming south african refugees at the height of apartheid. i feel like keeping going a little bit. &gt; bytewave: "do you know which version of windows you're running?" &gt; mr. opoku: "erhm... windows me." this may be the only call i remember where the user ran millennium while his problem had nothing to do with the os. i err a guess... &gt; bytewave: "double click on my computer, tell me how many drives you see." yep... takes awhile for that to open too. &gt; mr. opoku: "two.. local disk and cd-rom." &gt; bytewave: "local disk. right click it, properties, tell me the size limit and how much is used." i swear, we had to wait for the context menu to show up at all. &gt; mr. opoku: "4096 megabytes..." &gt; bytewave: "that's your size limit?" &gt; mr. opoku: "yes.. but also the used space i believe." &gt; bytewave: "... sir, your hard disk is simply full, which is causing your entire computer to function very slowly. it's not a problem on our end. should have a friend help you free up some space and your computer will be fast again." &gt; mr. opoku: "is there... any way you could suggest to me how to do it myself..? don't have many friends here..." &gt; bytewave: "we're not supposed to help with issues unrelated to our service, please understand if you call again with similar issues the agent will not help you, but... lets try emptying your recycle bin in case there's something there." &gt; mr. opoku: "there's a slow progress bar... very slow ... oh! this is fast now. you fixed it! the internet works!!" he sounds so genuinely happy, like i magically repaired his 'broken internet'. still, being a newbie, was kinda happy for a little win. &gt; mr. opoku: "there's... quite a bit of space left now. why was my recycle bin taking so much space on the drive?" ... i quickly explain there were deleted files that had not been purged form the disk and he thanks me profusely. end of call. three days later my manager wants to talk to me and mentions the customer by name. yeah, obviously, i'm about to get an earful about the support limit... but as i walk in his office, he hands me a brown envelope... hand-written with beautiful penmanship on glossy paper; my first customer appreciation letter, with all sorts of praise, you could see it meant a lot to him. delivered in a 8 1/4 by 11 sized envelope so it wouldn't be folded. there was also money in the envelope which we'd have to return. my boss asked me if i wanted it 'on the billboard' but i said no - we're not putting pins in this. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](today i discovered that in my companies upstairs department there is one individual who arrives early and turns all of the computers on and logs them in. she keeps everyone's passwords on a piece of paper in her draw. i found this out as the individual in question was away. turns out that nobody knows their own password... ugh. edit: i, thankfully, do not work in it so this whole shitstorm is not going to backfire on me. the biggest problem would be that we have one it person for the entire company and if you can't find him then.. tough. hello techies of all nations. just a short one that happened today that i just wanted to facepalm so hard at. so 'user a' walks briefly in to our office today and this is what goes down user a: "hey guys, so i left my laptop at home today and i can't seem to get my pc to start as i was going to use that instead" fairly normal question but unusual that the user has both a laptop and pc in our place. colleague: "so when was the last time you used your pc?" user a: "about a year ago" so in my mind i'm thinking it's a password sync issue and a easy fix. so i get up and walk to user a's desk and she points to the monitor and says: "so i try to switch the monitor on but nothing is turning on." well shit. all i can see on the table is a docking station that's linked up to the monitor. i proceeded to refrain from calling her an idiot and advised her she'll have to work from home or collect her laptop. this reddit, is my job. (and most likely yours) edit: formattingthis is dave's story. (name has been changed to protect the ignorant) it was a quiet thursday afternoon at the support desk. i was in the middle of rearranging my action figures when the phone rang. "it's not printing," said the voice on the other end. "i'm sorry?" i replied as i glanced at the caller id. it was the dave, the company's director of purchasing. "my printer. it's not printing." "okay," i say. "i'll be up as soon as i finish what i'm doing. for right now just use the shared printer in the bull pen." "no. i can't do that. i need you to fix it now." click. he hung up on me. it's not my favorite way to end a conversation but it happens often enough that it doesn't faze me. i finish posing my action figures and make my way upstairs. i must have surprised dave. he still had his facebook games on his screen. he opened an empty spreadsheet and turned to watch me. i go through the basic steps. cables are secure. link light is on. the display reads "tray 2 empty." everything is normal. wait. "tray 2 empty." did he really just call me because he was out of paper? i opened the paper tray. i looked at dave. dave looked at the paper tray. dave looked at me. i looked at the paper tray. dave looked at the paper tray. i looked at dave. dave looked at the floor. i walk across the hall to the supply closet and get a ream of paper. i cross back over to his office and load the paper into his printer. it whirrs to life when i close the tray and i hand him his document. he was making a caramel cheesecake.this tale happens back in the mid 90s, a time of joy, sadness, and dial-up isps. i worked for one, and once boasted that i could run someone through windows95 dial up networking setup with my eyes closed. my then-supervisor thought i was lying, and proceeded to bet me $10 i couldn't. "i can't and i've been here longer than you!!" he said. "i know i can. in fact, i'll *blindfold* myself and do it. i will let you know when i'm on one, you can listen in." he agreed. the next morning i showed up with a bandanna to use as the blindfold. and as luck would have it, my first call was a win95 dun setup call for our service. on goes the blindfold, and i lean back and walk the caller through the setup, all the way from "click on the start button" to his first web page without a glitch. i did the outro and took off the blindfold. no fewer than a half dozen of my fellow techs were watching me do this blindfolded, there was chatter on our irc channel about it, and my supe looked dour as all fucking hell at losing the bet. he did pay up, and i had a nice sandwich for lunch that day. tl;dr: no, really, i can do that blindfolded.a bit of backstory: &amp;nbsp; way back when, i was one-man it for a family business. in the early days of the internets (think pre-wifi, dsl and cable when people still debated the merits of modems and rockwell hcf modems were the bane of the existence of many), i was tasked with getting us online. what to do? we had no network, and i had no budget. cue 10base2 thinnet strung about, 'cause the equipment was available for cheap back then (100bt was becoming the norm but was still expensive and gigabit had just dropped and was unholy expensive) and hubs (much less switches) plus stringing cat 5 would be way more costly than rg-58. &amp;nbsp; so now we were all wired up, with no-place to go. bless the powers, they accepted my explanation as to why a ton of dial-up was not the answer. but, what then??? unfortunately, the facility was hell and gone from *newdeathstarbabybell*'s nearest co, so a t1 was right out of the question. t-spans back then were (and may still be) charged by distance for the physical circuit, and access (be it voice, data, etc) was separate. the quoted loop charges were insane even if i could get access for cheap. but this new-fangled service, called isdn, was not subject to a distance-based loop charge. for those unfamiliar, isdn was sold in many places as 2 64k [b]earer channels for data and 1 16k [d]ata channel for signalling. i figured 2 isdn lines, or 256k bandwidth, should work. &amp;nbsp; sadly, said lec's internet offering wasn't very advanced, and couldn't do bonding. they charged by channel and connect time. so that wasn't gonna fly. plus, this was a bit of a podunk area and innovation was thin on the ground. i, somehow, managed to talk a local isp into leasing us a spanking new cisco 1720 with two isdn cards for cheap and rolling that into monthly dedicated bonded service. they were primarily a consumer dial-up isp (first in town with 56k which is why they could also offer isdn), and in the evenings throughput definitely dropped but when we needed the bandwidth it was there. &amp;nbsp; for a year or so, this was ok. but then flash started becoming a thing, web pages were becoming more image intensive, and broadcast.com was growing popular. none were core business functions but what the powers want, the powers get. and the powers wanted bandwidth. this was perfect timing; $isp was getting commercially shaky and the service grew progressively flaky. meanwhile *newdeathstarbabybell* had recently started offering frame relay dedicated access in our area significantly more cheaply. so out went one 1720 and in came another. this time, we had to supply the router and i had to configure it. so i learned a little ios. this will become important later. but for now, bandwidth was quadrupled, our users rejoiced, and we carried on. &amp;nbsp; another year and a half down the road, and the screaming begins anew over the slowness. by this time we've got servers and printers and devices galore hung to hell and gone. so, it is decided that we'll do it right this time, and the cat-5ization begins. but, our contract with *newdeathstarbabybell* doesn't run out for six months, so while we can redo all the infrastructure and be ready to move, we can't actually switch until then and we'll have to have both running for about a month. they wanted mmmmooaarrrr sppeeeeeeed, so all was blessed. &amp;nbsp; **at long last, we get to the story:** *yellowrunfastshortdistance* telco was mounting a big push in the area to gain customers and had been by to see about picking up our dedicated voice business about a month prior (we did a metric crap-ton of inbound toll-free 800 service). &amp;nbsp; i called the 'rep and said if we got a deal on a 4xt1 circuit, i might be amenable to switching things up when our voice contract came up in about a year. she came back with a price that was equal to what *newdeathstarbabybell* would've wanted for the t1 loops alone and threw in a shiny new cisco 26something (think it was a 2621?) to handle it all. they were going to handle provisioning, install, everything, and the router was their problem. so they said. &amp;nbsp; problem: *yellowrunfastshortdistance* wasn't very good at provisioning and had a bad working relationship with *newdeathstarbabybell*. i wish i'd known that earlier. two weeks before the planned cut-over, i still didn't have an install date for the circuits even though the router had already been installed and mounted and was merrily blinking away into the nothingness not connected to a damn thing. this will also be important later. &amp;nbsp; increasingly impatient calls to the "network implementation team" and my "implementation specialist" were met with platitudes and insistence that all was on track. the name of the implementation specialist? **i kid you not: think military term for a toilet, with an a appended.** from here on out, she shall be military toilet. &amp;nbsp; so finally, finally, *newdeathstarbabybell* install tech shows up. i know these guys well, i love these guys, they love me. i frequently send them home with freebies and have cellphone numbers for 'em all. chubby sheriff (c) is the one that shows up today. &amp;nbsp; i call him that 'cause he kinda looks and sounds like a fat sam elliott. c has a serious enchilada-fuelled paunch, deep basso profundo voice with a drawl to match, full greying beard, and an honest-to-god handlebar moustache with no hipster-wax required. &amp;nbsp; &gt;c: ok, amigo, i gotcherdown fur a t-span teh them sunzabitches. whyyydjew take them anyhow?? &gt;me: offer i couldn't refuse, you guys were $$$$ more a month and they threw in the router. &gt;c: gawddamn!!! welp, we gawdda pay fur all us beeeaaayyyuuutiful techs like this prime spec-i-men ri'cheayah (right here)[slaps his stomach which continues gyrating for a longer time than expected]. &gt;me: waitasec sheriff, did you say 'a' t-span? &gt;c: ayup... wun t-juan, hawt, fresh, 'n made tuh order. &gt;me: uhhhhhh, that's supposed to be four there, amigo. i ordered cuatro so if this ain't it i'm sinko-ed. &amp;nbsp; c calls in and verifies the order is correct. i whip

&gt;me:...so no other orders exist. &gt;mt:naw, dat's all ya need. &amp;nbsp; now, the sales rep had brought her regional manager along for the call, and he'd given me his card. thankfully i remembered this right about now and rushed military toilet off the phone. as a rule, i never give techs or fellow support people hell. sales people do not get this courtesy when things go wrong. sales people are frequently the source of things going wrong. called regional manager up and raised utter hell. &amp;nbsp; &gt;rm:thisisregionalmanagerwith*yellowrunfastshortdistance*howcanihelpyouuuuuuuu.

graciously extends the demarc (demarcation point, where telco hands the circuit off to you) to the network room. &amp;nbsp; to be continued [if anyone actually reads this] **tl;dr: til smartjacks make t1s go to eleven** [edit: formatting, and second installment is now **[here](just happened today when i was out for some emergency field work. it all started with one call from one of our beloved clients, we call him $drb. &gt;**$me:** "hello techsupport you're talking to $waldue." &gt;**$drb:** "agh! $drb here! i got problems with this damn f*cking pc again! i need someone to fix it as soon as possible. send someone here, please!" and yep, he really started shouting in the middle of the sentence, stopped, and yelled again. he always does that. he is not that bad with it in general but sometimes (especially when he gets really angry) he doesn't know how to close a task. &gt;**$drb:** "if you won't send anyone i'll toss every thing in here out of the window! i am sick of nothing working here as it should! i swear i will rip everything apart!" he's always like this so his screaming is easy to ignore. and he swears a lot more but otherwise it wouldn't be sfw. so after confirming that it wasn't something simple as that (the pc won't react even after restarting and unplugging it) i get my toolbox ready and took off. gladly he ist just a few miles away so when i entered his office a few minutes later he seemed to have calmed down a bit. he showed me the pc and i looked at its backside. then i turned on the power switch. and it rebootet just fine and works perfectly normal. when i looked at $drb he just shook his head and thanked me. &gt;**$drb:** "and that was everything? just this?" i nodded and he started laughing, still shaking his head. once i returned i got mail from $drb. &gt;*thanks for fixing my problem. just one question: is it okay to shut the pc down or do you have to come again?* the time i needed to fix the problem: 42 seconds. guess that's a new personal best.user opens ticket annoyed that her computer keeps getting automatically restarted while she want to work... she says this is very limiting to her. sccm allows you to postpone updates, until eventually it forces you to install them (and restarts you computer in 30min, no cancel button) apparently she complained about this in the past and someone showed her how she can limit the updates/reboots to times outside of her business hours. so she set updates to never install from 6am-8pm... only problem: she leaves at 5pm and turns off her pc... every single day... so ofcourse no updates get installed and eventually the computer gets rebooted while shes working... now shes complaining that the setting isnt working... tl;dr: user want the computer to install updates while its turned off. this happened sometime in 1960. the characters: don = me. $mom = my mom. $gfmom = my gf's mom. $gf = my gf at the time. it was a bright saturday morning. i was in the basement rag chewing with some of my friends on 75 meters when my mom called down the stairs: &gt; $mom: "don, $gfmom is on the phone. she wants to talk to you" uhoh. i can think of many reasons for $gfmom to call me, most of them bad. run up the stairs and take the phone. &gt;don: "hello" &gt;$gfmom "hi don" &gt;don: "hi......." &gt;$gfmom "my stove is talking and singing" &gt;don: "what????" &gt;gfmom: "my stove is talking and singing, and $gf said you might know what is going on" whew! &gt;don: "what is it saying?" &gt;$gfmom: "i can't tell. i know its talking and singing, but i can't make out what they are saying". &gt;don: "i'll be over soon" &gt;$gfmom (to $gf): "$gf, why don't you take the t-bird and pickup don?" &gt;$gf to $gfmom (enthusiastically): "sure!" hangs up phone. i figured that this might be a technical issue so i grabbed my toolbox and went outside to wait for t-bird and $gf. got to $gf's house and $gfmom immediately leads me to the kitchen. &gt;$gfmom: "it is only the right-rear burner, and only for a few minutes after i first turn it on. then it stops and doesn't happen again til i turn it off and it cools down". i turned right-rear burner on and sure enough it starts playing music. it was really distorted, but what was coming out of the burner was obviously a commercial jingle. it was a broadcast station. the audio faded out as the burner got hot so i turned it off to let it cool down. asked $gf if she had an am radio, which she did. turned it on and started at the low end of the bc band, comparing each station with the sound from the stove. this was a slow process since we had to wait for the burner to cool every 2 minutes or so. *it didn't bother $gf or me because $gfmom left us alone* ;) kept tuning till i got to 1100 am and we almost got blasted out of the kitchen by audio that was synchronized with the noise coming out of the stove. that signal was **strong**. called the station and the tech there said that they had recently boosted their power from 250w to 10kw. the transmitting towers were just across the parkway from $gf's house. with that amount of power, almost any slightly poor connection could act as a detector for am radio if it had any excuse for an antenna (in this case, the ac power line when the burner was switched on). after the burner cooled down, i unplugged the stove and checked the connections to the right-rear burner. sure enough, one of them was just a little loose. when it warmed up, it tightened up enough to stop the "crystal set emulation". one quarter turn of the loose screw and the talking and singing were silenced. when $gfmom returned i demonstrated the silent stove. she was happy and insisted that i stay for a lasagna dinner. since she was an excellent italian cook, that was an offer i couldn't refuse. tl;dr silenced a talking and singing stove. got to spend unplanned day with $gf, mostly alone. $gfmom said "mangia". don ate a lot of great lasagna. after thought: i later heard that in $gf's neighborhood people had talking bathtub and sink drains, musical light fixtures and singing furniture. i never did find out how they fixed those problems but i'm sure that all of them were "pseudo crystal sets", just like the stove. editing: format.i recently [posted a few old tales about spam issues at my telco]( from the early 00s when i was still working frontline. a huge spike in spam occurred because a single angry employee was able to steal a full list of every single email address we provided and sold it to spammers. he just had to plug in a thumbdrive and accessed our billing database and copied everything, easy as pie. in the wake of the crisis, administrative rules came down demanding that unauthorized staff refrain from plugging in thumbdrives, phones and such to company boxes. of course a security policy enforced by internal it would have been more effective than an administrative 'don't do it', but let's not go crazy. half-measures are the rule not the exception here. people didn't mind much, it made sense and those with reasons to be exempted were easily accommodated. people started charging their cellphones in power outlets instead of usb and everybody moved on. often literally. unionized employees in senior positions stick around for a long time, but both frontline and lower level management have relatively high turnover rates. administrative rules gets twisted over time as their intent and the reasons why they were originally implemented are forgotten through the years as staff rotates. many years later, a new floor director started cracking down on *charging cellphones at work at all*, now calling it **electricity theft**. the cost to charge cellphones is trivial and people regularly use their personal phones for purposes that ultimately benefit the company, like tests, so that looked like pioneering new grounds in the art of being insanely cheap. we've since learned that this happened merely because the new director thought preventing "electricity theft" was the original intent behind the rule. at the time, staff was more than a little unhappy to be told they weren't supposed to charge their phones at work over this misunderstanding though. the notion of "electricity theft" had some employees blowing a fuse and getting into heated arguments. someone who was quitting told hr and the union in a mandatory meeting that it was one of the reasons he felt undervalued as an employee and that the company no longer deserved his services - but that still didn't change anything. awhile later, i was taking an escalation call from an employee trying to troubleshoot a caller id issue. all our business lines have confidential numbers so the usual way to test a customer's caller id is to call them with a cellphone. i made a joke about it during a call that some people took more seriously than i intended. &gt; frontline tech: "so, the customer's caller id wasn't working. like you asked, i tried pushing the service profile to value added services' server again, so i guess now we just need to test it to see if it works." &gt; bytewave - sarcastically: "oh i see! this is a situation where you can't test our caller id fix because you'd need to use your cellphone but your battery is dead and we can't do it with our business lines. we'll have to tell the customer we can't test whether our solution worked, because you're not allowed to charge your phone here anymore, as that would be 'electricity theft'." the frontline tech knew i was kidding and laughed - his phone was fine - but several other escalation techs around my desk turned their heads towards me grinning. i already knew the fix was successful, but i didn't realize my joke would get traction. the frontline tech was amused but may have been the only one to understand i was kidding. he used his phone for the test and confirmed all was well now. but fellow senior staff around me thought i was giving them a loud hint about how to push back against the 'electricity theft' nonsense. they started using every excuse they could to lament on recorded lines that something couldn't be done because there was no way to charge a phone. i was often working remotely at the time and didn't realize that was now a thing. within a few weeks, word had spread far enough that a manager went to see the 'electricity theft' floor director saying it seemed like a major issue that techs couldn't charge their phones anymore because of his strict directive. apparently they discussed various solutions like having some lab test lines switched to open ids specifically for this - but the number of locations we operate in (including contractors) made this a fair bit of trouble and got the floor director to instead escalate the issue to the division's vp who then issued a 'bold directive'... ... nixing the entire policy. the way it was explained to him, it was just about saving a few dollars off power costs and it didn't seem worth it anymore. having completely forgotten it was originally intended for security purposes, he wrote it off. right now everybody is allowed to plug in their phone or a usb stick in their workstation for any reason and could be a few clicks away from copying whatever customer-related information they want. people were happy to be able to charge their phones again and so far nobody misused it, but things like this make me wonder whether the whole company is just secretly recording us for a comedy show. not only was the initial 'fix' utterly insufficient, but they failed to remember it's purpose... and then rolled it back because a few people decided to joke about it. you can't make this stuff up. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!]( i receive at ticket saying the above, but had something i needed to do, so i called afterwards. please note, its around 4:30pm, on a friday afternoon, before easter weekend. i call the landline, which keeps ringing and finally forwards to her cellphone. i hear someone pick up, and there's loud music and the person yelling... &gt;user: hello? i can't hear you &gt;me: hi, this is burncycle from com-it calling about the ticket you submitted a few minutes ago. &gt;user: i really can't hear y...oh, i've left the building already. can i call you back? im on the plane and im about to go under *click* .....i'm sorry, you're about to go under? on a plane? should i call someone? maybe 911?sorry if this isn't strictly tech support, but seeing as it plays a large factor, i thought it was relevant. **background**: i'm still in college. my soon to be husband is graduating ahead of me, and since my credits (oddly) transfer to whatever communication program exists in the world, i'm looking for jobs for both of us somewhere out of the american south. i've worked tech support for my dad's consulting business and all his clients since i was knee high, and while i've never been it, it was what everyone called me. i freelance in social media marketing to help put myself through school, which is about as difficult as you'd think it is (as in not really at all). older, computer illiterate people just don't understand the internet, but can really be getting into a younger market with a little bit of help. i have a rate that turns out at about $15-$20/hr, depending on how much of my help they need. because i work in a lot of really teeny businesses, i often help the owners fix computers and set up their phones on the side. i'm very accustomed to genuinely confused clients and bosses. today, a small marketing firm out of a major new england city called me for a phone interview. everything had been going really well, and i had spoken to them several times. we even had a time set up for an in-person interview in march when i would be in town. the employees i'd dealt with were super nice, and there had been no red flags up to this point. i'd actually become rather close with a specific guy, who i'd talked to and emailed multiple times over the last few weeks, and who i know is a redditor. we'll call him "geoff." i had his extension number, and his personal email address. the person on the other end for the interview was significantly older than anyone else i'd dealt with. he sounded like a late 50's smoker who would have been better suited for a manufacturing plant. he starts giving me scenarios, asking how i'd respond to them. really weird things like, "if one of our clients made cupcakes that killed one out of every three customers, how you would respond to that?" every time, after the second sentence of my response, he cuts me off, saying, "ok, that's enough, sweetheart." after about 20 minutes of this, he suddenly asks, "do you know anything about resetting wireless routers? we really need someone to do that. we just had to fire our it guy because he kept messing up. lying bastard anyway, would always clear his internet history. you don't do that do you? because only liars do that." i spent a couple of seconds in complete silence, wondering what the hell i just heard. i eventually said, "yes, i do know a good bit about networking setups. what seems to be the issue?" he then details how he tried to install this browser tracking and keylogging software on the network, so that he knew his employees weren't liars. he had also installed security cameras so that he could see how much they were taking breaks. i needed to be ok with that. i also helped him install a wireless mouse. now, he was speaking really loud. i had to turn down the volume all the way on my phone, and still had to hold it away from my ear. by now, i was sort of scared that the employees didn't know about any of this. i decided to stall, telling him that was going to have to talk to my fiance and see if the dates lined up for when he first needed me. i obviously wasn't taking the job. he wanted me to start as soon as possible. i got off the phone, and immediately called geoff. i asked him if he'd heard any of that. he confirmed that he had heard everything, and that no one had been aware of what was going on. he'd checked his processes and there it was, a keylogger as well as some other random software installed that dumped everything he'd done during the entire day into a file on his boss's pc. he told me he'd call me back. he had to call a lawyer, then quit. he called me back later, and told me the entire office did just that. 25 people. they're starting their own firm, and have invited me to join once they get on their feet. the owner had died a year or so ago, and this guy had bought the business. his previous job? head of sales for a sofa making company. **tl;dr - big brother is revealed in a phone interview, entire office quits.** **edit** just got a text again from geoff. though he didn't give me any information on how his boss was doing it, apparently he was recording every phone conversation in the place and saving it, without notifying anyone, including the person on the other end. there had also been some discrepancies with pay, with half an hour being taken off somehow, or being made to work an hour longer. apparently, even though most were salaried, he had been docking their checks for every minute spent on non-work-related activities. they're hoping they can sue him just on the phone conversations alone.[*previous tales from dishonest used car dealership*]( &gt;”so, why is it that the red one is so much slower?” mr. ferrari, one of our salespersons, was in my office at dishonest used car dealership, attempting once again to get me to fix something that wasn’t broken. &gt;mf: “i drove both the red one and the grey one over the weekend, and the red one is just sooooooo much slower! there’s no way i can sell it with how slow it is. it’s not even drivable.” he was on a tirade about our vanagons. as you may remember from [the story where one made a jailbreak on me]( we would buy ratted-out rustbox vw vanagons at auto auctions and then spend nearly $10,000 in parts and labor swapping in vw 1.9l turbodiesels into them. this had the side effect of making them even slower, with the benefit of them getting exactly the same sh*tty fuel economy as before. in fact, slow does not even being to describe it. they were positively glacial. &gt;me: “look, you submitted a trouble ticket this morning, i gave both the grey one and the red one a drive, and i can’t tell the difference. they’re both slugs - all of ‘em are.” &gt;mf: “i don’t understand why this is so difficult. it’s pretty clear to me what the problem is. the grey one has a turbo, and the red one doesn’t.” &gt;me: “uh… both have tdi engines in them. they’re both turbocharged. all tdis are turbocharged, that’s what the t in tdi stands for. now if there’s something wrong with the red one, it might not be building boost pressure and it would feel sluggish. i can have a tech troubleshoot it, but we’ll have to bill for it.” &gt;mf: “no, you’re not going to charge us a f*cking thing, because whatever tech put the tdi in the red one just forgot to put the turbo on it, and that’s service’s fault, not sales.” before i had a chance to interrogate the bizarre misconceptions he was operating under, he marched out. now, to people who don’t know cars, turbochargers must seem like magical devices. i suspect people who don’t know how they work think they’re like a lightning bolt sticker or something that you just stick to the side of the engine block. “congratulations, you are now officially turbocharged. this award confers the right to make more power.” they’re actually very simple and clever devices, turbochargers - instead of routing the engine’s exhaust directly out the exhaust pipe, it’s made to spin an impeller first, capturing energy from the exhaust. that impeller spins a compressor, which force-feeds air into the engine’s intake, more air than the engine can otherwise draw on its own. more air means you can inject more fuel and more fuel means more power. but because the turbocharger is mounted directly to the exhaust manifold, between it and the exhaust pipe, it’s not really possible to just “forget” to put it on. there’d be a big hole there. you’d notice. i wrote up a repair order and gave it to lord salisbury, one of the techs, to take a look at. *** &gt;”i say, i’ll be damned if i can tell what he’s on about.” lord salisbury thunked the repair order onto my desk. &gt;ls: “it builds boost pressure just fine. i get 1 bar of pressure at full throttle, right within spec. i put a scope in the manifold - you know those early tdis like to clog up their intake manifolds - but it’s clean enough. near as i can tell, it’s just as slow as those vans ever are, but no slower. i had a run down the interstate with the grey one, and i’ll be damned if i can tell the difference.” &gt;me: “cool, i’ll bill sales for wasting your time.” &gt;ls: “let me know what happens.” lord salisbury wandered back to the bay and i paged mr ferrari, who appeared immediately from the sales office. i tossed him the vanagon key. &gt;me: “give it a drive, tell me what you think.” he took off in the vanagon, only to reappear less than 5 minutes later. &gt;mf: “whatever you did to it, it’s even worse than before! i couldn’t even get on the freeway it’s so slow! this is not acceptable. i don’t get what the problem is here, just quit f*cking around and put a turbo on it!” for f*ck’s sake. i paged lord salisbury and had him bring the grey vanagon around and park it next to the red one. we popped open the engine covers on both. i indicated to the two of them a snail-shaped object buried in the engine bay on the grey one. &gt;me: “lord salisbury, would you agree that this is a turbocharger?” &gt;ls: “i would.” i pointed to the same object on the red one. &gt;me: “and would you agree this also is a turbocharger?” &gt;ls: “indeed.” &gt;me: “so would you agree it is reasonable to say that both of these engines are turbocharged?” &gt;ls: “i would agree.” mr. ferrari did not have a pleasant look on his face. &gt;mf: “i don’t know what the point of this perry mason bullsh!t is, but it’s clear to me you two just don’t want to fix what’s wrong with the red one. get off your lazy asses, put a f#cking turbo on it, and *stop wasting my f#cking time!*” and with that, he stomped back into his office. lord salisbury rolled his eyes and slammed closed the engine covers. we stood out in the lot for a bit trying to figure out our game plan. at a certain point, mr. ferrari would get fed up enough that he would go to rom and the amazon, and the two of them were a whole order of magnitude more insane and unreasonable than he. we stood, surveying the two vehicles for a bit, just thinking about how we were going to solve this nonexistent problem. a moment later, miami vice, my new lackey, stepped out of the office to see what was going on. he was a smart kid and a hard worker, but he didn’t know much about cars. &gt;mv: “what’s going on, guys?” &gt;me: “oh, mr. ferrari is a dipsh!t. he’s got himself all in a tizzy about the red van not being turbocharged or something.” &gt;mv: “well, it isn’t, is it?” lord salisbury and i gave a quizzical look. miami vice explained his reasoning. the moment he said it, it was blindingly obvious. *** &gt;”hey dude, can you get me a quote on a new turbocharger for an early tdi? 2000 jetta ought to work.” i was on the phone with my contact at the old volkswagen dealership i used to work at. he was a grizzled old man who knew these cars inside and out. he was grumpy, irritable, and addicted to pain killers. he was great. &gt;him: ”they’re not cheap. you have one blow on you? you know, it’s usually not the turbo on these, it’s often the vnt vanes sticking or a clogged manifold…” &gt;me: “no, no, i just need a price on a turbo. it’s a long story.” he laughed. he had been around long enough to know what was going on. &gt;him: “looks like with your discount, it’s $550.” &gt;me: “cool. hey, do you have part number 1c0-853-675-agx-2 in stock?” &gt;him: ”looks like i’ve got three. you want it on your weekly delivery, or you want it rushed?” &gt;me: “asap. this afternoon if i can have it.” &gt;him: “you got it. you want that turbocharger on the truck too?” &gt;me: “uh... yeah, i guess, why not?” *** later that afternoon, a white van bearing the vw logo pulled into the driveway. the driver tossed me a box with a turbocharger and a small envelope inside and drove off. i summoned lord salisbury to the red vanagon. &gt;me: “you wanna do the honors, or shall i?” &gt;ls: “oh, i suppose i can muster up the strength to do it.” i handed over the envelope, and from it, lord salisbury pulled out a part. he cleaned off a spot on the lower right of the back of the van, and, with all the gravitas he could muster, placed the part in its new home. he stood back and admired his handiwork. there, on the back of the vanagon shone in all its glory, a little chrome badge that read “turbo”. we had previously stuck a turbo badge on the grey one just as a joke since it was so miserably slow, and now the two matched. this was miami vice’s great insight. the grey one said “turbo”, and it had a turbo. the red one did not say "turbo", ergo it must not have one. brilliant, right? undoubtedly, at some point the lack of a badge on the red one had registered somewhere in mr. ferrari’s primitive lizard brain and now it was, unconsciously at least, tainting his perception of the van’s performance. lord salisbury dusted off his hands and went back to work on his other projects for the remainder of the afternoon. as for me, i summoned mr. ferrari, who appeared in a moment from his office. &gt;me: “i had lord salisbury do a bunch of work to the engine today, including bolting on a brand new turbocharger from volkswagen.” &gt;mf: “oh good, you even got the little badge on there.” good, he noticed. &gt;me: “what i’d like you to do is drive the grey one first, then the red one, and tell me whether you think they drive about the same. sound like a plan?” mr. ferrari climbed into the grey vanagon and went off on his test drive. a half hour later, having driven both, he came into my office, positively beaming. according to him, the red one drove like a brand new car and it was easily the fastest vanagon we had. in fact, he had half the office staff give it a drive and everyone agreed, it was a speed demon by vanagon standards. from then on, we added a turbo badge to every diesel vanagon we built. it was never an issue again. oh, and the repair order? somehow someone accidentally billed sales for a $1200 turbo replacement rather than a $20 badge. lord salisbury somehow got paid 6 hours of labor to stick a badge on the back and an extra tdi turbocharger somehow wound up in inventory, but i don’t know anything about all of that.first call of the day. it's short but good for a chuckle. &gt;person: can you fix my email? mine is pink and the other person's is yellow. mine needs to look like hers. my manager and i took a few turns asking questions to try to narrow it down until we just decided to have them send us a picture. turns out they were using different applications. file this one under pebkac.my local town does a massive new years eve party where they have a massive band stage and get a concert going and fireworks and its a real show. being welsh we know how to drink a lot and being home with parents i went out with a few old mates from school. so there we go i drink a lot and we go to the concert - allowed in and we are there 11.30pm then this small guy comes up to me: $smallguy: “your xzy from school who was awesome with computers right?” $me: “yep who are you again?” $smallguy: “i was in the year bellow you anyway can you do us a massive favour seeing i organised this all and were having a issue with the fireworks…” $me: “whats the issue?” $smallguy: “the computer is not working that control is all - the team cannot get it to start and i thought you could - seeing you did a few cool things - could you get this to work…” i just look at him and think “really, they want me to go to a wet football ground and get a computer to work and take me away from people…” i just said “no i cannot do it…” $smallguy: “but you work for $thecompanyiworkfor right?” $me:”yes, but what that has to do with it?” $smallguy: “ you do work for $companythatorganisestheevent! your obliged to do this work!” i know i cannot do work as i’m drunk as i’m out of office and off call and i just say: $me: “call them i cannot do anything!” this guy just walks of and at midnight i pulled my phone out to record the fireworks and the event and the countdown ends and the small guy comes on stage saying t: “fireworks are delayed because $me and $thecompanyiworkfor are useless and refuse to get this fixed! $me - the smart kid from school is here and he has refused to do anything as he so full of him self…” i just get this abuse thrown at me while i’m recording in front of a few thousand people… we just walked off into a bar and i just emailed the clip to my boss telling him to have a look at it. the fireworks did go off in the end when the guy turned up about a hour later ($smallguy called him after me). i get an email back from my boss the next day thanking me and that he had spoken to the company about it and that he was in disciplinary and i also got a email from one of the top bosses… i been told that they are going to do a personal apology to me and the company in a local news paper and i know from the email thread that they almost lost a contract over that… tldr: i refuse to do work as i was drunk and wouldn’t be insured or anything - me and the company gets called out in front of everyone as useless.. [previous]( two. it takes more then one meeting to plan a christmas party. apparently. i sat down in the executive floor waiting for my fellow christmas party planner to arrive. nice arrived at the office, almost the exact same time i got up to fetch a coffee. &gt;nice: no, don’t go. sorry i’m running a little late. i looked over at the coffee machine, then back to nice. &gt;me: just going to get a err…. &gt;nice: errrr…? i looked into her eyes, they seemed hurt i was trying to leave. &gt;me: no. nothing. &gt;nice: oh good. so next up we need to decide on colors. &gt;me: colors? &gt;nice: for the streamers and balloons. &gt;me: i don’t think they have balloons at a christmas party. i think that's birthdays. &gt;nice: a party…. without balloons? &gt;me: christmas is more crackers and fairy lights. &gt;nice: hahaha, nice try. she smiled wide. i think she thought i was joking. doesn’t matter. balloons are nice right? &gt;me: so, colors? &gt;nice: when i think it i think grey, black. &gt;me: that's depressing. her smile lost some of its edge. i felt bad. the edge was nice. &gt;me: err, maybe whites, and silver? white, black and silver go together right? &gt;nice: grey too! excellent. so what costume are you going to wear? &gt;me: errr… i hadn’t given it a thought, ideally a costume that always holds a mug of coffee though. &gt;nice: i want to color match with you. &gt;me: so, kinda like going together? the thought was interrupted by the new security manager arriving at the meeting room. &gt;hsec: hey airz, i was told since its your year to manage the christmas party, and you where head of security for most of the year, it should be a joint security and it christmas party. &gt;me: errr… &gt;hsec: don’t worry i won’t get in your way, just anything you need, come get me, okay? i thought it was odd, how awfully nice he was being. must be the lack of coffee in the room. &gt;me: oh thanks, hsec. hsec gave me a smile, then turned to look over at nice. &gt;hsec: oh hey nice, you know since we’re organising this together…. &gt;nice: mmm? &gt;hsec: perhaps we should go together? ____________________________ [next](hi again tfts! i am delighted to report that my favorite users to date have made first contact! you can find the original story here: i arrive at my desk tuesday morning and sit at my desk for probably the first time in february; i've been dragged from site to site and am excited to stay in my office and work on some remote administration for a change. i open our ticketing system to get the lay of the land and notice two tickets from this morning. they are from someone named jake working at the same address as the two diesel mechanics who had so impressed me with their eagerness to read manuals on their computers before using them. the tickets are like nothing i have seen before. instead of "it's broken" or "come fix thisnow" or even "someone put porn on my google" i am looking at a block of text (all capital letters, too, but i'll spare you) that reads something like this: computer inventory number xxxx-xxxx-xxxx: computer powers on but does not successfully power on self test. computer at no time reaches windows boot screen. computer instead beeps in a pattern consistent with $mobo user guide's description of a ram hardware failure. need technician to confirm and/or replace. i am floored by this ticket. as i am reading the second one a third pops up. since i am the only person in our office right now, i lock up and drive across town to the garage. on arriving, i find my way back to the room where i left the greasemonkies previously and let myself in. inside, a kid of maybe 20 is seated at a laptop with a greasemonkey at each shoulder. they are both holding notepads and barking orders at the kid, who i presume is jake. my two favorite users positively beam and greet me in turn. one of them turns to the typist and tells him to get his ass back in the garage. he scoops his hat off the desk and scurries out of the office looking a bit traumatized. they have 4 machines with problems. one they have diagnosed with hardware issues and the other 3 are having problems with product keys or misconfigured software. i am impressed by their work but i am curious as to how they figured out some of these issues; i inquire into this and they tell me that jake had told them about something called "internet search engines". on discovering that navigating the internet required the use of a keyboard, they had forced jake to do all of their searches (this had apparently started on friday of the previous week), ticketing, and emails. they successfully figured out using some kind of latent google-fu that the motherboard was the part that was beeping and that it had a manual that spelled out exactly what its complaint was. they then debugged every single problem to the best of their ability and started submitting tickets first thing this morning. i was very impressed. i boxed up the problematic machines and told them to expect replacements later that day. i drove them back and dropped them at the it workshop to be fixed up and placed an order for 4 *new* machines to be sent back. the head tech and i agreed it was time for us to treat these guys, so the tech office started a pool and bought them a fairly nice bottle of whiskey to be delivered with the laptops. when i dropped everything off, they were delighted. they told me i should bring my fellow techies over on friday after work to drink and talk shop. and for probably the first time in my life i am looking forward to spending time with my users. tl;dr: somewhere far, far away, a kid looks over his shoulder before pulling out his smartphone.[previous]( why do all good offices get ruined eventually? a new ticket review system had recently been set up. it allowed users to give feedback on completed tickets. it was tedious. i sat down at my computer. the business consultant walked into the office. &gt;con: so we need to go over the reviews for the last few days. i looked down at the list of reviews, i couldn’t think of a worse way to spend an afternoon. &gt;me: yes, i’ve already taken a look… the business consultant started smiling. it was weird. &gt;con: oh, but you haven’t been through it with me yet. &gt;me: alas, i have been without your valuable insights, perhaps you read through these, and i’ll go fix some …. equipment… then we can pool our thoughts at the end. &gt;con: what needs fixing? coffee wasn’t around for ideas. &gt;me: errrr…. &gt;con: plus we never get any alone time, it’ll be good to go through this together. &gt;me: oh! i need to wash out that smelling laptop… &gt;con: hahaha, hardly urgent. okay open up the first review. i stared down at the computer, finger hovering over the enter key. might as well get this over with. *click* &gt;**hey it, i loved the promptness. everything was back-up in under 15 minutes. thanks again — finance secretary** &gt;me: seems…positive. &gt;con: oh my, looks like someone loves it. not much we can get outta that one. next. *click* &gt;**thanks again for the loaner laptop, this one didn’t smell. i hear you got a bad one in the batch now. :( still keep up the good work. — sales rep** i stared at the screen, what was happening? &gt;con: another, positive review good god airz, and here i thought i was the only one here that liked you. &gt;me: sorry… what? &gt;con: er….next! *click* &gt;**i give you 8/10. everything was done as expected. — analyst** three good reviews in a row. &gt;con: eight out of ten. yes. write that down somewhere. room for improvement it seems. &gt;me: yes. eight out of ten. *click* i started reading the first line of the review, it was glowing. i was interrupted from going further by the business consultant. &gt;con: i think that’s probably enough for today. don’t want to stop you from the laptop. i smiled, without coffee around. it felt good. &gt;me: oh its hardly urgent…. &gt;con: no, no i think perhaps this needs some tweaking. tweaking. dangerous word. very dangerous indeed. [next](a end-user who read too many things online about new technologies to extend battery life convinced himself that there were already working phones on the market that *did not need to be recharged at all* and insisted so much they convinced one of our salesmen out in the field. salesman then called tech support frontline asking about that technology and which brand of our magic phones we should sell him. as tech senior staff i get escalations from frontline employees who do not know what to answer. all too often, incredibly silly stuff gets to my desk, but that day, i wasn't being called about magic batteries, just listening to the call for mandatory evaluation as the salesman *complained to management after being told we had no magic batteries* ... about a minute into that call... &gt; auggie - the frontline tech: "no, i assure you, we're not currently selling any phones that do not need to be recharged, and though some experiments are in progress and documented on the internet about leeching from the radio frequency spectrum to extend battery life, no such device is commercialized anywhere. your customer got worked up over something that basically doesn't exist yet - but i can tell you which of our high-end smartphones have the longest battery life?" &gt; salesman: "no, no, the customer showed me all about it online on his phone, we have phones now that don't need to be charged anymore! maybe we're not selling them ourselves, but they're out there. if you don't know about it, please escalate immediately, i'll hold." frontline's purpose is precisely to ensure that escalation staff has to handle the least amount of frivolous calls as possible. they're there to filter the insanity, and though they sometimes fail to, i liked auggie's reponse a lot. &gt; auggie: "no. i'm sorry but i have enough relevant information and knowledge already on this topic. i'm paid precisely so that i filter calls where no additional input is needed, so that their much smaller department doesn't have to spend time on trivial issues, so i would be not doing my job. what your customer wants isn't commercially available. since i'm 100% sure of that, i will not escalate." &gt; salesman: "give me your supervisor's name and phone number, now!" auggie gave him that information as he was supposed to - but then the salesman still insisted to hear from tsss, so he very politely hung up. superb work. i looked at other logs and confirmed he had no issue escalating real issues to us, he just knew this one wasn't worth our time and said no. when his supervisor got a call from the salesman a minute later, the supervisor also confirmed it was proper policy to refuse to escalate if a tech is certain he knows the right answer already and then did what they have to do per procedure anytime someone complains about something technical - have my department listen to the call. that's why i was listening to this whole thing. frankly, i love it when everything went just right despite a complaint and everyone followed procedure like this, it takes my mind off all the times things get screwed up spectacularly. since the salesman who was easily convinced magic batteries are available wasn't tech staff, let's say that part doesn't count. but what about the meat of the story, the issue of magic batteries that do not need to be recharged? well, it's not wholly made up. there's a lot of money being spent to extend battery life and it doesn't just boil down to packing in more mahs and making displays more power-efficient. these are the ways devices *currently* maximize battery life, but there really are some serious research efforts out there aiming for better solutions. such as [a kickstarter for a phone case]( which harvests lost power back from the device's radio frequency emission to give a limited boost to battery life. for a few years there have been [studies and experiments about wirelessly harvesting power from the rf spectrum at large and other sources]( to reduce - and some hopeful say eventually eliminate - the need for manual battery recharge on efficient low-usage devices. [energy harvesting in general]( is fun to read about. but it's nothing practical when it comes to mobile phones right now. there may well come a day when we can commercially sell phones that only have to be recharged if you used the screen extensively thanks to these efforts. but today is not that day. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!]( yesterday afternoon i received a call from my former boss. my company was recently purchased by a larger company and he decided to stay with the part of the company that wasn't part of the purchase. we have a tsa in place, so i get calls from time to time to help out. when they built out their network, they did their best to mirror what was in place before, so they bought all the same equipment and configured it pretty much exactly the same. they are trying to setup their new network and he asked if he could take a look at things since they couldn't get authentication to work. it's been going on for two weeks and they just can't figure it out. sure, not a problem. i'm a juniper engineer, but i've dabbled with ad before and i have no problem giving a hand to the guy that hired me for this gig. we go through the configs and everything looks good. i found a couple issues, but once we got those squared away, it should have worked. it was close to cob, so he told me he'd do some testing in the morning and we parted ways. this morning my phone rang and it's my old boss again. "kiltedcajun, we still can't get authentication to work right. can you take a look at this?" we fire up a gotomeeting and he starts logging into the dc through the hypervisor when i notice that the time on the server is the same as the time on his laptop. i also know that the server he's logging into is a timezone away from where he is. i asked him when they moved that server to the home office and he said the hadn't, but wanted to know why i asked. "well, i see that the time is in central time. i thought that server was in the eastern time zone?" &gt;*"yeah, i got tired of being confused about the time zone difference so i just set the clock back an hour."* &gt;"oh, so you just changed the time zone?" &gt;*"nah, i just rolled it back."* &gt;"that's weird... ntp shouldn't allow you to do that." &gt;*"i disabled ntp. it kept fixing the time. every time i'd log in, it would be back to eastern time and it was pissing me off."* i wasn't sure what i should say at this point. i was actually kinda dumbfounded. i calmly explained that kerberos has **very** strict time controls and that when he changed the clock the way he did, he broke everything. &gt;*"that can't be it. the time on the laptop and the server are the same. it's within that 5 minute limit you're talking about."* again, i explain that because he left the server time zone set to eastern and the laptop was set to central, there was actually an hour difference. i told him to re-enable ntp and try again. &gt;*"that's not going to work."* &gt;"please just humor me on this one." ntp gets enabled and he goes to do his test and all i hear come across the phone was... &gt;*"well, i'll be damned... thanks kiltedcajun, i've gotta run."* click. i decided to forgo that other cup of coffee for my blood pressure medicine after this incident, but i thought you guys would get a kick out of it. [read my second story in /r/talesfromtechsupport]( &gt; **help ticket 1ac23812** &gt; i can't enter call data into the customer service page, it just sits there when i click save. i call the user up and get remoted into the users computer, i instantly see the problem. it's happened rather frequently the past week or so, so i instantly close out all of her open browser windows and head to control panel. remove the coupon commander, ask toolbar, yahoo toolbar, aol toolbar, ..... 20 minutes later during a reboot she finally asks... &gt; user: we're those causing all of the issues with call data? &gt; me: yeah, any browser addin can mess with the customer service app. &gt; user: well, how did all that stuff get installed? &gt; me: you had to install them at some point, it's pretty hard for them to get installed without someone approving/accepting the install. &gt; user: well, i never installed that stuff, it must have been on the computer when i got it. i don't respond, not worth the effort to fight with her over this on a short day before a holiday. her computer comes back up, i have her log in and she enters the calls perfectly. &gt; user: thanks, that fixed it, can i show you something else that's wrong? &gt; me: sure, i'm still connected. she opens her downloads and i see a row of ask toolbar installers, 11 copies of the adobe reader installer, various other installers for stuff that she really should not install on her work computer. &gt; user: when i install this, it doesn't work and i am one of those coupon queens, it would be great if you could fix it. &gt; me: ma'am, you have 17 copies of ask toolbar installer, various other apps, where did those come from.... &gt; user: well, it came up and said it would improve my internet experience if i installed it, and the internet is kind of slow sometimes so i thought it would help. &gt; me: so you installed the toolbars? &gt; user: i installed these toolbars, but they improve the internet not slow it down. &gt; me: those toolbars are the things that were causing the problem with the call data, it was preventing you from working. &gt; user: no those improve the internet, not stop it from working. &gt; me: ok, i'm going to make a few more changes to your system. i removed her power user rights, and deleted all her 'internet improving' applications she had downloaded. i sent her the computer use policy to review and resign, highlighting the parts where she is not allowed to install any non-work related applications on company equipment, and i cc'd her boss. *** helpdeskboss instantly replied that his people have to be able to install software, and i shoot him back a copy of the chat log from the remote session. i tell him if he can convince her that installing things that break work related things is bad, she wasn't getting install rights back. he elevated to his boss, and his boss told him to train his staff better. i'm a very calm &amp; reasonable person. i can count on one hand the number of times i've raised my voice in a professional setting, and this was one of them. many years ago, i worked for an msp that supported a large corporate office. my team was responsible for the usual desktop support - hardware issues, software installs, etc. one day i get a ticket that a machine won't boot, so i head on over there to check it out. when i roll up on this desk, i'm greeted with the sight of the pc completely disassembled. and i mean completely - every component is out and spread out (very neatly) on the desk, all the way down to the mb. "what's, um... what's going on?" i had never encountered an end-user tearing down their machine so i wasn't quite sure how to process this. the user looks over and says, "oh good, are you here to put my computer back together? the other guy said he'd send someone." "who's the other guy?" "you know, the new guy. he said he'd fix it for me." i have other tickets piling up, so i figure i'll figure out mystery guy later. i reassemble everything, turn the machine on, and i see right away that it's not booting because someone left a floppy disk in the drive. i pop it out, and everything is fine. after things slow down, i go on a hunt &amp; eventually piece together what happened. another department (outside of it) had hired an engineering student as an intern. he was "good with computers", so they asked him to look at this machine &amp; see if he could fix it. he took it apart "to look for problems" and then couldn't remember how it all went back together, panicked, and called it into the helpdesk as 'machine won't boot'. i'd love to say that he got canned for that, but turns out he was the son of someone important in the company. he tried an internship with engineering, but couldn't keep up so they shifted him over to the business unit rep team (interface between users &amp; it). this was apparently the second machine he had completely dismantled, so i had some rather harsh words with him about where his responsibility ended, which i clearly defined as anything short of physically touching a pc. he was there for another 6 months before he went back to school, where rumor has it he eventually failed out. i still imagine he's out there somewhere, randomly taking machines apart as his first troubleshooting step.[previous]( a good coffee sat on my desk, a smile on my face. it was a good day. i looked down at my to - do list. it said: &gt;**1.plan x-mas party** &gt;**2.end list** so essentially empty. lovely. a knock at the door irrupted my peace. it was the head of security. &gt;hsec: airz, have you got a minute? i looked down at my coffee. i took a sip. tasted like danger. &gt;me: sure, come in hsec. &gt;hsec: hey, is that coffee? &gt;me: yeah. i took another sip. &gt;hsec: could we talk away from it? &gt;me: from, the coffee? &gt;hsec: yeah, we can talk in the break room. &gt;me: but why?! the head of security gave me a worried expression, but reminded silent. &gt;me: fine, lets compromise, ill just finish this cup. i downed the whole coffee. tasted like a mini victory. &gt;hsec: so i was doing my weekly security audit… &gt;me: woah, you do a weekly security audit? &gt;hsec: how else do you know if everything is secure? &gt;me: i had a check list when i was security head. &gt;hsec: oh, a checklist of items? do you still have a copy? i smiled, it was easy to smile with a belly full of coffee. &gt;me: not on paper. i can tell you it though… my checklist was, &gt;**is stuff stolen: yes/no** &gt;hsec: errrrr…. how reactionary. &gt;me: worked for me. the smile felt like fixture on my face. &gt;hsec: anyway on one of my weekly audits i realized i didn’t actually have keys to any of the it rooms. &gt;me: no, you wouldn’t. &gt;hsec: can i get the keys off you? so i can get copies made. my smile left, didn’t even say goodbye. time to get serious. &gt;me: unfortunately due to an incident involving a security member taking home it equipment, security doesn’t have access to it rooms anymore. &gt;hsec: but we need the keys to all the rooms. &gt;me: why? nothing inside those rooms needs securing. &gt;hsec: okay, airz i understand you mistrust security after that incident, but the security guard who stole obviously isn’t still working here. &gt;me: actually…. &gt;hsec: seriously? okay which guard is it, i have to go see human resources. &gt;me: oh no, he’s working down here in it. the stare and silence i managed to receive after that sentence was almost endless. &gt;hsec: so …. are you insane? weird thing was, i didn’t know anymore. __________________________ [next](this is another tale from the late 1950s. let me set the scene. i had a rich uncle (he was a senior partner in a major civil engineering firm) who had an even richer neighbor (played the cello in broadway musicals). the neighbor had one of the original really expensive garage door openers. expensive but very cheaply built. no remote, just honk your horn to open/close the door. his problem was that the door would activate randomly, even in total quiet. my uncle told him that i was "pretty good with electronics" so he called me and offered me $100.00 if i could fix it as it was driving him crazy. that was a small fortune to a teenager in the late 1950's so i hopped on my bicycle and got there as fast as i could. when i got there, i checked out the electronics and found that it used a microphone (obviously), a 1-tube audio amplifier/detector (strange tube iirc, 117 volt filament, a pentode section for amplification and a triode section for detection and relay activation) ending with a sensitive stepper relay up/down/up/down/etc. while i was there, it activated and put the door down. i didn't hear anything so i started thinking about sneak signal paths (power line noise, etc.). i went home, got a pair of high-impedance headphones and my homework and returned. i attached the headphones to the input of the detector and could hear myself making minute noises that were being picked up by the microphone. this was a good sign. whatever was activating the system would be audible in the headphones. i started doing my homework while listening to the headphones. &gt;"idlewild tower this is united 123" *idlewild was the name of the major international airport in new york city; later renamed to jfk. we were nearly under the approach to one of the runways.* up went the garage door. the cable to the microphone was about 1/4 wavelength at 120 megacycles (mhz to the youngsters) right in the middle of the aviation band. back to the bicycle, got a 0.01 uf capacitor and soldering kit. connected the capacitor from the pentode's grid to ground and closed the garage door. finished my homework with no further garage door activations, collected my $100.00 and an lp of the latest play the neighbor was performing in and went home. another happy ending: happy neighbor, proud uncle and much, much richer me.i used to work for a website hosting company. it was actually a call center for 3 (later 4) hosting companies with various names that all were owned by the same company and run in the same datacenter. it's a slow day. i take this call from some guy, and he's super pissed about a ddos that was making traffic to his server screech to a halt. admins were mitigating traffic and getting it under control, it would probably be resolved within 30 minutes or so, but he wanted an instant fix, which i couldn't guarantee. he got pissed off and said he's canceling his hosting account, then hangs up the phone. next call i get... it's the exact same dude. but he called one of the other brands. he didn't recognize my voice, somehow. we had talked literally five, maybe ten minutes prior. obviously he didn't do any research on hosts, and just searched for a rate plan he liked. he rages that he's super pissed with *other brand* and wants to switch to *our main brand* because he's sick of their crappy support and wants help uploading his data to this new account he created. by the end of the call, he told me my service was great and he was really looking forward to working with our support team as he migrated his data. yeah.... same support (even the same agent in this case! lol) same equipment, same datacenter, literally the same everything, except the color scheme in the account management software. i didn't correct him. if he was too dumb to research any of the alternative options he had (and this information was so easy to find) then i didn't pity him at all. i remember stumbling across his account like two or three years later, and there was an email from him thanking us for our amazing service, and switching to that company was the best thing he had ever done. lol... his data maybe moved like 50 feet to another row of servers. and that "new" server his data moved to was older and had lower performance specs.read [part 1] ( here! first off, i love you guys, all you guys :p *** i quickly set the siso app to notify me when the employee changed his status from in office to meeting. then i went in the cold room and got one of the spare laptops, pulled the drive and dropped it into a hdd cradle. a few seconds later i had a blank hard in hand as i was heading up the hallway towards no it land. as i turned the corner i see the employee heading into the developer manager's office, and i see the door close. i look around nonchalantly and see the hallway is empty, so i let myself into the employee's office. i step around to his laptop, push the power button until it powers down, and then whip out the multitool. i flip the laptop over, and i remove two screws, a few seconds later, another flip and i push the power button. i watch as it begins to post, a small grin at the "missing operating system" message, and then i head back to my cave. once i get back to my office, i drop his drive into my hdd cradle, then i start it ghosting it to an image file. i tab around doing a few things while the drive is imaging, and smile at the new mail *ding*, i tab over and find. i got him out of his office for 10 minutes, i couldn't think of anything to keep him out of his office any longer. was that enough time? i start to reply to his message when my phone rings. &gt; me: hello, you got it, how can i help you today? &gt; employee: hey, yeah this is buck, over in development. i came back to my computer and it says missing operating system, that's bad right? &gt; me: yeah, that's bad, what's the tag number on your machine? &gt; buck: 3987, it's a d3ll laptop, we got them about six months ago. did i lose all of my data? &gt; me: well, it sounds like something is wrong with your disk. *i tab over and see that the drive is about halfway done imaging.* i'll come up in a second, let me send this email. &gt; buck: ok, thanks, i'll be here in my office. i tab over to the email reply to developer manager. he has a hardware issue, i'm going up to see what is going on exactly. i grin at that, and head up towards buck's office, the developer manager is at his door with a very pale complexion. &gt; devman: what happened, why does his computer not have an operating system? &gt; me: i don't know, i've not had a chance to look at his laptop. i can give you an update once i've had a chance to look at it. &gt; devman: that man has stuff that has to be completed on time, you better not have done something to cause him to miss a deadline. i don't think i've ever wanted to pimp slap a man and tell him to slow his roll more than at that point. &gt; buck: he didn't do anything to the laptop yet, i just called him. &gt; devman: i know what he does around here, i just want it fixed! buck actually looks more uncomfortable about the situation than i am with developer managers attitude. &gt; me: i'll update you once i look at his laptop, it might be something simple. i'll come by your office *i point down the hall at his door*, and tell you what i find out. developer manager stares at my finger for an uncomfortably long time, then turns away with a huff and heads towards his office. buck and i share a grimace, and he moves aside so i can get at the laptop. i do the once over, checking for thumb drives, disks in the dvd drive, and then i force a reboot and go into cmos. &gt; me: well, it see's the hard drive, and the boot order is set right. &gt; buck: so the drive is just suddenly blank? &gt; me: not sure at this point, i'm going to take it back to our area and test it, i'll give you a call when i have an idea about whats going on with it. when do you normally clock out for the day? &gt; buck: 5pm, then i'm gone until monday. &gt; me: long weekends are nice! &gt; buck: son is getting married, his fiance's parents are paying for most of it, so that means we have to go out of state. i unplug his power adapter, keyboard, mouse and speakers, then stand. &gt; me: well, congratulations, i'll try to get back to you asap. &gt; buck: thanks, to be honest, i'm kind of hoping you don't get it fixed. *laugh* &gt; me: well, i'm found of those multi-grain chips in the vending machine. *laugh* it's probably something simple, i'll call you back shortly, it will either be a quick fix or a few hours of replacement parts. i head out of his office, and turn towards the developer managers office. i knock on the door frame and see another outburst about to come out of him. i decide i've heard enough. &gt; me: wait, don't say a word, or before this is over, what did you say exactly, was it "i'm going to have your head". he doesn't say anything, but i can tell he is thinking wonderfully awful things about me. &gt; me: not a word....i'll have his laptop fixed in about 30-45 mins, well before the time he normally leaves the office. and you feel the need to show your butt like that again after dragging me into a world of lies, then the next meeting with hr won't be about your inability to submit a form. he looks about ready to pop, i give him another finger, the index in a hold on gesture. &gt; me: if you'd submitted the form when you first started this mess, i would have done this while he was at lunch, three hours ago. any stress this is causing you is your fault, and i will not be verbally abused because you are stressed about something. i smile, and turn to leave his office, i figure that one will come back around to bite me but that's fine, won't be the first time he's cried about something i said. *** back at my desk the drive is almost done imaging, so i turn his laptop over and pull the tray to remove the blank drive. i stick a sticky note on it with the word bad drive?/check warranty (007). his drive finishes imaging, and then i mount the image to check it has what appears to be proper file structure, which it does. i plug his drive back into his laptop, replace the cover and turn it on, windows loading screen pops up and i go to the cold room to get a power adapter. on the way back to my office, supervisor comes in with a frown on his face. &gt; supervisor: did you threaten to harm the developer manager? &gt; me: maybe, here you listen to what i said. *i toss him my phone* while he listens i go back the laptop and get the power adapter hooked up, windows has a message up about improper shutdown, and not to do that again. i look through the drive and it seems to be ok, i shutdown the laptop properly and close the lid. &gt; supervisor: did he really say 'i'm going to have your head"? &gt; me: in an email, want to see it? &gt; supervisor: no, just don't stir that pot anymore than you need to ok? &gt; me: *laugh* ok, did you listen to the one prior to that recording? with a deep sigh supervisor hands me the phone, and turns to leave, shaking his head in what i take to be resignation. first things first, i head back to buck's office and offer him a repair hard drive. i let him know that i re-seated the drive and ran chkdsk, it seems to have fixed the issue. he seems happy when the laptop comes up to the windows screen, and even more delighted when he doesn't appear to be missing any files. i remind him to send a help ticket about his hard drive issue, and wish him a safe journey out of state. i go down to the developer manager's office, but the door is closed and i hear some heated conversation coming from inside his office. i decide i will let him know everything is green with an email, and head back to start the investigation. *** i send developer manager an email, letting him know that buck's laptop is repaired and back in his possession. i then drop the 'bad drive' in the cradle and start to image the file to the disk. i go to the cold room and grab the spare laptop missing it's 'bad drive'. back in my office, i am delighted to see that buck did send the help ticket as requested. developer manager's response to my email is a short, and somehow pithy, **thanks**. i close out some help tickets while waiting on the drive to finish imaging, once it is done i plug it into the laptop. windows boots up, i get a machine name conflict, and quickly disable the wlan adapter. i get it plugged into a router to hide it from the rest of the network, but allow me to get to the internet. gotta be able to read reddit while all this crap runs right? i start by scanning his computer for files out of place, we generally look for mp3|wma|mp4|wmv|avi|mpg|jpg|gif|zip|rar|torrent etc.... occasionally you find a huge stash of music on computers, which isn't necessarily a bad thing unless they are clearly downloaded mp3s. it's amazing how many times people claim they ripped a music cd down to a folder named va-now_thats_what_i_call_songs_23-(us_retail)-2015-2loud, it's just said to see a guy set a boat on fire to fix the leak in it while he's headed for a waterfall. sometimes we find things in strange locations....one kid had 100 anime hidden in his 32\drivers\etc folder for some strange reason. i start filling in the check boxes, and getting rather frustrated that this did indeed seem to be a witch hunt. this guy has nothing on his laptop that would be considered improper. program and features is clean, he doesn't even have solitaire installed. i copy his firefox profile over and set it to launch by default, and open up firefox. his browsing history is extremely boring, the only thing i find that's not work related is a tendency to listen to various sermons on youtube. he's got dropbox installed and he's saved his password in his browser, i peek but there is nothing there as well. i open up the training site, and i see he's been spending a ton of time on the training for the next wave of software. but he's a developer, maybe he is reviewing the documentation before it's publish to the customers. i log his internet activity, i attach a report of the past 28 days from the proxy server, and the data report from the firewall. i run a file type report and save it to the investigation form as well, he doesn't have enough media files to break the line on the pie chart. i am really beginning to think this is a waste of time. i open up setup.dev.log, i see he has a nook someplace, i got back to see if i overlooked some ebooks, i find about a dozen. mostly web griffin books, one clancy novel. i add that to the report, i rerun the file type report to include epub files, not enough to change the pie chart. i save a screen shot of usbdeview, it doesn't have anything that screams look at me. i decide to take a break, and head over to supervisors office. &gt; me: hey, i've not found anything worth trouble on his hard drive. there was nothing in the logs before, he seems to be a super boring person as far as his computer use goes. &gt; supervisor: really? well, when you get the job done, let me know and i will take it to developer manager. i do not think he wants to hear how boring this guy is, and i don't want you taking anyones head from them. even if he only seems to use it to hold up his hat sometimes. i laugh and wave as i head out of his office, i run by the software testing guys and replace a fuser in a laser printer, they've been working it pretty heavy printing stuff recently. i get back to my desk and finish up the snoop job. i run recentfileview and save that report, yet another boring list of boring files opened by a boring guy. i finally go back and archive his user folder, his browser profiles, and save a copy of the disk image file. i type up my report in the form, and send it to supervisor for review. i head home and forget it about it to the best of my ability. *** i'm up and about early the next morning, thinking that maybe i got a sharepoke issue figured out. that or i had a very strange nightmare involved workflow loops. i get a call on my way into the office. &gt; me: hey this is me, let me know what this call is about. &gt; supervisor: hey, don't explode on me but i gotta ask. did you do a thorough job on investigating buck's pc? &gt; me: yes.... &gt; supervisor: why do i feel like i'm in physical danger? you aren't in the building yet are you? &gt; me: i wouldn't hurt you, i know you're just doing your job. but yes, i did as much investigation as the job required. the guy is super boring, he has no activity that would cause use to report him for it, to his manager or hr. the worst he had was a bunch of random religious sermons in his browser history. &gt; supervisor: how are religious sermons bad? &gt; me: they aren't. but that's the worst he had. i'm telling you the guy's machine was clean, his web reports are clean, he does have a ton of traffic to the training site, but that may be work related. &gt; supervisor: ok, i'm meeting with developer manager in a few minutes, i just wanted to make sure. &gt; me: alright, talk to you later. i get to the office, and spend a good 20 minutes answering email questions about store membership card spam. no matter how many times you tell them, someone always wants to get their free points to a store they've never been to before. i'm working on a mean green smoothie and watching some reports process when i get a visitor. &gt; devman: i need you to go over that laptop again, you missed something. &gt; me: i didn't miss anything, there was nothing there to find, i can look again but the report will be the same. &gt; devman: ok, then i want access to check it myself. i stand up and grab the laptop, i offer it to him, he looks surprised. &gt; devman: so i can look at his computer to see why he's having trouble meeting deadlines? &gt; me: sure, have at it, i wouldn't get to excited though, it's not exactly his computer at this point. it's a copy of his computer, but it's a clone of what he left with yesterday. &gt; devman: oh, ok, i will give you a call if i need help. &gt; me: you do that, you can login as an administrator to the laptop, and look until the cows come home. you might have trouble connecting to some things on the domain. &gt; devman: i can get to the internet on it tho right? surely he isn't this dumb.... &gt; me: yes, you can get to the internet, but you will have trouble running internal apps or accessing some of the servers. but the internet should work fine. &gt; devman: ok, thanks. he turns to leave and i turn to send an email. this is a notice that developer manager has the cloned machine to do a personal review of the activity of the user. i sent it to supervisor, hr, devman and developer director. i went back to the reports, sending them off to their destinations and wondering why devman had it in for buck. i get curious... i log into the project server, and i run a report on buck's assigned jobs, i don't see a single missed deadline. i don't see any outstanding deadlines either, which is odd. he is the only developer that doesn't have anything upcoming. one of the new hires appears to have inherited part of bucks normal responsibility, and he is missing deadlines pretty consistently. i print this stuff to pdf, and go back to finish up my reports. soon i'm visited by supervisor and hr, who both look a bit nervous standing in my doorway. &gt; me: did one of you spill the milk again? &gt; hr: no, but why did you send that email? &gt; supervisor: yes, are you trying to cause trouble? &gt; me: devman came in and wanted me to look again to find something on his employee, i told him there was nothing to find. he then requested to look himself, and he seemed very interested in getting to the internet on that laptop. &gt; supervisor: surely you don't think he's going to fake up something and get us to find it on another pass? &gt; me: i don't think he's going to fake something up, i'm sure enough that i already put a c note on it. amazing what vegas bookies will accept a bet on these days. birds attacking the side door is going 2:1 today. supervisor laughs, and hr looks more confused. &gt; hr: so, he's going to browse something non work related, get you guys to find it and then....what's he trying to accomplish? i tell them about the project server, and i speculate that he's wanting to get rid of buck for some reason. i point out how the new guy is doing the training data, and how nothing new has been assigned to buck recently. hr tosses up his hands, mumbles something and goes stomping off, leaving supervisor standing in the door mouth agape. &gt; supervisor: seriously? &gt; me: sneaky devman wanting to do a snoop job without the form, on a guy that hasn't missed a single deadline, and who apparently has a brother than eats four whole chickens for lunch. &gt; supervisor: four whole chickens? &gt; me: it's a blues brothers joke, one of the brothers eats plain white toast, while the other brother eats four whole chickens. &gt; supervisor: oh, because he's a boring computer person right? i nod, and go back to my sharepoke workflow, supervisor tells me to keep him informed and heads back to his office. *** read [part 3]( hereit had that odd smell of glue about it, that’s how i knew it was that time of year again. compliance time. &gt;me: seriously though, what is a compliance department? &gt;comliguy: for the hundredth time, we keep the workplace safe. now can we *please* get on with this, just select the sticker you think works best. he’d delivered a lot of stickers. piles of them. i wondered how anyone could even bother making this many different types. &gt;me: why? again. &gt;comliguy: seriously?! look these stickers are going to be placed on everyone’s computer case. warning them that if they’re not a trained technician they should not open the computer. how is this that hard for you to understand? most of the stickers had a big warning exclamation mark. my personal favorite was the sticker that had a skull and cross bones with the warning “potential death”. i’d already tried to select it, but alas it was apparently too shocking. “the right sticker for the right job” i was told. &gt;me: i’ve worked in it for years. very few people ever try and actually *open* a computer. &gt;comliguy: **very few**! so you admit some try. these stickers are for those employees’ safety. &gt;me: couldn’t we just... you know... let them try? compliance department personel seemed oddly attached to the idea of putting stickers on everything. recently they’d placed stickers on all the doors encouraging people to remember that doors are pinch hazards. &gt;comliguy: let them try?! they could get electrocuted. &gt;me: so they’re getting a free lesson in electrical safety! bonus. i could tell the compliance guy was getting increasingly irate about my lack of enthusiasm for the stickers. &gt;comliguy: how can you be so flippant about employee safety? &gt;me: i think i enjoy the enterprising spirit of an untrained employee blindly opening up a computer. &gt;comliguy: you ... like it?! it’s so dangerous. they’re untrained, they’ll probably be doing more damage than they fix. compliance’s eyes scanned the room, i could tell he’d noticed my door did not have a pinch hazard sticker. i’d peeled it off. it was ugly. &gt;me: i’ve an idea. &gt;comliguy: an idea for.... the stickers? clearly stickers were the only thing on this guy’s mind. i started to question his sanity. &gt;me: why don’t we just hire smarter employees? you know, ones that wouldn’t get a hand trapped in a door. or ones that wouldn’t try and pry open a computer when it isn’t working... &gt;comliguy: you don’t have to be dumb for accidents to happen. &gt;me: so the stickers help.... how? compliance guy almost completely lost it. his love for stickers could not take my skepticism. &gt;comliguy: placing stickers over the case will be another barrier of entry for people trying to open them. they’ll read the sticker before breaking it, which would tell them they should be calling it. this will save you time! how are you not getting this? &gt;me: i guess i just find it hard to believe that someone who has gone out of their way to find a screwdriver, take out any screws in the case and attempt to pry it open would be stopped by a sticker. in fact i’m surprised you think people even read the things. &gt;comliguy: we’re just trying to make the workplace safe. we need people to just read the directions. comliguy clearly had enough of me not accepting his one true love. stickers. he grabbed the pile of stickers off my desk and walked to the door. he reached out and gave it a push. the door wasn’t opening. he struggled with it for a few moments. then he gave the door a mighty kick. it swung outwards with great force and rebounded off the wall behind it, hitting him as he made his way out and managing to knock his pile stickers onto the floor. &gt;me: perhaps we need a sticker for that...? don’t open the doors with too much force, no no... don’t kick doors..... or maybe .... rebounding door hazard? i looked over at the compliance guy madly scrambling after the stickers he’d dropped. i began to feel a bit bad. but then i noticed the pinch hazard sticker plastered on my door. he’d stuck it on well.**four texts come in** all texts are from one of my managers. text1: "one of the exam rooms is down. unable to get on the network" text2: "please come look @ exam room

perfectly correct. corporate admin sent round an email stating that the company had an account with a well known ticket provider for national rail services, and we were to use that with the supplied login to book travel tickets and check timetables if required. first call of the day: &gt;customer: i need adding to the adult content group on the web filter. &gt;me: why? *it wasn't an unusual request as some services had access for reasons* &gt;customer: i'm trying to access a website and it states that it's blocked for adult content. &gt;me: what's the site address and i'll check. if it is incorrectly classified, i'll raise a ticket for this and we'll get it sorted. *i had access to all sites for this purpose* &gt;customer: www dot new train ticketing website.com &gt;me: are you sure? i remote to his machine, and he is correct. his browser is displaying the "blocked for category adult content". i check the site out on my machine, and there is no adult content. i then log the call and raise it with the supplier. before they've had an opportunity to look at it, there are 20 more calls for this. same site, same issue. it manager won't allow access to the adult content filter to everyone, because obvious reasons. finally, we get a resolution form the suppliers. they are unable to whitelist the site, no explanation other than it's a technical issue and not a policy issue, so it stays blocked. one can only suspect the level of adult content that is inherent in a train timetable.**previously on patches 765 crazy tales:** [one column... just one...!]( ah, another saga from my past. so, here i am... three inches of hard copy bug reports, and i noticed there was one coming up again and again. one regional office was complaining that a sales report was taking 45 minutes to run. this was originally designed to run at close, so run time was never an issue. however, during sales pushes, upper management asked for hourly updates - which would lock the pos while this report ran. i asked $itspaz who have been there for awhile. &gt; $itspaz: the customer is lying. it doesn't take 45 minutes. &gt; $me: oh? how so? &gt; $itspaz: we ran it on the test machine and it only takes 5 minutes. now, for those who know sql, 5 minutes is still ridiculously long for a query. however, why would a customer repeatedly escalate to the director that the queries took 45 minutes? i personally think that customer perception can be warped, but there usually is an issue if the customer is reporting something this specific. so, i decided to take a look at the test machine. (about to date myself big time here). it was a p2-300, 64 meg... totally state of the art. that would be fine, except the regional offices ran 386 with 2 meg... huge difference. i gave the order to dismantle the top of the line machine and turn it into a workstation somewhere. i wanted a test machine that was identical to the regional office. &gt; $itspaz: but the report will run slower! &gt; $me: really? i am shocked. i finally got a legit test machine. another thing i noticed was $itspaz was only testing a single day worth of data, instead of a month aggregate. after the store closed that night, i created an exact duplicate of their system, and ran it on the test machine. 45 minutes... **exactly**. quick review of the code for some reason, it deleted the indexes, and rebuilt them before processing the numbers. there was no legit reason to do this, as indexes were automatically rebuilt any time the system was rebooted. there were some other issues going on in the code (building arrays instead of a properly written select), but nothing i wasn't able to cleanup. the policy of corporate was i had to choose a random store for each software push and wait a week for it to soak before rolling out another version. i "randomly" chose the store that had been complaining about the report the loudest. amazing how that worked. code was pushed out, and ready to be tested. i ran the report remotely on their system before they opened up and knew it would exceed expectations. late morning (when store opens), i called the $manager. &gt; $manager: oh my god! no. i can't run the report right now. i have a line out the door and i can't risk locking up the register for that long. &gt; $me: all right, i understand. i know you don't know me, and my group doesn't exactly have the best reputation with you. when you are ready to test, please call me back **before** you push the button. i would like to be on the phone when it runs. &gt; $manager: ok, but it won't be for awhile. two hours later... i get the call. &gt; $manager: this better not lock up my register for another 45 minutes. &gt; $me: i need you to trust me. push the button. &gt; $manager: all right. here i go... &gt; $manager: &gt;&gt;inaudible squeals&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;sound of printer in background&lt;&lt; she called her director, who called my director, to explain that i managed to get the run time down to **zero**, that is, you push the button, it prints. (this is how any sql based report should run if properly written, in my opinion.) i used that strategy for all of my "test locations", and amazingly turned around corporate opinion about my group in a very short period of time. they even had an expose about me in the company newsletter. that created its own amusing, non-technical-related, stories.$intern opens ticket. $intern sends ticket to server team for work to be done. server team completes work, adds notes, sends it back to $intern. $intern sends it back to server team. server team sends it back to $intern. $intern sends it back to server team. server team sends it back to $intern. $intern closes call. $intern duplicates call. $intern sends to server team. server team collectively has a coronary. server team sends it back to me and team lead. $intern gets talked to. $intern understands now. $intern does it again. halp so, my dad gets a new laptop, no problem, right? he boots it up, usual complaints of windows 8 etc etc dad: hey $mrcoolguy, why is the internet so slow and why does it look different? me: it's because you're using internet explorer. i'll just install chrome. dad: no, don't do that! as soon as you installed chrome on my old one, i noticed how slow internet explorer was! me: yeah, that's because chrome is faster dad: no, chrome just downloads a trojan virus to slow down internet explorer, i'm not installing that! in the end i just installed chrome and used the internet explorer icon for it.short and sweet... i work with around 400 users - but as you all know you usually get around 12 nonstoppers as i call them. "hey %user% , whats up today" deal. 11 are pleasant and just sometimes need confirmation they are doing things correctly (cute and annoying). 1 however is an arse. "do this do that"... he regularly phones and complains that i am not fast enough in sorting issues out, ten minutes after a ticket opens is not fast enough, no toilet for me! he is always deleting files by mistake, trying to send emails around 50mb...give me all permissions i dont need...etc etc..."it stops me doing my job" attitude. so......one day he phones me up in panic mode. "i have sent an email and the person is on leave so won't get it, can you delete it/remove it before he gets back from leave"...you can hear its not just a sensitive email situation where figures or the like have been sent to the wrong person. so i go and see the email he has sent. he is badmouthing his boss and cc's him in the email. "can you get my email back"....no i didnt hear from him after that and got a user delete request from my boss. shame. **edit: i know you can recall emails yourself on exchange, you know this...but he didnt.**i wanted to share this story because the sweet taste of justice. the problem is this is not exactly it related and i don't know if this is the right channel, but we hear about sewing machines, lawsuits and dishonest car shops, so i'll give this a go. this story happened 7-8 years ago and is mainly about by dad. my dad was a great business man, and had build a great company that sold advanced cable, monitoring systems and safety system for large factories, specifically those with highly automated assembly lines. i did tech support for my father during those years and we always talked about large events around the dinner table. so one night my dad looked really puzzled. we didn't really have taboo subjects in my family so i inquired: &gt; $me: hey, what's up? &gt; $dad: i don't really know. i got this lawsuit today, but i can't remember this order or project at all. &gt; $mom: where is it from? **my mom remembers everything!** &gt; $dad: from [pissed off company]. &gt; $mom: i don't remember that either. let's figure it out after dinner. we lived right next to the office, which was just a house out in the country, so they went to work after dinner and i went to my room to fix my computer. now my dad sold his company some years back before this story unfolds to a business friend in a different country, and was rehired as the acting ceo of basically the same company he sold. good money and a good position. at this time my father was 50 years old and at some point he might retire. this move was great because it was easier to leave the company and his employees would still have work security. in total the company was in 4 countries, with one head office, which meant 4 acting ceo's and one to rule them all. some days later my parents found out more about the order and had contacted the company that did the lawsuit to get some more details because they could not remember doing the order at all. and this was a close to 2 digit million dollar order. those were rare and was something you would remember. they requested a copy from the contract they received. when they got the contract it just became weird. my fathers signature was on the contract. no one in my fathers company could remember a thing about this. so my father drafted me into browsing their system for any clue i could find. i collected everything i could from the project and gave it to my father, as i could only find the information but not really understand the significance of it. a week later i came home from school and i could hear my father yelling. loudly. like i have never heard before. i learned some interesting profanities that day and i found out why. they have been piecing through the stuff i found. apparently the ceo's from the other countries thought that the order was really good to get from [pissed of company]. but they also knew that the probability of failing was high. so to protect them selves they made the contract in my fathers name, found a digital copy of my fathers signature and used it on the contract, so he was responsible; without telling him. being my father he would not stand for that sort of abuse. he called his lawyer (a damn good one) and the day after a resignation was sent out. but my father has worked hard to get a lot of agreements from different vendors to make his company the sole distributor of products in his country and these contract were worth millions of dollars each year. and my dad wanted to start a new company and he wanted those contracts. now the law here stated that an employee may not use information from previous workplace to start a new one. an nda is normally in place for 5-10 years. my dad went to court and got the nda nullified. the company location was in a building that my father owned, so he terminated the contract immediately, almost throwing them out in the street. he sent job offers the all the employees to work with him at his new startup, everyone accepted. last i saw the old company they only had one guy working in a lonely office in the city and had lost millions the following years, because my dad took all the contracts and customers. that day he went to court, he came driving home honking, celebrating and flashing his lights when he reached our house. we went out to eat a very nice dinner and then went drinking, dancing and playing dart. i remember some young girls next to us playing darts as well while my father was dancing, asking: &gt; $girls: erhm... do you know him? &gt; $me: yep, that is my dad! (i said proudly) &gt; $girls: awesome! i never knew what happened to [pissed off company] contract, but my gut tells me my dad made a new contract with them that was successful. tl;dr: company uses fraud against dad. its ineffective. dad destroys company and goes drinking! edit: the usual suspects (spelling/grammer) edt 2: there seems to be some confusion as to how the company was structured. the company has offices in 4 countries, and those offices were sort of independent from the others, but shared the same product catalog, with some exceptions. kinda like a franchise. hope that cleared things up.the company that i work at requires documentation for issues as i'm sure the companies/businesses you all work for do as well. when documenting a ticket what do we call these folks? usually either customers, users, or clients depending on where we work, what we do, and who we help right? well i work in a place where the people i help are my co-workers, some higher, some lower but all co-workers none the same. here was a call from a while back... *ring ring...ring ring...* **me -** robot here, don't give me a reason to open the flask on a tuesday morning, what's broken? **luser -** hi. how are you? good? great! so i am trying to access my co-workers mailbox through outlook and it says "folder cannot be expanded" when i try to open it and i need to help them because they are out on pto. **me -** alright. what is the users email address so i can check their permissions on the exchange server? **luser -** what!? **me -** the user you are calling about. the one you need access to their mailbox while they are on pto. **luser -** they aren't a user... **me -** they don't work for *x-company*? **luser -** they do...they just aren't a user. **me -** do they not use our computer systems or network? **luser -** they do but they aren't a user. we drug test when we hire, they don't use. **fuck it all. les the binge drinking commence.**user: i don't have any of my network drives. me: ok, let's start with a reboot. user: (5 seconds later) ok, done, now what? me: you rebooted your machine that fast? user: yeah, it's one of the newer ones, so it's pretty fast. me: sir, computers do not reboot that fast, please start with a reboot so that we can see if that fixes the issue. user: i told you i already did that. me: ok, hang on a second. [at this point i just sent a shutdown over the network] user: what's going on, my computer just turned off. me: the first step of the process is to start with a reboot, and since there seemed to be a problem with the one you just did, i just forced another one just to be sure. user: if that was actually gonna fix it, i would have rebooted it, but i already know that won't do anything. i have had this problem before and there is something you have to do to the server to fix it, there is nothing wrong with my machine. (mind you, we have about 80 servers) me: ok, when the pc comes back up please login. user: (after about minute) fine, whatever, now what? me: are your network drives back now? user: yeah they're there, see i told you, all you had to do was fix the server. thanks, bye. - quick hang up twats, fucking twats everywhere.first time poster; long time lurker. i'm not in it, but i'm "*good with computers*" so i get called over to help a lot of users with computer issues that usually end up being some simple fix. i also see a lot of posts here about these simple fixes and i thought, hey, wouldn't it be cool if there was a vigilante tech support hero who instead of tackling the toughest problems, tackles the easiest? wouldn't it much more interesting to share these simple fix tales of mine if i were cast as a hero? so i bring you a glossed over tale of one such simple fix. in the world of t1 tech support... there is a legend. a vigilante hero. operating outside of it. a man, whose only powers are: turning it off and on again, stating the obvious and "*being good with computers*" he is, the two minute fix &gt;**$user:** "help my emails aren't coming through!!" &gt;**$twominutefix:** "i'll save you!" *whooshes office chair to $user's desk* &gt;**$twominutefix:** "aha! it appears you have set your outlook to filter oldest emails on top, just click here and..... done! your emails are now back!" &gt;**$user:** "oh goodness, thank you two minute fix!" &gt;**$twominutefix:** "my job here is done." *whooshes away on office chair* edit: [bonus comic]( thanks /u/shaezybazey [previous]( the vp looked up from his desk as i opened the door. he gave me a smile. why a smile? i wasn’t happy. &gt;vp: come in airz, sit down! coffee in hand i accepted the seat, i could see the vp’s secretary outside the door, she mouthed “relax “ at me. i tried. &gt;vp: you know why you’re here? i knew, no one down in it had done any tickets for almost a day. i didn’t feel like saying that out loud though. &gt;me: complaints? the vp’s smile got even broader. &gt;vp: yes, many. want to go through them all now? or explain yourself? &gt;me: i err…. i looked down at my coffee, its depths were murky. i looked over at the vp’s secretary, she just looked scared. something felt wrong. &gt;me: i don’t feel that great right now. the vp looked me up and down. i gazed over at the bathroom longingly. &gt;vp: you look alright to me… &gt;me: i feel really sick, i think i’m about to throw up. &gt;vp: no, you’re not sick. we need to get back on topic, the complaints! &gt;me: oh. yes. &gt;vp: well? what do you have to say about them? i looked down at my coffee again, it was swirling. i don’t remember stirring it. &gt;me: i havent… heard what they are. &gt;vp: you don’t sound like you care very much! &gt;me: i feel sick. &gt;vp: you’re. not. sick. okay how about we change tactics a little bit… &gt;me: okay. my head started pounding. &gt;vp: lets look at the current ticket queue, see how big it is. i’d dumped all the tickets from the ghost account into the normal queue, the queue was huge… &gt;vp: normally say… 20 tickets on the open queue on a normal day right? my ears started ringing. &gt;me: yeah, so listen i feel really sick. my ears are now ringing. &gt;vp: that's because everywhere is ringing, what the hell is going on? the vp’s secretary opened the office door. &gt;vpsec: vp, since you asked us to retest all the systems, a fire drill has been initiated. remember you’re the fire marshal, you need to be outside organizing everything. &gt;vp: a fire drill! now? i’m the fire marshal, why wasn’t i told about this? &gt;vpsec: well it wouldn’t be a good drill if you knew it was coming. &gt;vp: call it off. i need to manage this it situation. &gt;vpsec: we can’t turn off a fire drill, mid drill. &gt;vp: yes you can. get the security manager on the phone, get him to call it off. the vp’s secretary gave me a look. i was too busy avoiding puking on the carpet to see what it was. &gt;vpsec: i can’t. remember the phones aren’t working like you said before… i’ll have to run that message down to him. the vp looked angry. mad even. &gt;vp: the phones, are fine! just call him. &gt;vpsec: if they’re fine, why couldn’t we use them to send a message to airz before? &gt;vp: because, he needed to be escorted up here… how are you not … you know what… fine. i’ll deal with this. the vp picked up his office phone, i could hear the rage from my chair. ring. ring. ring. &gt;vp: he’s not f*%$ing answering. &gt;me: its been ten minutes… he’s probably evacuated. &gt;vp: fine! we’re going outside. i looked over at the bathroom, i really wanted some water on my face. &gt;me: i should probably…. &gt;vp: no! you stay in sight. after this is over we’re coming back here and finishing this. [next]( again i am supporting the professors using classroom technology at a large university. a little background: our interfaces on the instructor's podium include an hdmi cable, a vga cable, and an ethernet cable so that you can hook up to the projector and get on the internet if your wi-fi isn't working. a professor calls me and says she is having trouble getting her mac to show on the projector. no problem, we get these calls all the time, she probably just needs an adapter, since apple would never include a common video interface on one of its laptops. me: "are you using a vga or hdmi adapter/dongle?" her: "i don't think i am using an adapter, i've got it hooked up already, its obviously the projector that is broken since i cant see it on the screen." me: "what cable did you use to hook it up without an adapter? how old is the computer?" i am wondering if this is some kind of new mac that i haven't heard of that has an hdmi port her: "oh i used the modem cable, it was the only one that fit" me: "modem cable? what do you mean? there are only three cables on the podium and none of them are..." her, interrupting me: "its the one that looks like it goes in a modem. see i don't really understand all this new technology, that's why i got a mac, it's easier than a computer." she's referring to the ethernet cable as a modem cable and thinks that will carry video to the projector automatically. me: "i see, well unfortunately that's not going to work. you will need an adapter to hook up your mac to the projection system. you can come by our office anytime to pick one up" her: "i don't have time for all that, i have to give this presentation right now. i'll just use the modem cable" me: "good luck!" it concerns me that this woman drives a car on the same road as me alright, i'm not actually it support, but a gatekeeper at night to fund college. few days ago i got the following mail &gt;"due to recent events, companyxx (handles the burglar and fire alarm) is no longer allowed to work in the server rooms unsupervised, please call headofit whenever their employees need to work on blabla" turns out their service guy turned off some of the ac systems in the server rooms because he was "cold". it also turns out that calling the emergency ac guys at 3am on a sunday morning because of critical temperature in the server room isn't exactly cheap. no matter how trivial the solution is. &gt;"have you tried plugging it in" here's the context, i used to work tier 1 tech support in a corporate office, you know, intern stuff. you all also know there's always that one problematic user that no matter what you do, you can't placate. they just exist to make your life difficult. well this time things were different, because you see, it was my last day. we'll pick up from where the ticket begins &gt;luser's ticket: i cant get to $companyintranetsite (no additional info, no screenshots, no error messages, great.) alright sounds like a compatibility issue to me, lets give them a ring and gather more information, you know as in do my job. &gt;yci: hello, im calling regards towards the ticket you put in, are you still experiencing the issue at this time and has anyone followed up with you today? &gt;luser: seriously youre calling me to ask that? how should i know if im still experiencing the issue? did you guys do anything at all before calling to ask me this? &gt;yci: im sorry, its just the other techs aren't at their desk and the ticket hasn't been updated so i figured i'd follow up with you. can you try and reach the site now? &gt;luser: i'm not going to try, i dont have time, just fix it. alright cool, looks like i'm taking a trip to the users workstation to fix it manually, i know the site works i could reach it just fine. &gt;luser: what so you come over here? im busy and you need to fix the issue. why are you here? i didn't want you to come and i dont have time for this. just do your job and go reboot the server that runs this stuff! even i must know more about it than you if even i know it needs a reboot. &gt;yci: im sorry, its just policy, this is how we always resolve issues that we cant close over the phone. thats fine though i'll just go close the ticket, don't worry about it. &gt;luser: so why did you even come over here then if youre going to go to your desk and fix it and just close the ticket? see this is why i told them to stop sending you over, you don't know what youre doing at all. i'll be sure to let your manager know how much of my time you've wasted. &gt;yci: oh, im not fixing the issue, im just closing the ticket. when you email me an apology with my boss cced since you were being rude and threatening me over my following of company policy, then i will. &gt;luser: you can't say that to me. dont you understand im $vaguelyimportantposition? i will see to it youre fired. &gt;yci: dont you understand todays my last day? what'll you do, fire me? i'll see to it someone fixes your computer, it just wont be me. hopefully you cooperate with them. in the mean time, ill be waiting on that apology. i'm really not normally that bad, its just this one user. i've avoided them like the plague since the day i started to the point where i would push tickets to other techs. of course they push them back though because i was the lowest on the totem pole and they wanted to avoid the toxicity. but what ever happened? well i sat back down at my desk knowing that entire encounter was worthless, that user will of course never be reprimanded and that i wasted my time. by the way, the fix they needed was just for me to add the site to the compatibility list, it takes less than 30 seconds and had they not been difficult i wouldve had it done promptly. but for once i got to tell a user to get it together and that was all i've ever wanted. [previous]( tuesday morning. today marks the first day of the security audit, it is a bleak time in it. as it leader, i envision it being free from these oppressive checks. free to fix computers and fix them well. i looked over at the entrance to our department. **embargo the door!** i realise suddenly. being a leader of action, i walk over to lock it’s door. &gt;me: this will keep security out. the rest of the it staff look at me wearily. &gt;solitaire: why ~~are you unfairly burdening us~~ ? &gt;me: security. ~~to raise security to fight the audit~~ &gt;solitaire: ~~embargoing~~ locking the door will just get in our way. &gt;me: ~~we as a department need to be free from the injustice of the security department.~~ security can’t audit us, if they cannot even enter. it was in shock. the department door was always open. change to the long established way of doing things had the department enraged. &gt;redcheer: keeping people physically out is securities job. we just need to stop hackers. right? redcheer looked around the room for support. many were nodding in agreement, i felt the urge to crush this rebellion quickly. i attempted to disarm the it staff with reason. &gt;me: it’s easier to keep people out of our systems if they cannot physically access them. i tried to smile at the it staff, but they seemed to be surrounding me in an unfriendly manner. colourblind put down his tea. it was at that point i realized i had perhaps pushed it too far. &gt;colourblind: no. they could do as much damage from any computer connected to the network then from these ones. the server room is locked. my grasp on the situation seemed out of hand. a knock from the opposite side of the locked door distracted everyone. &gt;headsec: hello? this door seems to be locked… solitaire walked over and unlocked the door for the head of security. who i could oddly only hear in a french accent. &gt;headsec: who locked this door? the room turned to stare at me. i realized it had somehow allied themselves with who i thought was our common enemy (security). &gt;headsec: it’s a fire hazard to lock this door you know? &gt;me: oh. defeat. [next](i work as senior staff at tech support for a big telco, where tech work is neatly divided between multiple departments. being technically able to fix something yourself doesn't mean you're allowed to if it falls outside your department's job description. because too many things are broken, we do skirt those rules on the d/l when we deem it critical, [i've defended that at times]( - and even [wrote tales about it]( - but for routine tasks and problems, we tend to respect the rules. our internal tools are handled by a dedicated internal it department, called systems in my tales. that day our manual provisioning tool - key backup tool given how many issues arise everyday with regular provisioning - was down. i knew it pretty well given i worked on improving some of it's features ten years before when assigned to a different position. it's a lifesaver but it's aging software with a few quirks and sometimes it needs attention. wrote a quick ticket to systems explaining the issue and practically handholding them through it. &gt; bytewave - ticket to systems: manual provisioning is down - all tasks sent by tsss are on indefinite hold. that's usually the task queue crashing, should clear up if you run the script that reschedules tasks. please make a new task to check if it gets processed or not, reboot server if issue persists. i assumed that could be done pretty quickly. awhile later, i get a ticket alert from systems, assumed it was a 'resolution' entry until i saw it was an 'escalation'. **tsss-bytewave, your priority ticket to ticket manager - systems, is0219944, has been escalated to tsss-bytewave.** ... probably a misclick when filing in ticket resolution? no. no it wasn't. minute later i'm on the phone with the ticker manager at systems who handled my ticket. &gt; systems: "yeah, i couldn't do it myself, frontline at systems don't have access to these scripts nor physical access to that server, we need to escalate this whenever this occurs." our internal it has grown so large that it's plagued with an issue that normally only customers have to deal with everywhere. to slash costs, the corporation has reduced internal it to a multilayer department where people taking calls and dealing with tickets are paid to filter out simple issues and escalate real problems to people with reasonable access levels and technical knowledge. basically, management added frontline script-monkeys even internally. &gt; bytewave: "right. but that's not me, i never even worked at systems. i'm from tsss, i deal with the escalated issues of our external customers, not our internal systems'. and i sent you the ticket, so how did it make sense to.." &gt; systems: "you're the listed backup for this system, and unfortunately the three admins who normally take care of it are unavailable. one is on his weekend, one on vacation and one called-in sick. protocol is that the ticket be escalated to the backup, and it's you." .... i was speechless for a second. i'm not formally allowed to do any kind of maintenance on this, yet i'm still somehow listed as a backup admin for the system because i helped with some overdue updates 10 years before. on top of that, it seems sane procedure to send someone from another department his own support ticket back and tell him to try to fix it himself. &gt; systems: "well, i assumed you could do it yourself since you're listed as backup - might still have a valid login to the remote tool too, right? you guys at tech support are union staff, you get away with pretty much anything right, nothing to lose? .. but if you can't, you can send it back and i guess it'll be put on hold until one of the regular admins can deal with it - probably tomorrow." yes, i still remembered that old login and could have broken the rules to fix it myself. we do that kind of thing to keep critical operations running sometimes, but i had a bad feeling here. the whole thing sounded like he knew i could be convinced to do it myself even though he knew i'm supposed not to. felt like i was being pushed to break the rules so they wouldn't have to bother handling a real issue that clearly fell under their department - and that's not how i operate. i don't like to enable terrible policies or be manipulated into someone else's workload, nor setting precedents like this. my tone got a little frostier right the second i decided what to do about this mess. &gt; bytewave: "i'm not allowed to perform this task myself at this time, company and union rules, hence why you've been sent the ticket. i'm afraid the delay you're suggesting is unacceptable, as manual provisioning is rated as critical internal infrastructure, one of the regular admins will look at the issue asap. the service level agreement is 90 minutes tops­." &gt; systems: "well like i said, there's nobody who can do it today." &gt; bytewave: "no, what you said is that one of them was on vacations, and another was sick - hr is not allowed to call either of those. the third, you said, is on his weekend. and therefore qualifies for emergency overtime. i'm writing to hr-logistics and my boss to say a ticket for critical internal infrastructure i'm not allowed to act upon myself has been sent back to me due to lack of critical escalation personnel - at which point they'll simply have to call him in on ot due to the sla. i'm sure he'll take it." &gt; systems: "emergency ot rates are crazy, [that's going to cost like 2 days worth of normal escalation pay] ( you're sure that's worth it? for running a script?" &gt; bytewave: "email's already sent i'm afraid. also asked to be taken off the list as backup escalation for this tool, as it's unfortunately outside my current job description. thank you for your help." &gt; systems: "err... sure." *press send* half an hour later, the single admin eligible for overtime (it was a friday, and he worked sunday to thursday) logged in remotely from his telework station and ran the simple script that i knew would fix the issue with the task queue. everything returned to normal. he was indeed compensated quite ridiculously for such a simple thing, but some situations make me think the company deserve to just pay up. when management hear about this kind of thing and see there are real costs, bad tools or policies actually tend to improve for the long haul. if we just hide the dirt under the carpet, they remain broken forever. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](there are days where i'd rather be wrestling a couple great whites in their natural habitat while an underwater volcano was going off (sequel to sharknado?) this was one of those days... the software we support uses the sql database engine. the installer has a batch file, that runs the sql express installation with the default settings our software requires. at times, it fails due to windows updates, permissions, microsoft sucking, etc. i can walk somebody through an sql install and it's not too painful. as long as they follow my instructions, the manual install doesn't take too much time, but like i said, the prerequisite of this not taking too much time requires the customer to follow my instructions. a remote session failed, so i was not getting into this guy's computer. an hour went by, no progress. **me:** are you sure you don't see that folder in the temp folder? **customer:** oh sorry i closed it. this is pretty much the story of this case. however, the fates were kind to me, as something glorious and slightly majestic happened: he yelled at his son. **customer:** no i don't want you to take that! unplug your computer from the tv! i don't know how you did that. my gears start turning. this kid is probably running an hdmi connection from his computer into the television. this requires him to change the default sound settings and sometimes visual settings. it's a gamble, but i'm bald, and don't have any hair to rip out to ease my pain. i began to engage in small talk. **customer:** sorry about hearing me yell at him **me:** no problem. how old is he? **customer:** he's about 17. he's pretty savvy with windows. you guys play command and conquer red alert? remember tanya? remember how she'd go in a somewhat manly\womaney voice cha chiiiinnnggg??? this happened. **me:** oh. you think he'd be able to help us? **customer:** meh maybe. this is no longer up for debate **me:** may i talk to your son please? **customer:** oh, sure. jake!! come here and talk to the nice tech guy. note we're about an hour and a half into this. i get his son. **me:** hey jake. i need you to follow my instructions exactly as i say them. if you have questions feel free to ask. this should take us about twenty minutes. **jake:** oh okay cool. i was wrong. it took 15 minutes. so, thank you customer's son for being the light at the end of that issue's tunnel. no there was no bacon at the end of that tunnel as i was wanting. but whatever. edit: spelled sharknado wrong. sue me.i work as escalation tech staff at a telco. like everybody else we offer the standard array of telecommunications products, including hardlines, voip and mobile. which of course means we also offer voicemail. &gt; bytewave: "senior line, bytewave, you may send me your ticket" &gt; frontline: "i have the weirdest voicemail tool issue here. customer just had their hardline number ported to mobile. that went fine. but they locked themselves out of their voicemail shortly thereafter by putting the wrong pin four times and the tools to fix it won't work. i tried all the ways i could, still wouldn't work. tried sales' senior staff as they know tricks with the voicemail but no cigar. so i called switchboards and.." &gt; bytewave: "i have to interrupt right there, we at tech support's senior staff should always be your first contact point for escalation per procedure." not to mention sales have less than zero to do with this. &gt; frontline: "i know but your line was soo busy..." there we go. productivity metrics interfering with real work yet again. he saw we had many calls waiting due to a regional outage we were in the process of documenting, so to avoid damaging his statistics by waiting 10 minutes, he started dialing randomly. i hate that, but the pressure management puts on frontline techs to solve 7 issues per hour leads precisely to this tomfoolry. &gt; bytewave: " back to the issue at hand. portability to wireless caused your customer to switch voicemail systems, as you know, were still running a separate one for mobile users until they're merged later this year." yeah, that'll happen. maybe next year at best, but i like to use the official timetables. reminds everybody nothing is ever done on time here. &gt; frontline: "yeah i know! that's why he locked himself out. he wasn't told or didn't hear when we told him his pin would reset to default after portability." ... default pin is unavoidable when switching voicemail systems but... &gt; bytewave: "in that case the issue is resolved, we already know what his pin is and there's no need for our tools. the reason your tool to reset isn't working is because the switch hadn't been processed yet by the billing system, which this unfortunately relies on. we can.." &gt; frontline: "got it, i explain to the customer i'll call him back tomorrow and *then* i'll be able to unlock his voicemail?" &gt; bytewave: "not quite. you ask him not to touch it for 30 minutes and then try again with the default pin." &gt; frontline: "...oh. you want to wait out the lockdown..." at this point i'd have been happier to learn he had never been told that these security lockdowns only last 20 minutes or that the voicemail was using a default pin but clearly he already had all that information. given he tried calling three escalation departments i looked at the timestamps for when his current inbound call got in.. nearly 45 minutes. &gt; bytewave: "actually, try it right now with the default pin please." .... &gt; frontline: "oh! you fixed it!!" .... [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!]( a few years ago i was working tech support in it. my client, a large tugboat and barge company in my state had called in reporting that their head office had just lost power. i told them to let me know when their power is restored so i can check all their servers are online and accessible. a few hours later one of the staff called me and it went like this: me: hi welcome to it company this is t35345 how can i help client: hi this is sarah from tugboatco i was told by management to give you guys a call when our office power was restored? me: no worries, so your office has power now? client: ummm i'm not sure. me: you're not sure if your office has power? client: no i'm not actually sure sorry. me: are there lights on? can you see people working on their computer again? client: hmm i don't know. me: i don't understand, you can or can't see lights on? client: i'm not sure, i'll have to have my manager call you, i'm not too good with the technical stuff me: ok no prob. a few mins later the manager of the tugboatco called and explained that they now have power and he was confused that sarah couldn't tell if they had power as they have a large open plan office with not that many windows, it would have been very dark in there when they didn't have power. tl:dr: sometimes people can't even see if a light is on in front of them. the auditor looked down at me. &gt;audit: hello airz, just doing a quick audit of the department. nothing to worry about. i stare back up at him. i fumble with my hands till they find the coffee mug. i take a sip. tastes like a lie. &gt;audit: oh, coffee. you couldn’t knock me up a quick tea could you? not coffee? i hate him already. &gt;me: i’ll just go get it now. i walk into the break room and the auditor follows. teabag in the cup. &gt;audit: so how many employee’s do you have in the it dept? &gt;me: maybe like 7. &gt;audit: so seven? grab the milk out of the fridge. &gt;me: seven…ish. the auditor chuckled. it was weird to see a chuckle. &gt;audit: don’t you know? &gt;me: to be honest. no. we’ve a half security half computer destroyer walking about does he count? &gt;audit: that’s my nephew. &gt;me: oh… the kettle. i forgot to put on the kettle. [next]( [older stories](i worked blackberry tech support for (major wireless provider) several years ago, right as they were being bought out by (other major wireless provider, we'll call it "spring"). one of the two worst calls i received was regarding that very buy-out. i gave my (overly long) introduction, got the customer's full information (it took approximately 2 minutes of us demanding information before we were allowed to ask what the customer's issue was or we would be disciplined for not following the script), and asked what the problem was. me: "and how may i assist you today, ma'am?" customer: "well first, let me start by saying that i am not at all racist." me: "of course not, ma'am." at this point i'm recounting how the most racist, bigoted things i've ever heard were prefaced by those eleven words. customer: "well you guys just got bought out by spring wireless, right?" me: "we, uh, technically 'merged' with spring, so now we are the same company." customer: "used to be, when someone would call my phone, before ringing they would hear, 'please wait while the (original company) customer is being found." me: "yes..." customer: "well now it says, 'please wait while the spring customer is being found.'...but then it repeats it...in spanish!" me: "yes ma'am, because our customer base is very diverse we find that it is best to reach-" customer: "well i do not want people to think i would ever, ever associate with someone who would speak spanish! i'm not going to support those illegals!" me: "but...it's just a recording." customer: "well you better change the damn recording. i don't want people to think i have anything to do with them!" me: "you don't understand...i do not have the ability to re-record the message that goes out to several million subscribers myself. customer: "you will change the message or i will cancel my account today." me: "okay, ma'am," i responded, exasperated. "but i just don't seem to understand why it is such an issue." customer: "because if those little people want to float over here in those little boats and steal our jobs and ruin our economy then they damn well better learn our language! now you send me to cancellations so i can switch to a company that has some morals!" at this point my supervisor has come over to listen to the call and is doing everything he can not to fall out of his chair laughing. the lady has four phones on her account and is just a few months from the end of her contract--meaning she will still get hit with $800 in cancellation fees because she can't accept the fact that other languages exist. my supervisor comes over and mutes my phone. "let me handle this," he says with a grin. he hits "conference" on the phone. this puts the customer on hold and opens another line. he types in a number that i faintly recognize but just can't place. he hits "conference" again right before the line picks up. the phone is muted from our side, but he has just connected the customer to this other department, who starts to give their intro. i can't believe what i heard. my ballsy supervisor transferred my racist customer to the spanish-speaking helpdesk. edit: "anonymized" company name to "spring" instead of its real name as per reddit rules.while lurking i realised some of you might enjoy this short and (literally) sweet tale. i usually wouldn't warn y'all about formatting because i'm brutal about making it perfect but posting on this new mobile site is confusing as heck, so sorry. (also i'll probably forget to reply to comments because i'm never logged in.) i used to stay with an older woman, and since my new house is near hers, i still visit from time to time. i also help her learn how to use a laptop when i'm free. to give you an idea of how inexperienced she is; i can't show her how to use the backspace button because she was taught to use "delete" and it's too confusing to use both. she's a lovely person and didn't go to school so it's more cute than annoying. today i went over, and she tried showing me a video of her friend in the hospital. she complains that it's always hard to find, and i notice that it's because it's lost amongst a bunch of imessages. being the good samaritan i am, i teach her how to save the video and she's so excited about this that i'm encouraged to help her around her phone. after a bit of gentle instruction, she's able to send text messages by herself, using the greek keyboard instead of making do with using the english one for greek letters. she was so excited that she texted random stuff to all of her grandchildren. the amount of pride she had in herself made me smile, and she said something like "my grandchildren always tried to teach me, but i always thought i couldn't do it." i don't know, that was badly written but i hope you all enjoyed that as much as i did. makes me feel a tad better about the fact that with the degree i'm studying for i'm probably going to spend most of my life dealing with incompetent users. edit: ok so i totally warned everyone that i'd forget about this post but i wasn't expecting so many comments/upvotes and gold. i think i'm gonna have to start logging in to reddit after i post things :p now to enjoy the random stories in the commentsi would imagine most people here have a story similar to mine if you worked with tech/customer support. this one however stood out to me. late in my shift i got a call for an angry elderly customer who demanded to speak to my boss. as standard i screened to call before transferring to "the boss" and this was his story. for several months he had been in contact with my colleague "nora" (danish girl name) but she hadn't responded to his last two emails and he was furious. here is the kicker, we only had ~20 people working there and i knew all of them, none of them had a name even close to nora. the clever ones here already figured this out, but like i said it was late in my shift. i asked him what email he was emailing us from and went to town on our mailing system, nope, no mails from the last two months, actually no mails at all??? i asked him to forward the last reply from "nora" to me so i could identify her, thinking by now it might have been a phishing email. lo and behold, he had been emailing us for quite some time, always being answered by my colleague noreply@[company].dk. i spend the next five minutes calmly (god bless the mute button to stifle laughter) explaining who "nora" really was trying not to hurt his feelings too much.weeks came and went; another month slipped by unnoticed. a new support manager had appeared. young, new and inexperienced, his often rash decision making seemed reminiscent of angie’s vicious and brutal idea of management, though it seemed driven by immaturity rather than vindictiveness. we continued to exist in the knowledge that there was nobody who would be like our first its manager. but, thankfully, nobody like angie either. i had two major projects after angie’s departure. i was in the midst of successfully redeploying the laptops complete with fully working software. however, it became apparent in the days subsequent to her finding out that angie had opened administrative access to ad to the entire helpdesk. as you can well expect, our sparkling and carefully maintained ad structure now had contradictory group policies, login scripts which went nowhere and more phantom accounts and objects than i think we would ever finally sort out. it was if angie had left me a parting gift, a final “fuck you” from the queen of aggression. it’s two-pronged effect seemed unintentional given her ineptitude. but it had encroached on every single user in the company as their login times grew exponentially, together with seemingly random permission sets which denied sometimes even the most basic of privileges. it was getting to be the hottest summer i’ve ever known in britain. i still hadn’t taken time out to wash my mondeo; it’s recent costly repair bill had left a bitter taste in my mouth. the grime that lay affixed to the bonnet and wings seemed an apt punishment for depriving me of yet another wage check. arriving back to the office from a well-earned summer pub lunch, i walked towards the building across the car park. as i passed, a familiar jaguar graced a vip spot in the car park. sleek and shiny, its black finish shone in the midday sun, freshly polished and lovingly detailed. its congeniality seemed marred by the fact that angie had once owned a car like this, her angry face refusing to even make eye contact as she stared over the leather steering wheel. i had finished replacing a dead hard disk in an optiplex and was delivering it to a damsel in distress. particularly, this was one of the sales guys damsels in distress. as i connected the machine back up, he came out of his glass-clad office for a chat. “did you see, your ex manager is back” he grimaced. i knew what he meant; this man had been trained to smile and lie for a living. the news that angie was back seemed unpalatable. “who, angie?” i questioned. “she got sacked, didn’t she?” the sales manager shook his head with a learned look. “people like that don’t get sacked!” he explained. i hung on his every word, as if this was the most important lesson i would ever receiving in my life. “when someone like that is put into a particular position, it’s usually because someone recommended her for it. someone put her there, jon6! if she had done well, the person who recommended her would have gotten a nice pat on the back. but, if she cocks it up, there’s no way they’re going to turf her out. whoever recommended her would have their nuts in a sling for recommending such a dud; nobody would ever take them seriously ever again” he continued “when people like that in such positions of power make a fantastic fuck up like that, they get paid off. they get promoted with a golden handshake just so someone above her can save face with the board! admitting failure isn’t even on the menu!” despising the obvious truth to his words, i had to probe deeper “then, who got the blame for all that then?” “well, bhit of course. he was so close to retirement and he didn’t really make much noise anyway. people forgot he was there. it was either him or you guys, really!” i looked up from over the desk partition. across the cavernous office, i could just about see the familiar twisted frame of angie as she stormed with intent around a small section of desks, her shrill and piercing tone somehow breaking through the human noise, over the sound of printers, phones and chatter. another hapless team of underlings were getting it from her, both barrels. i turned, eager to continue this discourse; however the sales manager had already retreated to his office. he held his phone to his head as he clicked the door closed. as the optiplex spun into life, the windows xp splash screen floated as if to stand testament to the spoils. who had really won here? well, nobody it seems. as i struggled to think for a moral to the story, i was interrupted by the returning damsel. she thanked me for my time turning back to her work, our brief moment of temporary friendship now at an end, politically and autocratically ceased with the completion of my task, the only remaining duty being the closing of the support ticket. **previous** [pt1: a new world order]( ) [pt2: safety first]( [pt3: the it induction from hell]( [pt4: undercurrents]( [pt5: how to make friends and...]( [pt6: marking territories]( [pt7: one friday to rue them all]( [pt8: best laid plans]( [pt9: its one step for man]( [pt10: ...and one step back for its]( [pt11: bring home the solider]( [pt12: who needs minor victories...]( [pt13: dawn of a new nightmare]( [pt14: rules of engagement]( [pt15: bring out your dead]( [pt16: the greatest trick the devil ever pulled...]( [pt17: who's the king?]( [pt18: now that's what i call a sticky situation]( [pt19: throw the dice]( [pt20: cardboard city]( [pt21: the rollout from hell]( [pt22: fallout](  i'm still awaiting permission to retell a story of wifi being an airgap, so i'll tell this one. i'm doing short engagement at a large distributor. a part of the job is to figure out all the important data flows. a core system accepts orders as some form of .csv and sucks it up into a massive sql database. other processes then pull out orders by manufacturer, supplier or warehouse to place orders or ship products. it's an order multiplexer and a day's downtime would be very, very expensive. like hundreds of millions of dollars expensive. this engagement isn't really a security exercise. i'm involved since there's a gap of a few days in my schedule and i'm pretty good at the interviewing and writing stuff. but i can't look at anything without contemplating how to break it. i'm interviewing a systems architect to understand how this monster works. me:"so, i'm an end user and i want to place an order for 10 units of $product. walk me through the process" sa:"an individual location either uses our application or generates their own csv. it gets sent to us through the application or an alternate method" me:"how does the application do it?" sa:" me:"and the alternate methods?" sa:"they can email to a special email address or use sftp. the internal apps and database have no route to the outside world, so we're pretty well sectioned off." me:"and once it's in your system, what happens?" sa:"it's dropped to a folder. a script watches it and it's imported using sql" me:"what kind of filtering or pre-parsing do you use?" sa:"uh, none. if it's not compatible, the scripts reject it and generate an exception" me:"so no preparsing for control characters?" sa:"no." me:"what about spam to that email address?" sa:"if it's not a csv, the script rejects it. the email address isn't obvious. why are you so interested?" me:"well, this is a critical system, right?" sa(chuckling):"oh, yeah" me:"and what if i place or email an order for fifty units of [bobby droptables?]( sa:(looking at me blankly):"uh. hmmm. who would?

&gt;eu: yeah, i am trying to install windows 7 on my computer but i keep getting errors while trying to activate. &gt;kupholder: sadly we do not support personal computers, but if you don't mind me asking, what is the error you are getting? &gt;eu: it says that my product key is not valid and that i may be a victim of software counterfiting. i purchased this key myself. i called microsoft and they informed me that this key is blacklisted and that i need to buy another key. however they do not sell windows 7 keys anymore. only windows 8. &gt;kupholder: where did you purchase your product key? you will need to contact them if microsoft says the key is blacklisted... &gt;eu: well i purchased from a site called windowsproductkeys.com but they never sent a key, so i purchased one from windowskeys.com and they e-mailed me a product key. now both of those sites don't appear to exist... &gt;kupholder: ok, you first will want to reach out to your bank and get a new card because those sites are not valid sites to purchase anything from.. if you still want windows 7 you should go to like a local bestbuy or something.. i strongly advise you to never purchase anything like this again without verifying that the site is a valid merchant.... &gt;eu: ok thanks, i will do that. goodbye. the laughing and crying was so hard my chest hurts... this is why cybersecurity is such a booming field!i've been working at my particular campus for going on four years now and never had anything truly entertaining to report. i've had plenty of clueless end-users and unbelievably disgusting problems to address, but never anything i considered worthy of reporting on this subreddit - until today. for the past month one particular departmental supervisor ($sup) has been complaining about one specific staff computer. the problem was not catastrophic and staff were still able to work, so it was very far down on our list of things to address. the emails sent were as follows: &gt; $sup: hi guys, either there is a ghost living in our staff computer or some wires may be crossed somewhere :). staff reported to me last night that the persistent beeping on the computer is causing numbers to pop up on the screen. thoughts? the regular troubleshooting methods were applied and the staff members were unable to reproduce the problem, so we the it staff) chalked it up to user error and moved on with our lives. although, the problem seemed to crop up at random points and the "ghost of the staff computer" became a running joke. after a few more phone calls that led nowhere, today i received the following email: &gt; $sup: it appears the ghost is still living in the staff computer. yesterday afternoon the computer was beeping for quite some time. every time it would beep the numbers 093911 would show up on the screen. i'm hoping this can be solved and is not actually a secret message code we're supposed to translate... finally my director ($dir) comes into my office: &gt;$dir: can you at least go *look* at the computer? this problem just isn't going away. &gt;$me: sure, no problem. &gt;$dir: i'm sure it's nothing, but let me know if you find anything. i go look, and it takes me two seconds to identify the problem. an amazingly old legacy barcode scanner, long and forgotten, was crammed back into the corner behind the desk. this old scanner used to be used to scan in prescription numbers, but has long since been made obsolete by electronic rx modules. it was positioned in just a way that it was occasionally scanning the serial number barcode on the back of the monitor. [proof]( solution: unplugged the scanner. miraculously the problem went away. i was disappointed that i didn't get to perform an exorcism, but i suppose i can take solace in knowing that the "ghost in the computer" jokes will stop.  i used to work at an ad agency referenced [here]( . the agency was in your typical suburban office park. next park over was the emergency operations center for our local electricity utility. ironically, the office park had unreliable power, which is why we had [ups]( at almost every workstation. one morning, i know we're going to have a bad power day when i can hear helicopters coming into and out of the operations center. the sysadmin's not at work yet, so i'm bouncing between powering down servers in a controlled manner and explaining to users that "i know your ups is beeping- it's singing the song of its people". our phone switch goes down hard, since we haven't refreshed the ups battery. (we had diverted the funds to purchase the latest powerbooks for the senior staff). one particularly dense junior account executive calls me over to her cube. her:"when are we going to have power back?- i have a very important call at 10am" me:"i really don't know. i'd recommend making the call on your cell phone" her:"this isn't acceptable. we pay you and you can't even keep the lights on" me (pointing out the window to the operations center):"they're clearly scrambling over there at $local_utility. five minutes after power comes back, the phones will be working". her:"stop making excuses." me:"ok. does it look like i have a hard hat?" her:"it's just technology, make it work". actually, her comment inspired me. i went to the art department, pulled a recently refreshed heavy duty ups attached to a workstation... and connected it to the coffee maker. this happened a few months ago. i wrote, and support a surgical audit system. so all the users are doctors. one part of the system lets them up load documents or pictures (ppt, pptx, doc, docx, pdf and jpg). so i get a call from an irate surgeon who is complaining that he desperately needs to upload some images but the system won't let him. i take a quick look and see that he's trying to upload bitmap files (bmp) and not jpegs (jpg). &gt; ah! i said. i can see the problem. you need to save your files as jpg and not bmp then the system will take them. an oversight on our part. i didn't think that people would want to use bmp files so didn't cater for it. i'll write a fix and upload it during the next maintenance update surgeon thanks me and i closed the call. 30 minutes later, phone rang. &gt;i've changed them all to jpg files and uploaded them but the won't display! fix this shit! so i logged onto the database and took a look. yup. there was binary data in the blob. the file extensions were jpg, the tags and filenames look ok. but they wouldn't display. then i looked closer at the blob. specifically, at the first 2 bytes. they were bm. i rang surgeon back and asked how he'd gotten the files into .jpg format. &gt; oh i just right clicked on the files and renamed the extension from .bmp to .jpg *headdesk* &gt; it doesn't work that way. to put it into medical terms that's like grabbing a bottle of viagra, crossing out viagra and writing morphine on the bottle and expecting it to relieve pain. it won't work. all you'll get is a patient, in pain, with a hard-on. then i told him how to open the files in paint, save as jpg and upload them. problem solved. [previous]( &gt;defiant: i want do a ticket by myself. &gt;me: you’ve done a few by yourself already. &gt;defiant: no i mean, 100% by myself. defiant looked at the ticket queue, to select his ticket. i was happy he was so keen on working. i went to get coffee. ***** a ten minutes later i walked back into the office. defiant was sitting back in his chair happily. &gt;defiant: i’ve already finished three tickets! &gt;me: oh… i was surprised he’d completed them so quickly. i thought he was just selecting which ones he wanted to do. &gt;defiant: i’ve done a password reset. defiant clicked on the email. the reply was very short. **email** - here is your new password; *$@v3.m3*. please change it asap. —it. &gt;me: how… efficient. i made a mental note to send actual instructions on changing your password to that user. defiant happily clicked on the second ticket he’d completed. **ticket** - *i recently got a new screen. can i trade it in and get a white bordered screen? or could you paint my screens border white? black is very distracting.* - the vp. **reply email** - *stop being stupid. black is fine, its a border.* —it. &gt;me: errr…. &gt;defiant: right?! how stupid is he? thinking we’d paint a screen. my face drained of colour. &gt;me: defiant… who… do you think the vp is? &gt;defiant: does it matter? a silly request is a silly request. the phone on my desk started to ring. &gt;me: oh perfect... i picked up the phone. &gt;vp: what the hell is going **on** in it, airz? &gt;me: err…. apologies. i think a mistake has been made. the vp was furious. defiant sat smugly in my chair, oblivious. &gt;vp: i sent a ticket to get rid of these black bordered screens and what do i get in return? &gt;me: ... defiant had worked out who i was talking to and sat shocked. &gt;defiant: what are you doing? that was the dumbest ticket i’ve ever seen &gt;me: defiant… just.. quiet. okay? &gt;vp: the *rudest* most uppity reply i’ve ever gotten. i only asked if a white screen was possible, and suddenly i’m getting insulted. &gt;me: vp! apologies. it has been having some problems. my mind went into overdrive to find a solution. with a sip of coffee, i found only one. lie. &gt;me: the email client has been, causing problems. it’s scrambling some of emails. we’ll sort it. &gt;vp: scrambling emails? i didn’t feel good lying. everything i said sounded fake. &gt;me: it replaces words with the opposites. and stuff. &gt;vp: oh i see. &gt;me: the email that got *sent* said; “you’re so right, white is good, we’ll sort it." &gt;vp: so i’m getting a white monitor? i agreed and quickly hung up the phone. &gt;me: defiant. find some white paint. you’ve got some painting to do. ***** at that point time i forgot to check that third email. probably not important though. [next]( just had another house moment: "everybody lies". this reminded me of my first user-lie as a pfy working helpdesk. i was making a coffee, when account manager snoozy (he fell asleep at a company event) cornered me. &gt; **snoozy:** "hey fb, my computer is making a ticking sound. can you have a look at it?" &gt; **me:** "oh dear. i am off to a meeting. raise a ticket and someone will check it out." &gt; **snoozy:** "uh. ok." a couple of days later, i am in reception *(the receptionist was cute)* and i get a drive-by from snoozy: &gt; **snoozy:** "hey, fb. it's still ticking." &gt; **me:** "hey, snoozy. raised a ticket yet?" &gt; **snoozy:** "oh yeah. forgot. will do." *** so, weeks later, i get called into boss's office and snoozy is there. both seem cross. &gt; **boss:** "now, fb. snoozy has been greatly inconvenienced by a hard disk failure that you were supposed to sort out weeks ago." &gt; **me:** "did he raise a helpdesk ticket? i asked him to raise a ticket twice. i never saw one." &gt; **snoozy:** *(indignantly)* "i spoke to you twice about it and i was under the impression that you were going to look at it." the expectant look they were both giving me was: "what do you have to say about that?" &gt; **me:** "i can be honest, or polite. unfortunately this situation prevents me from being both." the nod and smile from boss told me i could leave the room. *** **users lie** *** **edit:** thanks to /u/jbranscum for this idea: [&lt;desktop&gt;]( **edit:** thanks to /u/metoxys for doing it in the correct font: [&lt;desktop&gt;](a couple weeks ago, [i told you guys about how you just can't save some people]( today i received much better news. i have a long standing policy with people. if you really want to learn networking, and you've shown to me that you really want to learn this trade, i will make it my mission to help. i will provide the hardware for you to learn on. [when you have racks like this at home, you don't really miss an extra router or switch]( not only that, i will loan you books from my own library to use. i will work up exercises for you to complete. i will do what i can to help you learn, but you have to be willing to do so. about two years ago, i had a guy that worked help desk for one of my customers that was extremely interested in what i do. whenever i was onsite, he'd follow me around like a puppy asking questions. after a while, i asked him why he didn't just get a ccna or something and start doing networking. he obviously had the drive to do it... he told me that his wife was unemployed and stayed home with their autistic son. he just didn't have the extra money to devote to hardware or training. if there was ever a situation where my policy fit, this was it. the next time i went onsite, i brought a cisco 1812 and a 3550 switch with me. i handed him the gear and explained my policy to him. i would help him get certified. i called my buddy jeremy and got him a full course of computer based training to get his ccna. he had full access to my library of books. on a thumb drive, i had copies of all kinds of routing and switching books which i gave him. i moved off that contract not long after this, but me and the guy kept in touch. i sent him exercises every other week for him to do. i designed labs for him. i even shipped him a router that i had intentionally screwed up and told him only to "fix it", starting with logging into it, since i didn't give him the passwords. for about a year, this went on until he stopped responding to emails. i thought that i had lost yet another one... until this morning. [i received this text]( from the guy this morning. &gt;*i just wanted to say thanks. i started my new job at &lt;-!company!-&gt; yesterday as a network engineer making $20k more than before. i have you to thank for that. what is your mailing address? i would like to send you a check for your time and to thank you for everything. you have changed my family's life!* rather than text back, i just called him. he stopped replying to the emails because he felt bad about leaning on me to learn. he felt he had a good start and wanted to continue on his own, so he did. and he did get certified. he got his ccna and ccda. for christmas, i sent him two vouchers for cisco tests, even though we hadn't spoken in a few months. he used those two vouchers back in march and got certified. and yesterday he started his new career in networking at a very large bank. it's an entry level job, but his total package (including benefits) is worth over $20k more than his previous job. it also has excellent insurance that's going to help his son. i could hear in his voice that he was nearly in tears on the phone. i told him to not worry about sending me anything, seeing him succeed was payment enough for me, and at that point he was in tears. now, contrary to what you might think, i didn't post this to toot my own horn or to pat myself on the back. i posted it because there's a lot of us in this sub that have a lot of expertise in what we do. we are the masters of the universe, because if we all decided to quit our jobs tomorrow, the world wouldn't be able to function. who is the assistant marketing director going to call when she opens that .exe file she received from an unknown email address? how else will the cfo get his new surface tablet connected to the vpn? i think all of the senior folks here need to have a similar policy to mine. i issue this challenge: if someone shows you a real interest in what you do, especially if that person is young and willing to learn, make it your mission to help them in any way you can. many of the things that we look at as "common knowledge" probably look like rocket science to people that don't do it everyday. even something like teaching binary/decimal/hexadecimal conversion and subnetting to someone can open a whole new world to them. you're going to fail pretty often. of the 13 different people that i've tried to help and provided hardware to, only 5 of them have gotten a certification, and two of those people never put that cert to use. (although one is now an artist at disney and is amazing...) let's even try to teach users about what we do. i'm not saying that the cfo needs to know what a type 7 lsa is, but he should probably understand why plugging that little netgear switch he picked up online into the wall twice won't give him twice the speed, and will probably break something in the process. (well, not if you actually configured spanning tree correctly the first time.) --------------------------------------- i'm getting a lot of pm's about where people should start if they want to get into networking, or which books i suggest for getting your ccna. start with cisco press books for your ccna. if you want to learn juniper, and i kid you not, the junos for dummies book is invaluable. i have a hard copy close, as well as pdfs of my phone, ipad, and laptop for quick reference. for cisco, here's some authors to keep an eye out for. they are all excellent. todd lammle jeremy cioara wendell odom kevin wallace william tedder if you want to computer based training, jeremy cioara's cbt nuggets series is awesome. he has a great voice and is very excited about what he does, so it makes learning easier. not only that, but if you work for a company that is a cisco partner, there's a metric sh*t-load of free training on the partner portal. for juniper, simply go to juniper.net/fasttrack and you can take a free network fundamentals e-course. if you pass the pre-assessment exam on juniper's site, you get a 50% discount voucher for your certification exam. network companies want you certified and they will provide many different ways for you to learn the trade. and just remember, if doesn't matter if you learn cisco, juniper, hp, brocade, extreme networks, or whatever. routing and switching works the same on all hardware, the only difference is the command line syntax and their own proprietary protocols (i'm looking at you cisco...). routerfreak.com has tons of good resources too. tools, config tips, cheat sheets (these are invaluable), study notes, you name it. ------------------------------------ guys, please don't give me gold for this post. if you're feeling the urge to give something, might i suggest giving to wikipedia. face it, the wiki has saved all of our asses at one time or another. if you don't like wikipedia, try [the electronic frontier foundation]( [child's play]( (a great charity that gives games to sick kids in hospitals), [first]( or [the planetary society]( for every month of gold ($4) you donate to one of those charities, i'll match it. ------------------------------------ more pm's answered, and more questions asked. many people want advice on getting into networking, so [i've made a new post to address those questions.](the building manager was a portly man, he bumbled about the building occasionally fixing problems and generally keeping out of the way, therefore it was some surprise to me that i found myself facing the wheezing mass. &gt;buildmang: the ... lifts.... he tried to puff out an entire sentence, but failed. the building manager slumped into the seat opposite mine and gasped for air. i was mildly concerned for his health. &gt;me: the lifts aren’t working. &gt;buildmang: yes, ... the sound of his lungs battling for air continued for a few moments. having nothing to say to the man, i worked around him. after around ten minutes of silent reflection and recouperation by the giant he finally decided to attempt speaking. &gt;buildmang: you’ve heard nothing from the vp, recently? &gt;me: the vp!? goodness no. the building manager seemed disapointed, i wondered if the vp actually had a friend. i quickly discarded the thought, it was too weird. &gt;buildmang: you’re in management right? &gt;me: head of it. so ... &gt;buildmang: and head of security! &gt;me: not anymore. luckily. the nightmares of my time in security had finally started to fade. i realized how out of the loop the building manager truely was. &gt;buildmang: definitely high management, though. to command two different departments. so i was wondering, did the vp even mention to you our arrangement? &gt;me: no... &gt;buildmang: well, errr... not to put too fine a point on it, but the lifts don’t run themselves. the building manager bluntly rambled on about all the things in the building that didn’t “run themselves”. oddly he kept mentioning things like automatic doors and elevators which i had always assumed did run themselves. &gt;me: ahh, and it’s your job to keep these services running? &gt;buildmang: indeed. the pause lengthened out to eternity. i looked down at the bumbling man with confusion. i couldn’t tell if he was looking for his regular pay or a bit extra. the word bribe spun round in my mind. &gt;me: well if you’d like to head up to accounting... &gt;buildmang: i was thinking more, cash. those accountants love books a little too much. a bribe it was. &gt;me: i think you’re in the wrong department for that kind of thing. perhaps go up to the executive level, someone will point you in the right direction. i could feel my wallet thanking me from my pocket. &gt;buildmang: mmm yes, but that would take time. looking around here at all these heavy computers i can’t help but think it would be a liability not to just sort this out now. &gt;me: so you’re saying the lifts won’t work till i... sort *this* out? &gt;buildmang: the repair of the lifts could take anywhere from a few minutes to weeks. having never been asked for such a blatant bribe before i didn’t know the protocol. naturally i just stared him down like a bull. i silently waited for him to leave. he eventually heaved himself off the chair and ambled to the door. &gt;buildmang: just trying to speed things up. building manager was right, carrying computers up stairwells is dangerous. opening up my email i decided to send a quick message company wide. &gt;due to lack of lifts, it can no longer move computers between floors. all it work will either be fixed on site or postponed until such a time.... i sat back in my chair and wondered who else the vp had agreements with.working as engineer for a large manufacturing group. i discovered the server that controlled all automated sheet metal fabrication equipments was a stand alone, island network and sever that fell outside of our secured data center. upon asking about this, they informed me that the sheet-metal operators were confident they could handle the responsibility of maintaining this island network of sheet metal computerized machines and the server. surprisingly they went years without any issues that affected their production. one day they needed a bit of help so i came in. never before had i actually seen where this server was. under the billing secretary's desk. she said it put off so much heat it kept her warm in their some what drafty shop office. it was connected via a cheap compusa power-strip along with the most stable of electronics: a space heater and the shop microwave. the dell t3xx server was throwing a raid drive fault light. "i see the audible alarm has been disabled" i tried to get a response out of the few people watching me look at this dusty reck. secretary - "oh yeah. it started beeping and wouldn't stop" "did you not think to bring that to someone's attention? how long was it doing that?" secretary - "since october" "so about a month" "of 2012" "this server has been beeping at you for two years" "yep" "and this was no cause for concern" **silence "with all due respect ma'am. you're an idiot" a very old tale from when i provided in-house it at a corporation’s headquarters. it was my first job, over a decade ago. it was an incredibly wasteful place, previously featured a few times. ( [1]( - [2]( - [3]( ) at one point, we needed to purchase some licenses from microsoft for a few different pieces of software. my orders were to purchase a total of over 2000 licenses, which seemed fine given that some of them would be used outside headquarters. until i looked at the specifics at the request. my boss' boss had decided to order tons of copies of nearly everything in their catalog - including licenses for an old os we were almost done phasing out along with the new one and things as out-dated as ms works - along with ms word. at a glance, i could tell half of these would never be used, but he had clearly opted for some sort of package deal. when tacking on the costs of premium support, the final tally was one of the largest bills i ever signed up for. the exact specifics of the package direction wanted had been pointed out to me so really i was just handing down an order, but still. i thought this concluded the business. after all, the software we actually needed to use was already part of the win2k ghosts i used all day long as part of the ongoing migration. we weren't actually purchasing new products, just the rights to use copies we already had and were in the process of updating. and several hundred extras to cover for future growth. sometimes later i get a call from my lovely friend at reception. &gt; emily: "bytewave, your crates just arrived, do i let the delivery people in or you'll pick them up here?" crates? wat. &gt; bytewave: "i don't believe i'm expecting a crates-sized delivery..?" &gt; emily: "from microsoft? your name is on the order." i hurry over with an industrial trolley. i sign the paperwork and bring them back to the depths of it's lair. the shock when i opened them! one was filled with endless copies of brochures explaining the features of each product we had bought. tons and tons of fliers explaining what you can do with visio? powerpoint? basic? yeah, i have a use for that. thankfully at least it wasn't one brochure per license. then the cd crates. for each license or nearly so by my estimation, we were provided with a hard copy. okay, it's the early 00's, which makes it slightly more understandable than it would be nowadays, but i'm still dumbfounded. and they're not in cd cases, but in thick envelopes where they are directly stacked on top of each other in bulk. i looked again at the invoice to make sure i didn't make any mistakes and order hard copies instead of licenses. sure enough in the breakdown of the costs there's a scary line providing for 'physical media costs', but it's really part of the package i was specifically told to get. i figure its an oversight, as we have no use for all that stuff - hell i'm not sure where we're going to store it. i tell my boss who quickly runs it up to see if it was unintended. i'm still assuming i'll be told to ship that back so i'm not sweating too much just yet. my hopes were quickly dashed. &gt; first boss: "i'm afraid it wasn't unintended. they didn't know we'd get this many, but they wanted them just in case. we're keeping them." &gt; bytewave: "... where the hell am i supposed to store this?!" we're on a high floor of the skyscraper with the most expensive square foot in the city, there aren't that many available corners to stash crates in. corners are generally occupied by tons of overpriced printers. even the server room is getting pretty crowded, it's really the only place out of sight i have to store stuff beyond the maintenance closet. there's the 'furnitures' room, but the lady in charge would kill me if i littered there. it had to be spotless at all times, after all, important people need paper too sometimes... &gt; first boss: "well, not here.. you can take them to the tape backup location. and take a dozen or so of each we could actually use and put them in a cd binder, would you? stash that in the server room. oh and while you're at it, bring the tape backups." and here i am soon after, a pfy with a big industrial trolley and heavy crates of utterly useless junk nobody will ever use being slowly pushed through elevators and hallways and carried by company truck to a set of empty offices above a noisy printing floor. i tucked it all in a corner where it's probably still collecting dust to this day. i had a lovely afternoon there digging in these to find the potentially useful disks and slowly filing them into a couple binders. the win2k ones were ultimately buried at the very bottom, under a thick stack of windows me disks. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!]( i just went into a meeting and happened to be sitting next to the help desk guy who had the privelage of taking the ticket. "user reports that she had a squirel in her office and now she is unable to connect to the network. she would like a tech to take a look at her pc to make sure everything is ok with the wires on the back of her pc." made my friday so much betterthis took place a while ago when i lived in sydney with my gramps, he was on holidays with my aunt in brisbane, i worked in hospitality and it was an exceptionally busy friday night where i had been non stop serving booze and fixing pokies(slot machines) for a few hours now, when i get a slight chance to check my phone i noticed my gramps had been calling me non stop for the past 10 minutes and texts me asking to call him as it's an emergency. my old workplace was quite strict on phones, you weren't supposed to have your phone on you and you definitely were not supposed to be calling someone mid shift. so i tell one of the managers that i need to call him as it was urgent, i know i'm already in trouble as they will chew me out for having my phone on me when i get back but he frowns and continues serving people at the bar. i rush downstairs and call my gramps, at this point i should probably mention that brisbane is roughly 900 kilometres from sydney. **the call:** **me:** hello? what's wrong? i'm at work. **gramps:** whenn, tell me, what is the wifi password? **me:** ...what. **gramps:** the wifi password quickly tell me what it is, i bought a laptop and i need to check my emails **at this point i'm pissed that he got me in trouble as it certainly wasn't an emergency.** **me:** oh so you're home? that was early. **gramps:** no no, i'm still in brisbane. **me:** w-what? **gramps:** just tell me the bloody wifi password, i'm in a rush. **me:** so you want the home wifi password. **gramps:** yes! **me:** while you're in brisbane. **gramps:** yes! jesus, what is so hard to understand? i simply hung up on him and dragged myself upstairs awaiting to be chewed out by the manager for having my phone on me and leaving at the busiest time to make a call. my gramps is the least computer literate person i have ever come across, he is a goldmine for tfts.i work as an internal tech support, we deal with our office user’s problems and engineers in the field. i'd just made my first coffee of the working day, around 9:15, when i get a call from $engineer: &gt;$beefytowers: good morning $beefytowers speaking. &gt;$engineer: oh, hi there $beefytowers: i've got a problem. &gt;$beefytowers: how can i help? &gt;$engineer: well it's this pda, in my old age i’m not getting very good with these things. i start to prepare for the inevitable; i can't see the screen, how do i turn it on, my emails won't sync... &gt;$engineer: well my pda won't turn on. &gt;$beefytowers: have you charged it up? &gt;$engineer: well you see, i got up this morning made myself a coffee... i wasn't prepared for a 10 minute monologue of $engineers morning routine. i glazed over waiting for him to get the bit i need to know. &gt;$engineer: ... and i got it out of the microwave and it wasn't my porridge... &gt;$beefytowers: sorry, can you repeat that last part. &gt;$engineer: well i microwaved my pda. i think i need to retire, but my wife won't let me. &gt;$beefytowers: **pardon?!?!** &gt;$engineer: it was only in for a few seconds. as you'd presume, i was not expecting this. &gt;$beefytowers: urm, well, wow. if at all possible can i have the sim number and asset number? &gt;$engineer: well it’s a bit squidgy now, give me a minute. *frantic sounds of what i presume was a variety of kitchen tools prying apart the pda to get to the now buried sim and asset sticker.* &gt;$engineer: i found it lad, it’s a bit lumpy, do you still want the number? &gt;$beefytowers: yeah, i need it so i can transfer your number to this sim. &gt;$engineer: okay, *0123*. please don't tell **anybody** about this. &gt;$beefytowers: don't worry i won't report this to your line manager. i'll have a new pda set up and sent out for tomorrow. &gt;$engineer: thanks ever so much. bye. i set up and sent out a new pda, with a **do not microwave** post-it note. a few days later i got the *faulty* pda and it was definitely lumpy, some might even say it was like set porridge. tl;dr: pda's dont microwave. some years ago, i found myself on the roof of our building at work, early in the evening. technically i'm on the clock, but it's a quiet night at my telco and there's a blood moon event, so some of us decided to just go up there and have a slightly extended union break stargazing. after bypassing a locked door with an override security card we're not really supposed to have, i see the roof for the first time. great view. but we notice the *oddest* thing in a corner. a commercial-grade emitter and a receiver dish facing each other with just a few inches in-between, in a transparent casing to protect them from the weather and eliminate interference, with hardened cables connected to each going back in the building on both ends. i can't fathom a reason for this contraption. in theory that's utterly useless, a simple cable would do the same thing, and we're a cable telco. we chat about it and are all a bit curious, but we don't have an answer so we just relax and do some skygazing as originally planned. next day, i look at the building plans - it's all there in detail for anyone to see amongst the fire drill documents. the contraption is documented and it's actually broadcasting and receiving inches away "over the air" a couple qams, which i look up and notice are reserved for public channels, including cbc. i go downstairs to the office of the tv product director to get the skinny. i skip the part about the stargazing on the clock and tell him i saw this on the plans, wondering if he has an explanation. &gt; tvpd: "oh yeah, that. we only get the full subsidies for broadcasting certain public channels if we do so over the air rather than strictly through a cable network. the rules were written by the crtc at a time most households didn't have cable and they were never updated. once we stopped doing real ota, here and at every headend, we installed a setup like this where we are *technically* broadcasting a couple qams ota and feeding it back inside to the cable network to stay in *technical* compliance." ... moment of silence while i process this. &gt; bytewave: "that's cheating.. beautiful, genius cheating! given how arcane these rules are, perfectly appropriate. it's also a great story, i'll let the rest of senior staff know about this." i walk away not sure if i should be stunned or vaguely in awe. probably both. for clarity, the genius part is that after being ota for a milisecond, the feed the receiver gets goes on to become the source feed we broadcast for these channels. so it's not a matter of being able to pretend we're sending *something* over the air, but very much that any of our customers watching these channels is actually receiving a feed that was briefly ota. that's what made this bizzare solution defensible. after all there's nothing that says for *how long* the signal has to be ota. there's also nothing that required these dishes to be on the roof, at other headends they are all inside, but at my work location, there was a set outside that could be easily re-purposed on the roof with minimal trouble. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](hi, may be not exactly support story, but related. about 6 or 7 years ago, i was searching for a new job. i was somewhat experienced(or so i thought at the time), caring for a small ad forest and unix/linux based web-hosting for 2 years prior. it was december, relatively dry time of the year for job hunting, so one of the positions left on the local market to choose from, was in helpdesk support for some it outsourcing company. they claimed that they are very big, successful and popular company, but i've never heard about them neither before, nor after that. during the interview there was an hr lady in the room and head of it(hoit). hr asked questions first, pretty generic ones like:"why do want to work here?", nothing interesting. so finally it was time for technical part of the interview, hoit asked some easy technical questions at first, but then: &gt; **hoit**: please, name 3 network protocols from microsoft, without which windows xp based network cannot function. &gt; **me**: *wtf is he talking about.. i can name a few protocols developed by ms, but none of them are critical for network to work, at least without any conditions mentioned to be necessary.* &gt; **me**: well... i guess netbios, ldap, even though it's not from ms and.. i don't know, nothing else related comes to mind, and even those aren't really critical for the network. &gt; **hoit**: sorry, but this is an incorrect answer. &gt; **me**: ok, can you give me a correct one? &gt; **hoit**: sure, the answer is: dhcp, dns and icmp &gt; **me**: what?! first of all none of those are developed or belong to ms, and second, none are required for windows network to function, with only slight exception of dns needed for ad to function properly. your answer for your own question is completely wrong. &gt; **hoit**: well... you are correct, but i wanted to hear from you the answer i gave. &gt; **me**: how am i supposed to correctly guess which incorrect answer to the question you are thinking of? &gt; **hoit**: yeah, well.. that will be all for today, we will send you an e-mail with our decision regarding you. about a week later i received an e-mail explaining that my application was declined, reason: underqualified. **tl;dr**: you are correct, but i am right. (credit: /u/alacorn75 )this is one of the more interesting ones around i have witnessed. hope you enjoy! cast: $cl = cheery elderly lady that was my intelligent bar client $hg = hardware guy $me = yours truly &gt;$cl hi! how are you? &gt;$me fine, your self? &gt;$cl better if this piece of sh!t worked for once &gt;$me well, lets see what i can do, first, whats the problem? &gt;$sc my grandson was using my mac and now when ever i try turning it on, it makes a loud noise and doesn't work! crap. boot-loader. &gt;$me well, lets see this tomfoolery clunks a mid-2007 white macbook on the table. yep, it was screeching for its life. also, this macbook felt, oddly lighter... &gt;$me uh, mam, there isn't a battery in this mac. &gt;$cl yeah, my grandson said that i don't need it. double crap, modified. i also went to check that there were ram in the slots. none. hard drive? nothing. &gt;$me mam, there is no ram or hard drive, you can't use your computer without that. &gt;$cl my grandson said i don't need those either. tl;dr: grandson thinks he knows everything. grandson has to pay her for a new computerlong time readers may remember [this old tale, where 'overly honest guy' was let go]( ohg had explained in great detail one of my telco's controversial policies; it's still active today. if you have a problem that requires a service call, you'll likely first be serviced twice by a smelly road tech contractor paid by call. they *usually* get it done, but if your problem isn't obvious and we need to go to your place for a third time, we kick into high gear. this is what ohg referred to as 'getting a good technician'. your issue is escalated to senior staff, we review your history, look at logs of your devices and your node, and set up an 'advanced service call', with recommendations sent to union road techs' escalation for review. then you get union techs from select crack teams sent your way with solid documentation. these guys the best we got and will happily work all day to make sure everything is just perfect - hourly wages. furthermore, when we send out a 'good technician' out, a network tech goes along in case anything network-side is causing part of the issue. there is one caveat. because of the chain of escalation, the required analysis, the fact two escalation teams have to be involved and handpick people for the job, it takes time to set up. also, deep in the countryside, we don't always have union people at hand. sometimes your 'good technician' will be driving for hours to get to your place. so we need a 12-24 hour delay for these, something that some unhappy customers find hard to swallow, as we can normally get someone to their place quicker, sometimes at 3 hours notice. [i wrote tales about how customers sometimes react when asked to wait with services down]( normally, frontline techs manage to convince them the short delay is worth it to ensure the problem is fixed for good. advanced service calls are thorough, with a success rate over 99% and extensive followup. but sometimes a customer just flat out refuses, demanding we get someone out there faster. several weeks ago, a customer in the deep end of nowhere lost tv on a few specific channels for the third time. cable box already replaced and wiring redone according to the contractors' tickets. signal problem on specific qams. we were happy to roll out a union team 2 hours away to get it done right. frontline thoroughly explained why it was worth to wait for the next morning for our team, but customer refused and instead got a same-day contractor. two weeks after that they called again with the same issue, *and the exact same thing happened again*. two weeks ago the customer calls again for the 5th time, same story. despite assurances time was required for proper escalation, they wanted *any* tech asap. the call finally gets escalated to me, late afternoon. &gt; bytewave: "just lie. tell them that due to exceptional circumstances no technician's available today and that he'll have to wait till tomorrow, first thing." i'm on hold for a bit. but after complaining a bit about slow service, customer agreed to next am because it 'couldn't be done that day'. that's what it's come to, having to lie to the customer to fix their problem. ohg would be sad. the high-frequency rf issue causing this problem was fixed the next am. though nobody else had complained about it and our network tools suggested everything was fine, the backup network tech was critical to get it fixed. as any contractor could have noticed had they bypassed the customer's wiring and plugged a cable box at the source. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](hello tfts! short story from back around the holidays. the company i work at makes robots and machine parts. a few months ago we were contacted by a major company to get quotes for satellite parts (which is a lucrative albeit difficult-to-enter market). bosses decided we would produce what we could on current equipment, contract what we couldn't, and fabricate our own high-speed, high-precision cnc lathe to get more production for ourselves. we make cnc anyways, so why not a super high-end one for our own shop? on the day in question we have a mostly-complete lathe that will turn small workpieces with incredible accuracy; the engineers are excited it might cut to tolerances under a few dozen millionths of an inch. however the machine also has very little in the way of failsafes which i am told get added just before final calibration. then, over lunch, something goes horribly wrong. this is the story on our records (we may never be 100% sure). the manager of this facilitybrings his new girlfriend in to impress her with his amazing machine. he leads her past several authorized personnel only signs (no, he is not authorized inside fabrication areas) to the new lathe. discovering the machine is locked out (a lock is in place to stop anyone from turning on power to the machine), he finds a pair of bolt cutters and removes the lock. he then fires up the attached computer and enters a directory named something like benchmarkscriptsdonotuse and launches a program. this program brings the lathe to life and starts it in action; the lathe proceeds to push the compound tool rest into the chuck of the lathe. the manager, now panicking at the sight and sound of the machine cuting itself apart, frantically mashes buttons on the computer before smashing its case with the bolt cutters. the lathe eventually hits too much resistance from cutting itself and the motor driving the chuck catches fire and kicks out. the manager and his girlfriend flee the scene. he later argued that the machine had come to life on its own and that the engineers working on it were responsible. he goes on paid leave while the bosses look into the matter. they reach the obvious conclucion that the engineers and fabricators had followed company policy in securing the machine and that the manager had not only broken a dozen rules but had also engaged in activity that could be considered sabotage. he was fired but i do not know if they actually filed lawsuit. tl;dr: i know why engineers drink.i did my work experience at company x where i worked in the it department so my jobs involved installing anti-virus, fixing phones that employees dropped and making computers for new employees. so one day, one of the actual it guys gets this call saying that someone's monitor just randomly went black. he thinks it will be an easy fix so he decides to take me along. e is employee, it is the actual it guy, m is me. &gt;it: "so, what seems to be the problem?" &gt; &gt;e: "i moved my monitor forwards so i could see it better and it randomly went black" i instantly thinks that a cable has fell out. checks the back and sure enough, the input cable fell out. &gt;m: "the cable fell out. *plugs back in and screen lights up* there you go" &gt; &gt;it: "whoa **m**, *unplugs cable* you cant fix it that quick, you need to talk for about five minutes so they can get you a cup of tea." *five minutes and a cup of tea later* &gt;it: "so **m**, do you think you can fix it?" &gt; &gt;m: "well it seems like a cable has fallen out the back, let me get it for you *plugs back in* all done" &gt; &gt;e: "wow! thanks so much **m**!"tfts! new here. i work for a computer repair company that takes in a ton of strange clients. this client in particular happened this past monday. lets call her farmlady. &gt;fl: "hi, my computer runs really, really slow when i'm on the internet!" &gt;me: "hello, let's see what we find." *plugs unit into monitor and power* while i am plugging this computer in, farmlady talks my ear off on how she loves to play farmville 1 and 2 and also some zoo game on facebook. so much so that she has 3 facebook accounts so she can visit all of them and get more points or whatever. &gt;me: "well, taking a look, right off the bat i see nothing on this computer that may be causing problems. did you get this computer recently? **please note: this computer had no data on it whatsoever. there was still ~1.78 tb free space!!!** &gt;fl: oh, no. i've had this computer for over a year now! how can you tell if it is running defrag? because, i don't think it has done that in a while, maybe that's the problem! &gt;me: well, ma'am, there is nothing to defrag as you have no data on this puppy at all. let's see, show me how you normally use this computer on a daily basis. maybe we can get it to replicate the issue. &gt;fl: *proceeds to open chrome, firefox, and ie. signs into different facebook accounts.......***she uses all. three. browsers. at. the. same. time.** **tl;dr:** when you use chrome, ie, and firefox at the same time, you're gonna have a bad time. edit: i wanted to add a little clarification to this post. 1. she plays 6 instances of farmville on all three browsers at once. 2. the reason the hdd space is relevant is because she kept asking me if she needed to defrag her computer. and was wanting to know how she could tell that if it was running or not. when i told her that she didn't have anything to defrag she was completely baffled. "but i'm on it every day." someone has built and shipped to a user a computer with the hostname set to the local administrator password. ping [local admin password] pinging [local admin password].domain.co.uk [10.248.123.35] with 32 bytes of data: reply from 10.248.123.35: bytes=32 time=&lt;1ms ttl=125 i'm laughing so hard i'm crying. thats the reason i'm crying right? ...right? ^please... ^send ^help edit : i should point out that computer hostnames are like nat1234 - the asset number. the local admin password looks a lot more like de858585::arkedttt123*, this is not an easily missed typo... *its nothing like that, of course. but you get the picture.this happened a very long time ago when i worked for a very large organisation (3rd largest employer on the planet, if that is a clue). i worked for a national group in this organisation and we had offices in every major city in the country. one of the cities had a regional holiday and i had agreed to cover any local calls while the two it support guys took the day off. i was not expecting much other than a few senior managers who had to catch up on work. no calls had come through until about 9am, when a senior member from this remote office telephone number came up. “i’ve been trying to print and nothing is appearing in the printer”, he told me. “not a problem” i said, “i will remote into your machine and check it out myself”. so, i get onto his box and could see that someone had changed his printer to a networked one. “you are not printing locally” “i am sorry” he replied. “you are not printing to your local printer; it has been changed to a printer on the network”. i changed it back to the one on his desk, while i explained . “you are printing to another printer in the country”. “oh” he said and hung up really abruptly. i did not expect that type of rude behaviour from this guy but then he was a pretty high level person and they could get rude. the next call i got was from this young secretary in one of our small offices. i did not get support calls from there very often since it was a small office with only 10 staff. this girl had started about a month before and this was her first job, i think she still lived at home. “hello, is this it support”. she asked. “yes, it is. “my printer has not stopped printing this morning.” i was kind of expecting this call and so i told her not to worry and was about to say i knew where it was coming from when she interrupted me. “it won’t stop printing p-p-porn”, she exclaimed. she had trouble saying the word ‘porn’, as if this was something bad that her parents had told her about. “it is pages and pages about men’s ‘things’ and their problems”. “i am sorry, what is it”, i asked. “men’s parts and them having difficulty with them”. she explained. “erectile dysfunction?” i asked. “i am not explaining this any more!” “there are pictures!” “we have been hacked””. she yelled at me in quick succession. i calmed her down and told that i had stopped the printouts and that we would not be ‘hacked’ again. i guess the fellow in the other city had been trying to print out suggested solutions to his problem from various medical websites and when the first printout had not appeared, he had pressed print several more times. he had tried to print over 25 copies of multiple articles. the secretary left a short while later, stating that she did not feel suitable for this position. it seemed to have really rattled her. edit: wow - front page - thanks. he was not in a medical profession. this stuff was strictly personal. he came in on a holiday to surreptitiously print information of a sensitive nature and read it later. this was back when folks did not have home broadband. i think that he had probably been set up to print to the remote office and then forgot about it (until he remembered). i never chased it up and found out if the local support guys had done this for him. i thought the fellow had suffered enough. the offices were on opposite sides of the country (roughly 50 miles apart). the lass had left after this but i think other things were also affecting it. she was pretty sensitive and did not handle being in a busy office well. closeted schoolgirl to frontline support staff in a busy office is tough for most folks. this probably did not help. i have no idea what the pictures showed. use your imagination. back when i was in high school a couple years ago, i was more or less tech support for most of my teachers. simple stuff, nothing too complicated. this is my favorite story among many to tell from back then. the bell had just rung. i walked into class and sat down, like any other day. after everyone had arrived and gotten situated, my teacher walked to the front of the room to get class started. she went to turn on the projector so she could display the powerpoint with the material that she would be lecturing on. class had continued on for about 10 minutes or so, when all of a sudden the powerpoint was gone. the projector had shut off by itself for some reason. my teacher, not skipping a beat, looked up at it, with a determined look on her face; "don't worry, i know how to fix this." she took an empty chair, putting it right under the projector, and stood up on it. after taking a deep breath, she placed her face against the vent on the back, and blew with all her might. her face was turning red from how hard she was blowing. the class was utterly horrified. i did my best to contain my laughter, managing to let out the words, "ma'am, please don't put your mouth on the projector." she turned her head and gave me this sincerely confused look. "this is what the tech support guys did the last time i called them in here to fix this." these guys were being paid a salary for this. i sighed and asked her politely to get down, and she complied. i tried to think of what to do to troubleshoot the problem. it was pretty obvious to me what it probably was, but i wanted to confirm by hunch. i turned the projector back on, leaving it for a couple minutes, and sure enough, after a while an error message popped up: "check airflow". it was overheating. naturally, to prevent damage to itself after passing a certain temperature threshold, it would shut itself off. i got up on the chair to see what i could do. i fiddled with the vent a bit and the cover popped off without much fuss, to reveal a filter. sure enough, it was totally, completely clogged with dust. i took the filter to the trash can, knocked it on the side a couple times to dislodge the dust, and put it back into the projector. "that should fix it," i said. she clearly didn't believe me based on the look on her face, but she humored me anyway, and went to turn on the projector so she could resume class. class ended and the projector hadn't pooped out on us again, and things ran smoothly for the rest of semester. still got a b in that class though. so i'm in the military and work in tech support so to speak. we broadly label it data networking but it entails a huge variety of actual tech jobs. sometimes i'm configuring routers, other times i'm troubleshooting equipment. but on this day i was on the help desk for a fairly large field op. it can be stressful sometimes because all of the users show up at the same time and it never fails that half of them have the same problems ie. initial logons, setting passwords with proper security, stupid stuff like this. things finally calmed down for us and i went back to our hide away to relax for a bit. well i didn't make it very long when this pissed off sgtmaj came storming into the room. he's all flustered because he can't get to the google. i make my way over to his office and ask him to give me a couple minutes to troubleshoot. thoughts running through my head initially were the basics, is an ethernet cable even connected? yes. can it ping the default gateway? yes. and the dns? yes. i see his ie browser and open it. in the web address bar he was literally typing "the google" in and trying to load the page. to make my life easier and rather than explain that it doesn't work that way i simply saved the page and labeled in the google for him. this guy joined the military before i was born and probably saw it go from snail mail to email. just one of the dynamics of tech support in the military i guess.*i have a accent. i know i do. its not distracting, i just had a.d.d growing up and then had a shuddering problem when i was younger. having said that, in no way does my voice equal to = im indian .* **me**: thank you for calling "bloopbleep" . my name is ray, may i please have your....... **jane**: oh hell no. i do not want to talk to you. i want somebody from america! **me**: umm well your in luck cause...... **jane**: why are you still here?! transfer me now !! (mind you know, i am part of a internal it department. i cant be rude no matter what. me and her have the same boss. normally that's enough to deter people from being jerks but not this time .) **me**: fine, give me one sec and ill transfer you to my manager (while i transfer the call, i stay online in mute, to hear what she is going to tell my boss) *ring ring* **manager**: hello this is mr. allthat how may i assist you today. she proceeds to explain that she needed her pst files set up, they are stored on her shared network drive and couldnt find them. and then states she is in the biggest hurry and cannot waste time speaking with sombody over seas who might not understand her. my boss being the smoooth talker he is - **manager**: not a worry, we will take care of this immediately! just allow me to transfer you my best agent. he will take care of your every need!! is that okay mam?? **jane**: omg thank you soooooo much for that!!! im so gratefull!! **manager**: not a problelm! stay on line and ill transfer you ... *ring ring* **me**: thank you for calling "bloopbleep" . my name is ray, may i please have your last name??? **jane**: *sighhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh*........................ sure **end** for the record, im super good at my job. my average call handling time is like 7 mins. i am a tier 2 tech. it makes me mad that because of my slight accent, people assume im indian and flat out refuse to speak to me. [previous]( the vp arrived at it with a huge smile on his face, his arms filled with pda’s. &gt;vp: they’re here! his giddy excitement made some of the it staff turn around. &gt;me: oh, vp, you’ve brought the pda’s. how… kind. i decided not to mention i’d been putting off collecting them from his office for over half a day. &gt;vp: actually it’s also my birthday today, so i thought… why not bring them down to you. &gt;me: wait wasn’t your birthday!?….oww. redcheer had walked up and nudged me hard in the side. &gt;redcheer: happy birthday vp. redcheer whispered something about not being rude. i didn’t hear what she said, i was too busy trying to remember when the vp’s birthday actually was. &gt;vp: thanks. er… r… red?… anyway since i brought the gifts… the vp gestured to his arms filled with pda’s. &gt;vp: hopefully you guys brought the cake? i looked around to make sure i was still actually in it, not a cake store. yep. no cakes. &gt;me: we… didn’t realize you’d chosen to celebrate with us. &gt;vp: don’t worry. just send someone out! we can celebrate together. i send pantsuit off to get a cake. the rest of it gathered awkwardly in celebration of the vp’s birthday. &gt;vp: actually i also need to thank the student that sped up my computer. it’s much faster now. where is he… i decided not to worry about if it actually *was* the vp’s birthday. i finally got to work out who was in the vp’s office. i gathered the it students, and waited for the outcome. the vp looked between the three assembled students. &gt;vp: where’s the other one? &gt;me: other one? &gt;vp: he’s … round. slight moustache. i looked at the three students assembled. nope. &gt;vp: the one that fixed my computer… &gt;defiant: round… ? slight moustache?…. the vp was nodding his head wildly. the three students started smirking. &gt;defiant: that’s studclean. he works in cleaning… &gt;vp: a cleaner?! &gt;badshirt: ya he picked cleaning staff because of that tv show, scrubs. apparently the janitor gets “a key to everything.” &gt;vp: my office was invaded by a …. **cleaner!?** i was worried. a faster computer can never spell good news. however before i could voice that opinion pantsuit arrived back with a cake. it looked delightful. an awkward happy birthday song started. it forced the vp to calm slightly. &gt;me: happy birthday, vp. here’s some cake… &gt;vp: it does look nice. what a lovely birthday, i get cake and a new pda! the cake tasted awful, it looked nice but it wasn’t very useful for sustenance. much like something else that had just arrived in it. [next]( **positon:**deploy technician. main duties were building the computer to the requested specs and delivering to the end user or to the machinery it was used to run. **company:**big green tractor maker. we had around 7 various buildings with different it equipment in them, but the one that everyone dreaded goign into was the foundry. if you've never been in a foundry, they tend to involve a lot of activities like [this] ( and [this]( needless to say, this was not our most favorite place to deploy..well anything. the one redeeming factor there were the people. they fixed and made-do with whatever they had for as long as possible to help us out, and we appreciated it. when they called for hardware, they needed it. there was never a complaint from us about them requesting too many things as they used things to the last shred of usefulness was gone and then they called us. one of these fine people was alex.. aka the mad russian. alex was really a fun, fun guy. got work done, but when things went wrong due to ineptitude or bad planning on someone else's part, he let it be known. he also had the pull to make things difficult for anyone who crossed him, so we usually went out of our way to keep him happy. usually. this is a story of what happened when we didn't. i was driving in the foundry to drop a computer off for a small office located just next to one of the hotter holes of hell located in the foundry. i make my drop, hook up and confirm it connects. all is good and grab the gator to leave and head back to that air conditioned office. i can see the door at the other end, but then notice a 6'4, bald mid-40s russian standing directly in the middle of the inside driveway. no no for most people, but not for him. hell, who would tell him to move? the following exchange occured: **alex:** derp, we need to talk. **derp:** sure, how can i help? **alex:** where is my printer. **derp:** *noticing this isn't the regular happy alex* i'm...not sure i know. i don't handle the printers really. **alex:** *unimpressed with my lack of answers* the printer i requested 3 weeks ago. ours broke beyond patching and we need it. quickly. please find out and get back to me asap. i agree and speed back to the nerd cave we have on the other end of the site. i approach one of the more senior techs about this. he assures me he knows and is trying to do what he can to get it and that he will contact alex. he does, notifying alex that due to restraints put in place by our contracted company (terrible place, by the way) we had to wait for too many varying levels of approval. alex understood, he wasn't happy, but he understood. now, alex isn't dumb. he knows things such as hardware requests, replacements, etc. are pretty low on the hierarchy of it issues around there. the bigger issue we had was network security. the wireless we had was strictly for laptops and they were hardcore at making sure it stayed that way. no personal phones, corporate phones or personal laptops...anything not a business use laptop was allowed. when something not allowed connected it was noticed and that area was notified immediately. more than that, the higher it people were forced to deal with it, look into it and update superiors on the issue, etc. massive email chains always erupted from this. the very next day, we get a high urgency ticket regarding network activity and an iphone. specifically, someone attempting to logon with alex's credentials through a phone. emails were spammed. alex was contacted. the phone was disconnected from the network. as he had recently gotten the phone, he was made aware and disconnected. he also became aware of just how serious this "network intrusion" seemed to be. fast forward to the next day... around 1 pm the following day, the same thing happened. emails, alex contacted, phone disconnected from network, ticket resolved. again, the following day it occurred. it started happening each and every day. ignorance no longer a valid excuse, this email roundabout was becoming a hassle for all those involved as it touched some pretty important it mailboxes, not to mention some higher ranking managers of the plant overall. not soon after this first week of calculated "attacks" he stepped up his game. 2 times a day, he would connect his phone to the network. by the middle of the second week, our it broke. literally. every other email seemed to be about why we couldn't keep the network secure. why all these intrusions were happening. to the passive viewer of emails, most higher ups who were cc'd out of requirement, all this looked like was a bad it company not able to do their job. to us in the it area, it was pure genius. he couldn't get his printer in a reasonable time? fine, but to make up for it, he would swamp the it higher ups with so much grief and email that he would be impossible to ignore. finally, one of the higher it people of our company called him directly. at first, to berate him on his constant breach of wireless protocol. he left a stern voicemail and stood by in fake bravado as he told us it was handled. a call came in, but as he was talking, we were to listen and let it go to our department voicemail. when he finished, he turned, saw the missed call was alex and put the phone on speaker before playing it. obviously, expecting it to be an apology but getting something much, much different. [voicemail starts] *in a heavy russian accent* i'm aware that i've broken your...rules. i do not care. i've waited. i've followed your..rules.. to get a printer for this area. you ignore me. can you ignore me now? i want. my. printer. *click* the bossman stands in silence, not sure what to think. we all sit there doing our best not to laugh our asses off at his failed attempt at returning order to the land. if the situation wasn't perfect enough, we all got an email as we sat there in stunned silence. intrusion alert. 2 days later, alex got his printer. mad russian? not anymore. **tl;dr** russian turns into cold, calculating network abuser to convince it higher ups to give him what he deserves. so i work tech support for a popular camera company. i answered this call. me: thank you for calling in to.... customer: you guys sent me the wrong fucking camera! me: sorry to hear about this sir, which camera did you receive? customer: i ordered the _____, which is the most expensive one! this piece of shit did not come with a touch screen!! me: sir, the model you ordered may be our most expensive camera, but this particular model does not come with a built in touch screen. customer: well what the fuck kind of logic is that!!??? me: sorry sir, i can understand how this can be frustrating for.. customer: fuck this shit!!! i want a supervisor!! i will get an upgrade!! i don't care if i have to get all the way to the fucking ceo!! me: unfortunately, there are no supervisors avalible at this time. customer: well i hope you lose your job and that your entire company goes under. sometimes, i can't fucking believe how entitled and ignorant people are... one day at my first job, i was called into the bosses office. with a stern face he said "we have to have a talk". when i enquired what was going on, he said it was about the software i wrote "hacking into the company". and that i was to be fired for breaking the law. he handed me an envelope with what i assume was my dismisal notice. i asked what the hell he was talking about. he said, "there is no point hiding it, you have been caught and i have the evidence right here. [pointing to his laptop]". he then asked if i had anything to say before he called the police. i asked to see the evidence on the laptop, he turned it around and showed an error message on the screen. it read "this program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down". edit: a few requested that i finish the story [ so here it is ]( ) this is a story from awhile ago and i only just found this subreddit so i apologize if this doesn't quite fit. i was working tech support for a rather large isp. female customer calls in, doesn't know their password. ok, i can reset it for you but you need to answer the security question first. "oh, my husband set that up. i'm not sure i know it." "i'm sure you can get it ma'am. where did you go on your honeymoon?" answers in 2 seconds "florida." "uh, that's not what i have here..." "what? i know that's where we went. i was there." "i'm sorry ma'am, that's not the answer that was put in." "wait wait wait! does it say hawaii?" "yes ma'am, that's what i have here." "that's where he went with his first wife!! imma need to call you back! daryl!!" *click* i sat there for a moment and then laughed my ass off. ltr;ftp and non-native english, so excuse my crappy text. a little background, i work for a pretty small company doing support and mostly helpdesk to an erp system which our clients get access via vpn-only. the thing is sometimes this vpn service get stuck and the client can't access to erp, so i need to connect using remote desktop to client computer and unstuck the service. months ago i got a mail from one of our clients. **$client:** i can't access to erp, can you give me some help? **$me:** sure, can you give me authorization to get access to you computer? and the id and password from remote desktop app please. **$client:** yeah, there is: xxxxxxxxx : xxxx this gonna be easy, huh? wrong, i get a error from the app: *the app isn't open in the remote client* oh well, maybe is a wrong number or something **$me:** excuse me ma'am, i can't access to your computer, can you open your app and give me again the id and password, please? **$client:** sure, is xxxxxxxx : yyyy yup, new password. the thing is everytime you close and open the app the password changes, the only thing doesn't change is their id but i always ask, because sometimes they are on another computer or in a bussiness travel with company laptop. so, i put again the new password: *the app isn't open in the remote client* what? again? **$me:** ma'am, please do not close the app and this time can give me the password only. **$client:** sure, is vvvv. putting the password: *the app isn't open in the remote client* **[heavy sigh]** **$me:** ma'am, please do not close the app because if you do i can't access to your computer and i can't fix your issue. **$client:** oh, the app was annoying me and i can't do some work with the app open, i thought you only need the password and acccess to my computer meanwhile i do some work. **$me**: **[headesk]** later i get a glass of whiskey. **tl;dr: user believes in magic** edit: some format and corrections. my coworker just tried to send an email but it would not send. i had her check her email box size: **7,846,546kb!** yes. you read that right over **7 gigabytes** of email, most of that in her deleted items folder. her response: "i thought when i deleted an email it was deleted." i used the throwing paper in the trash can under her desk metaphor. she empty her deleted items folder. 5 minutes later email she was trying to send was sent on its way. somewhere, an it person is wondering about all the space that just opened up on a server. edit: it may have been 78gb. i only got to see the ridiculous amount for a brief moment. edit 2:my email box size: 6,923 kb edit 3: not in it. just "tech" person in office.[previous]( i pinched my nose and winced. the day refused to end. &gt;defiant: ..and then, on the final boss you can do this triple combo... &gt;me: defiant, as much as i love hearing about your game adventures, i need to ask you... were you de-fraging computers upstairs? &gt;defiant: nope. wasn't me. as i wondered who it could have been i looked down at the ticket queue. &gt;defiant: anyway as i was saying, the triple combo has this dash which means you can dodge... &gt;me: oh look! the prefect ticket. i hurriedly clicked on any in the queue. as defiant looked at the ticket he continued to recount his game adventures. i tried to zone out, i failed. &gt;me: how about we have another bet? &gt;defiant: the ticket is impossible. you can't get a computer to fill out sales forms for you. &gt;me: i wouldn't say... impossible, but its certainly not an it support ticket. defiant looked thoughtful, he stood blissful silence for a few moments. &gt;defiant: you'd need a microphone, voice recognition software... a speech analyzer... &gt;me: all that effort, just to save clicking on an object and typing in the number ordered. so if you can talk him out of it, we're even. &gt;defiant: done. i didn't mention he'd be convincing a sales staff member, who talked people **into** things for a living. ***** arriving at voicerecon's desk a smiling happy man looked up at us. &gt;voicerecon: so happy to see you! i never get to see it. &gt;defiant: i'm afraid we've come to say no, to your proposal. &gt;voicerecon: oh, that's alright. i just thought it would be fairly useful, when i'm talking to clients i want focus 100% on the sale. if i had the computer fill out the forms itself wouldn't have to worry about writing everything down. i turned to leave, but defiant was stuck. he'd looked voicerecon in the eye, so felt compelled to reply. &gt;defiant: well, you already record the call. why not just re-play the tape and fill in the forms after the call? &gt;voicerecon: wow, you're pretty smart young man. that would work, but don't have time to listen to a whole call again. defiant smiled at the compliment and continued thinking. &gt;me: time to go. &gt;defiant: wait a sec, i'll solve this problem. okay how about just marking the pertinent times of the call. so you only have to re-listen to the orders. voicerecon looked like a shark, he smiled down at his prey. &gt;voicerecon: excelent idea. however i'd need a mic, so i can record locally. at the moment it's all saved on a server.... defiant and voicerecon bounced ideas off each other for a full fifteen minutes. eventually defiant was swayed by the entire idea. &gt;defiant: actually, the auto fill idea could work... &gt;voicerecon: mmm, what do you think airz? voicerecon and defiant stared up at me. i was honestly in awe of voicerecon's sales ability, being able to sway defiant so quickly. &gt;me: i'll get back to you. ***** getting back to my office defiant looked quite happy. &gt;me: you realize you just lost another bet? &gt;defiant: automation is a solid idea. plus even you couldn't say no to him. &gt;me: defiant, come here. i'll show you how it deals with a ticket like this. **new email** - to voicerecon, **no.** from it. &gt;defiant: just no? won't he argue? &gt;me: trusty, faceless email. you can't argue with a computer. [next](i work for a large construction company providing advanced level technical support to our end users. i am incredibly lucky that many of the people i support are very technical, at the very least in their own field, so supporting them is usually educational and interesting. yesterday i received a call from one these very technical (or so i thought) users who also has a thick accent, which can lead to misunderstandings at times. let's call him miguel. *ring ring* &gt;me: hey miguel, wassup? &gt;miguel: yes hey good morning jasonisnuts do you have any lubricant for a hard drive so i can relubricate it? me: *stares blankly at phone trying to determine if this is a prank* &gt;me after a slight pause: just to confirm, you are looking for lubricant for a hard drive??? &gt;miguel: yes, the drive is making noises and i want to asjldkajsduiq9woijfa at this point my coworkers all chuckled after hearing the question i posed back to miguel. i begin laughing harder and harder, so i can't really understand him anymore. &gt;me: miguel i have to call you back in 90 seconds. i hang up, laugh cry, and compose myself. i call him back. &gt;miguel immediately upon picking up the phone: you done? &gt;me: hey, so hard drives are totally sealed units that don't have lubrication in the traditional sense. can you tell me specifically what's going on? &gt;miguel: the drive is making all sorts of mechanical noises, like grinding and clicking. i want to disassemble it so i can relubricate it, then i can plug it in again and get all the data off it. *head desk* &gt;me: okay, first of all do not disassemble the drive. secondly stop turning it on or plugging it in. the more of those noises you hear the more potential damage you are doing. lastly, get your checkbook ready and call kroll ontrack. it turns out he was "just trying to help" the marketing manager who sits next to him who didn't want to lose all her music. i ended up selling her on itunes match (mac user, natch) and the importance of backups. tl;dr if it goes bump in the night you need an exorcist not lubricant.  i'm doing some work for a customer with a significant industrial control system network, spread over a large campus. i'm not directly assessing their security, but the work requires me to be in contact with their it and infosec folks. $customer's ics systems present a risk to property and human life if they fail, so there have to be significant controls to protect them. their ics network is a separate network from the 'regular' it network, not under the control of it or information security. the ics group is very tight lipped, even with company it and is staff. any questions i ask regarding their ics infrastructure are rebuffed with: " all our ics is on an airgapped network, so we're good " my work peripherally discusses $customer's ics/scada infrastructure, so i'm not going to get all cranky. i do need to ask a responsible person a _few_ questions, so i get an audience with an ics lead. in order to not be a complete fool when i get to talk to the ics person, i spend some quality time getting familar with the concepts and potentially the kinds of devices one might find in an enterprise in $customer's line of work. until i find 'the document'. when i did litigation, we often talked about the 'smoking gun' document, where someone admits that they knew the product was cancer-causing/made from repurposed realplayer code but sold it anyway. never saw one. until now. i've found a manufacturer of fiber switches, with an open share of marketing documents, including a detailed network diagram of $customer's ics fiber network, showing switch locations, names, model numbers. it also clearly shows how ics and 'business' traffic travels through the same network and switches. the switches break out traffic, but sit on both networks. i print a copy. i get to actually meet ics person for ten minutes, since he's running late from one meeting. i get to ask him the dumb questions i had. i think they were about physical security access logs or something like that. i'm about to leave, but i can't let it go. me:"i keep hearing that you have an airgap. how do you validate it?" ics guy (looking annoyed that i'm breathing his air):"we designed it that way" me:"i get that. how do you know nobody's plugged in something that bridges it or allows outside access?" ics guy:"the ics network is designed separately from the it network" me: (handing him the schematic):"so, can you show me the airgap on this map?" ics guy (visibly turning pale):"how'd you get this?" me:"from the vendor. but if this is accurate, you're separating traffic at layer 2 or 3. the switches are visible from both networks. i'm going to guess that you haven't locked them to serial only access, since some of them are hard to get to." ics guy:"you'll have to delete this document from your laptop. it's classified and proprietary" me:"sure. but a google search for '$customer $switch_vendor $year_of_project' will show it. i think you've got some work to do" i'm still friendly with a few it people there. they're working on it. they at least asked the vendor to take down the schematic. "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." - arthur c. clarke earlier today i was working on a web-ticket where i had to remote into a pc and install adobe flash player. simple enough, right? well it would have been, but while i was in the computer, someone at the store walked by and saw it moving around all by itself. instead of chalking it up to ghosts and leaving it at that, they decided to take action. they went over to the computer and ruthlessly tried to exorcise the demon from the computer by constantly dragging the mouse down toward the start menu to shut it down. after almost a minute of fighting this person for control of the mouse, i finally managed to click in the address bar at the top of the browser to type a message to get them to stop (we usually do this to let them know we are working on it and get them to stop fighting us). normally i would just type something like, "this is the help desk, please stop moving the mouse." but today, i tried to be funny. i typed word for word, "i can't let you do that, dave." the person stopped moving the mouse, so i figured it worked and they had run away to prevent being ejected into space, but a few seconds later the screen went black and i was kicked out of the pc. i pinged it from command prompt and it was completely offline. the person at the store pulled the power cord to stop the demons from escaping. about a minute later a co-worker of mine received a frantic call from a user whose computer was being hacked and identity was being stolen. hilariously enough, his name was dave. edit: after the fact, i learned the the person who called back (who was also the other person trying to use the computer) was actually one of our level 2 support group guys. he was remoted into the *same* computer at the *same* time and had no idea what i was trying to do. yes, his name was actually dave which is why he was freaking out at the time. all in all it was a very hilarious day. :) edit2: i also learned today (thanks reddit!) that sccm2012 has a feature to lock the keyboard/mouse of whoever you're remoting into, so this silly scenario will never happen again! :( :) :(emergency alarms went off at my condo tower a few days ago. in every condo here, there are at least three alarms all ringing and flashing red lights at the maximum decibel level considered safe by regulation whenever it happens. guess what happens when my four emergency alarms go off, each at 'peak safe decibels'? combined, is so loud i get a little ear damage every time, i'm sure. thankfully it's a rare event, but i still wanted to write to building management about it. leaving my telework console, i ran stairs down 6 levels to get away from this crazy noise, like everybody else. elevators are a hazard when there's a fire emergency. fire trucks rapidly surrounded the tower as cops started redirecting traffic. we're very close to a joint emergency services compound and it shows. the day there's a real emergency it'll be nice. fifteen firemen go up the stairs and a few down to underground parking. one of them is notably a bald 6 feet 9" half-giant wielding the largest fire axe i've ever seen. there's perhaps up to a hundred people living here outside the tower now, and i know this is likely to take a bit so i go grab an early lunch and coffee. i come back well over 40 minutes later. fire trucks are still there, the entire road is cut off. people are mostly on the other side of the road because *even outside the alarms are too loud*. babies are crying. it's so freaking cold i see men with icicles on their facial hair. a fireman is addressing the crowd. &gt; fireman: "we've determined this to be a false alarm, as soon as we figure out a few issues with your primary fire panel downstairs the alarms will stop. anyone who can bear the noise can go straight back in." nobody does. it's just not bearable. &gt; other owner: "what few issues? just shut it off if it's a false alarm." &gt; fireman: "we're trying, but there might be something wrong with it. we have someone good on it, should just be a matter of minutes." ... i shut down that thing before. never been any issues... &gt; other other owner: "my kid is freezing but it's too loud in there! i'm going inside elsewhere, someone text me please?!" &gt; bytewave: "fireman, i've shut this down before. lemme just mildly dampen the ear damage with earbuds. okay, let's go." he shrugs and waves me in, and we head downstairs into the underground parking and straight to the electric room where the primary panel is for the alarm system. there after getting through the door guarded by two cops with fingers in their ears, i find half a dozen firemen staring at the thing. the half-giant with his two-handed battleaxe seems particularly intent on driving it through the thing. another fireman is holding a manual and screaming the lines written in it at their operator. next to him is a huge open suitcase of manuals, presumably for all commonplace systems like this one. the operator is pushing buttons seemingly at random. &gt; bytewave: "i've shut this down before! the power button is up on the top left, on the steely part, it'll shut down the system and the alarm won't be on anymore once it boots back up!" &gt; fireman2: "i know! i tried! the power button doesn't work! we're trying the emergency codes now!" ... the power button doesn't work? ... well stuff can always break, even a power button, but after 20 years fixing stuff, i've come to believe some explanations are less plausible than others. i never even encountered a real issue wholly caused by a power button. &gt; bytewave: "did you hold it down?!" &gt; fireman2: "what??" &gt; bytewave: "hold the power button down for 5 seconds!!!" ... he complies. alarms stop. he looks at me with an even mix of 'thanks' and 'i'm about to facepalm now'. did nobody there ever have to shut down a computer before? ... eh, whatever, let's get something out of this instead of just rubbing it in. i take out my earbuds. &gt; bytewave: "hey, happy to help. now the noise these alarms make is crazy. is it up to code? any of you feeling a little deaf right now?" they confirmed to me each alarm was up to code but that together, they crossed the threshold. somehow nobody planned for this when we had this tower built. &gt; bytewave: "okay, i'd like this in writing so we can get it tweaked easily. do you think it would be possible to..." &gt; half-giant with battleaxe: "of course. give us your email, i'll send you something." incredibly enough, merely an hour later i got a legal-looking advisory from the fire department that our alarms were too loud. already forwarded to building management. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](i don't work in it, i know that a simple google search can fit a lot. apparently google is too hard for some people. anyway, on to the story... i was living in a share house and one room mate was a hippy in her 30s and an artist. one day her phone broke and she went out and got another el-cheapo prepaid. she wanted to download a program for her art thing to do digital works on her phone, but she couldn't find google play! she asked for my help and i watched her go through her phone, and sure enough it wasn't there. after a minute of going through her phone settings and what not, i noticed her home screen wasn't like normal androids. with a little bit of a suspicion, i asked her to restart her phone before we try a factory reset. sure enough, she had a nokia. i facepalmed so hard internally before telling her she has a windows phone and they don't have google play and it's not an app you can download.attention: long story ahead! i‘m working for a big company with branches in many countries. i and my colleagues are responsible for around 200 servers and everything support related for employees inside the building and field staff . you could say i am the it janitor. this story actually made me so furious that i had an impuls to punch a hole in the wall for the whole day. so today i’ll tell you the story of the in my opinion stupidest department of the company. it all started on a monday morning (when else…). i got a call from my beloved marketing department. the call goes like this: &gt; md: hello toast, this is $stupidgoose1. the copier isn’t working again. you really need to fix this. &gt; me: ok. what’s the problem? &gt; md: it’s only printing half of the page i need. seems to be a easy fix. just some printer settings. no big deal. they mess the settings up every week. &gt; me: ok that should do the trick. could you try and print it again? &gt; md: ok one moment… after 2 minutes waiting i hear a unhealthy sound through the phone. &gt; md: what have you done! get up here immediately! you are in big trouble! &gt; me: (what the hell…) on my way! so i walked up to their office and what is the first thing i see… toner… toner everywhere around the copier … and pissed off employees… so i asked what on earth is going on here. the respond was screamed into my face from $stupidgoose1. &gt; sg1: you see exactly what happened here! its your fault! you will pay for this! (points at her with toner sprinkled jeans) &gt; me: please stay calm and explain me what happened. &gt; sg1: you broke the printer and now everything is fucked up! &gt; me: i see… so investigated the battlefield around the copier. the panel you open to get to the toner was ripped off. the toner was lying on the ground in two pieces and there was toner on the carpet 2 meters around and on the copier. so i asked her what she did in the 2 minutes i was waiting on the phone. &gt; sg1: it was not working again! so i tried to fix it myself! &gt; me: you tried to fix it yourself? &gt; sg1: its your fault! it should work in the first place! now the rest of the department jumped in and helped sg1 stand her ground. after 15 minutes of “nothing is working”, “you broke our copier”, “i am not professional” and other stuff i’m kinda used to i just said that i’ll be right back to clean the mess. i know those people for not quite a year now but i know that they are not the most intelligent people in the company. so i told them to stay away from the copier because it’s important that the toner is not pressed into the carpet. also toner is nasty stuff you should better not put on your sandwich. so i left the office to get the special vacuum cleaner for toner. and you might see where this is going… when i came back into the office there were footprints everywhere around the copier … that was the moment where i lost my calmness and got pissed. bad idea… i mean getting pissed… &gt; me: ok who the **** walked straight through the toner? then it started. a shitstorm of complaints about how i was useless. now i realized that there is no way to talk to them like normal people would do so i just started cleaning the mess up with that very very noisy vacuum cleaner. at this point i just ignored everything they complained about. so after 15 minutes of cleaning and putting the broken stuff into a bag i left with no words. after only 5 minutes i got a call from my area manager. he told me that the marketing department is complaining to all highly ranked people in the company that i broke their copier, damaged the office and soiled their clothing. also they said you left without cleaning your mess up. ... that’s it those *insert random insult* will suffer! after i explained everything to him he was on my site and it was time to think about the punishment. so what to do... there are many things i thought about at this moment… most of them would bring me in jail for a looong time… but there were some ways to make their job harder that are not that…well… not that brutal and bloody… **punishment 1:** writing a full report of sg1 destroying company material worth around 1000€ (broken copier, broken toner, until the end of days black carpet) **punishment 2:** talking with my colleagues about declining calls from them. they are now not allowed to call us directly except for an very important emergency. everything else needs to be put in as a ticket. **punishment 3:** i have the servers, i have the power! password resets every week with special rules: 10 character length, min 3 special characters, min 2 numbers, both small and big letters and the passwords must be different to the one before by 5 characters. and before…and before… the list goes 100 passwords into the past atm. as long as they do not apologize to me i won’t change anything. the end of the story is that my report went high up to the boss and sg1 got to a first and last warning. if she fu*** shit up again she is fired. i think they've learned their lesson. they haven’t said a single word to me except for “hello” and “thanks” since then. ps: there was a trainee i know in the room when sg1 broke everything. so i knew exactly what was going on in those 2 minutes i was waiting at the phone and while i was gone for the vacuum cleaner. i wen’t like this: -sg1 goes to the copier, waits for 10 seconds, punches the copier, tries to open the printer with force, rips off the opening mechanism of the printer, forces the toner out, looks at it and starts shaking it. toner is flying around and she tosses the toner at the copier. toner cartridge brakes in two pieces and spills toner everywhere. copier got damaged by the hit too. after i went for the vacuum cleaner she walks to the copier again and mocks around how stupid i am. that’s it. i’m done with this department. sorry for mistakes while writing. my native language is not english, so there are definitely mistakes in my text :) edit: due to some people telling me how unsecure the password policy is, here are some more informations for that: everyone thinking that is 100% right. it is not professional and not secure at all. they will write the password down and stuff. i'm not going to let this new rule stand for a long time. just for 1 more week. maximum 2. but hell i laughed when the trainee told me how hard it was for them to change the password for the first time. (btw. trainee was not affected by that stuff). also...i know that they were writing the passwords down the whole time... i told them to stop that but they ignored it. i even told the supervisor about that problem but it seems like they ignored it too. i've already become loud while telling them to stop that. (they had lists with passwords under their keyboard). so the security hole in this department can't get that much bigger...i was told you guys might enjoy this: i went to the surgeon's the other day for a follow-up and to get my stitches out (yay!). he logged into the computer and pulled up the pictures he took of the inside of my wrist. as they came up, he made a joke about how the pictures won't mean anything to me because, "it's not your fault you didn't go to medical school." to which i gave him the requisite chuckle. then, when he couldn't get the program to re-size the pictures properly on the screen and i had to show him how to use the computer, i said to him, "don't worry, this is what i went to school for, i wouldn't expect it to make sense to you." he didn't think it was all that funny. true story.one of the most ridiculous calls i ever got working as senior staff at my telco. false [impact event]( report. &gt; bytewave: "senior line, bytewave. you may send me your ticket." &gt; oblivious subcontractor (os): "uhh yeah, my customer just lost service, give me a minute, pretty sure i got this." ... &gt; os: "there! i think you should have it." ticket reads: customer offline due to meteorite. &gt; bytewave: "... there's *just* been a *meteor strike*?! do we have an exact location? we need to determine impact on the network first, did you test the node?" &gt; os: "no... i dunno?" of course you dunno. checking node. checking news as i run the test, nothing unusual... &gt; bytewave: "... okaayyy. your customer is the only one offline in the area, as you *should* have noticed. the 'meteor' happen to strike his living room or what?" &gt; os: "i guess? he said it fell from the sky and now there's no tv and internet." i'm not believing it obviously, but gotta check the... **oh come on.** &gt; bytewave: "when the customer contacted you, did you not get the automatic popup with his call history and highlights of previous calls?" &gt; os: "yeah..." &gt; bytewave: "how did you miss the fact that the last call was about ufos and packet loss?" &gt; os: "no, i read it... but it's closed so..." &gt; bytewave: "how about the fact his modem is offline *but the battery is still working*? we're still getting readings from it! it's just unplugged." ... &gt; bytewave: "there's notification in bold in the comments that the customer has called us several times to report implausible problems that did not pan out. lets assume a meteor hits an apartment building in a big city and *somehow* just one customer loses service... wait, no, let's not even. that will never happen. and if it did, how do you think you'd learn about it? from a customer with multiple documented frivolous calls?" &gt; os: "okay... but... i guess i don't have to schedule a service call?" ... &gt; bytewave: "obviously not. i'm flagging this account for review. he'll be contacted within 24 hours by someone who will politely offer him a choice between terminating service or keeping it while blacklisting his phone number from technical support. can you explain to him gently that he will be contacted within a day regarding this issue?" &gt; os: "i'm not sure, he seems pretty upset..." &gt; bytewave: "okay then. tell him we'll call him back within fifteen minutes, i'll hand the call over immediately to an agent with... more impact event expertise." &gt; os: "oh! great, thank you!" &gt; bytewave: "... thank you for choosing senior line." [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](i've unfortunately taken down this story and my related comments a few weeks ago, my most popular so far, because there was a substantial witch-hunt going on for a time about it at work after it made /r/all and i had reasons to believe it was an employment risk. at the time, the two parts together had over 6k ups and 6 glids. thanks to it everyone at work has heard about /r/talesfromtechsupport now. but it's no longer an issue. i have confirmation that it was largely overblown and that i was never actually at risk of identification despite early information to the contrary. i hate censorship, and i feel bad for ever taking it offline. so i'm rectifying that tonight by re-posting whole thing here, the hell with it. for the curious about past comments, i present the internet's inability to forget, though with atrocious formatting. [part 1 was archived entirely here]( while [part 2 is all here, comments included]( the side-discussion about plaintext passwords [led to this]( without further ado, the whole thing i deleted because i briefly got scared of hr's plastic teeth. we're all humans with bills to pay, but in the end, all that is needed for hr to triumph is for employees to do nothing. ****************** in memoriam of fallen colleagues - causes of unemployement; love, justice system gonewild, 21st century witchhunting against unions. this story contains a healthy dose of legal drama but i believe it's still relevant here. awhile ago my isp laid off in one day 8 unionized employees and about a dozen non-union staff and managers, including a director, and in the end were quite unhappy to have to do so. legally, this happened over 'fraud'. we're a big company, and of course many couples formed at work, and in many cases, began to live together. we're also all entitled to generous discounts on all our services, with several being simply free for all employees. you can get a package of cable, internet, phone, and mobile that would normally cost 300$/month for about 60$ if you go for a set of high-end options as we mostly all do. the 'problem' was that when two employees lived together, one of them de-facto lost this privilege, as a single privileged account covers everything you can possibly need at one address. the 'solution' used by everyone for years to avoiding wasting their perk for living with whoever they loved was simple; one of them would put the home address of a relative as their own, just to avoid wasting the perk. legally, this has now been determined to be fraud, but at the time, it seemed like an innocuous workaround, and it was fairly common knowledge among average employees that was how you dealt with it, and nobody cared, until the day one manager with an axe to grind found out two union reps in love together were doing exactly that. suddenly legal, hr and the president (of the company) started pushing panic buttons frantically. so began the great witchhunt. initially, according to sources close to ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶e̶n̶e̶m̶y̶ the company, their initial plan was just to fire the two that had been 'found out' and issue a stern company wide warning against such practices. but orders rapidly came down from the office of the president that this fell well short of sufficient. the lovebirds were left alone for now. legal papers were drawn up, six people with great suits plotting world domination with legal degrees picked up their best italian leather suitcases and went to court, requesting a closed audience to discuss 'potential fraud'. they argued that the audience had to be kept under wraps because for the time being, the 'potential fraudsters' had access to information that *'could endanger national security'* (our databases have lots of confidential information on millions of customers and yes, everyone aside from the frontline grunts can read their emails and see their passwords) if they were aware of procedures against them and that police action would be hindered if word got out before the potential fraud was fully uncovered. *hey, they said national security? motion granted.* the secrecy prevented the union from knowing about the proceedings or representing anyone at this stage. law at least ensured that a public attorney would represent the parties which did not know they were accused, but without the possibility of contacting them to organize a defense. at audience, they explained the situation, the suspicion it was widespread amongst rank and file employees in a relationship with another. and that since the company had no records regarding who was sleeping with whom, there was only one logical thing do: *order police to secretly collect gps data on the cellphones of every union employee for 7 days to ensure they were not lying about their place of residence*. of course only police would see the data, compare it to listed addresses claiming employee discounts, and report mismatches to the court for further action. hey, why not, it's not like this is pre 9/11 or something, they did say national security, let's do it! then the generic public attorney (gpa) finally said something useful. the dialogue is based on secondary sources and is not word for word. &gt;gpa: "are unionized employees the only ones with these benefits?" &gt;evil corporate lawyers (ecl): "well, technically anyone working for the corporation has..." &gt;gpa: "defense moves that if such an action is authorized, national security could also be affected by any non-union employee with access to the company's database, that any warrant must be broadened to the entire company, and coupled with a gag order that forbids anyone with knowledge of these proceedings to share this information with any employee of the corporation, including upper management." &gt;ecl: "your honor, we do not believe such a risk exists and that the high hiring standards and regular screening of our non-unionized personnel, who unlike the union workers fall under our strict corporate policy instead of a very limiting work contract, make the risk negligible that they could defraud us. it's not worth the time of law enforcement to investigate such a dead end." &gt; gpa: "amongst all people with employee discounts and access to systems that could access information that might in any way impact national security, what is the ratio of union to non-union personnel? &gt; ecl: "objection, relevance." &gt; gpa: "essential to evaluate the extent to which non-union personnel could theoretically impact 'national security'. &gt; judge: "overruled, please answer." &gt; ecl: "well, i don't have exact numbers on hand, but uhm, slightly more non-union personnel overall in the entire structure, but..." obviously there was more to it than this. corporate could bring in witnesses whereas gpa couldn't given his inability to contact those he represented. we're told he managed to get a government official to testify to his belief that the threat posed by isp's employees ability to realistically damage national security through access to systems was 'generally low', but to no avail. still, his main point had being heard. &gt;judge: "be it ordered that a mandate is given to city police to establish within 30 days the technical basis for a 7 days wiretap of every person with a listed address with employee discounts at the corporation, limited to the collection of gps data of the wireless devices listed in the accounts in question, that everyone aware of these procedures is sworn to absolutely secrecy about the provisions of this order on pain of criminal sanctions, and police is to report within 60 days after collection of cases of potential fraud to this court, and that all collected data that does not point out to potential fraud must be immediately destroyed. the contents of this hearing will remain sealed for the time being." soon after a colleague of mine, part of our unionized security department (mostly in charge of ignoring thousands of piracy claims that very often involve references to the dmca even though we're in canada...), and also in charge of cooperating with all police, military or judicial requests to the corporation in complete secrecy got the very weird call. he told me about it once he was legally allowed to. &gt;policeman: "do you understand the contents and limitations of the mandate and that you're personally sworn to secrecy for the duration by virtue of it's content, and that failure to..." &gt;internal security: "yes, i understand have to track my own damn cellphone's position for a week and a few thousands others, your paperwork is in order. soo, if i turn off my cellphones for a week, do i go to jail?" &gt;policeman: "this is no laughing matter. and i do not advise that. how much time to do you need to setup a track of this magnitude?" &gt;internal security: "oh, let's see, thousands of accounts, about 50% more sims, hmm..." &gt;policeman: "the volume is going to be a problem isn't it?" &gt;internal security: "the only problem is that a judge signed off on this. eta 24 to 48 hours." policeman: "could you then next week cross-reference it against employee accounts to..." &gt;internal security: "could, sure. will, no. that falls outside my job description and your mandate. i will provide you in bulk the relevant addresses and gathered gps metadata within 24 to 48 hours after the big brother week is over. given the sensitivity, i won't send it electronically, i will have a physical thumbdrive for you to pick up." &gt;policeman: "this will cover your obligations, but it's less than helpful." &gt;internal security: "then that is less than my problem. have a good day, policeman." and so soon after my cellphone was legally wiretapped (only for gps data) for a week. thousands of others too. including the president's and the ecls'. what could possibly go wrong? - tl:dr 1/2 - upon uncovering two union reps were living together and skirting the rules about employee benefits in a way many had done since forever, upper management launched a legal witchhunt that involved getting legal rights to track every union employee's cellphone's gps data for a week in utter secrecy, and they argued **national security** to get their way. but it backfired when a random public defender forced them to track management's cellphones too. fast forward a few months, in part because local police is notoriously slow working with gps data when we don’t do their job for them, we're back in court. &gt; policeman: "over the course of the investigation, we have established 18 mismatches and 6 potential mismatches between listed addresses and the usual patterns of movement. a small percentage of sims could not be tracked, either because they were offline, not in working devices or outside network coverage. the threshold of evidence for possible fraud charges is met, and a copy of the report has gone to the crown's prosecutor for evaluation. in a case like this the likelyhood of criminal charges were extremely low, but section 380(1) of the ccc obligates such cases to be reviewed by prosecutors, frauds over 5k can land you in jail for up to 14 years *in theory*. &gt; judge: "very well. before the report can be released to the parties, the court wishes to know what procedures have been or will be put in place by the corporation to limit any threats of the sort discussed earlier in the process from playing out once information leaves these walls. &gt; ecl: "we will build our cases rapidly, at which point we will terminate the employees we are convinced committed fraud simultaneously, with security in place to escort them out. their access to tools and networks will be disabled as of notification. union stewards will be informed simultaneously and will be present to offer counsel and explain arbitration procedures to ensure they get due representation. personnel effects will be boxed and mailed. we intend to separately file civil suits seeking damages, legal fees and punitive damages, but in the interest of not clogging the courts, legal will show good faith when discussing potential settlements." &gt; judge: "termination procedures are one thing, but the danger to the public good you argued, caused by the information your staff has access to, is another. i offer advisory that the corporation reviews it's internal procedures to minimize potential future harm, as we've determined that too many employees had access to potentially powerful tools that were not strictly necessary to do their jobs. anything else before we proceed?" &gt; gpa: "yes, your honor. the termination procedure described was very specific, mentioned union stewards and arbitration procedures. what exactly will happen to non-union personnel who are equally suspected of the same offense on this list? we would argue that all must be held to a single standard if fraud indeed occurred." &gt; ecl: "we continue to hold full confidence that if any non-union professionals engaged in such practices it'll be in extreme minority." &gt; judge: "counsel will provide an answer to the question actually asked." &gt; ecl: "... i assume we would have to apply severe disciplinary procedures to these outliers, we cannot really tolerate fraud at any level, but the final decisions would lay with the relevant direction." &gt; judge: "that is a big change of tone compared to the previous statement, the court truly hopes this is not evidence of bad faith. we have not mandated police resources and taken extraordinary surveillance measures for what increasingly appears to be a witch-hunt against unionized employees. the corporation will provide notification to local police, the court, and the union of what disciplinary measures or legal charges have been brought forward against each person on the list, in addition to security improvements we have discussed within 90 days, or may face consequences for wrongful proceedings and contempt. i am allowing into these proceedings the lawyers of the union, whom are to be read into the gag order and events so far, to assist or replace at their leisure gpa. they will be equally bound to secrecy towards their own structure, and the court no longer believes their presence poses a security risk. you will understand my mood better in a moment. sergeant-at-arms, provide counsel with copies of the police reports. we will recess until new counsel has been read in." what i would not have given to be a little bird in the window looking at ecls' faces when that union brick dropped on their head and they realized the bulk of the offenders were non-union personnel, including managers and a key director. union lawyers were horrified to be read into what happened. while they couldn't yet tell the union what happened, they had power of attorney and immediately both drew up suits alleging everything they could, and tacking on immense damages. they went after them for civil damages for privacy breaches (that could get them settlements), offenses to union rules (like conspiracy to hinder representation, that could get them favorable rulings in arbitration) and breaches of lawyer ethics (legal misconduct, willful misrepresentation, etc) that could potentially get ecls disbarred. they stopped short of charges that would become criminal, as there's no way to bargain once it's in the crown's hands, something the ecls should have thought about in the first place. while they could not even tell union management what they were working on (as per gpa's gag order), they could legally tell them that their billable hours would go up by an order of magnitude and they needed one extra lawyer, which rang huge red alarms. the union was on war footing. this went on for awhile, with most everyone still in the dark but suspecting something unusual was going on. people in many departments started losing access to tools under new security policies that popped up out of the blue. sysadmins could no longer see customer billing files, plaintext passwords became harder to access, someone in sales couldn't use tech diag tools anymore, frontline staff were no longer allowed to ask for passwords without permission from senior line, etc. my department is probably one of very few that didn't lose any useful tools. as the shadow legal battle began to draw on, i'm fairly certain breaches to the gag orders happened on both sides, though it's impossible to prove. the ecls were now negotiating directly with the union's lawyers and everything suggests they were blinking hard on firing everyone, they wanted a deal, but they had opened a pandora's box they couldn't close. the police report suggesting likely fraud meant that crown could very well bring charges of it's own and the corporation was now vulnerable legally to things like contempt or obstruction of justice if they did a 180. so they ultimately just did it. they fired everyone, unionized or not. only the person in each couple who was lying about their address was fired, not their so, except in the case of the two union reps; they fired them both, which was completely bogus - one of them got their job back and significant damages in arbitration 18 months later, but the rest all lost, fallen in the field of a senseless battle. the promised civil suits for damages all vanished as the company had no desire to go hard after their lost managers, which they hardly wanted to let go in the first place, and they had to demonstrate equal treatment. they clearly helped them land equivalent jobs at other companies while playing hardball with our own. ultimately the final tally was 7 union down, 12 non-union. some of them were good friends. no criminal charges were filed by the crown. there was a big 'shakeup' at legal awhile later, because the counter suits our lawyers filled had clear merits in many cases and had to be horse traded for things they had no desire to give. this is a bit weird, but it's how it happens. whenever one side is losing a suit too badly, it more often ends up settled, with related changes to the work contract the other side wanted rather than actually risking rulings with huge damages. in the end, it's fairly obvious that the company came to understand the president and legal had gone in way too hard, and the common sense idea of simply warning everyone that this had to end would have been much better. - tl:dr 2/2 - the ecl's hopes to focus on the union backfired, as more non-union were doing it. the court understood what was going on and brought in union lawyers. they forced the company to update it's policies. sadly, they had painted into such a corner they had to fire everyone even once they no longer wanted to. our own lawyers made multiple gains when fighting back but we could only save one of the 8 union fallen on the field, because it was really deemed to be fraud in the end. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](long time lurker, first post, yadda yadda... this might actually be one of the first stories of my tech support live, even though i technically don't work in tech support. 20 years ago i was the proud owner of a commodore amiga 500, 512kb ram and no harddisk. so every program or game had to be booted from floppy disk and the floppy drive was loud. i was spending the weekend at my grandparents place when my dad called. (i was 11 or so at that time) dad: hey, sentryy, i want to write a letter, but somehow that program won't work. me: what doesn't work? dad: i can't find the symbol that starts the word processor (*i really can't remember the name*) me: okay, what have you done since you started it? dad: nothing! *of course* me: can you please restart the amiga so i can guide you to the program? dad restarts the amiga and i can hear the floppy drive working. *brrrr tic tic tic tic tic brrrrrrrrrrrrr tic tic brrrrrr tic tic ...* me: eh, dad? i think you inserted the wrong disk. dad: what? don't mess with me, how do you want to know that? me: trust me, it's the wrong disk. dad: if you're trying to make fun of me- me: just remove the disk and tell me what's on the label. dad: eh ... "workbench" me: yeah, that's the wrong one. you need "amiga word" (*not sure on that one*) i hear him searching through the disks and inserting a disk. *brrrr tic tic brrrrrrrrr brrp brrp tic tic ...* me: yeah, that's the one. dad: wtf? the screen is still blank, how can you know that?! me: i can hear it. dad: *silence* - ah, okay, i see the symbol now that i usually click on when i use that program. me: glad i could help, bye. i hear unbelieving muttering before he hangs up. ---- and that's the story of how i learned to diagnose computer problems by ear. it was later augmented by the blinking rhythm of activity leds. part of me misses the time when hdds were louder. with all this fance ssd stuff, my psychic powers are less useful. **tl;dr:** every disk has its own rhythm edit: typos edit 2: found a [video of an actual floppy loading]( on a a1200first time posting, but won't be my last. so first, a little background. i work in an it support center for a college as a part-time employee and work at an it repair center full-time. i enjoy computers, but customers are a whole different story. so last week i was at the college and i had to run the phones and take calls. something i usually don't do. day goes by then i get a call from the art dept. &gt;me: hello this is batman from it how can i help you. &gt;art: well we have the mobile projector in room #___ and it doesn't seem to be working. me being the jokester that i am proceeded with. &gt;me: well have you tried plugging in the projector cart? &gt;art: one sec... *plugs in projector* &gt;art: well that's new, but now it's working. thanks. *hangs up* &gt;me: *bashes head on wall*i am a network engineer for an msp and we handle a number of clients. being on the engineering team, i rarely field phone calls, but we were short-handed one day so i was back in the trenches. i received a phone call from $user who is unable to access their files on the shared drive. keep in mind that this location is in another country (canada) and doesn't have the same procedures as the us branches. i then proceeded to do basic troubleshooting. i quickly come to the conclusion that they have gotten some sort of ransomware as all of the files, even shortcuts, have the ".vvv" extension. interestingly, the file last modified dates were all 12/11/2015. even more interestingly, there were two sets of the helpdecrypt.html files, one of which with a .vvv extension. huh. so that means that the entire volume was not encrypted once, but twice. i informed $user of the situation, promptly disabled the unc share, nuked the entire directory and began restoring from our daily backups (of which we retain backups from up to 3 years ago). $user was very understanding, as this isn't the first time this has happened at this location. in fact it was the 5th in under a year. i've recommended that the entire staff there be submitted for it safety training and we're pushing through a phishing test as well. i found the users responsible and shut their machines down remotely followed quickly by a phone call telling them to ship the machines back to corporate for reimaging. how no one there noticed that all of the files on their shared drive were encrypted for 3 months is beyond me. this was supposedly a business critical system.12/30/14 a lot of employees have been here for a long time. . decades, even. but annie has been here for over 40 years. i don’t know how old she is but if i had to guess i would say around 75. she recently battled cancer and has recovered, although she walks around the office a little bit more slowly now. on the week before christmas she left a big box of chocolate covered cookies on the table in it, and a card on each of our desks. each one had a $25 gift card. the morning we came in and saw all this the helpdesk specialist and i ran out to kroger and got her a plant with some red flowers and a card that had a dove shaped, detachable xmas ornament on the front. inside it said “may peace be with you in your life and always” or something to that effect. we left them on her desk when she wasn’t there. she came downstairs later that morning with tears in her eyes and thanked us and told us how thankful she was to have us in her life. the story would be over at this point, but it turns out she had a favor to ask of someone in it, and i turned out to be the one she asked. she needed a voice-mail pulled off her phone and she didn’t have the slightest idea how to do that. as she gave her old flip phone to me she said “what you’re doing will mean a whole lot to someone.” i wondered what she meant. i got some free time later that day and i dialed voice-mail. the first one was business-related. . that didn't seem like the one. the next one started and i suddenly knew this was the one she was referring to. as it started playing i could hear some quiet music in the background. then a man started talking in an old, tired sounding voice “i love you baby, i love you anne. and thank you for everything you’ve ever done for me, and are still doing for me. i don’t know if i’ll ever be able to repay you. just to be the man that you know i, that you want me to be. that’s all i can promise you. but i’m ok. ok. i just want to let you know i’m safe. i love you, goodnight, bye.” whether he was addressing annie or some other anne, i don’t know. all i know is that she said it would make a woman very happy, and after i recorded with my iphone and burned it to two cds (one data and one music) annie said that i did make someone very happy. she said that the man in the voice-mail was someone’s husband who died, and this voice-mail on her phone was the last time his wife ever heard his voice. the next day there was a visa gift card for $100 on my desk. i bought a tiffany style turtle lamp with a stained glass shell. i even bought the bulbs and had amazon gift wrap it. i left it on her desk. i spent $95 on it and kept $5 for myself. she sent me an email the next day: hungry_weevil good morning! thank you for the beautiful gift. i will always cherish the light. it is a spiritual artifact - i will use during meditation. god’s love and light to you and your success 2015 love a everyone once in a while, i'll put on my best doctor cox impersonation and call a junior engineer by a girls name, then go on some stupid little rant. it's all in good fun, and enough people have seen scrubs or a /u/zachinoz ama that they get the joke quickly and we all get a good laugh. this morning was just another one of those days, but i'm actually quite proud of it myself. i've noticed recently that our monitoring company is quite lazy. they handle all alerts and tickets that occur between 6pm and 7am, but if an alert were to be triggered at, say, 6:40am, they will hold that ticket until 7 and then send it up to us to be worked. their main problem is that they actually forward the original alert to us, and it's timestamped, so i know what they're up to. i woke up a bit early this morning and saw this very thing happen. i checked the site to see that it was already back up, and saw that the circuit had came back up 12 minutes before he bothered to send the alert. after all, he had to wait for the cutoff time so he didn't have to work on it. i shot an email back telling this guy that it was his issue and he needed to work on it, but an email argument went back and forth for a few minutes before my boss put an end to that. he asked me if i could prove my point, i said yes, and he had an emergency conference call and webex so i could do just that. everyone dials in (i was surprised we had 11 people on a call at 9am with less than 10 minutes notice) and i'm made presenter. i quickly login into the device and show that the last flap (up) was 12 minutes before the alert was sent to us. the guy was sitting there saying that it was down and i looked at the user logs to see that he was logged in shortly after the flap and was still logged in when the alert was emailed. everyone saw my screen as i'm highlighting this part of the log files. for some reason, doctor cox came out... &gt;wwww(hhhhhhhhhhhh)eeeeeeeeellllllll... what do we have here? it appears that the little princess here knew damn well what was going on but was too lazy to find a root cause. you see, logs are like hips, *shakira*. they just don't lie. i don't think i've heard so much laughter in an emergency morning meeting in my entire career. so i was settling down to go to bed one night around 11:30 when my phone rings. my boss tells me that he is having an "email emergency." i tell him (politely) that he is shit out of luck because there is no way i am coming in that late at night and to wait until the next morning. i wake up to about 12 texts and a voicemail that are basically "i fixed the problem", "the problem is back", "when are you coming in? please hurry!" now let me be clear, this guy has an "email emergency" on a monthly basis, but it wasn't until i got to the text saying he would pay me a $100 bonus if i fixed the problem before noon that i took his request seriously. if he was willing to throw in an extra hundred bucks, there is probably a real problem. so i rush to get to the office around 9:30 and my boss is frantically typing on his computer. he tells me that he thinks client emails aren't coming through so he has been sending himself constant test emails and none of them are coming through either. i sit down and check all of the usual suspects. account settings were right across all his devices, the network was fine, i sent a couple of test emails and they came through fine. i asked him to send a test email to himself because i wanted to see if the server was bouncing them back for some reason. it was at this point i realised what the problem was. he was typing in his own email address incorrectly (which is *firstname*rentals@gmail.com). he had been sending dozens of emails with the subject line "test" to someone else all night/that morning. i informed him of the typo and he just kind of stood there contemplating the fact that he **literally** **spelled** **his** **own** **name** **wrong.** turns out he wasn't missing emails, it was just a slow email day. he gave me the $100 out of sheer embarrassment. tl;dr: boss thinks he isn't getting emails, tries sending emails to himself. doesn't get the test emails, calls me late at night repeatedly. he was typing his own email address wrong, paid me $100 to fix a typo. just a short one here. at my school had to fix an issue with a teachers personal laptop. turns out she was on leave. call her up and ask for a screen shot. she says she will mail it to me. find a pdf file in my mail. thinking nothing of it i open it to find out that the teacher scanned her monitor and sent the pdf. i think there is a face shaped dent in my desk from where my face hit it. edit: the obligatory holy shit this blew up[previous]( friday - early afternoon a raging storm outside echoed my mood after i got back from the legal department after an hour of arguing about bills. everyone wanted a fight today. the phone on my desk started to ring. i looked down at it disappointingly, i was hoping for a quiet nap. traitorous phone. &gt;sassy: it? someone's stolen my screen! &gt;me: what? &gt;sassy: i was sending an email, then i realized. someone had stolen my screen! i tried to stifle another yawn, it brought the taste of peach tea back to my mouth. i almost gagged. &gt;me: how did they steal a screen mid email? how's that even possible? did you see them walk off with it? &gt;sassy: no, stupid. they didn't steal it **as** i was typing the email. i realized they had stolen it *while* typing an email. i'm not sure if it was just my tiredness, but my mind couldn't make sense what sassy was saying. &gt;me: okay go back a few steps. you turned on your computer, you could see the login screen? &gt;sassy: of course i could see it. how else would i log on? &gt;me: okay so you had the screen when you logged on. then you started typing your email and.... &gt;sassy: no! i don't think it was there when i logged on. i'm not sure though. i only noticed when i started my email. i was monumentally confused, and very tired. &gt;me: so did you see it when you logged on? &gt;sassy: no! &gt;me: but, you said... &gt;sassy: listen to when i'm saying. i logged on. i started typing my email, then i realized the screen was gone. i sat confusedly at my desk. my head was spinning. &gt;me: okay... &gt;sassy: well, what are you going to do about it? i can't work under these conditions. &gt;me: yes, i imagine working without a screen would be hard. okay, can you borrow another computer while we sort out where your screen went? &gt;sassy: why would i? every other computer here is the same as mine at the moment. a whole department's worth of screens had gone missing? i had a sinking feeling. &gt;me: wait. there are no screens in marketing? none at all? &gt;sassy: no. there are heaps of screens, but none of the spare computers have double screens, which is what i want. &gt;me: oh. double screens. of course. my tired head hit the desk. i wanted sleep. &gt;sassy: so?! &gt;me: i'll sort it out monday. for today, you'll have to make do with a single screen. &gt;sassy: but i need to type an email... **click** silence. lovely silence. ***** the silence lasted about thirty seconds. i heard screaming. &gt;redcheer: **hesitant! what the hell have you done?** i got up off my chair with a sigh. getting to my door, the entire it staff were frozen. redcheer was furious, standing at her desk. hesitant was standing at the door to the department, drenched in water, a confused look on his face. &gt;hesitant: what? &gt;redcheer: i can't believe you, you little s#%t. i too wore an expression similar to hesitant's. total confusion. pantsuit looked shocked and turned to redcheer. &gt;pantsuit: is this true?... pantsuit pointed down at her email. i walked back to my computer, two emails sat in my inbox, both sent company wide. &gt;**new email** please disregard last email. i sent it to the wrong group. --redcheer, it. &gt;**new email** vp, &gt; i cant wait too see you again, your house is so much nicer then mine. thanks again for cheering me up the other day by bringing cake to it. that felt special. --your red devil, redcheer. my mouth was wide open. i walked back out to the department, redcheer was furious. she was busy shouting at hesitant, who remained oddly calm &gt;redcheer: you did this... &gt;hesitant: how could i? **you** just sent me off to fix the vp's new pda, which couldn't connect to the other building's wifi and since he apparently was incapable of typing in the password himself i had to run out through the rain to go do it myself. i only just got back. i haven't been near a computer. redcheer was so mad, she was speechless. i was trying to stifle a yawn. pantsuit looked like every christmas had come at once. &gt;pantsuit: don't worry redcheer. whoever sent it, also sent a please disregard the previous email. so no-one will read it. pantsuit was trying to keep a straight face and not laugh. a knock at the door of it drew everyone's attention. standing behind hesitant, the shadowed figure of the vp. [next]( [previous]( &gt;me: how is this even… &gt;defiant: let me have a look! i stared down frustrated at the laptop's warning. an annoyed hr worker stood beside me, chocolate smudges all over his face. **the power adapter type cannot be determined. please plug in a manufactures power adapter to charge the battery** &gt;chocolate: see?! the battery doesn't charge, if you unplug it… bam…. computer turns off. &gt;me: where is your power adapter? chocolate handed me the power adapter. it was the correct type and in good condition. &gt;defiant: maybe its a settings problem? defiant then started searching deep in the power settings. i knew it wasn't a settings problem though, but i didn't have the heart to tell defiant, he seemed so happy looking through settings. &gt;chocolate: it's really frustrating. every time i bump the power cord out, i lose all my work. &gt;defiant: i can't see a problem with the settings. must be that the adapter is broken…. i smiled as defiant had come to the correct solution. i started to wrap the cords of the power adapter so we could replace it, but it was pulled from my grasp by defiant. &gt;defiant: don't worry though… i know how to fix it. *fast* &gt;chocolate: oh. good. i like fast. i opened my mouth to object, but defiant had already run off. he returned moments later. &gt;me: defiant, pass me that power adapter. it needs replacing. &gt;defiant: no, no, don't worry. it's already fixed. defiant bent down and plugged in the computer. it sprang to life, and the battery started charging. &gt;chocolate: woah! it's already working. &gt;defiant: see… defiant smiled up at me. i was dismayed at the surprising success. dismayed and suspicious… &gt;me: how did you… &gt;defiant: it's like you with the printer… a magic touch. very suspicious. &gt;me: what did you do to it? &gt;defiant: a magician never reveals his secrets… ultra suspicious. &gt;me: what happens if i need to fix another one and you're not here? defiant smiled and thought carefully for a moment. &gt;defiant: fair point. okay, i'll tell you. the other day i was here in hr, i noticed a laptop over in the corner, which never gets used. it had the same charger. i just swapped them. &gt;me: …. suspicion confirmed. the silence reigned for a moment as my mind collected everything that was wrong with defiant's "fix". defiant started getting nervous under my gaze. &gt;defiant: what?! everyone wins. chocolate's computer is working, and we can get on with more interesting things. &gt;me: defiant. this is **not** everyone wins. think for a second, what happens when someone else uses that charger? &gt;defiant: then we have to come up again. plus if it's after hours you might even get double time. triple win. defiant seemed to be in an argumentative mood. i however was not. &gt;me: that charger wasn't working right, however it was *still* pushing out some power… which means something in that adapter is eating up *some* of the output power. if that part instead of **partially** failing, that part decides to fail completely it'll either catch fire or explode. now who wins then? &gt;defiant: oh. defiant looked slightly downtrodden, chocolate however picked up the argument. &gt;chocolate: i thought no one uses that computer though… &gt;me: chocolate… &gt;chocolate: yep. &gt;me: shut up. as we walked away, broken power adapter in hand, defiant looked sad. i thought about consoling him, but decided against it. &gt;defiant: do you have to prove me wrong all the time? why not just tell me to shut it, like chocolate. &gt;me: i don't really care what chocolate thinks about it. a faint smile let me know defiant understood. [next]([previous]( wednesday afternoon i was staring at a screen that seemed impossible. it had hung on the logo of the company that made the computer. bios error. &gt;sassy: it just sits like that, for hours. i was hammering f1 - f12, the delete button, enter. nothing seemed to be responding. &gt;me: not ideal. i looked around marketing office. all the other computers seemed to be working properly. perfectly even. &gt;sassy: since i’m now so far behind in my work, can you tell my supervisor i can’t do anything today? &gt;me: you only submitted a ticket 10 minutes ago. i looked at the clock in the corner of the room. it was almost three. &gt;sassy: yeah but… i’ve been troubleshooting for hours. even before it broke. i deserve the rest of the day off. &gt;me: wait **you** were troubleshooting? i looked upon the screen with a new found affection. poor thing. &gt;sassy: i was on the phone to (people that make the computer) for ages. we were updating, and moving things…. &gt;me: specifically, what did you update? &gt;sassy: files. folders. i donno! ask the (computer manufacturer) guy. i’m too tired for all this questioning. sassy’s demeanour defied logic. i was tempted to just revoke all computer privileges, but alas it is meant to help. i tried turning it off and on a few times. holding down various keys. sassy got more and more impatient as i worked. &gt;sassy: can i like… go? home now. &gt;me: unfortunately its only 3 o’clock. do you remember what things you moved around? or anything you tried to update? she looked at me and breathed out slowly. &gt;sassy: three… aww. it doesn’t feel like three though. feels more like, home time. right? &gt;me: no .. just…. bios. did you see the word bios anywhere? i was feeling pretty frustrated at this point. sassy didn’t seem to care. &gt;sassy: you’re talking like that guy. on the phone. he just said stuff needed updating, okay? so he pointed me to the site and i kinda… accidentally hung up on him .. so i just decided to install everything. &gt;me: you went to (computer manufacturers) site, and decided to install everything? sassy got up and started walking away. &gt;me: where are you going? sassy turned around slowly. &gt;sassy: feels like home time. &gt;me: just sit down. now did you install everything from that site? &gt;sassy: yes, and i thought that would fix it, but the darn thing just kept popping up with boxes and boxes. it took *soooo* long. i worked hard on getting through all of it. i waited patiently for her to continue. after a great pause she decided to keep going. &gt;sassy: i read all of it, pressed all the right buttons, worked my fingers to the bone. then right as i thought maybe it would all work out and i could continue my work day. **blam** it starts just… restarting. over and over. i just wanted to get back to work but it wouldn’t let me. eventually i gave up, unplugged it. i tried turning it on normally and then it just … stopped. &gt;me: you… unplugged it, while it was restarting? oh darn it all. &gt;sassy: see what i’ve had to put up with all day? just madness. now can i please. please. go home. my mouth was wide open. i could not believe it. this was just…. i wanted to be angry, i wanted to cry, i wanted to at least be shocked. instead i just smiled and quietly packed up the computer. &gt;sassy: so… can i go? &gt;me: talk to your manager. &gt;sassy: you’re a manager! i gave sassy my best one thousand yard stare. &gt;me: no. talk to *your* manager. sassy gave a huff. &gt;sassy: geeez … don’t have to be sassy about it. damm. [next](this is by far my best and most memorable story while working at a computer repair company. a middle aged woman dropped her daughters laptop off because it wasn't working...or to be more accurate, was so plagued with viruses the hard drive should've been take out back and shot. i spent some time going over it and gave her a call to let her know a backup, format and reinstall would be the best course of action. she declined because it would cost r550 (~$39) and said she'd be back in the morning to collect. she came in to pick up but needed to leave again so she could get some cash for our r100 (~$7) minimum labour fee. that was the last i saw of her for 7 months. out of the blue she came into the store to to collect the laptop, but we had re-purposed it, as store policy was that if a pc or laptop is unclaimed after 6 months we resell it or scrap it. i informed her of what had happened and she and her daughter left but she would be back in the morning with her desktop which was not turning on. true to her word, she re-materialized the next day with a her pc in tow, wrapped up in several black bin bags. she informed me that it had stopped working after her son had borrowed it for the weekend and she had been trying to get it to turn on with no success. okay, doesn't sound too major, may just be a blown power supply. i checked it in and because i still had a lot on my plate that morning, put it on the shelf and would get round to it later in the day. a few hours later... as the mid afternoon rolls in, it's time to see what's wrong with this machine. i start cutting through the several layers of manky black bin bags wondering what kind of horrors i'm about to come across when i finally reach the case. first thing i notice is that the side panels are loose. interesting, what's happened here then. i pull the tower from its cocoon and it quickly becomes obvious why this thing isn't working. it had been gutted. **everything** (except for the dvd drive) had been removed and was nowhere to be found. after about 5 minutes of laughing, i summon the other techs to see if they can lend me any assistance in figuring out why this pc isn't turning on. they look at it in disbelief after i tell them it's not a joke and was a legitimate customer who brought it in and we all had a good laugh about it. grant called the lady up because he wanted to be the one to tell her that the computer she brought in wasn't a computer any more and that she should probably have a good chat with her son. she picked it up the next day free of charge albeit angry. to this day i still wonder what she was trying to plug the power cord into. **tl;dr:** customer didn't know why her gutted pc wasn't turning on. this isn't a story about me, but one from an uncle i love who was remarkably knowledgeable about technology back in his day. **fade to black and white!** this tale occurs in the early 1970s. everyone always called him joe, since he was born back when it was cool to name at least a few of your kids joseph. joe did all sorts of work when he was young. he got his education studying to be a priest, but decided he liked girls and booze a little too much to go through with it ;) then he went on to be a lumberjack, an accountant, a vietnam-war volunteer, worked a gig at what passed as a startup back then - learning everything about punch cards. they went bankrupt, and then he became a road tech for a tiny company pulling copper wire all over a city where there was simply no cable network. this tiny company would ultimately become part of the telco i work for today. after having worked in the field awhile, his accounting experience landed him a cushier gig in a long-defunct and then-tiny department that essentially did everything hr, payroll and logistics do here today. it's difficult to fathom, but over 40 years ago, things were incredibly different. he told me tales about how back then, a simple low-rung employee could make decisions that today could only be made by the board of directors after the evil corporate lawyers signed on with a super-majority. but this tale is about the day he was asked to choose between two technical solutions to help the company get into the computing age early. he had a boss who wanted into the computing era early. perhaps too early. &gt; 1970sboss: "we're looking at ibm's new 128 column card and at hollerith's card. i know ibm has more capacity, they are pricier, but since you did some work in that field i'd like your input before i turn in paper." &gt; joe: "er, sure, let's start by what they're going to be used for?" &gt; 1970sboss: "well, that should be obvious. we want to computerize - if we do it early, we beat our competition. the goal is to put *everything* related to accounting and hr on those. the vp is in, i have a large budget. payroll will have everything on cards, it'll be so efficient, we'll make major gains. but i do want to know which is the best solution, so i asked three employees - including you - with expertise in the field which to pick. can you look at it and get back to me by friday?" joe was silent a moment and nodded. came friday. the first employee was a strong defender of ibm's card, even though it cost more. the second argued that there were many flaws with this card, and that most people saw it as a 96 rather than 128 column card because there were huge issues reading the 4th row and suggested hollerith's. joe came in with a huge box filled with paper. a secretary was helping him cause it was too heavy for one person. on top of the box was an ibm punch card and an hollerith card. &gt; joe: "first, i'd like to congratulate ibm on their momentum, even though it's overpriced and there are some issues, they did slightly expand on what you can do with a punch card right now. but i'm not exactly here to recommend buying either." he removed both cards from his cargo, and put a relatively thin stack of paper next to them. &gt; joe: "that small stack of paper is the amount of data you can store on the best punch card that exists right now, i triple checked. it won't be this way forever, but right now it's the best money can buy. tons of great uses for them anyway. what they may not be so useful for is storing accounting data. the huge box next to these that i only pulled a single folder from? that's just the data from the last quarter from the provincial health board regarding work-related injuries, a rather small slice of the stuff accounting deals with." &gt; 1970sboss: "huh. so, what's your point? we should look into a different card?" &gt; joe: "there's nothing to be gained by trying to move our accounting to punch cards right now. in fact, i can get through that paper stack in a week, but if i had the same data on punch cards, i'd still be making excuses a month from now. i'm sure punch cards will get better; more data in less space. but right now? nobody in my department - me least of all - thinks it would help any. not for the kind of work we do. wait till the technology matures before making this kind of investment." the old boss dismissed him, but ultimately, they chose not to go ahead right away with the punch cards. just a few years later, once early computing was becoming actually efficient for the kind of work they needed, they went all in early, and joe approved at the time. it paid off in spades. had they blown their money on last-gen cards, they might have been late on the industry rather than pioneers. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!]([previous]( walking near the vp is always a problem, he doesn’t seem to enjoy silence. &gt;vp: so… how are you going, is it all good? &gt;me: yep. good. i tried to get out of sync with the vp’s footsteps, but the vp continually managed to get back in sync. we looked like we were marching. &gt;vp: why are you taking my computer away again? it’s so fast now. &gt;me: unauthorized access. &gt;vp: can’t we just ask what the boy did. then if it was just a de-frag … leave it, because it is at least twice as fast at the moment. &gt;me: oh we’ll ask him. still, its better to just wipe and start again though. safer that way. i stutter stepped a few times. the vp, ignored it and somehow end up in sync within a second. it was almost impressive. &gt;vp: how long will it take? &gt;me: a few hours. max. i’ll get you a loaner laptop for the interim. the vp looked thoughtful. he seemed to toss up the options in his head. &gt;vp: no, don’t worry. i’ll just wait. &gt;me: oh. are you sure? &gt;vp: it’ll be fine. in fact i probably don’t even need a computer anymore! &gt;me: er. okay. it’ll only be a few hours i suppose. we arrived at his office and i started unplugging his desktop. he sat down at his desk and started looking thoughtful. &gt;vp: airz. do me a favor, take the screen off my desk. i placed the screen on the floor. the vp carelessly tossed the keyboard and mouse over at the floor next to me. narrowly missing my head. &gt;vp: oh my… the vp spread his arms out over the desk. running them smoothly across the now empty surface. &gt;vp: my desk. its so big! i had successfully unplugged the desktop and stood up to leave. desktop in hand. &gt;vp: airz! wait. you forgot to take the screen. &gt;me: we’ve got screens downstairs for the install. &gt;vp: no, take it now. so you don’t have to do a double trip. &gt;me: taking it isn’t required. you’ll need it again when your desktop comes back. the vp looked taken a back. he had recoiled in horror. &gt;vp: comes back?! no. no. no. have you seen what my desk looks like without a computer cluttering things up? it’s so smooth. so nice. i don’t think i’ll require the desktop back. &gt;me: … you don’t want your computer back? the idea sounded suspicious. i didn’t know if i should be overjoyed or worried. &gt;vp: no. i think i’m better off without one. a vp’s computer can’t do much. &gt;me: but, you’ve access to every department… the vp’s face looked determined. &gt;vp: i’ve decided. this office looks better without a computer. &gt;me: well.. okay. i guess you won’t be seeing much of it anymore then. i walked over and attempted to juggle the screen and desktop in two hands. it was too much. the vp was smiling. &gt;vp: don’t worry. i’ll still be connected. the vp waved a little box in the air. it contained a new pda. i then realized the vp would now solely *rely* on a pda. f@%$. [next]([this comment]( reminded me i had to post this tale! when i'm not working from home, my office is in a tall skyscrapper. underneath it is a parking lot. underneath that is a core headend that's supposed to be able to survive a direct nuclear strike built to specs in the 80s, based on what the government thought would most likely be lobbed our way in case of an all-out soviet first strike. few years ago, we were in technology readiness tests for wifi repeaters. the end goal was to ensure that every customer who brought or rented one of our routers would have perfect coverage in their entire homes, no matter how vast. it's another money-losing gimmick that upper management really wanted us to push. orders come down from the office of the president to road techs' manglement. as a test, they're supposed to get those to work in multiple locations, including some headends where this would be most challenging. but 'mine' is behind feets of concrete and heavy metal doors made out of some obscure alloy supposed to survive soviet nukes, no wifi will ever get through. &gt; bytewave: "senior line, bytewave, you may send..." &gt; road manglement: "patching you to our most senior road tech, input required. apparently something can't be done. i'm told you're the department to call when this happens." well, i'm a tiny bit vain, and he stroked the right buttons. let's make miracles happen.. as he explains the situation, my first answer is "well, you're pretty fucked but it's not your fault." there's zero ways to get a repeater to work past blast doors. but then again, it's a damn core headend, the entire region works only because of this. blast proof or not there's connectivity. &gt; bytewave: "so, the real goal of the exercise is to demonstrate the ability of the repeaters themselves, or your department's ability to get a signal in tough to reach locations?" &gt; senior roadtech: "in theory, who knows, but really - the latter. my boss made that very clear. unlike pretty much everything else about this thing." &gt; bytewave: "yeah, you were right when you told your boss to call us to back up the fact it can't be done. it can't. but i might have an idea to impress the wide ties. (union slang for upper management) fiber optics are going in and out of this headend, no matter how much concrete was poured. i don't know where but you do. there's always an entry and an exit. have the repeaters get to the entry point, go through the existing wiring, and then on the other side, set up the repeaters to give total coverage - generously assuming you need more than one in there." &gt; senior roadtech: "well, that's obvious cheating, they'll figure it out in no time." &gt; bytewave: "really, you worked for the same union i do for decades, and you still think they'll figure it out? the only thing to figure out is the fact they handed down an assignment that's physically impossible. now you can skirt the rules or just say i confirmed it's indeed impossible, either way i got no skin in this particular crazy game beyond this ticket i already closed." &gt; senior roadtech: "... why not give it a try. from what i gathered they really want wifi to get into this bunker." and so it happens, the bunker's hard structure is circumvented and they get 'wifi' coverage in there. it goes down to the entry point, then though well protected fiber optics deep in concrete, then wifi again. totally cheating, but there's wifi coverage everywhere, right? weeks later, i'm cc'd on an email from the secretary of the president thanking everyone for great work and saying the repeaters are moving to business-readiness. yeah, totally a cheat. but when you're given insane directions you do what you can. to this day the 'office of the president' still thinks we got repeaters working through blast doors. monday midday i’d had enough. two audits was too much even for half a day. time to call in the big boss. as i rang the big boss i wondered how much money was wasted on passed audits in the world. with managers like mine, probably all of it. &gt;boss: airz, good morning - ish. &gt;me: president i was wondering, did you know i’m currently under two audits? &gt;boss: two does seem a little excessive. &gt;me: two external audits. i could hear the boss get mad. steam pouring from his ears. &gt;boss: we aren’t made of money! those things aren’t cheap. &gt;me: perhaps… &gt;boss: perhaps the vp’s trying to screw everyone. two audits… two. auditors cost more then a high class prostit…. &gt;me: er… &gt;boss: don’t worry airz. i’ll get rid of one of the auditors. just wait at it, i’ll send down security to escort them off the premises. &gt;me: bit excessive… but okay. as i waited for security to arrive i got chatting to audit. screechy listened on, but refused to talk. &gt;audit: i gotta say airz, its been a while since ive seen my nephew work so well. he seems happy here. just this weekend he said you’d put him in charge of the whole phone roll out. &gt;me: yeah, he’s been working out okay. audit smiled. he actually seemed okay, even if he did prefer tea. security arrived shortly after. &gt;sec: we’re here to escort an auditor off the premises. the security guards look between the two auditors. &gt;sec: say, boss. which er…. auditor do we escort away? i looked between the two auditors. better the devil you know right? &gt;me: miss screechy. please follow these security guards. it was at this point that the security guards mobile rang. &gt;sec: hello, this is security. he put the phone on speaker. &gt;vp: please escort auditor off the premises. &gt;sec: not miss screechy? &gt;vp: no. auditor. the security guards left the room with auditor. there i was, standing alone next to a person i’d tried to fire. and she was my auditor. darn. [next]( [older](one idle day at the [retail]( [shop]( i'm on the sales floor, since it's a bit more pleasant than the shop area. one of the salespeople waves me over. he's got a customer looking for an adapter that the salesperson is unfamiliar with. salesguy:"lawtechie. this customer is looking for an adapter to connect his playstation to his imac" me:"uh-huh. connect in what way?" customer:"you know, so like the playstation would connect to the imac" me:"right. what would this look like when we're done?" customer:"well, you know, they'd be connected" me:"yeah. you said that. would they be networked?" customer:"would that do it?" me:"what is it that it would do when we're done?" customer:"see, i don't have a tv" me:"and you want to view the playstation via your imac's screen" customer:"yeah. i didn't see the adapter" me:"which imac do you have?" customer:"the blue one" me:"well, that model doesn't have an external video in port. theoretically, you could disassemble it, plug another db-15 cable into the monitor, pin it out to vga on the other end and plug that into your playstation. you'd have to drill a hole in the case and cobble together some kind of a/b switch as well." customer(pointing at a wall of various cables and adapters):"so, which adapter is it?" me:"no such adapter exists. this is the first time i've ever heard of someone wanting to use their imac as an external monitor" customer:"so, you can't just plug it in?" me:"no. what i'm describing is a day long project, modifying existing hardware to make it do something that apple didn't consider when they designed it" customer:"how much would that cost?" me:"a day's labor? probably $800 or so" customer:"i can't afford that. a new tv is only $300" me:"that might be a better option for you" customer:"you were trying to rip me off" me:"no. i was trying to explain that what you want is possible, even if it's not cost-effective" customer:"you were trying to rip me off. i'm just a poor college student" long time lurker, first post. not very interesting story, but i have to vent. some background: 1) i work for the mayor's office. i am responsible for maintenance and support of all machines in my town. 2) have three employees: fatgamer, dumbcrazy and crosseyed. the last 2 are interns. 3) this happened 15 minutes ago. ------------------------------------------------------------ most of the time we just have to reinstall some networked printer who went offline for whatever reasons, or check why there's no internet connection (usually somebody just turned off the modem 'to save power'), but sometimes whe get older machines (all desktops) with users complaining that they are slow. normally we just cleanup the dust, do a virus/malware scan and/or format and reinstall, since we don't use any special software, just office/winrar. not so often we have some spare parts like a better memory, or a faster hd, and upgrade the machine the best we can. so this machine came to us. crosseyed pick the ticket and proceed as usual. suddenly... crosseyed: - boss, i think this machine came toasted. me: - no, the client said it was ok, just running slow. i know them, they're reliable. check again. ce: - boss, the machine isn't powering on. me: - did you checked if the power cable was plugged in? because you did this once... ce: - yeah boss, i checked. me: - did you checked if it is 110v or 220v? on their site they have both. ce: - yeah. me: - strange. let me see. i go check this poor baby, and the first i smell is that sad scent of a deep fried motherboard. me: - crosseyed, come here. ce: - 'sup? me: - tell me exactly what you did. ce: - i cleaned it up... me: - ...and... ce: - ...upgraded the ram from 512mb to 2gb... me: - ...and... ce: - ...switched the power supply. me: - and it was all ok? ce: - well, it was a little hard to fit but i managed it. when i turned it on it smelled burned so i turned it off. i had to show him. he did those upgrades hundred of times. but this time he accomplished 2 things i never saw in my life: he managed to plug a ddr2 on a ddr slot... and plugged the power supply backwards. when it doesn't fit he does the one logical thing (on his mind) and cut the power plug in order to fit. **tl; dr: crosseyed intern could fit an square peg on a round hole.** edit: downgraded the 512 gb to mbfirst time at this subreddit, i will definitely have to share what happened today. all begins with the most ambiguous email title for an issue: "subject: fix server asap please fix server " so i called this user, i asked him to be more specific in what was happening, he told me that his applications were not working properly in his iis server, there was a poor performance making everything partial down, and then as he wasn’t the developer he transfer me to this guy… the star of this story. the first time i was talking with this guy he didn’t even say hi, or good morning…the first words i heard from him was: &gt;user: listen dude, let’s make this quickly, just sent someone to put more ram in this server, with the time our applications got bigger and heavier, we require more memory, because we need everything that’s running right now, if you provide more ram this will disappear, its simple logic, you get it? &gt;deycko: sounds fair, but first i have to take a look and make that decision by my own. &gt;user: dude, i just gave you the reason, if you install the ram everything is going to be ok. you say you got it. &gt;deycko: according to system, the last time that server was shuttled down was 1 year ago, so probably we will have to restart the server and see how it goes after that… your applications are not accessible and are currently down so there is no risk or impact in here. &gt;user: oh no no no, dude, no… what’s wrong with you? that’s your solution? if restarting is your solution, i will better call my son, and after that your damn manager. you cannot be serious, i refuse to do such thing, you have no right to say there is no impact, you don’t know nothing. at this point i was getting upset, but i’m not the kind of guy that shows his anger that easy, actually i become more nicely, probably in a sarcastic mode, but nicely. &gt;deycko: all right sir, i will show you why a restart it’s needed, i will connect to your server remotely and…(interrumption) &gt;user: no, you cannot access to my server, that’s my server, it has a password that i only know and there is no way i can give you that password. &gt;deycko: no problem sir, if you are using the corporate intranet i don’t need your credentials. &gt;user: but… just after i was logging into that server i noticed something weird in the task bar, there was a process running that was consuming almost 70% of the memory, and that process was, prepare yourselves: **gta vice city** …so this douche bag, wanted more ram to play videogames in one of the servers of the company, he was about to beat the game (as i also played it in the past) and it was frozen when he was trying to save his progress apparently, so that was maybe the reason he was not ok with performing a restart of the server. i was shocked, this dude was so rude at me because he was playing a game and got freeze. deycko: dude, are you playing gta vice city? **user goes offline** ---------------------------------------- **edit**: of course i sent an email to his "damn" manager, i told him that his applications were down because his employee was using the server to play videogames and also he was being rude about it. i don't have any response yet. i will keep you guys posted. **edit 2**: i got answer from his manager: "you can be sure we will take this very serious, this is totally against our company values, and we are going to take the necessary actions. thanks for your quick response in our issue." this is a tale about a tough call. when you just don't know if you're doing the right thing. not so long ago at my telco, the 'l2l3' chat - a chatroom for senior staff from all departments at my telco - got a message from internal security, the department in charge of contacts with law enforcement and piracy complaints. &gt; is - l2l3 chat: systems, networks - n03-a1b2 to go dark immediately. we'll tell as soon as it can go back up. i blinked hard reading that. that meant bringing down 1200 devices, both cable boxes and mtas. never seen them ask for anything this broad before. wasn't immediately my call anyhow, that's networks' job, not senior tech support. &gt; networks - l2l3 chat: systems can't bring nodes down. as for us, happily. forward copy of warrant to networksmanagement@telco.ca (fictional), will be down in seconds. &gt; is - l2l3 chat: no warrant. bring it down now. &gt; networks - l2l3 chat: no warrant, no outage. you know the policy. very soon after, my emergency line rings. i see the caller id. is repeats their request. i'd never override networks on their own turf - this is the kind of call *they* make. i troubleshoot issues, not create them. but though i kept calm it was hard not to worry i was making the wrong call... &gt; bytewave: "like they said. no warrant, no outage. i've been here over a decade and we never ever shut down a node voluntarily without a warrant. that's 1200 modems and dhcts. why can't we pinpoint something more specific like we usually..." &gt; is: "look, we don't ask this often but this node gotta go dark somehow and quickly. i can't say why but it matters." &gt; bytewave: "okay. wrong department, technical support senior staff can't bring nodes down. systems and networks can, but will only if.." &gt; is: "cut the bs! this is an emergency. i know you have access to their tools, n03-a1b2 needs to go dark now." ... well it's true, tsss loves to collect perms and logins we don't strictly need and i have some i "shouldn't have". technically, i could bring the node down. &gt; bytewave: "just linked this call to the recording software - my boss, and hr's emergency line. if you believe anyone's physical security is at risk, you can tell me right now on the record and yes - i will then have n03-a1b2 down within ten seconds even if it's not my job. if not, then i'd like an in-depth explanation why you're asking the wrong department to create an outage while you..." he hung up. it's a fellow union department and i hated to put them under the spotlight, but trying to circumvent procedure to get a department that's not supposed nor trained to handle this kind of emergency responsible for one? not under my watch unless you can tell me why. the pretext of 'emergencies' is routinely abused. if you can't even tell me what me what the 'emergency' is, won't work with me. it's risky but if there's a real emergency, there's little risk it ends up at tsss. the recording wasn't cut despite him hanging up. &gt; bytewave: "second party appears to have hung up. this is bytewave, employee number x******. no followup on is request's for lack of warrant nor information pertaining to an immediate threat. terminating call." i was sweating a bit, might have been something serious... did i put someone in danger just to stick to the rules? ... almost a minute later... l2 sales rep - l2l3 chat: false alarm regarding n03-a1b2. threat from unsatisfied customer. tv product director on it, no action without tvpd orders. ... might have just lucked out, but i never knew the full story. usually is makes these calls, but i couldn't think of any reason why they wouldn't tell me on record it needed to be done. much relief when it turned out to be an overblown issue and there was no real danger. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](this is my first story, so, all of that or whatever. this occurred at least ten years ago, but probably not more than fifteen years ago. so well into the age where folks generally know about email and the intertubes and such. the star of our tale today is a $salesguy. as far as i know, he was a pretty good sales guy and made a lot of sales, but he had quite a few eccentricities. one of them was, he was constantly stomping up to the copy machine to make copies. of forms that he insisted on filling out on the old style ncr forms, so it already made four copies when he wrote it. i guess he just didn't trust the clerical staff. gotta get that cash. his other weirdnesses included constantly doing a sort of pee pee dance while discussing any topic with anyone. not just shifting from one foot to the other, but bouncing around a fairly large area, jumping and jiving. he also was a blatant personal space invader. yet another was asking every question three times of everyone, with a different inflection each time, as though expecting a different answer. on this day, we find $salesguy inside of my tiny cubicle, looming over me and getting in my face, and taking up the entire area with his strange dance. &gt;$salesguy: "my emails are not going through to my customer! i typed his address in exactly as it was on his business card!" *pee pee dance* &gt;me: "well, i'll take a look. what address are you sending to?" &gt;$salesguy: "my emails are not going through to my customer! i typed it in exactly as it is on his business card!" *more dancing around* &gt;me: "yes, you said that. what address are you sending them to?" &gt;$salesguy: "my emails are not going through to my customer! i typed in his address exactly as it is on his business card." *now dancing and flailing wildly around my tiny cubicle as i shrink in my chair* &gt;me: "yes, i am aware that is why you are here. can i please know what email address you are attempting to send to?" &gt;$salesguy: *thrusts business card an inch in front of my eyes* i graciously accept the business card, and bring it far enough from my face so that i can actually read it. great, this customer's email address is customer@customercompany.com &gt;me: "give me a moment please." i pull up the logs and search. &gt;$salesguy: *flailing and dancing wildly around tiny cube* "this is a really important lead, you better fix this!" found it. failed deliveries to www.customer@customercompany.com &gt;me: "you didn't type it in exactly as it is on the business card. there is no www. in front of it, because it shouldn't be there for an email address. that's why it's not on the business card. just type it in like it is on the business card." &gt;$salesguy: *huffs a few times and stomps off*i was a new starter looking after a client we had taken over 6 months ago who where having lots of issues, the ceo was concerned the old it guy was still accessing the system. i thought that was a bit crazy but strange things were happening, account lockouts, passwords changing, services being disabled, it really felt like something malicious was happening but i couldn't prove anything. then it happened. one afternoon i was light on work so i decided to log into their system and have a poke around. i log onto the terminal server, look at active users. logged in user - backup holy shit, that didn't look right. i bring over my coworker who notices that the computer name has the same initials as the company that the old it guy was currently working for. we look at his ip and bingo, reverse dns shows he is connecting from his old work place. reset his password and displayed this message on his session this is an unauthorised connection, your ip _._._._ has been linked to your domain __.com.au and legal action will follow knowing his session wasn't idle i let that sit for a nice 5 seconds so he could marinate in panic and fear then disconnected his session. logged in and opened outlook and he had everyones mailbox connected to his with full permissions, we checked his sent items nothing .. i hit "recover deleted items" and hey presto, 6 months worth of emails he has been forwarding to himself or forwarding to a women in the office who we discover he is having an affair with ! he is feeding her information from her coworkers and she was using that to her advantage. he had forwarded other emails that i had written to the ceo assuring him the old it guy was not logging in remotely and he had added "haha these guys are fucking idiots, they have no idea. cancelled another backup last night, do you think they will figure it out ? morons." i could not believe what i was reading. i simply can not include all of the incredible things we discovered and the evidence we collected, it was the most exciting it work i have ever done in my life. it was filled with justice and epic wins. **epilogue** the ceo decided to get lawyers involved, i provided them with every scrap of data i could find and they put together this intimidating 200 page document that included itemised lists of connection times, showing he basically logged in every day while working at his new job and tampered with the system. it stated they would sue him and have him charged if he did not capitulate with the terms of the agreement. that document was delivered to him personally, at his desk at 9am of a work day and at exactly the same time the exact same document was delivered to his boss at 9am. he was escorted out of the building at 9.20am. edit: epilogue, not prologue ***edit ii: answering some questions here*** **what happened to the girl?** the ceo decided to review her work and discovered that she had been doing some sabotage as well, not putting in sales orders in from people she didn't like, deleting messages and saying they were never recieved and in one more serious incident she edited someones timesheet resulting in lost overtime. she had to pay the back money owed and lost her job, they could have taken legal action but my understanding was it was not a large amount. **what where the terms and conditions?** i wasn't privy to all the details but my client did let me know that he had to attend several depositions in which he had to answer in great detail everything he had done, surrender hard drives and other equipment that he had mentioned he had stolen and there was some kind of financial component to it as well where he had to pay costs of causing all of these issues, i think it was in the thousands, not a huge amount but for a guy without a job it was. there was some provision about not working in it, i am not sure how legally that works but i believe he had to stay away from it for 5 or 10 years. **you aren't an it detective, you're a big phony!!** yes, when taking on a new client all password should be rotated and the entire system should be reviewed. unfortunately i had been working for the company for two weeks, they took on the client six months ago. i later determined that several factors went into why the system review wasn't done, time and cost constraints but mainly laziness. my coworkers had already "looked into it" and concluded that he "wasn't logging in" and told me a full password rotation was done (later i discovered it was only for real peoples accounts, not service accounts). when i was given management of the client (account manager, not it helpdesk guy) the ceo gave me a the full story and i began looking into it. it should also be said that my job role was account manager, i met with clients and discussed the performance of our helpdesk, their it agreement and projects - i was not meant to do troubleshooting, that was apparently for the helpdesk tier 1-3. the jobs that came through to the helpdesk (backups cancelled, account lockouts) were treated by them as isolated issues and did not investigate further than that. all of this coalesced into a situation where everyone in my company was telling me its fine and my client is just paranoid. i didn't accept that, and found what i found. did i use any advanced techniques ? no. the guy was sloppy as shit and anyone who is worth half their salt could have found it. i am sharing this story because it's interesting, not because i think i am a detective. **what other evidence did you find?** he was a prolific user of lync and his chat logs were all stored in his user profile, he would chat throughout the day with the woman in the office and have some of the most cringe worthy interactions that were just disturbing to read. they had flashes of red hot anger, swearing at each other like two drunks at a pub followed by pathetic apologies and disgusting make up flirting. constant bitching about others in the office. i found that this woman would contact him to fix it issues, it explained why she was so hostile towards me when i met her in person. several incidents where he was attempting to "fix" something, our helpdesk was also looking at the same issue and this inflamed the problems. he had accidentally saved some passwords to websites in his browser cache like facebook, web management site of his personal domain, some other weird forums. couldn't do anything with these of course but it was hilarious clicking on his history and it loading straight into these sites, the audacity and gall of this guy thinking he would never get caught yet taking no steps to hide his activity. the most disturbing of all though was the m night shyamalan twist when i discovered that the old it guy was very close to one of the owners and they had remained in contact after he was let go. he had convinced the owner that letting him go was a mistake and to watch how many problems would occur without him. he also claimed to be logging in to "check on things" and "make sure backups run, that kind of thing" (quotes from emails he wrote). he was sabotaging the system while pretending to fix things, saying that if he wasn't logging in things would be so much worse. the owner believed every word and met with him on several occasions to discuss how to deal with the situation. the ceo was furious upon this discovery and went to the other owners who decided to use this opportunity to push him out of the business. thanks for reading !it tech for a school district. ok? ok. last week i had a work order from a teacher stating that everyday , around 2:30pm, her mouse pointer would jump to the bottom right corner, twitch, and click/drag randomly. i get to her room to check out her machine. the mouse is behaving normally, so i check the usual places for anything unusual e.g. installed programs. i find a bunch on shady stuff. ask toolbar, coupon companion, and yontoo among other things. i start culling the herd and run mbam for good measure. final score, 133 items including 3 trojans. i remove these and tell her to let me know if she has any more trouble. today i get an email from her saying that she is still having trouble. i try swapping out her mouse thinking that maybe the optical sensor has gone bad. 2:30 rolls around and she is still having trouble. i propose re-imaging her computer since nothing else seems to be working. she agrees and is done for the day so i can get right to it. as i'm backing up her data to google drive, she tells me that she has to step out for a bit and will be right back. as the door to her classroom closes, the mouse starts to have a seizure. i look at the door and see that there is a mirror bolted on it that, when opened, faces to the west. my only thought is, [no way]( i move the mouse to the other side of the screen, open the door, and slowly close it. i see light reflected onto the floor and as it lines up with the desk, with mouse freaks out again. turns out she always has her door open during class. tl;dr sniper trick shot from 93 million miles away manages to give a rodent ptsd. [part 1]( [part 2]( [part 3]( i'm performing it vendor audits for a banking client. this particular vendor seems to be special, since the bank itself is sending their own compliance people instead of leaving all the work to me. i'm sitting in the director of compliance's office while he's trying to shmooze the bank's compliance people. he's discussing his career as a big corporate lawyer. i don't mention that i'm a lawyer. it'd only confuse things. i'm here for it things. the vendor is a print shop. they print statements for the consumer and investment customers, so they're processing a bit of sensitive data for the bank. i ask a bunch of questions on how they hold and process data and i get believable straightforward answers. just to keep them honest, i occasionally ask about the same control from an attacker's point of view rather than a controls point of view. as an example: "i stick in a thumb drive into one of the graphics workstations. can i download valuable data to it?." i'm hoping to get them to explain how their controls work together. if they do, i get the feeling that they're less about compliance checklists and instead about actually securing important data. this drives the vendor's director of compliance batty. i think he's afraid that i'll come up with something to ding them, which i'm not trying to do. he's starting to make nasty comments when i ask questions. next, i want to see their print shop. they run on what essentially are truck sized inkjets. once the statements are printed, they're put into lockable, wheeled cabinets until they're assembled and mailed. i reach over and touch the padlock- a nice, reliable master #4. the director of compliance snaps at me: doc:"what, do you think you could pick that?" me:"well, yes. masters are hard to break but not too difficult to pick. my local lockpicking group uses them to teach people to pick locks" at this point, everybody's staring at me. the director of compliance is not happy. doc:"so, you're saying you could waltz in here and steal anything you wanted?" me:"well, my job requires me to think like a bad guy. if i were so inclined, i'd make a pretty good thief" bank compliance person:"so do you think they're insecure?" me:"listen, listen. they've got multiple controls in place. they've got cameras. they've got key cards. i've been stopped on the way to the bathroom. if i were going to steal data, i'd try to get the feed into the printers- get tens of thousands of records rather than a few hundred" director of compliance:"where did you learn to think this way?" me:"law school" one day at my telco my boss comes to me with an unusual assignment. &gt; boss: "there's something i'd like you to help me with, but i'm not quite sure if it falls strictly under your job description." &gt; bytewave: "let's hear it, i'll let you know." &gt; boss: "six months ago, dropped calls to senior line quadrupled, went from a little over 1% to 4% almost overnight. i asked systems three months back to explain the anomaly, but they said they calls aren't being dropped for technical reasons and that nothing changed regarding the system. since you have access to all recordings, maybe you could investigate it?" so-called dropped calls are just calls that didn't actually begin at all; an agent calls us and hangs up before speaking to us at all. the legitimate reason for it to occur other than a technical problem with the internal call system is whenever they find their answer on their own while on hold, but this spike is definitely abnormal. &gt; bytewave: "yeah, i have recordings of every call. not recordings of calls that never began at all. but yeah, i can take this." there's a broad line in the job description - 'all relevant operations to service the internal technical senior line' - so it was my job, sorta, even if it flirted with managerial work. first thing is to get the timestamps of dropped calls i'm missing. i call switchboards, who are in charge of our pbx' and internal call systems. &gt; switchboards: "wait, you want logs on every call to your line for the last six months?" &gt; bytewave: "unless you can give me specifically those who hung up before conversation started, yup. just timestamps and employee ids will do." &gt; switchboards: "just got your ticket, so we will get that to you within the next ten business days." &gt; bytewave: "... to pull timestamps, seriously? any staffing or tool issues i should know about?" &gt; switchboards: "i never said *when* within the next 10 business days, check your email." that was humor, there it is with a huge csv attachment. &gt; bytewave: "i will mail you my thanks within the next 10 business days. have a good one." i start by looking at the shortest calls, but i'm not satisfied by the volume, there's only a few dozen that last mere seconds. bulk of them are obviously lasting longer, a pretty sure sign that this isn't a technical issue. then i get an idea, i export my own recording tool's logs to csv, specifically just the timestamps by date, reduce the logs i got to the same, and compare the two. all the missing lines in csvdiff are the dropped calls. there's a lot, and they're all at least a few minutes long, which is weird because the wait times are usually instantaneous on our line. now the fun part, tracking who is making them in such bulk. it takes a bit to paint a clear picture but it's increasingly obvious. the crushing bulk of the dropped calls, accounting for the entire increase, come from a specific call center - our main subcontractor's. this isn't just a few people, it looks like we have dropped calls from dozens of them, and upon closer inspection, the calls all occur when we're particularly busy, enough to be 'worth it' to call and hang up to take a short break that won't show up as too odd in your call statistics... but how would they know when to hang up to avoid getting caught? sure there's tickers with calls waiting, but it's pretty hard to gauge your position in the queue, you'd be bound to get caught regularly unless you came up with creative reasons to call. unless *something* changed over there six months ago. time to call their batphone. &gt; bytewave: "bytewave from senior staff, i'd like to know about your ticker system over there, specifically any changes that might have occurred around mid june earlier this year?" &gt; tim: "hey, this is tim, floor manager right now. ticker? why?" &gt; bytewave: "... quality assurance purposes." he doesn't get my life story until i get my info. &gt; tim: "uhh... we only had one ticker, it wasn't really working out for a call centre this big, so we put up extra displays around june, yeah. what's it to do with qa?" &gt; bytewave: "lots of problematic calls from your centre ever since. i need more information on these new tickers, are they all exactly like the one you had before?" tim hesitates and puts me on hold for a minute, not exactly inspiring great trust. once he gets back, i ask again. &gt; bytewave: "actually if you could take a cellphone pic of one of the new tickers and send it to me, that would be best." he seems a bit reluctant but does it still. &gt; bytewave: "that's not a ticker, tim. that's a large tv connected to a computer running *management's live call monitoring software!*" &gt; tim: "yeah? we had the tvs on hand, so it was the most cost-effective solution, like you can see it has all the calls waiting in big bold at the top." &gt; bytewave: "that it does. and the live details about every queue and the the employee numbers on hold right underneath! anyone who can see this knows their exact position in the queue!" &gt; tim: "... so?" &gt; bytewave: "so we have an inordinate amount of dropped calls coming from your floor since june. people are looking at this and whenever we have calls waiting, they're calling us and know exactly when to hang up once they're next in queue." &gt; tim: "err, if that's so we won't let that go unpunished, that's absolutely unacceptable." &gt; bytewave: "yes, it is. the problem is that from what i'm seeing it's a bulk problem. thank you for helping me figure this out, i'll let the contractor quality director figure out the details." i swiftly hang up, knowing the amount of dread that oxymoronic title inspires in every subcontractor manager's heart. clearly someone over there got this idea and spread it far and wide, because from my logs this is happening all the time, every time there's as much as three calls waiting on our line. i rank my diff file by employee number and pull up anyone who shows up at least 10 times, to account for legitimate hang ups. that's 36 employees. 20 times? 30 employees. clearly done on purpose. i make a neat list of employee numbers with the diff file as evidence, and off to my boss and the cqd it goes with an explanation and the picture of the 'new tickers'. couple minutes later i already got an 'on it' reply from the cqd and i can hear my boss cursing. i give him an half smile. &gt; boss: "well, excellent work.... sooo, i hear you like to get subcontractors in trouble - today was a good day, huh?" our dropped calls were back to 1% within a few weeks. * tl:dr - subcontractor put up overly detailed info on calls queues on large tvs instead of using normal tickers, and their staff swiftly used this data to call us and hang up repeatedly whenever our line was busy to get 'untraceable' little breaks. it took six months, but it wasn't so untraceable. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](i work in it for a hospital. i was asked to put a license for office 2010 pro on a user's pc. all the paperwork was filled out, so i went and installed it. as i was leaving, one of her co-workers said "hey it guy, install it for me too, please." i said "sorry ma'am, but i need the paperwork filled out and it has to be paid for. then i'll come do it." she said "oh... don't we own that company?" i replied "what company? you mean microsoft?" she said "yeah, we don't need to pay for it if we own the company." i just stared at her thinking that she had to be kidding. she just stared back waiting for an answer. "... no ma'am. i don't think we own microsoft." i used to work for my college's tech support team. i did classroom support, but mainly i manned the s.s help desk. like most universities, we provided software to students at a discounted price through a 3rd party vendor. this is only available to admitted and enrolled students, not a difficult concept. our tale of swearing, law breaking, and employee termination begins one lazy afternoon. i shall be me, and ms.angry pants will be known simply as angry. me: thank you for calling it support, this is toplesspenguin, how can i help you? angry: yes, i'm a student at [university] and i'm try'n to buy microsoft office with the student discount but it's telling me that my student number is wrong. me: alright, can i get your student identification number please? angry: it's (proceeds to give me username that has no numbers in it) me: no ma'am, that's your username i need the number you put in our system to try and purchase the software. angry: oh, we'll why didn't you say that! it's (id number) me: thank you. (i proceed to look up her i.d number and find that she was a student that hasn't enrolled in classes in about 3 years) ok ma'am, i believe the problem is that you are not currently enrolled in any classes here. the discount is only available to students who are currently attending classes. angry: (voice suddenly filled with rage and ignorance) i am too a student here! i need office for some classes that i'm taking over at (other school not related to us at all) and i **demand** the cheaper price. that shit is too expensive to buy regular. me: are you currently enrolled in classes here at (university)? angry: no, but i **am** a student!! me: ma'am if you're not taking classes, then you're not a student here. angry: i am too! i just had to take some time off because of illness! (she then proceeds to tell me about her "illness" and how she still deserves her discount software and) me: i'm very sorry, but unless you are taking classes, you don't qualify for the discount price. angry: can you just let me use your student number and order it for me? me: no ma'am, that's illegal. angry: are you new there? i can't wait till they train yo worthless ass. me: ma'm, insulting me will get you nowhere. if you're not a student here, then i cannot help you. angry: you're not helping me anyway! i can't believe how fucking stupid you is! get me my software, i deserve it! me: no ma'm, if you're going to yell and curse me, you deserve this. *click* a few minutes go by and the phone rings again and on the caller id it shows her number. so i go and get my manager and ask if he would handle this irate woman. manager: thank you for calling it support, this is manager, how may i help you? angry: i just called a few minutes ago, and one of your employees was rude and refused to help me! manager: i'm very sorry for that, i'll have a word with toplesspenguin later. is there anything i can help you with? manager then goes through the whole process of getting her number and telling her she's not a student and doesn't get her discount. angry: is there anyone there with more experience who knows what they're doing!? manager: ma'm, i designed and created the system you're using, there is no one with more experience. it's obvious you're trying to get something you don't qualify for. if you call again your number will be blacklisted and you will lose it phone support privileges. angry: fuck you! manager: (in the calmest cool voice) no bitch, fuck you. *click* i have never felt more defended and cared for as an employee since that day. i later found out that she did call a few days later that she did call again and convinced one of the other techs to use his id for her. manager was listening to the call so he got fired and mrs.angry got blacklisted and reported to judicial affairs. tl;dr if you give in to bullies, you get fired. first time lurker, long poster. i work for a cable company as a remote tech doing virus clean ups and other garbage work. i get this customer about 5 time a day. very simple stuff, but enough to drive me insane. me: you already know cc:clueless customer. at some point during any call you are going to need to restart the computer, all tech support knows this. &gt; me: thank for calling (insert name here) my name is ssnikki, how can i help you? &gt; cc: my computer won't connect to the internet/has a virus/is being mean to me! fix it! &gt; me: okay could you please restart your computer for me really quickly? sometimes that helps. &gt; cc: you want me to shut it down an turn it back on? &gt; me: yes please. &gt; cc: all the way off? &gt; me: yes please. &gt; cc: how should i do that? &gt; me: click start, and click restart. &gt; cc: where's start? by this point i am ready to throw my headset out the window. thank you all for letting me vent. i'm sure i will have more humorous stories soon.we were standing outside, mexican standoff style. i could finally see how these standoffs always ended up with someone dead. if i had a gun…. &gt;vp: and you! how could you? i thought we had an understanding. the vp was looking directly at screechy, he looked disappointed. screechy finally decided to defend herself. she certainly didn’t seem in a hurry to do so. &gt;screechy: listen vp, it wasn’t us. we were together all morning. we should call the police, and airz should probably get back to it and start getting services back online. i took another sip of my coffee. tasted surprisingly sensible. i liked this coffee. &gt;vp: oh no, give you two a chance to break more things? no, no, no, you both can wait in hr till the police confirm things. &gt;me: sorry. listen, services need to come back… &gt;vp: you think i give a darn about services? get it into your head, ive caught you. the vp was practically in a rage, i thought about arguing further but a coffee in hr did sound quite nice, plus… my cup was almost empty. whilst walking to hr i wondered who exactly sabotaged the air- conditioner. the vp did seem genuinely mad about it…. upon arrival at hr, screechy and i were sat down in an abandoned office. &gt;screechy: soo….. this is nice. i took a sip of my nearly empty coffee. the small talk was nice. &gt;me: yep. perfect start to an audit. &gt;screechy: you didn’t er… do it did you? i took another sip of coffee. small talk was over. the coffee cup was empty. it sure goes fast. [next]( [older]( one quiet evening at home, taking senior line calls as usual for telco.ca. teleworking that week, as i preferred not to share the flu i had with the rest of the office. &gt; bytewave: "senior line, bytewave, you may send me your ticket. &gt; gary: "hi bytewave, this is gary at the northshore offices. my customer has problems with his tv remote every night, it's just not working right now, but we already changed the batteries and the remote... twice." i look at his file, check who had the bright idea of sending a second remote for fun. subcontractor logic of course: if a solution fails to fix a problem, apply more of the same and pray... &gt; bytewave: "i see, you said right now that the remote works at times and at others it doesn't? is the customer always setting in the same spot and pointing at the set top box?" &gt; gary: "yeah, i checked the basics. nothing unusual in regards to the box either, but it's just not working." &gt; bytewave: "tell the customer the location of the ir receiver on the frontpanel, have him walk up to it, put the remote directly in front of it, about a centimeter away and try changing the channel." &gt; gary: "be right back." basic interference test. coffee refill while i hold. idly browse customer's history, i notice all the calls this customer gave us - quite a few - have evening timestamps. &gt; gary: "yeah that worked somehow. i don't understand though, its a brand new remote and new batteries. our tech tested it earlier at normal range." &gt; bytewave: "yeah we have interference. you said this happened in the evenings right? i want to know exactly how that room is lit. every source of light in range, lamps, globes, strobe lights, types of lights, positions versus the stb and the couch." more holding. holding for tests is half what i clock on the job when taking calls, no matter how basic the instructions it always take longer than it should to perform. &gt; gary: "yeah there's four lamps in the living room, two on the wall with the tv and the home theater system, two on the on the opposite walls. three are lit right now, the customer isn't able to identify which kinds of lights they have, though." &gt; bytewave: "okay, then have him turn off all three lamps, sit on his couch and try again." &gt; gary: "but what do the lamps have to do with..." &gt; bytewave: "i'm willing to bet one or more of these is fluorescent and the source of the problem. why do you think he always calls us in the evenings about this problem?" &gt; gary: "but why would..." &gt; bytewave: "i'll explain when we don't have a customer on hold. just tell him to turn off his lamps." he proceeds to do so, and miraculously, no more problems. &gt; gary: "alright, the customer tried switching them off one by one and found the one causing the problem. he'll be swapping it with another lamp. this is the first time i heard of this, is this a new bug with our cable boxes?" &gt; bytewave: "..no. google something like 'fluorescent lamp interference remote' and you'll find articles dating back from the 90s on resolving issues related to high-frequency fluorescent lighting systems interfering with infrared tv remotes. it just doesn't come up often enough as a real world issue, so everyone forgot or never learned about it." &gt; gary: ".... huh. thanks" &gt; bytewave: "thank you for choosing senior line, and have a good evening." [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](...nobody can administer it. too short? 'tis a quick one, so i'll elaborate. local gov sys admin here. trying to go about my day creating / deleting accounts when i have one of the rare bits of work to do in our psn compliant secure email system, for which the yearly demands to make it more secure continue to get more and more ridiculous. &gt;tao: unable to connect to server? o.0 yo boss, can you get in? &gt;boss: nope. you using the elevated network access vpn? &gt;tao: nope, never needed to before for this. &gt;boss: i'll check with adguru. &gt;adguru: using the elevated access here. no luck either. **hmmmm** **to the project

&gt;tao: yes please :) *checks ref* **disable rdp rule** *(was previously deny rdc connection, but nerddtvg reminded me how much the double 'connection' bugs me too)* **....** &gt;tao: well if they don't want anyone new to use the system then that's one way to make it secure. clearly the best type of security is the inability to access, 11/10, definitely compliant. the moral of story, project managers don't check with administrators whether the requested server changes will have any impact of day-to-day access. post edit: thanks on all the upvotes, wasn't expecting this for an off the cuff post from an amusing start to my dayas a roving it engineer with a health service, i occasionally had to take a trainee (minion) with me so they could experience real it work. my work was varied, from installation of hardware, cabling, software install, to the "turn it off / turn it on" fixes. as a result, i carried a lot of spare kit with me, and every tool imaginable. i had arrived at a remote site in a small seaside town ad was scheduled for the entire day to floor-walk and fix the simple issues that they were getting. we brought my kit in from the car, and settled down with a coffee. &gt;minion: i'm curious about three things in your toolbox. &gt;me: go on. &gt;minion: nail polish remover, nail file and clear sticky tape - the cheap stuff. why do you need them? as if on queue, we are asked to fix a printer. the laserjet in one of the offices was jamming paper. i used the air can in my kit to clean out dust, and then check the roller. it's smooth. &gt;pass me the nail polish remover please, and grab me a couple of paper towels from the toilets. minion returns to see me soak a paper towel with the remover, then wipe it over the roller. after a few seconds, i dry off the roller and re-insert it, allowing a test print. no more paperjam. &gt;me: the acetone in the nail polish remover eats at the roller and roughs it up a little. it buys us time to order a new set and have them delivered. i make a note of the asset number of the printer, and the model. &gt;minion: what about the tape? &gt;me: these pcs have a design fault. the power switch is a microswitch that's held in place by two flimsy plastic clips. any decent force pushes the mechanism into the case and you can't turn it off or on. if one breaks, i just wrap a layer of this tape around the switch and re-insert it. it wedges the switch in place and again provides a temporary solution until we can replace it. i see he's making notes. &gt;me: first rule of customer service. make sure that the customer is working, even if you have to stick things together with tape and glue. they're not fixes, but they are temporary solutions that means the customers are not sat twiddling their thumbs. that trainee now services our printers, and still carries tape, a nail file, and polish remover in his kit.i've been wicked busy and haven't had time to write about this one. i'm doing third party security audits for a bank. these are fairly rote- send a questionnaire, show up, ask the it, compliance and hr people a bunch of questions, write a report, go home. sometimes they're [fun]( sometimes [not]( this particular vendor has a substantial server farm. they're responsible for the client's online banking, credit cards and mortgage products. they seem fairly mature, with a fair amount of internal software development and separate information security and technology groups. i also am traveling with the bank's compliance lawyer. she's happy to see me. she finds me at least partially amusing as opposed to the other techies doing these reviews. she's looking through various policies while i hang out with the vendor's techies. i'm dealing with a quartet of the vendor's it and is staff: bearded unix guy (bug), a grizzled unix veteran. he's a senior member of the unix sysadmin team. spooky windows admin goth (swag), bug's equivalent on the windows side. she's wearing black clothing, serious boots and lots of silver jewelery. twitchy security guy (tsg), a jamie hynemann lookalike. he's responsible for securing stuff. he's not happy i'm here. compliance checkbox checker (ccc), a stylishly dressed but none too bright young man. he's cheerful, but guarded around me. i get to asking questions and taking notes. tsg is trying to sell me on how locked down everything is. i get a sense bug &amp; swag don't like him, since they roll their eyes every so often when he speaks. i ask about what $vendor does about internal controls. tsg is very proud of what he's done to protect the important servers from the rest of the network: tsg:"we channel all server access to five pivot servers. these pivot servers have two ethernet connections and bridge the server network to the rest of the network. you have to authenticate with the pivot server before re-authenticating with the server you want" me:"ok. interesting. what kind of intrusion detection or prevention do you use?" tsg:"don't need it. we log all traffic coming through the pivot box" me:"and all other connections are firewalled off?" i notice swag smile, ever so slightly. tsg:"all traffic has to go through the pivot" me:"ok. how do you ensure that?" tsg, exasperated:"all traffic has to go through the pivot" me:"so there's a firewall between the workstation network and the server network?" tsg:"i don't think you understand. all traffic has to go through the pivot" i turn to swag and bug. me:"can i ping your servers from here?" bug:"yes, you can" me:"can i login to the servers from here?" tsg:"you have to go through the pivot" me:"so the firewall blocks ssh and rdp traffic?" i notice that both swag and bug are nodding 'no'. me:"is there a firewall between the workstation and server network?" bug:"no" me:"what actually makes traffic go through the pivot?" tsg:"security policy requires it" me:"ok. so if i'm an employee, i'm supposed to do it or i get in trouble" tsg:"exactly" me:"have you stopped to consider that an attacker or malicious insider may not consider this a significant threat?" ccc:"all employees sign a document agreeing to follow policy" me:"let me explain. you have a control that is trivial to avoid. you've got a toll booth in the middle of a field. only honest people will pay the toll" tsg:"but we have policy in place" me:"attackers may not actually follow policy" i realize that it's not up to me to explain my findings to this guy, so i proceed to other controls that are easier, like hard drive destruction. during a break, ccc and tsg leave. i notice that bug and swag seem to be smiling at me. i try to talk about non technology stuff- hobbies, travel, family. i inadvertently mention that i went to law school. bug turns to me with a big smile. bug:"do you post stories on reddit?" me:"uhh, what?" bug:"i've read your stories." bug(pointing to swag):"this is the guy who wrote those stories about doing tech support" me:"i admit nothing. but if i do write anything, i won't mention the pizza stain on your shirt" so my co-worker is being twisted into knots today. he deals with any compromised account issues, and works with other teams to block websites that have a high number of malicious pages on them (like webs.com) or offer free webpages. today he's pissed because a lady clicked on an email link that told her to enter in her corporate credentials. however, she received the message that the page was blocked due to phishing attempts. so, she goes on her phone, and enters in her account information. then she gets all pissy when m$ realizes her account is sending out tons of spam and they suspend it, and takes it out on my co-worker! this isn't tuesday, this is monday masquerading as tuesday! curses!my brother is a regional it manager for a major bank. he has survived two major mergers. he's been there about 15 years i guess. the operating system he built, that they still use, with twenty other people? he is the only one left. he now works from home, he gets the 2am calls from india. during the last merger, new company a is vastly bigger than company b. things that 1 person in b does, 12 people in a do. there is a meeting my brother is called into. (he has worked from home for b about a year or two at this point) he has sat there for hours listening to them drone on about who will do what, and before they wrap a manager asks my brother, "you haven't said anything the entire meeting, what do you think we should do?" my brother, "call me whenever you break something." end of meeting. frontline library computer tech here. about a month ago, a woman in her mid 40s came into my computer lab. lady=lady, me=me simple enough? &gt;me: hello, do you need any help? &gt;lady: yes, i need to make a new website. (me knowing almost nothing about making a website.) &gt;me: alright, do you know how you made your previous one? (maybe i can suss out how she made her old website and direct her to the appropriate resources) &gt;lady: no. (damn) &gt;me: ok, do you know what language you used? &gt;lady: i think it was yahoo? (well now we're getting somewhere) &gt;me: so you're looking to make a new email address then? &gt;lady: yeah, i forgot the password to my old one last year. &gt;me: maybe we can recover the password. do you remember the address? &gt;lady: i don't think so, oh wait... it might be $emailaddress &gt;me: do you remember the password? &gt;lady: no... but it could be $password. (both worked on the first try) &gt;me: enjoy your old email and write down the address and and password so you don't forget and that's the story of how if helped a woman make a new website by recovering her old email. my mum, who manages a client management system, was once having a problem with her laptop, which didn't want to log on to the domain. even though she's not *too* tech savvy, she had the brains to take it to their in-office tech support guys to diagnose the problem. part of fixing this problem involved disconnecting the laptop from the network. so instead of hitting the physical wifi switch on the side of the machine, the tech guy *carried the laptop outside of the office and down the road until it lost wifi reception.* ***he carried the laptop outside of the office and down the road until it lost wifi reception.***"the ghosts of print jobs past haunts the color printer in sales and marketing. i respectfully request that you arrive at your earliest convenience to perform an exorcism on the mysterious innards of that printer to exterminate the shape-shifting demons. in case you need to diagnose the problem by personally witnessing an apparition, i have left a sample of their handy-work attached to the wall near the printer. i have aromatic herbs ready to light, a small bottle of liquid white-out, the feathers of a marabou, and slabs of pristine chocolate -- in case you need magical devices to appease your deities. the intern is still here this week, so they can fetch chicken feet, eye of newt, or any other voodoo charms, amulets, or talismans you require to ensure success. (i could just say that the color printer in sales &amp; marketing needs routine cleaning and maintenance, but where's the fun in that?)"get an email from one of the scientist in the lab i support. he needed a cable to connect to a projector. i asked him which cable he needed. in reply i got: "i believe it is a serial connection, with the plug being fairly large, trapezoidal, and with six pins in each of the three rows, with the middle row offset from the other two." after i laughed for a minute, i pointed him directly to a vga cable.screechy and i stood outside, starring at the sabotaged air-conditioner. you would have to be brave to destroy something so exposed, a building was directly facing the wall the air conditioner was placed on. it was a wall of windows. the vp arrived to access the damage. i expected he’d want to control the situation, which was fine with me. hell if i would volunteer my time to fill out police reports. &gt;vp: airz! &gt;me: oh vp, yes its pretty bad. the server room is cooked. &gt;vp: why would you do this? &gt;me: sorry? &gt;vp: and you, miss screechy! why’d you help destroy a server room? &gt;me: it wasn’t us… &gt;vp: like hell it wasn’t. i get a call about the server room going down, run to the server room, realize the air conditioner is broken. when i arrive outside i find you two, still admiring your handiwork. &gt;me: er…. no. miss screechy and i worked out the same thing as you, came outside and found this sabotage. i point over to the air-conditioner with the pipe sticking through it. i realize i’m still carrying coffee. i take a sip. tastes a little bit like a framing. &gt;vp: see! you’re carrying coffee! if it was such an emergency you’d have dropped it. i looked down at my coffee…. coffee was getting me in trouble. coffee was framing me! [next]( [older](so i got asked about my flair yesterday, so i thought i'd share the tale... that's very likely embellished... and i've probably filled in some points incorrectly... it's also only tangentially related to it... and it's also third-hand. there's a demolition site near where i work and the workies often frequent the sandwich shop i go to for lunch. one of them is complaining about how the mandatory site safety training they were doing this morning felt like being taught to suck eggs. so the other guy explained they were forcing it on everyone because of what happened at their last site: &gt; ~ ~ wibbly wobbly wibbly wobbly flashback ~ ~ they'd hired $newguy who, instead of doing the job he'd been hired to do, acted as a gopher for $sitemanager. so he was well known by everyone on site as 'the guy who gets stuff for the boss' the morning of their last demolition the $sitemanager was having trouble connecting his laptop to their wireless hub, even standing right next to it. he phoned up their it for help (*see*: it&lt; it does belong here) and he was told to get a cord and just plug it into the back for now. (note the specific use of the word *cord*) $newguy gets sent off to get him a cord. he comes back twenty minutes later with a large length of detcord. turns out $newguy had worked in construction, but not in demolitions. and it turns out he didn't know where he could get network cable on site, so he started asking the other guys around where the cords were kept. $explosivesguy, when hearing the site manager needed it, said "yeah, sure" went off and got him the detcord. $newguy, having never seen detcord (or probably cat5 for that matter), thought nothing of it and sauntered back to $sitemanager. $sitemanager's boss - who was, naturally, on site for the big day - clearly wasn't pleased. now, if you don't know what detcord is, it's basically a fuse. that explodes. at 4 miles per second. it's used to trigger multiple higher explosives simultaneously and it's what they use to make sure all the charges go off at the same time. you probably don't want to stick it in your laptop. hell, you probably couldn't crimp the ends of it without losing a limb. anyway, the higher ups got shit scared that a new hire could so easily get a hold of explosives (you know, cause turrurism). needless to say there was a major security audit; resulting in everyone getting extra site safety training, and $sitemanager being told not to use the same guy regularly as a gopher - whether it was $newguy or not. &gt; ~ ~ wibbly wobbly wibbly wobbly flashback ends ~ ~ i never asked if he found any cat-5 though. but if the last site was the building they blew up last year (there's a lot of old 60's/70's brutalist eyesores around here), then it's surrounded by about 6 computer parts shops (not counting a pc world and an argos within spitting distance) so i'm sure he got some. **tl;dr company worry intensely about rodents stealing their explosives.**at the shop. it was 22:00, and i was hungry for mcdonalds, (mmm big mac) and sleep. i got a text from the boss. "close up, mate. - boss" so, i do the usual routine. lock the door, turn off the light when... a knock. a loud knock. i turn around, expecting the police to be there. instead a man looking in his fifties was waving at me. i open the door. &gt; "sir, we are closed. please come back tomorrow" &gt; "i, err.. need something now." &gt; "sir, this is closed now. please leave." &gt; "do you have netflix?" &gt; "yes, sir, i do. i can help you purchase it tomorrow, we open at 5:30." &gt; "i don't care! do you have it on dvd?" &gt; "uhhh, no. it is online..." &gt; "ohhh, kk. bye then." i close the shop. turn off the lights, head toward the employee room. the phone rings. &gt; "this is an automated recording to announce a change in your clock system." i hang up. i know that the server provider is doing this, i know about the change allready. walking out the door, and locking it, i find the man staring at me, muttering "netfliiix" to himself over and over. weird.i'm new to this sub so i'm sure there are dumber customers than this, but so far i haven't heard anyone worse. this happened a long time ago so hopefully i can recreate the conversation appropriately. &gt; **customer:** my tv signal isn't working, it just went out. &gt; **me:** oh, i'm sorry to hear that sir. i'll get that working for you as soon as possible. so you said you were watching tv and it just stopped working? &gt; **customer:** well it was working earlier. i just turned on the tv right now and there's no picture. no sound either. &gt; **me:** okay. so on the screen are you getting any message like "no input" or "source not found"? &gt; **customer:** nope. i still see the channel numbers and guide but every channel is blank. &gt; **me:** hmm, okay. i'm looking through your account right now and i see you had an installation scheduled for today. did you make sure the tv and everything were working before the installer left? &gt; **customer:** oh, the guy's still here. he's out back installing my service. &gt; **me:** (very, very, very, very long pause) the installer is still outside? so he hasn't hooked up anything inside your home yet? &gt; **customer:** nah, he's trying to run a line right now. &gt; **me:** (another long pause) so you had a different cable service already and we're installing a different one? &gt; **customer:** that's right. &gt; **me:** (sigh, on mute of course) i apologize for the confusion and inconvenience sir but your other cable service will be down until we finish then installation. i assure you you're tv service will be working when we're finished installing it. (exact phrasing) &gt; **customer:** oh, okay. sounds good. thanks for your time.three years ago i started working in my current post as an it manager. my predecessor had decided to turn our old kitchens into a printer room and thrust a large high-speed printer in there that does our critical print jobs. a year after i started, the pipes froze, cracked, and when the weather picked up around fifty gallons of water cascaded through the printer. i was tasked with securing a replacement, and this is the conversation i had with the accountant (acc) &gt; acc: i don't see why we need all these features on the printer. &gt;me: we print 4500 pages in a single run, so this will cope without having to refil the printer with paper. of that run, 1000 pages are colour a3, and another 1000 are duplexed. trust me, this is the minimum spec for a printer. &gt;acc: but 5 grand is a lot for a printer. my inkjet cost fifty quid! &gt;me: your inkjet doesn't print at fifty pages a minute and hold five thousand pages. it also would have to replace the cartridges half-way through the print run. &gt;acc: what about if we go for a second hand printer? &gt;me: i can't get a full warranty out of a refurbished one, and you never know how badly its been used previously. if it fails, we won't be covered. &gt;acc: surely we have a backup solution? &gt;me: sure - a printer that runs at fifteen pages a minute. it will take us all day to do a print run on that, so we will only use it for dire emergencies, not as a fix. &gt;acc: that's fine then. we'll get the second hand one and use the backup as an interim fix if it breaks. &gt;me: i'd rather have the agreement that if the new printer breaks then we replace it within 2 weeks. i don't want to be trusting an older and slower printer with the main print run for too long. &gt;acc: we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. i can always swing it by the board. we bought the 3 year old printer, and last week it died. one thousand pounds worth of component costs alone, three days labour. the device came with a 1 year swap-out warranty and the second year was a "simple fix" warranty - labour and small (ie cheap) parts. now the accountant is wondering why it's not being fixed and a new printer has not been budgeted for. we can get a new one for 7 grand, or a refurb for five. this time, i'm not settling for the refurb. edit: disclaimer - our company owners never lease anything. all managed print solutions are purchased hardware.some days. email from a user: "the copier in [room] isn't working. there's an error light on it." well, heck, that's on the way to the coffee pot, might as well check it out. walk to the printer. there's an error message on the screen: [process] failed, please press button for restart. the error message is next to a big red button. i pressed the button. the copier restarted. the waiting crowd was astounded. **tl;dr: only 4.5 hours until i can drink.** edit: i spel gud. so, we recently made some changes to our wifi infrastructure here, and predictably, it's caused a great deal of angst from the users. that this was going to be done was announced a month ago, and a web page put up explaining what you'd have to do. it was announced again last week, as is our way, and again last night, before the change actually occurred. there's been a lot of "why is the internet down?" and "my username's broken!" and a whole bunch of "why doesn't it just work? why do i have to do anything? it worked yesterday. this is too hard!" coming from people who didn't read the email announcements, or the "status" or "news" sections on the intranet site, or even the notice that we stuck up outside the department hoping that people might read it before coming in here... which is causing a certain degree of homicidal feeling among the support team, but this one, this one user... from: [idiot]@company to: help@company; support@company; [linemanager]@company; [local-office-drone]@company; [it-team-member-1]@company; [it-team-member-2]@company; [it-team-member-3]@company ... it went on like that. as far as i can see she just emailed every address she's ever corresponded with. subject: wireless down &gt;"the wireless is down." then a whole bunch of "reply to all" happened, with the various ccd people _also_ emailing help, and occasionally even each other, and it took a couple of hours to prune everyone who had nothing to do with this out of the conversation. once the shouting had shut up we managed to get a reply back explaining that the wifi was not down, and that she needed to log in using her usename and password now, along with detailed instructions as to how. also, a fairly stern warning about sending out bulk mail and why it was causing everyone such a pain in the ass. what did we get back? from: [idiot]@company to: help@company; support@company; [linemanager]@company; [local-office-drone]@company; [it-team-member-1]@company; [it-team-member-2]@company; [it-team-member-3]@company ... (etc) subject: ok. &gt;"the wireless is still down." aaaaaand the reply to all happened again. whilst we were trying to quieten everyone down we got another, again, cc'd to basically everyone she'd ever met. &gt;"i tried the password." then another... &gt;"it didn't work." then another... &gt;"i tried my username too. is that the password?" and another... &gt;"what's the password?" each time cc'd to what appears to be her entire address book, each time just one line with no context. each one a new ticket that we have to merge with the old tickets to try and track this growing abomination. to try and stem the tide we sent one of the helldesk to her office to talk to her in person... she wasn't there. whilst hunting for her more emails kept coming in. &gt;"i thought my password might be wrong." &gt;"my password is [password]... is that right?" **headdesk** &gt;"i tried [otherpassword], which is for my pc... is it that one?" **double headdesk** &gt;"i changed my password to [newpassword]. that doesn't work either." i had this image of someone sitting there just typing whatever came into their head into their email client and hitting "send to all" once every few seconds, never reading the replies that came back. then something occurred to me... if she's not sat in front of the computer in her office, and she's not able to use the wifi, then where the hell is she sending these emails from? i was composing a message to that effect when i got this final one: &gt;"by the way, i'm at home." tl;dr: user can't get their home wifi to work. spam everyone they've ever met with their stream of consciousness whilst trying to fix it.i have a really nice speaking voice for the phone, and it works to my advantage. but at times, it can form an unrealistic expectation of my looks to men i talk to on the phone. i talk to a lot of guys who work in the field, and they are less like the corporate guys who apologize for swearing and more like boys playing around. they really have no filter. they usually try to unabashedly flirt with me. i don't care so much about that, it's the time it takes for them to stop and tell me their problem that drives me insane. i have never professed patience as a virtue. one guy in particular was especially flirtatious and obviously decided that he had "game" and would try and woo me even though we were over 2000 miles a part. after our first conversation, i called him the "daaammn, your voice is sexy" guy. dyvis for short. also, one note before i start the story, this guy had a pending request on my facebook that i had neither accepted or ignored. -------------------------------- there i am minding my own business when i get a phonecall. i rattle off my usual spiel. dyvis: hey baby, nice to hear your lovely voice. me: oh hello, what's going on? (nervously laugh) dyvis: why haven't you accepted my fb request? me: oh, i really only have people i know in person and really well on there. dyvis: ah, c'mon, i'm not a creep. me: what problem are you having? (i try to extricate from the uncomfortable conversation.) dyvis: oh, i see how it is. (he guffaws) my aircard isn't working. after some troubleshooting and remoting into his pc, i am checking the drivers and need him to take out the aircard and put it back in. me: can you take it out and put it back in? dyvis: woah, bookinvertebrate, it's a little early for us to be doing that! (laughs obnoxiously, shredding every last remnant of patience i had ever deigned to posess.) finally fed up, my voice entered a flat tone and i said: no, i am not talking about your penis, i am talking about your aircard. he coughs, the line goes silently awkward. my coworker practically broke his neck as he swung it around looking at me with surprise. the guy finally does as i ask and he stays blissfully silent the whole time. i'm sure he thought i was going to report him, but i just wanted him to stfu. greetings fellow support experts! i've come to regale you with a tale of great justice! this is a follow on to an earlier tale about a ridiculously stupid user/owner that just doesn't have a clue what she's doing, which you can read at: after undergoing quite a great deal of hassle and headache associated with their migration to quickbooks 2013, the owners of senior corp finally came to the realization that they were ridiculously under-manned and over-worked, plus lacked real quickbooks experience to deal with their 500+ contractors. so, they decided to add a few heads to the operation. at the time, they had 4 employees / 4 workstations (including owner p's "server") machine. they wanted to add 3 more stations, and intuit/qb support advised that they would need a 'dedicated server' for their quickbooks data - something i had been suggesting for the better part of a year now (yes, i could conceivably have up to 10 stations with 7 pro but a server is clearly the way to go here). since owner p never listens to the it guy but listens to qb support, she now was onboard with me and owner m that they needed to go with a dedicated server…hooray. so, i spec out an inexpensive lenovo server box, with 1tb of raid storage and server 2008r2 with 10 cals. plus 3 additional workstations identical to what they purchased earlier. they have no issues, they order the stuff, stuff delivers. all is well. over a weekend, i get the server in and set up, move the data, etc… no problems at all, backups are running, and the only machine with any shares at all is the 2k8 box. sweet. owner p also requested a second monitor since user l has two (hooked up her old non-hdmi monitor to the vga port). so, there was an extra monitor in there for owner p since she needs to feel special (p has her new 1080p monitor set to 1024x768 resolution btw). monday evening, owner p starts texting me like crazy while i'm at the gym: &gt; 'where'd the quickbooks data go!' &gt; 'how come the quickbooks isnt in my documents' &gt; 'i moved the quickbooks from the p drive to my documents' &gt; 'i can't log in to quickbooks, it says it cant find the file' &gt; 'you screwed everything up with this server, i want it back the way it was' &gt; 'i can't see my quick books screen through go to my pc' at the same time user l emails me: &gt; 'p f----d up the quickbooks somehow. can you un-f--k it when you get a minute. also the vendor excel sheet is gone, i think she f----d that up too.' i come home, and prepare to vnc in to un-f--k the f--k up before dinner. turns out that owner p did in fact move the qb data file and vendor excel file to her my documents, and her desktop…several times. i proceeded to undo the mess and put the files in the right place, so user l and everyone else is working just fine. as i'm wrapping up, owner p apparently gotomypc's into her machine and sees i've done work. she proceeds to call my phone, and that's when the sparks flew: &gt; p: oh thank god you've answered! things are really screwed up! &gt; me: well, yes they would be since you moved the data file off the server where it belongs. you can't go moving the data file. &gt; p: but it needs to be on my pc! i'm in charge, so it should be on my pc! &gt; me: that's not how it works anymore. we have gone to a dedicated server now…any and all shared data needs to be on the server. &gt; p: that's not how i want it! &gt; me: well, that's how it is now. your pc doesn't have any shared folders, as it should, so nobody else in the office can see the data on your computer. anything that needs to be shared must be on the p drive, anything you don't want shared should go in your documents folder. &gt; p: that's so stupid! i should be the master computer! my computer should share everything! &gt; me; no. you just spent x dollars on a server which does all that now for you, just like quickbooks and i recommended. you can't share with all the office pc's using just your computer, remember? &gt; p: that's bulls--t! but fine! i give up! did you fix the thing?! and why can't i see my quickbooks on go to my pc?! &gt; me: well, it's unfortunate you don't like it this way, but it's the way it has to be. as far as your gotomypc access, it would appear that you have quickbooks running on your second monitor. did you switch monitors in gotomypc? &gt; p: switch monitors? what the hell is that? &gt; me: you should be able to control what monitor you're looking at when using gotomypc. i'm not sure what the control would look like, i don't use gotomypc. &gt; p: fine! so how did you fix the mess?! &gt; me: i put the quickbooks file and vendor excel file back in the appropriate locations on the p drive. now everyone can access them, and user l is already in the system remotely from home without any issues. &gt; p: how come i always have so many problems with quickbooks?! &gt; me: well, once everything is set up properly and the files are in the right place, you're the only one that has problems, p. l, m, and s never have problems…and every time you report a problem it's due to you not opening the right file or something else that is only on your end. &gt; p: are you saying i don't know what i'm doing? &gt; me: no, i'm merely stating my observations from current and prior experiences. i believe you guys are hiring a new person that's a quickbooks expert, correct? &gt; p: yes, but i'm very computer savvy, i'm a quickbooks expert! you don't know what you're talking about, you're the idiot that screws everything up! &gt; &lt;&lt; and here is where i lost it and rage mode ensued. i could have cared less about the job at this point. i just unloaded, full lbj treatment style here. &gt;&gt; &gt; me: p, how old are you?? &gt; p: i'm 68. &gt; me: okay, p. i'm going to be direct here, so just shut up and listen. what you just said is not the case at all. you are the one that doesn't know what you're talking about! you are the one that screws everything up! you claim to be a computer savvy individual that knows quickbooks, yet you've managed to create the largest quickbooks clusterf--k that one of their senior engineers has ever seen!!! you don't understand how a network works, you don't understand how data is supposed to be shared in an organization, and most of all…you don't have a clue how accounting works!!! you are the cause of all the problems in your business, because you sabotage the employees there that do know what they're doing. how dare you call me an idiot when i am the one that is constantly fixing your screw ups! &gt; p: &lt;stammering&gt; uhhh…uhhh…uhhh… &gt; me: quite frankly p, you are without a doubt the most incompetent, ignorant user i've dealt with in the last ten years. you have no business being in a quickbooks file, and really you have no business being on a computer to begin with. you just told me "you give up"…well that's what you need to do. give up…retire…go enjoy your life and your grandkids and whatever else makes you happy! just for f--ks sake, stay away from a computer and let your people do the work for you! &gt; p: &lt;sobbing&gt; uhhhh…ok… &gt; me: now, have yourself a lovely evening. i'm going to go eat now. &gt; p: bye. at this point, i figured i was done with the company. she'd fly into a rage at owner m and demand they bring someone else in. i could have cared less. however, ten minutes later owner m calls me… &gt; m: what did you say to p? &gt; me: she said i was an idiot and didn't know what i was doing, so i laid down the ugly truth to her. &gt; m: whatever it was, you rocked her world. she told me she wasn't going to be in the rest of the week and was crying up a storm. &gt; me: good. &gt; m: indeed. thank you for everything. owner m told me that a couple days later owner p let her know she was throwing in the towel and finally retiring 'to spend more time with family'. she came in and cleaned out her office that friday. owner m is beyond grateful to me, as she had been trying to get p to retire for over a year and p wouldn't budge. tl;dr - idiot owner screws things up again, claims to be a genius and calls it guy an idiot. it guy verbally pwns owner into submission and retirement.i read [this other story]( and it reminded me of something a coworker shared with me from back in his day. a story where styles of management and tech support collide. let's call this coworker "tim". many years ago at a company far, far away... tim was working for a u.s. defense firm. as you may expect, defense companies use computers [and other stuff] to test military hardware. one day, during a particular test cycle, the test fails and fails hard. in the beginning, it's not even clear if it's an issue with the computerized test equiment, or the unit under test ["uut"]. god help you if your test equipment fried a perfectly good uut -- the pope will refer you to st jude before running like hell. so there's a tight schedule and all testing is halted because of this failure. managers are sweating. senior managers are sweating. directors and vps are sweating. the customer pays a call to say 'hello' in person. for defense firms, "the customer" is a polite term for "uniformed members of the armed forces". it falls to tim to be the man on the spot. "hey, tim, fix this up double quick." he gets to it. after some troubleshooting, it turns out the test equipment is buggered but the uut is fine. the fix will take roughly 20-40 minutes. ... except that all these managers, senior managers, big wigs galore, and the customer are huddled together 30 feet way "to facilitate". we know how some managers are when it comes to facilitating via being physically present in the room. every few minutes, one of these folks would break away from the group, meander over to tim, and ask some version of, "so, how's it going?" or "what's your status?" or "how close are you to being finished?". every... few... minutes. a 20-40 minute job quickly starts to extend into forever. tim's direct manager walks in. i mean, what's taking tim so damn long? let's call tim's direct manager "bob". bob takes one look at the group of big wigs, and then one look at tim, then back to the big wigs. bob walks over to tim. bob: "tim, how are you doing?" tim: "well bob, i'm trying to do this fix-up work so we can get back to test. i know what needs to be done, i should be done by now to tell you the truth, but they keep coming over one by one and interrupting me." bob spins on the balls of his feet and jabs his finger up in the air. "everybody out!!!" after a few minutes of cat-herding and political massaging, the room is evacuated except for tim and bob. tim continues his work and bob actually helps out by passing tools around. job is done, steps and fixes are logged, the word spreads faster than bad news, and testing can resume. forever after, tim knew he liked working for bob. edit: front page, wow. thank you everybody! edit #2: holy man, i never expected such a turn out when i wrote this. personal records abound. thank you all. i hope to share more stories as they come, and we know they will. [clasps hands and shakes] thank you! edit #3: made it on to "best of ttfs july2013". many thanks!ffs. people are complete idiots. as a web designer, this is what i get 80% of the time - so you can do this for $100 right? anyways, today i had a potential call me and ask about web job he had and this is how it went. client: i am looking to build a website for my small company, i already have the logo and content i just need the website done. &lt;...here i gather the details...&gt; (after gathering details) me: this sounds like a plan, so as far as budget goes.. client: yes, so we were thinking $250 would be good? me: so you want me to spend about two weeks on a project, and get paid $250? client: well it is easy right so what is the problem? me: the problem is you are paying me $3.12/hr for estimated time. client: but web design is easy. me: then do it yourself. *click* ffs. tl;dr - web design is easy, therefore you should be paid $3/hr. **edit:** after this, i have reformatted my website, to include in the contact form *budget requirements*. before this i never did as to let them send details and negotiate. from now on though, i will see how this works out...of course the field is not a required field but lets see how it works out. **edit 2:** i paid myself $1.50 to get myself a drink after finishing the above task as it only took 30 minutes. i got ripped off $0.06 but hey, prices fluctuate.so this happened today at my telco, as i was taking calls on senior line. when we heard about this 'leak' of usernames and passwords earlier today, we very quickly all understood neither gmail itself nor mail.ru had been 'hacked'. we quickly needed to remind frontline staff that either way, the whole thing had nothing to do with *us*, as they were *of course* getting calls about it from some users because... reasons. the topic made some headlines today, sometimes in a sensational fashion that suggested gmail itself was compromised or that the data was generally current and accurate. what was actually hacked is a series of websites with shady security and plaintext passwords. well known names include bioware, eharmony, friendster, fildropper, xtube, etc - whom were compromised sometimes several years ago. stolen email addresses of accounts associated with three mail providers were published, but the accuracy of the passwords appear rather low. usernames are accurate, but a user would need to have used the same password on both the major mail provider and the compromised website and then go on to never change it for it to pause a problem; but on 10 million... yeah there's going to be *many* valid credentials held by people who don't care or don't know better. what does that have to do with a canadian telco? we thought 'nothing', until i got this call... &gt; bytewave: "senior line, bytewave, you may send me your ticket." &gt;patrick: "hey bytewave, going to need a second opinion on this." he worked senior line on a temporary basis (meaning he passed all our exams), so i know he's good and the call will go straight to the point. &gt;patrick: "lady here says she can't log in her email. we can go in fine so i was about to say it's on her end, but she tested it on two computers and her tablet with multiple browsers, with or without router, same deal. everything else works. so i had her disable wifi on her smartphone, and using data it went through. mail provisioning is obviously fine. got any idea?" he had already gone through all the normal troubleshooting, kind of call i like. &gt;bytewave: "okay, so mail auth fails, only for her cable modem's ip address? that's new, or rather that's quite old. we haven't done ip bans to the mail servers since the spam age, and there's no notes about it. but i can't think of anything else." even then it was rarely used, 99% of the time we'd disconnect problem users, but there were special cases when such tools were preferable, like a customer with multiple static ips with only one offender or blocking a single network adapter causing problems from an open wifi spot. i follow my gut instinct and dig up a very old bookmark to an intranet page where such bans of ips or network adapters were listed automatically. it's still up after all these years later. annddd my customer's ip and two of her mac addresses are blocked from the pop and smtp with recent timestamps, no notes anywhere. normally this must be green-lit by internal security. i put patrick on hold. is has no answers for me, they say they're the only ones supposed to do it but if it had been them there would be a flag on the account, and they didn't touch it. okay then, the only others i can think of with access are the mail admins. &gt;bytewave: "bytewave with senior staff, i have blacklisted network adapters and a single ip address without is approval. they haven't used this in a long time, i just wanted to see if..." &gt; mailsystems: "yeah i'm your guy. i got an alert earlier that failed pop login attempts with non-existent usernames were spiking through the roof. honestly, took me hours to get to it, but then i found out they're *all* from this ip. i didn't wait for is; i'd have just disabled the modem but we lost access to provisioning tools in the security review." it takes a second to sink in that there's still major telco whose' pop server lacks any automatic lockout even after thousands of attempts with invalid logins. sure, we'll lock out a specific account if you type the wrong password a few times. 60,000 different accounts you hit once each? if the mail admin gets to it, maybe he'll care to do something about it manually in four hours or so... &gt; bytewave: "so you're telling me the pop got hammered by some script with random usernames? any matches or breaches?" &gt; mailsystems: "that's the good part. there's well less than half a percent of valid addresses, which is very low, but the attacker got into a few still, which isn't the end of the world but translates into a somewhat worrying percentage of auths amongst valid boxes. seems like he had some sort of partial data on passwords, and it operated damn fast too. i'm getting is on it as soon as i'm done typing it up, and i'm monitoring this, should be fine on my end. your end-user will get a call from them." &gt; bytewave: "wait, this is too juicy to just pawn off, i have a theory i can test right now. are you swamped? because if you have five minutes i need some of the addresses, both failures and those that got through." &gt; mailsystems: "no fires to put out, why not?" i assume by now that password leak must be spread pretty widely, it's the internet after all. i bypass the work proxy with my usual clean wifi, and the internet delivers as usual. takes about a minute to find and snatch it. i discard the yandex and mailru leaks right away. a ton of our customers use gmail, though. open that in notepad++. just a long list of gmail addresses with passwords stolen from 3rd parties that may or may not work anymore. &gt; mailsystems - chat : here's some of those that don't exist in our system and just bounced... *file attached* he sends me several, of course all in @mytelco.ca form. i change astreus@mytelco.ca for astreus@gmail.com, boom, it's on the list. after three on three, i'm sold. &gt; bytewave: "its the damn credentials leak! the script kiddie on the other end is just fishing for people who might also be our customers, using identically-named addresses on both our domain and gmail's, and who are still reusing the same password. he just got lucky a few times but out of these 5 million there's statistically quite a few more. dawned on me that any large isp with similarly shitty mail security could be hammered in the same way for a few handfuls of valid accounts of random people reusing usernames and passwords everywhere - though it's anyone's guess what could be gained from that. and you'd most likely be locked out swiftly.. elsewhere, anyhow. &gt; mailsystems: "yeah with those numbers i figured the attacker needed some source of at least partially valid data, that makes sense. we're just setting up a temp ban for multiple wrong usernames, should prevent further attempts. i checked the accounts he got in too... little of value was endangered. we'll coordinate with is then? " that temp ban 'idea' should have been up long ago. by now, i've kind of figured the lady we had on the phone wasn't our scripter fishing for random valid logins. more than likely the other email address registered in her account that ended with a '98' belonged to the guilty party. most likely a 16 years old teen; i search for that username, and, with much irony (reusing usernames...), find every trace of online life you can expect from a careless teenager, up to and including a reddit account under that very name. annddd he posted a comment in a post about the password leak. if you're reading this: *slow clap.* at least he's not reusing passwords. &gt; bytewave: "okay, i'll coordinate with you, but would you have a use for the script that was used? i know you can't see billing data, but this account belongs to a lady with a teenager who is likely responsible, there's decent circumstantial evidence. we could probably..." &gt; mailsystems: "nah, write it all down for is, but we're not running such a script *voluntarily* on my watch. we're lucky it just caused a slight slowdown, you know how old the hardware is, right? besides, people reusing usernames and passwords are beyond any mail admin's help." right. out of my hands then, so i just filed everything, down to the semi-incriminating reddit comment from someone using the same alias' as the customer's kid. i was forced to tell patrick that even though we had found the cause of the problem, she'd need to wait for our security team to call her before we could explain the details. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!]( i used to work as a student worker for a college where i provided support for anything and everything that needed support, printers, ad, av setups, lab deployments, scripts, cable runs, ad, and pretty much anything you could think of or **bigboss** told me to do. this tale is about one of the most awkward situations that i've ever had happen doing a task that is really simple. anyways one morning i get an email: &gt;nurse:"hey i was wondering if i could have "specificlabprinter" added to my office computer." now a word about this or campus had a large number of printers it had been set up so administrators would have to physically add the printer to computers as some of them we didn't want anyone and everyone to be able to print to such as 3d-printers, plotters, and some color printers. anyways their office was literally across the hall from our lab so i figured i would go down and do it n person. so i go to her office. &gt;**nurse:**"ohh hey thegiantcat1 here to set up the printer?" &gt;**me:**"yep, shouldn't take long just have to log in and add the printer" &gt;**nurse:***"alright i wasn't doing on anything go ahead" i sit down and get started, now a word about how we are set up. everything is on roaming profiles so if a teacher logs into a classroom system they easily have access to all their files, they don't have to worry about using a flash drive, or using a network share or have to learn anything they can just log in and they will be there in their documents. this is where it gets interesting the second i log in i see the user start to tear up and she asks: &gt;**nurse:**"is that your cat? *pointing at my desktop backround*" &gt;**me:**"yep thats my kitty" &gt;**nurse:**"my cat *kitty* just passed away last night, he looks like a sweet heart *pointing at my cat*" &gt;**me:**"i'm sorry to hear that..." &gt;**nurse:**"here is a picture of him..." after adding the printer she showed me pictures of her and her cat it was actually kind of sweet, afterwards she thanked me and gave me a hug and a picture of her cat and a packet of hot cocoa mix. she even sent an email to **bigboss** about how sweet i am and asked that if i'm available i deal with her, which isn't a problem as she is actually a nice person who is willing to listen and trouble shoot. **tldr:**go to install printer, end up helping a user cope with the loss of her pet.i posted [this]( story about) about traffic powered wireless and people seemed interested in my story about the judges daughter. so here it is. i was doing my normal shift helping customers with their broadband, television and phoneline woes and i got a call i'll never forget. this was a few years ago when i was relitivley green. i've had my fair share of crazies. tin foil hat style. overyly paranoid. we tend to humour them but this girl was different and changed the way i view the crazies. so here it is. &gt; me: hi there, you're speaking with jaay how can i help? *she sounds really panicked* &gt; pars: hi there, my names paranoid and rightly so. i really need your help i think someone is hacking our phone line! we need to get this fixed! *alarm bells ring. ok let's humour her* &gt; me: ok, let's have a look. what makes you think your line is being hacked? &gt; pars: well. my father is a judge and he's preciding over a major case. a few of the people involved in the case were stalking me a few weeks ago when they managed to hack my apple details so they could follow me around using the gps information in order to scare me. i managed to get that sorted but now i think they are listening to our phone calls! i'm so scared! you need to help us. *ok i tottally think this chick is a zoomer who thinks the mothership will be coming to pick her up soon. so i open google and search judge parl. sure enough top result is a wikipedia page of this girls father. i still think she's a loony though* &gt; me: ok let's have a look. your line seems fine on this end and since there doesn't seem to be a fault with the line the only way i can send someone out to investigate the line would be chargable call out. &gt; pars: yes that's fine! when can you get someone out? *so i book her out a technician to my surprise as the crazies normally back out when you tell them their paranoia will cost them £99. i save her account details out of curiosity and check them a couple days later when the tech had visited. turned out the technician found a strange device on her line which shouldn't have been there... so turned out she was right.* *her dad must have been into some proper shit.* **tl;dr**: don't judge a fruit loop by it's colour. a manager of a department in my warehouse messaged me on our im app and told me that she had sent "too many jobs" to a label printer which is on the network. i come in, she tells me "it just keeps printing, i can't stop it." i take a look, and there were about 47 billion (with a b) jobs going to the printer. i go on the server, cancel the jobs, and all was well. i asked why she didn't put a ticket in or call me on the radio. she said she was too embarrassed to do either. it turns out she had scanned a bar code into the print quantity field. after law school, i did some contract document review. while dull, it was lucrative. it entails sitting in front of a screen, looking at documents and reading other people's email and figuring out if they were useful for a filed lawsuit. any voyeuristic tendencies were beaten out of me by doing this. in order to keep us productive, internet access was 'turned off'. since the document images were hosted remotely, i realized that there might be a way around this. after a bit of poking around, i realized that internet explorer was locked down and only able to view the document hosting sites. the leasing company had set these machines up and wasn't available to unlock them. to get around this, i installed the portable version of firefox on a usb drive so i could browse the internet during breaks. eventually this came to the notice of the paralegal managing the job-site. instead of getting in trouble, she found this resourceful. i soon got pressed into offering tech support for the rest of the team, especially when we needed to obtain and distribute documents from sites barred by the restrictive policy. i had a few additional usb drives that i offered to my friends. one is grace, a delightful older woman without much technical savvy. grace looks at me browsing the web after inserting the usb drive. grace:"so that's why you can browse the web and we can't" me:"yep" grace:"that's amazing" me:"i guess" grace:"you can fit the entire internet on that little drive" fateful short tale from this morning: user calls up blowing up that she can't search for files on the server. &gt; "see i go into the folder where i save them and they are all there, but when i search only one shows up." this person has invoices going back about two years in this folder. &gt; user procedes to type in "invoice" &gt; 1 file appears "invoice sheat yyymmdd.docx" i check back to the folder location - every single document had been spelt invioce sheet yyyymmdd apart from the one file where invoice was spelt correctly and sheet was spelt wrong. back to the vnc session and i type in "invioce" and hundreds of documents appear in the search window &gt; "...... um ....... i'm really really sorry for wasting your time.... thanks *click*" wednesday's hey.last month i received a call from one of my frequent fliers. &gt; me: internal it helpdesk, this is simality, how may i help you? &gt; her: hi, i can't get to $webbasedapplication &gt; me: what happens when you try? &gt; her: it won't come up! &gt; me: hmmm...that's not good. let's make sure its not an internet issue. &gt; her: it's not. &gt; me: humor me. could you try going to $othersite? &gt; her: *(pause)* it won't load either. &gt; me: okay, well in that case, let's let windows run its troubleshooter on the internet connection. &gt; her: the connection is fine; the internet is working. &gt; me: how can you be so sure? &gt; her: i keep getting a time warner page when i try and go places. &gt; me: that's odd....what does it say? &gt; her: "easy ways to pay your bill." before my current place of employment, i had a support job with a moderate sized company that manufacture tape backup and anti-virus software. wonderful company to work at (before they got bought out), great boss and mostly wonderful co-workers. the following is one of the cases i picked up while i worked there... fm: thank you for calling $software_company, this is flying_monkies, how can i help you today? pebkac: your backup software keeps destroying my tape drives, who do i talk to about submitting a bill to have you replace the drives you destroyed. ok, this is a new one on me. the software runs on the server and does nothing but issue scsi read/write commands against the device... fm: i'm sorry sir, but what do you mean by "destroys your tape drive". pebkac: well, i'll attach the tape drive to the server, it'll work for 3-4 days then it stops working. we're no longer able to read or write to the tapes. your software has destroyed four of my tape drives, this is the fifth one about to go out and i need you to replace them. seriously, down four tape drives and you keep plugging them in?!? fm: ok sir. the software only runs on the server and it only issues scsi commands to the tape drive, it doesn't really have a way to affect the hardware device. you say your current drive is starting to exhibit errors? pebkac: yes, i need another drive immediately, who from your company can i send the invoice to since you're destroying my drives. fm: let's see if there's something else going on first. can you please go into the tape engine service, check the box for debug and kick off a quick backup? pebkac: i can, but you're just going to owe me a new drive. sure we will... he runs the backup, takes about five minutes and i have him email me the logs. first thing i notice is that he's using an exabyte tape drive. nice, second thing i notice is the drive telling me the make of tape. hmmm, funny, but i don't remember that tape being valid for that model drive. pull up the exabyte website, look at the tape drive and sure enough, the tape he's using has a particle density higher than the tape drive supports. whenever he does a backup using these tapes he's effectively sanding the read/write heads off the tape drive. fm: sir, i think i've found your problem. can you open the log up you sent me? i need you to look at a couple of things. pebkac: ok. fm: sir, see on this line where it displays the tape drive model? pebkac: yes. fm: great, and do you see here where it shows the tape you're using? pebkac: yes, that's the tape we've got. i don't understand why you're showing me this, i need a new tape drive immediately. fm: yes sir... now, if you can go to this url &lt;point him to the specs for the tape drive&gt;. pebkac: ok... fm: do you see here, where it shows the tape models you're allowed to use with this drive and the warning message that using different model tapes can cause irreparable, permanent damage... pebkack: .... fm: you need to switch to one of the models of tape supported with this drive sir. is there anything else i can do to assist you today? pebkac: ... fm: thank you for calling $software_company, have a nice day. if you enjoyed this, which would you like to hear next: the customer who used the birthday scheme for their addressing or my co-worker i had to back fill on site because he burned a hole in his eye? edit: thank you kind sir/madam for the gold!a couple doors down in the industrial park from dishonest used car dealership was a shop that built canoes and kayaks. we hated each other. when i got hired on as a service writer, the guy i was replacing pulled me aside and shared some wisdom, saying, &gt;”look, kid. there’s three things you gotta get if you’re gonna work here. 1. rom and the amazon are a$$holes. 2. sales wins every argument, and 3. we hate those f#ckers at the kayak place.” the war had been going on so long that no one could even remember who had fired the first salvo nor what specific disagreement had even sparked the conflict. we only knew where the current front in the war was, and that front was in the parking lot. those animals at the kayak place for some reason absolutely *hated* how many cars we had in the back lot. it shouldn’t have been an issue: the back lot was galactic in size and was never more than half full. our lease specifically granted us use of 60 parking spots and we never used more than about 40. and you know, guess what: if you move into the same complex as a used car dealership, you shouldn’t be super surprised if there are some used cars parked around. none of these facts mattered to the barbarians at the kayak place. each morning i would come in, park the jeep, and walk into the back door, with eyes like daggers glaring out at me from the kayak place’s shadowy back door. some time around noon, like clockwork, the tribal elder over there would march out to the lot and painstakingly count the cars that belonged to us, grumbling the entire time about how many there were. twice a month or so we’d get a snarly phone call from the landlady, telling us that she had received complaints that we had upwards of 100 cars on the lot, in spite of there only being a third of that. it had all gotten a little ridiculous. one friday, it boiled over. *** this particular friday was unusually slow for us, slow enough that i actually had some downtime. the defrost switch in the jeep was on the fritz, and it doesn’t come out without removing the entire god-damn dash bezel. late pre-facelift cherokees are just complete mongrel cars - the dashboard is all amc, but some jackass put a parts-bin chrysler steering column in, and the two do *not* play well together. now age the plastic 15 years in the sun until it’s good and brittle. getting the extremely fragile and yet completely enormous dash bezel out is a careful ballet of nervous sweating and cursing, lest you snap the bezel in two around the narrow steering column cutout. i’ve been at it for a good ten minutes trying desperately to sneak the tiny column cutout on the bezel past a steering column the size of the moon when someone starts shouting. &gt;”hey! hey! who’s the f#ckin’ boss here?” i peered over the dashboard and saw the alpha male of the kayak herd standing in the bay door. i rolled my eyes and acknowledged his existence. &gt;me: “hey, i’m in here! what can i do for you?” &gt;chief kayak: “yeah. yeah, you the boss?” &gt;me: “sort of. look, i’m kind of in the middle of something delicate, can this wait?” &gt;ck: “yeah, well, look, you f#ck, i wanna talk to the boss about all these f#ckin’ cahs out here.” &gt;me: “in that case, we’re an anarcho-syndicalist commune…” &gt;ck: “i’m sick’a all these f#ckin’ cahs in the f#ckin’ lot! there’s too many f#ckin’ cahs!” &gt;me: “my count says there’s 36 that belong to us today. i can recount ‘em if you want, but we’re well below the 60 we’re allowed on the lease.” &gt;ck: “36! 36, that’s horse$hit. there’s gotta be a hundred out there!” &gt;me: “yep, and not all of them belong to us. it might surprise you to learn this, but we don’t own every single car in the world. now, if you don’t mind, i’m trying to do something very delicate here, and i need to concentrate.” i turned and started back trying to coax the dash bezel out past the column. maybe he’d take the hint. he didn’t. my ignoring him only further fueled his rage, and he began shouting directly in my ear. &gt;ck: “i’m sick’a this $hit. you know what? i’ve been talkin’ to my lawyer. yeah. we’ve been talkin’ all day about what to do about yous f#cks. you get all these f#ckin’ cahs moved now, or you’re gonna hear from him. and while you’re at it, you can go f#ck yahself!” &gt;*crack* f#ck. f#ck f#ck f#ck. it was all i could do to keep from taking the broken pieces of dashboard bezel and smashing them over his head. &gt;me: “i’m afraid you’ve said the magic l-word, and at this point, i’m forced to terminate this conversation. any further contact with any employees of this company will need to be directed through our counsel. i will also have to ask you to leave the premises. have a good day.” &gt;ck: “no, i ain’t done with you. you get in these f#ckin’ cahs and you move ‘em now! now!” by this point, colossal redneck and the raver had come out to the bay to see what all the commotion was about. colossal redneck walked up to chief kayak and got up in his face. &gt;cr: “the man told you to leave. this here’s private property and y’all is tresspassin’.” the dictator of kayakistan started to say something, but colossal redneck just stepped back a pace, flipped out his phone, and dialed. &gt;cr: “howdy. this’s colossal redneck at dishonest used car dealership. we got ourselves a trespasser. y’all po-lice wanna come take care of ‘im, or should i just do it myself?” colossal redneck would have easily weighed in at 300 lbs after a month of starvation, and he had a good foot on the savage from the kayak place. i’ve been in enough fights to know that you don’t take on the big guy, and the primitive standing in my bay apparently had gotten the memo as well. he retreated and colossal redneck called off the cops. *** &gt;”holy. balls.” the owners, colossal redneck, miami vice, and i rolled into the lot at about the same time the next monday and found a disaster. about 10 of our cars had been keyed. and not just keyed, but *keyed.* two windshields were smashed, tires were slashed… it was a mess. of course, we immediately knew who had done it. colossal redneck filed a police report, the amazon got in touch with our insurance agent, who surely was going to drop us this time, and rom and i dug into the security camera footage to see what it caught. a blurry pickup pulled into the lot late sunday night and two blurry humanoids in blurry hoodies piled out. the humanoids had blurry items in their hands and did blurry things to blurry cars. &gt;rom: “why can’t we see anything?” &gt;me: “how much did you pay for this camera?” &gt;rom: “it was on sale at radio shack.” &gt;me: “that’s why.” we had nothing we could pin him with. *** &gt;*pfoot bang… pfoot bang… pfoot bang* oh goodie, weird noises coming from the service bay. i walked out and discovered felonious monk molesting a pile of splice connectors. &gt;me: “what… what would you say you are… doing?” &gt;fm: “check this out. you take a splice connector, and you fill it full of hot glue, and then once it dries you stuff it in the tip of a blow gun. and then watch this $hit!” felonious monk grabbed one of his hastily-constructed missiles and stuffed it in the end of a blow gun. he connected the blow gun to the air compressor and pointed it outside. &gt;*pfoot bang* the blow gun launched its projectile at somewhere approaching the speed of sound, sending it all the way to deepest, darkest kayakia, slamming into their bay door and leaving a golfball-sized dent. the back door of the kayak place opened and a face peeked out of the shadows. &gt;ck: “hey! hey yous f#cks! i know it’s you making that racket! quit f#cking with my bay door!” i smiled and waved. felonious monk did a little jig. &gt;ck: “f#ck all you f#ckin’ a$$holes!” the door slammed. felonious monk stuffed another missile into the launcher. &gt;*pfoot bang* felonious monk shot me a grin. &gt;fm: “i figure i just do that every once-in-a-while and maybe he’ll go crazy.” &gt;me: “he’s already crazy.” &gt;fm: “well i dunno. maybe he’ll kill himself.” &gt;me: “well, i obviously can’t condone this kind of behavior, but it does look like you’re getting a little low on splice connectors. i’ll order another couple of boxes for the afternoon delivery.” *** things were quiet for the next couple of weeks. a couple times a day, felonious monk or one of the other technicians would launch a few splice connectors over toward our mortal enemies, just enough to keep them on their toes over there. their bay door was beginning to look like it had a bad case of acne. then one rainy tuesday, i got a call from the landlady. &gt;me: “service, this is…” &gt;ll: “60 cars. that’s how many you can have. 60 cars. 60.” &gt;me: “we’re aware. i’ve got 43 out there right now, give or take one or two. you can drop by and count them if you want.” &gt;ll: “i don’t care how many you’ve got, i’m sick of getting these calls that you have too many cars. 60. you get 60.” this was fairly typical for the landlady. any conversation eventually devolved into her just repeating the same few words, *rainman*-style, until you hung up. luckily, just then the diplomat walked by my office on her way to lunch. you may remember her as the young lady we hired to handle red tape for us. she was unbelievably persuasive. i waved her over. &gt;me: “hey, landlady, just real quick, there’s somebody here who can handle this issue better than me.” i put her on hold and filled in the diplomat. she took the phone and worked her magic. &gt;td: “hi! hey, look, we know you’re sick of making these calls, and we don’t want you to be burdened with this kind of stuff. you’ve got a lot on your plate to handle, and a dumb parking dispute has got to be unbelievably trivial for you to have to bother with. look, we know it was chief kayak filing the complaints because he’s been over here threatening us with lawyers over the same issue. if you’d like, and the complainant is willing, we would like to sit down with you and him and see if we can come to some kind of amicable agreement. really? great! hey, when you come, can you bring a copy of everybody’s leases? i just want to go over them with the group to make sure we’re in compliance and not treading upon what they have promised in their own lease, you know? great! friday at noon? awesome. thank you!” she tossed the phone onto the hook, gave me a grin, and disappeared. *** noon on friday rolled around and i found myself with the diplomat, the landlady, and chief kayak all crowded in my office. the landlady pulled out our lease and slid it across the table to the diplomat. &gt;td: “if no one minds, i’d also like to see the lease for the kayak place. you don’t mind, do you?” &gt;ck: “why?” &gt;td: “i’m guessing what’s going on here is that you’ve been given a bunch of spaces in the lot, and we’ve been given a bunch of spaces in the lot, and together, it’s more spaces than there are parking spaces in the lot, you know? and then you come in, and the lot is full with our cars…” i had no idea what she was up to. the lot was never even close to full. half full at most. she smiled at chief kayak. &gt;td: “so you don’t mind if i just have a quick look, do you?” &gt;ck: “no… i guess not.” the landlady shrugged and looked through her briefcase, pulling out the kayak place’s lease. while the diplomat slowly read through the two leases, chief kayak amused himself by working himself up into a froth. horrendous, hateful, deeply untrue accusations were levied against us. &gt;ck: “yous f#cks always have all these f#ckin’ cahs in the lot! there’s hundreds of ‘em! and worse yet, now yous f#cks are shootin’ some kinda thing at my bay door! it’s all covered in dents from you f#ckin’ assholes!” i bit the inside of my cheeks to keep from grinning. &gt;ck: “i’m sick’a all the f#ckin’ cahs! they gotta go, all the f#ckin’ cahs! they’s makin’ my shop look like it’s in a junkyahd. it’s like we’re on the set of *the jeffersons* or somethin’!” &gt;me: “*sanford and son*.” &gt;ck: “*the jeffersons*, *sanford and son*, whateveah!” the landlady chimed in with her usual admonishment. &gt;ll: “60 cars. you can only have 60 cars! no more than 60 cars.” before the landlady could repeat herself once again or chief kayak could work himself up into another crazed rant, the diplomat chimed in. &gt;td: “i’m sorry to interrupt, but i think i’ve found something. as everyone will note, our lease does show we can occupy up to 60. what i’d like to do is go outside with everyone and count how many we’ve got, just to show everyone we’re in compliance.” we walked outside and i counted our cars for everyone. 35 today. &gt;td: “so, there’s still a bunch of other cars on the lot. 36055512, who do those belong to?” &gt;me: “i’m not sure. i see a couple parked in front of the gravestone place - i suppose those belong to them. and then the florist over there has five or six. and then the rest, i assume, belong to the kayak place.” &gt;td: “is that right, chief kayak? how many cars do you have on the lot today?” &gt;ck: “i dunno, there’s the workahs, and me, and the delivery vans, so that’s like 20 cahs. so what?” &gt;td: “well, that’s interesting, because your lease only gives you fifteen parking spaces.” the look of “oh $hit” on his face was delicious to watch. &gt;ck: “what!? lemme see that.” chief kayak snatched the lease from the diplomat, and she indicated where in the fine print she was reading. the landlady immediately chimed in. &gt;ll: “fifteen! that’s how many cars you get! fifteen cars! you get fifteen! fifteen cars!” &gt;me: “you know, ms. landlady, it sounds like there are a bunch of cars on this lot that are illegally parked. i’d be more than happy to grab our tow rig and remove them for you.” the landlady threw up her hands in disgust at the lot of us and divorced herself from the group, walking off to her car. chief kayak turned tail and retreated back to the uncivilized hole from whence he had come, pausing only briefly to turn and shout, &gt;”this ain’t the last you’ve heard of this, you f#ckin’ a$$holes!” *** epilogue: it was, in fact, the last us f*ckin’ a$$holes heard about it, though the following monday, five of his employees were conspicuously parked on the street. that evening, i stood in the bay with the technicians, carefully filling splice connectors with hot glue. &gt;*pfoot bang… pfoot bang… pfoot bang* we hate those f*ckers at the kayak place.again let's visit the magical land of what the absolute fuck. working at a small company budget is a major concern. so if it can be done cheap great, free is better. i come in one morning to find the boss has performed one of their "audits"of my computer. having already configured spiceworkd i never understood why they needed to go to computers. then again, they didn't seem to have a clue what they were doing. these audits consisted of looking around for files and applications they don't know and deleting them. i wrote code examples like github gists to demonstrate how things could be implemented. they were deleted to prevent them accidentally being included in release builds. two branches of source code, better delete one... which one? better delete them both so they know not to have multiple copies. that reminds me, i better ask where we are up to with the new features they were writing. i would come back to databases being deleted. migration projects gone! database engines gone! i open outlook to see they have once more removed the reading pane. oh look they have moved all my email and forwarded them all to themselves. oh joy, i envision a day of "you received an email 3 years ago from.x at y about z can i mark this as resolved?" there is an email from them at 04:00. "it has been noted that hardcore pornography was on your computer." unsure what constitutes hardcore these days i email back "was this email meant for me? i am not sure what you mean." after only a few seconds i receive an email back with "on your computer you had a file called gimp that contained pornography." "do you mean gimp the gnu image manipulation package? i used last week to edit graphics for a client as we do not have photoshop." "we have photoshop. i will bring it in. it's the latest version you can get and it cost us a fortune." they brought in cs2. i was expecting cs 5. it appeared to have been bought at a rummage sale and i was told not to activate it. gimp was never mentioned again. tl:dr; the gimp's sleeping.in the hospital i work at we have portable workstations that use these big 24ah batteries to power them and i've tasked myself with going through and inventorying the locations of each of the chargers because we've got a couple listed as "unallocated" that have bad batteries reporting back to the manufacturer. so i get in and get through 5 floors and on the next floor as i'm looking for the chargers i was told that there was a mobile workstation, called a wow for workstation on wheels, that wasn't responding to badges, keyboard or mouse input. usually this means it has a crappy startech plastic hub and just needs to have the power and b connector disconnected and reconnected. i tried that first and it didn't work. crap! now i have to take it apart to replace the old style hub with our newer ones. as i'm taking it apart i'm noticing that the screws are loose as hell, the wires aren't managed properly and i started complaining quietly to myself trying to figure out what moron did this wow previously. so 45 minutes later i get everything buttoned back up, i tighten the screws properly and velcro strip the wires so it's more asthetically pleasing and better tucked away. i return the wow back to the floor and go back to my charger inventory duties and 20 minutes later it hits me, i worked on that wow about a month after i started here. and i remember bitching about the other techs tightening the hell out of the screws. so the screwup was me. it goes to show you that everyone can have an off day, including you. i'm new here so this might not be correct format, but here it goes. years ago, i worked tech support for a company and about 75% of my work were taking calls from customers who locked themselves out of our website. it's a very simple and basic website for customers to manage their accounts. one of the most memorable calls i received was from a customer locking themselves out and needing a password reset. it went like this. **idiocracy13:** thank you for calling, i can i assist you today? **customer:** your website sucks and i can't login. **idiocracy13:** i apologize about that. can i have your name and account number? **customer:** jesus (insert expletive here) christ, why can't you pull it up with my phone number that shows up on your screen? **idiocracy13:** if you don't have your account number handy, i can pull it up with the phone number but i still need your name. **customer:** i don't have time for this. fine. it's (customers name). now can you (insert expletive here) help me? **idiocracy13**: thank you for that information, but lets try to keep this call professional and refrain from using profanity. so what seems to be the problem when you attempt to login? (my company advised us reps that if a customer started using profanity and/or became abusive, we could give a warning and disconnect if it continued) **customer:** look, i'm a millionaire and i can speak however the hell i want. we spend a lot of money with you guys (they didn't) and i will cancel this account if you don't help me get on your god damn website. my username won't work so fix it. **idiocracy13:** i apologize you are having trouble on our website, what is the username you are using? **customer:** customer12321 **idiocracy13:** thank you. i see that it has been locked out. i have unlocked it and reset your password. is your email still customer12321 @email.com? **customer:** yes, now why did you have to reset it? it's always the same with you people. i used the right (insert expletive here) password so it shouldn't have been locked out. **idiocracy13:** ma'am, i'm going to have to ask you again to refrain frrom using profanity. if it happens again, i will disconnect the call. the reason your password was reset is because anytime a username is locked, our system will automatically generate a new password and email to the email address on file. have you gotten the email? **customer:** are you trying to say i am stupid and don't know how the internet works? i am a millionaire and obviously very successful and know a lot about computers. **idiocracy13:** i am not saying you are stupid, i am just explaining how the process works. did you get the email yet? **customer:** yes **idiocracy13:** thank you. can you please trying logging in again with the temporary password? i'll stay on the line with you. you can copy and paste it if you'd like **customer:** okay, i just put the password in and it isn't taking it. this is ridiculous. i don't know what you mean by copy and paste. **idiocracy13:** hmm, okay. are you getting a specific error message? **customer:** it just says it isn't correct. at this point in the call, i usually start asking some basic troubleshooting questions. i asked her what os and browser she was using. both of which we support. then this happened. **idiocracy13:** can you make sure your caps lock isn't on? **customer:** wow, you guys really think i'm an idiot don't you? of course it's not on. i've been dealing with computers since the 70's so i know how they work. **idiocracy13:** i am not saying that ma'am. i'm just trying to help you login. can you do one last thing for me? can you type in your username and tell me if it's all uppercase or lower case? **customer:** it's all big letters (sic). **idiocracy13:** okay, that means your caps lock is on. if you..... **customer:** (insert expletive here) you and your company. *click* --------------------------------------------------------------------------- i know it might not be as exciting as some of the tales on here, but i guess some people truly believe their wealth makes them experts. i was curious after that call and did a simple google search on her company. well it isn't even hers. it's her husbands and she was labeled as the secretary. edit: some are questioning how i can remember it so well. well it was a recorded call and i saved all of my really crazy calls on my computer up until i quit a few months ago. i listened to a few of them on my last day and this happened to be one of them. they wouldn't let me take the call with me though :(. i was a manager when i left and had been out of the tech call center for a bit. it may not be verbatim..........but i'm sure 90% of the posts here aren't either. i hate making difficult phone calls, the receiver starts getting heavy before you even pick it up. i pick up the phone. i can’t do this without coffee. i walk over to the kitchen and grab my cup. the boss picked up on the second ring. he was fast. &gt;boss: hello? &gt;me: hello mr president. its airz here, i’m the security and it manager. &gt;boss: oh yes! i’ve heard about you. how’s everything going? &gt;me: not so great mr president…. &gt;boss: let me speed things along a little. there has been a break-in, you’re worried about your audit and your budget situation is abysmal. &gt;me: errr… coffee looked back up at me. it was instant. so fast. &gt;boss: i do pay attention sometimes. &gt;me: yes. a break-in has occurred…. &gt;boss: i wouldn’t worry about it. vp called me a while ago and told me not to worry. &gt;me: i’m head of security though, and a whole rack has gone missing. &gt;boss: unfortunately i owe the vp quite a lot. i wouldn’t trust the guy as far as i could throw him, but i do owe him. &gt;me: sorry what? &gt;boss: oh sorry, i was off in my head again. not enough coffee… here’s what you do, get the network back up then lock that room down. &gt;me: police? insurance? &gt;boss: no no. i owe the vp. he told me not to bother, he said he’d cover it. &gt;me: fix the network then lock the room down. &gt;boss: yep. oh and make sure you’re the only one with a key. i sipped my coffee. tasted suspicious. &gt;me: could i get that in writing? &gt;boss: oh, yes. don’t worry though, i’ve got your back. just behind the scenes thats all. &gt;me: thanks? after hanging up the phone i looked at my email. nothing new. not yet. [next]( [older stories - follow this if you're a fan of chronological order]( [older stories - written order and all](i work at a tech firm that services residences and businesses in the surrounding area. i'm sure everyone here understands the basics of what that entails. this particular service call for one of our contracted clients, a cpa firm, took place this past week. **client:** tax season is coming up pretty quick, so we need to clear off some of our computers to make way for new temporary hires. **me:** ok, that shouldn't be a problem. what do you mean by "clear off?" **client:** like make it so the new employees don't have to use the old employees login and files, that kind of thing. **me:** alright, well when the new employees start, we'll just need to create new user accounts for them on the server. once that's done, all they'll need to do is sign in and begin working. **client:** i don't want them to have to use the old employees information. i want these computers cleared off so none of the old stuff is there. what do you call that? wipe and reload? *a feeling of dread begins to form in the pit of my stomach, and a disturbance in the force tells me i'm about to lose my cheery demeanor.* **me:** you want to have windows reinstalled on all these computers? **client:** yes, so the new hires won't be using the old employees information. **me:** they already won't be. they'll be using their own logins that we'll create when they are hired, and all files are stored on the server. the old employee logins have already been deactivated, so nobody could even use them if they wanted to. **client:** well when you go to sign in, it still has their name there. **me:** ah, i see what you're saying. it's quite simple to change that. all you need to d- **client:** it may be simple to you, but it's not to me. i don't want to spend a lot of time trying to figure it out. just clear the computers off for the new employees. *steam begins to billow from my ears due to being cut off mid-sentence.* **me:** i understand what you're asking for. i'm trying to tell you your computers are set up so that doesn't need to be done. all you have to do- **client:** *sigh* how long is this going to take? i have a lot to do and i need to get back to work. *red is beginning to cloud my vision, and the steam spouting from my ears is whistling like a tea kettle.* **me, forcefully:** all you have to do is click the "switch user" button and type in the new username. **client:** i don't know where that button is. we'll just call you guys when we start hiring some new people and you can help us then. *walks off.* i stood there for a moment, simultaneously dumbfounded and enraged at the clients rudeness/ignorance/refusal to learn what has to be the most simple task you can possibly do on a computer, short of turning it on. tl;dr - client wants complete windows reinstalls on multiple domain workstations to get rid of former employee usernames at login. refuses to learn about the apparently-understated "switch user" button. drives me to rekindle my friendship with the captain. edit: it seems i forgot the most important point of this entire incident, and now feel like an idiot. that's what i get for typing this up at 3am. i mentioned the client is contracted, but i forgot to detail what this means. the client pays a monthly rate for msp monitoring services, and part of their contract is unlimited labor. any work i would have done would have been under this contract, meaning we would have made no $$$ from going ahead and wiping/reloading the computers, and it would have ultimately been a colossal waste of time.senior staff's line at my telco has a (very secret) direct priority number that bypasses everything. we not only refuse to write it down anywhere, we even deny it exists at all unless someone has a valid reason to need it; most of management aren't even aware it does. of course, no matter how well you keep a secret, anyone can punch in random numbers and *might* end up talking to the prime minister's secretary. in the same fashion, anyone can hand out false random numbers to their credit card company. and so our secret number somehow ended up on the call sheet of a [third party debt collection agency.]( it should be a simple matter of telling them 'i'm not the justin mackenzie you're looking for' and that they're calling a business line in a call center for them to take us off their sheet, right? nope. we told them over and over, and they kept calling. very unpleasant calls to boot as they operate on a 'bad cop' principle where they assume you're lying about your identity if you deny being their guy and berate you about being irresponsible repeatedly. several of us spoke to them, but the caller was different everytime (they're a call center too), and even though at first we took the time to convince them or even provide evidence, everytime they told us they'd stop calling, we'd get another angry call asking for justin the next day. i drew the line once their priority call fell on amelia, who has the sweetest feminine voice imaginable, and the idiot on the other end *accused her of being justin mackenzie*, at which point she turned on speakerphone and i got to hear him scream she should pay 'his' bills or they'd make 'his' parents pay them. i waved her to transfer it to me. &gt; bytewave: "justin mackenzie speaking, please hold." &gt; boss: "the hell?! how are we going to get them to stop calling now?" &gt; bytewave: "i'm just messing with them now, i had to talk them down once already, it's enough. their outbounds all go through a single number, we can block it." &gt; boss: "how do you know? it's a confidential number, for all we know each of them could have their own line.." i point at one of my screens, where i have a chat session open with a friend at switchboards. &gt; bytewave im - inbound call at xxx-555-8080 received at 10:27, i need to know if the caller's number matches other calls we got at this number on [timestamps of the tickets for three other calls we got from them]. &gt; switchboards im - sec. &gt; switchboards im - yeah. confidential number, its xxx-555-1820. &gt; boss: "oh. good work. thanks, about time this ends." i call switchboards with the muted collection call agent on the other line listening in. &gt; bytewave: "hey man. i need a corporate-wide ban from inbounds from that line you sent me, xxx-555-1820. hell, let's throw in the subcontractors too." switchboards: "sure thing. i just need a ticket for the records." &gt; bytewave: "sending now, i attached the wav file where they're accusing amelia of being a guy named justin who owes them some money and threatened her parents." &gt; switchboards: "you're kidding me? why didn't she just explain that we're $telco and.." &gt; bytewave: "believe me, we tried, i had four timestamps, remember? that's just about half of it. all that can be said in their favor is that i'd hate to owe them money. not because they're good - because they'd be too stupid to stop calling even once i paid my damn bills." &gt; switchboards: "done, they can't connect to any of our work lines anymore. i used the broadest ban available." as he says this, i see my muted line one just cut. switchboards is extra effective. &gt; bytewave: "thank you. next time you come out of the bunker, let's have some coffee." [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](our cfo is a really awesome guy, despite being 6'7 with the presence of the terminator (i'm a 5'2 girl with arms like a t-rex) he's very approachable and i have a good banter driven relationship with him. he's also pretty tech savvy which makes him a hell of a lot easier to deal with. i deployed a new voip soft phone to him last week, he loves it and has had little issues with it. except for today. i'm at lunch, i check my phone and realise he has im'd me and emailed me about an urgent issue with the soft phone client. since he pretty much runs our company i fang back to the office. walk into his office, he booms at me the client is broken and he can't make calls. he tells me he's very busy and important (jokingly) and that it needs to be fixed pronto, he goes on to rib me about recommending this soft phone to him. i lean over and plug his usb headset back into the port, it'd fallen out and he'd ignored the big red exclamation mark on the client telling him as much. i shake my head at him and walk out. he bellows after me that he's still very busy and important but not to tell anyone this happened. this is an off the clock it tale with a happy ending. i left for the night at company co. and stopped in for a beer at a local bar. four beers later i tried to pay the tab with my credit card. "no cards under $20." fine. i moved toward the atm and heard someone say "don't bother, it's broken." i noticed there was an error code on the atm display screen. natural reaction is to look up said error code. i googled the atm brand and error 1377. "obstruction in the cash dispenser." the obstruction was $100 crumpled up in the dispenser. thank you and goodnight. i got a support call this morning from a manager, i was cooking breakfast when it came in, so i was just partially listening to her issue. &gt; her: this new printer is not working correctly, it's got wireless built in and it is hooked up to my laptop with a cable. but my husband can't print when i print to it... &gt; me: you mean when you print from your laptop hooked up directly, he can't print over the wireless? &gt; her: yeah, when i print from my laptop, he can't print from his laptop. i think back to the last time this manager needed help, and decided to start with the dumb question end of the list. &gt; me: so, while you are printing to the printer, he can't get it to print his document? &gt; her: yeah, when i am printing he can't print from his laptop. &gt; me: um...ok, when your document is done, does it print his next? &gt; her: yes, three copies of it for some reason... &gt; me: you think because it's wireless he can print something while it's printing your document right? &gt; her: yeah, that's what it said on the box, he explained that's why he bought it. &gt; me: oh, so let me make sure i understand the situation. you can print from your company laptop to your personal printer? &gt; her: yes, but he can't print while i'm printing. &gt; me: he needs to call his tech support guy, it's working as far as i'm concerned, have a good day, bye. *click* oops, my cell phone is on silent and i seemed to have dropped it in the towel drawer, under the towels... i know tomorrow she is going to be in an ill mood, but i swear sometimes i fear for future generations....don't work in tech support, but as the only teenager in the house, i may as well be. backstory: my stepmother considers herself to be very proficient with technology because, and i quote, 'i set the router up with 4 channels and every device is on a different channel'. in reality, the 2.4ghz and 5ghz networks were on by default, and i turned on the guest network for her. my dad thinks she's a genius as well. recently, a lightning storm came through and actually fried the router. my dad and i head off the the shop to get a new one, and my stepmother has no trust in either of us to get an actually good router because evidently nobody is as good as she is with technology. we get there, and i subtlety manage to persuade dad to get a netgear nighthawk x4s under the guise that the range will be long enough to reach his sheds (we live on a somewhat rural property, and in fairness, t does actually reach the shed) but really, i just wanted a gaming optimised one where the qos would automatically prioritise me over my stepmothers netflix binging. we arrive home and i begin to set it up and she walks over and tells me everything i'm doing is wrong before i'd touched anything. 'great...', i began thinking, knowing she's inevitably fuck something up and i'd have to sneak out and fix it later overnight, while she claims the credit. naturally, she can't make it work. note: the setup really wasn't a hard process. all we really needed was my dads isp details and it does everything else automatically. i don't understand how she couldn't do it, but it was my fault because i'd touched it. important tidbit: my phone service is provided through the same isp but on my mothers account. eventually, i get sent away from the router because i'm obviously screwing everything up. the claim: the router couldn't connect to the isp because it was trying to 'latch on to my phone 3g network and authenticate with the servers wirelessly'. deciding the argument wasn't worth it, i left and upon returning to my room, introduced my face to my desk. four hours later my dad and stepmother went for a walk and i fixed it in three minutes. tl;dr: stepmother knows technobabble, thinks she's an it queen, definitely is not. at a call center for dsl internet tech support, for a major us phone company. a very angry lady calls in because "my internet is down and my kid can't do her homework! she missed a due date and it's all because of you!" so i go through a bunch of troubleshooting, and ultimately wind up writing a trouble ticket for a tech visit. her dsl modem is *out in her back yard.* in a tool shed, apparently, and "we ran all the wires for it when we built the house." ok, ma'am. got a field tech visit set up for you. earliest time window is in four days. advise her of possible charges if the problem is in her home wiring. she screams about that for a while: "but my daughter can't do her homework at all! she's been waiting for two days to do her homework and it's late!" i guess she forgot that earlier in the call, she was also screaming at me because her daughter is "home-schooled" and thus has an extreme need for their internet connection. what i probably should have said: "ma'am. since your daughter is home-schooled, you are her teacher and you set the due dates. so perhaps you should just move her due date to allow for the internet being down." what i did say: nothing. i just let this jesus-hugging church lady scream into my ear for nearly a half hour.it’s been a few years since i was desktop support but users still come to me for assistance rather than go through our wonderful “helpdesk”. i’m sure many of you can relate. user sticks her head in my office first thing this morning and said she was having problems with her laptop and asked if i would be willing to take a look. she starts telling me how yesterday afternoon she started getting these pop-ups for a program that she hasn’t used in years. she used it daily when she was in a different department but insists that she no longer uses it. i was only half paying attention as it was still really early and i was on my first cup of coffee. we get to her office and try booting up her machine. pgp screen comes up and she enters in her password, immediately we get a bsod with the message “unmountable boot volume” i ask her which program she uninstalled. “pgp” she says… she had no idea that pgp was used to encrypt her laptop even though she has to enter in her network password to get past the pgp encryption screen every time she boots up her machine. how/why pgp allowed her to uninstall it without first decrypting the drive is beyond me. but yeah, she used pgp years ago in her previous position and rather than go through protocol by contacting helpdesk and opening a ticket to resolve the pop-up issue (pgp couldn’t find her keyring files) she decided to just uninstall pgp. the person she shares an office with also used to be in it so she took over the efforts to try and get her back up and running…pulled the drive, connected it to another machine with pgp and started decryption process. i would say i hope she’s learned her lesson but i kinda doubt it. lol *update* apparently it caught wind that she was trying to get it fixed without having to send it off and they let her know that this was grounds for dismissal. so now she'll be shipping it off and probably won't get it back until sometime next week. beautiful. ;-)i work for the it department at a university. we have a few student workers who man the phones and create tickets to assign to my team. this morning one of the student workers tells me of a user who's very upset, has a very high pitched squealing computer, and a message on screen that says "failed to boot". &gt;me: "what is the exact error message? 'failed to boot' is not something i've ever seen before and i don't think that's what the screen is actually saying". &gt;sw: "i don't know i already hung up. can you please go look? she's in the next building over. i didn't know what to do and she was very angry". /facedesk so i walk over and have the user power on the computer. immediately i hear a repeated beeping, not a whining or screaming. sounds like keyboard input in a pre-boot menu. i look at the keyboard and the user's stapler is laying on the f12 key. it's a dell machine. the message she was seeing on screen was the "select boot device" menu. tl;dr stapler on boot menu key = irate luser. this is a tale from about 3 years ago, back when i was in full time education. i had gained a reputation around my school as a "geek" as i knew how to set up projectors and use a different web browser to ie8. &gt;teacher in class: warp_, deputy_head needs your help with a computer, go to her office! &gt;me: ok. &gt;deputy_head: i need to open this website but my email won't let me! i glance at the screen, the school was running server 2003 and office 2010. she had ms outlook open with some kind of internal email open with a long web link that was partially selected. i think the html email was formatted incorrecly, so it overflowed and didn't wrap within the content of the email correctly. &gt;deputy_head: it won't work! &gt;me: so you need to get on to this website? &gt;deputy_head:yes, i tried to select it but it doesn't work! i see that it's a actual web link, and not just text, so i click on the link and ie8 opens, usual expected behaviour. &gt;deputy_head:what? how did you do that? &gt;me:i clicked the link- what was the issue? &gt;deputy_head:how did you do that? &gt;me:i clicked on the link, like this. &gt;deputy_head: (looking like the sky just fell down) wow! i didn't know you could do that! &gt;me: yup, try it yourself! she very unsteadily navigates on to the link and does a *looong* left click on the link. it opens again. she then lifts her finger off the mouse. &gt;me:yup, you can just do a click. &gt;deputy_head: wow! i never knew! she eventually got the hang of it after i showed her 3 times more, and with a few different emails she also had issues with. previously she'd been manually selecting the text, right clicking and then pasting into the url bar. this woman was in her late 30s and had used pc's for years. won kudos later with some tech shenanigans later though! *edit:^wow front page on my first post! thanks tfts!*a few years ago i did some contract work for two different companies that were owned and run by the same group of people. for the most part they were separate legal entities, but they shared some network resources and at one point some office space. each company had their own it staff though, including developers, help desk, and admins. my buddy was the lead developer so he was in charge of a few interns. one of the interns proved to be completely useless within a couple weeks of onboarding; showed up late, left early, took long lunches, did less work than anyone else, etc. they let him go on a friday (as was customary). monday rolls around and useless intern is strolling down the hallway like nothing happened. my buddy chases him down and tells him "dude, i fired you! you can't be in the building, who let you in??" "oh, othercompany hired me back on because they needed help with this project .. " the it manager storms off to talk to management. it turns out that the assistant to the coo saw the termination email go through hr and *without asking anyone* immediately rehired him under the other company. they didn't know why he was fired and never asked. was he stealing from the company? did he assault someone? did the background check show he was a convicted felon? "oh he seemed like a nice kid and we really needed help on this .. " *facepalm* so they kept useless intern around for a few more weeks so he could prove he was useless again. luckily he wasn't fired for anything horrible, but in any other company it would have been considered a massive security breach.i was recently asked why my co-worker girlfriend and i have the same acer laptop, so i'll tell the tale. perhaps a year ago, working at my telco... &gt; boss: "hey bytewave, there's going to be a job opening in our department soon, do you have time to handle grading the exams?" pretty time-consuming task, always a ton of applicants and the 5 exams for technical support's senior staff are hard so it's a long string of failures usually before you get the guy, but hey, paid by the hour. plus i have nobody to blame given i designed some of the exams. &gt; bytewave: "sure. there's an opening? they really finally opened new positions?" &gt; boss: "alas not. thierry's leaving for sales' senior staff, i'll need to fill the slot. usual exams, to be corrected in rank of seniority." i was slightly taken aback. few tech people, much less senior staff, are interested in anything that has to do with sales. we fight tooth and nail to ensure that our frontline staff doesn't have to sell stuff when troubleshooting. there's admittedly a much more favorable gender ratio over there but thierry was already married. he saw me wince. &gt; boss: "there was an argument. we don't have much to reward you guys with beyond pay and the work contract basics here. over at sales, they get off-book bonuses all the time. thierry got mad that the top girl over at sss got a free car as a performance bonus last month while all i have are free pens. really wish i had the rewards budget to match that." ... it's true. sss is seen as an awesome source of revenue by the telco while tsss gets scraps at best. we've often been told "you're an expense, not a revenue." &gt; bytewave: "i'll grade. but the rewards budget will always be minuscule for tech support. just use another budget if you want to hand out candy." he was about to say something, thought the better of it, nodded, and went back to his desk. he's always had our interests at heart, but is always careful not to say anything that could be incriminating - he has no union to back him as a manager. soon after, at the next tsss monthly meeting... &gt; boss: "so, i know our security suite has always been underwhelming, but i'm told they're really trying hard to make the next revision outstanding. i know, we've heard that before, but still. this time around, i thought tsss ought to take a more direct hand in testing the beta. we have the usual external qa team on it too." since that falls well outside our typical job description, and union job descriptions are fairly narrow, people in the room weren't immediately enthused, a few puzzled eyebrows were exchanged. also, we all hate that software, previously [featured here]( &gt; boss: "purely voluntary basis, of course. i've had these laptops readied for testing purposes. but you'll have to install the security suite on it yourselves if you're interested. you can take them home and back here as you like. if you take one and find any bugs, you can file them the usual way." the department secretary brings in a pile of [these acer laptops]( then another. i notice there's literally one for every of us. &gt; frank: "wait. you know we can't do any work outside work hours without violating the work contract, and we already have plenty of computers here to run tests on the clock for..." indeed, we had already been testing the beta in our lab and on several workstations. &gt; boss: "oh i know the rules, i've been union too. never do any work outside work hours without authorized paid overtime. this is not an authorization to bill overtime, that requires hr-logistics' consent. anyhow, these are for testing, as per the quasi-unlimited budget for the security suite. they've been added to the permanent testing devices account." and then it dawned on frank, and any other who had not already read in-between the lines. i have two pvrs with full testing profiles in my condo i never paid a penny for, because they're 'testing devices'. they never, ever, ask for these devices back once the tests are complete. it's more trouble to track them back than to just forget about them. &gt; frank: "oh. well did it have to be acer laptops if you're..." &gt; boss: "ahem. it's what we could have in bulk at a reasonable cost. *for testing.* again, purely voluntary basis, take one if you'd like. the acer bloatware has been removed. no worries if you don't feel like it, they'll be put to good use elsewhere." everybody took one. boss never really expected us to even install the security suite at all. the whole point was to tap an unlimited budget to give us something off-books to show appreciation, because unlike other departments, tech support almost never gets any money to do that outside the christmas budget. he's really great, making things a little better for our department in a company that's usually truly stingy when it comes to giving us anything that goes beyond the work contract's requirements. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](him: "alright, since the monitor is giving you troubles, let's try turning it off and turning it back on again." user: "i already did that." him: "alright, let's just do it again, just to be sure." user: "i can't find the button."frustration crossed my cousins face as the progress bar slowly crept across his game console. &gt;cuzdad: it’s so close to the ‘rooter’ though. i don’t know why it’s so slow. &gt;me: its **router**. plus i think it’s an issue with the game service, not your internet. cuzdad went back to the game console and continued to try to update the system. the fact is was working albeit slowly on chrismas day seemed like a miracle to me. &gt;cuzdad: darn it, our internet has been acting up a lot lately. help me move this thing closer to the ‘rooter’. &gt;me: **router**. i sighed as i helped untangle the cords behind the television set. arguing was futile, since he was family. &gt;cuzdad: everything’s all tangled down behind the tv isn’t it? &gt;me: mmm hmm. i pulled at the cords connected to the game console, everywhere i looked things were wired incorrectly. tv’s with external sound systems that weren’t plugged in, speakers plugged into inputs not outputs. it was a mess. &gt;cuzdad: you know i’ve always wondered how that happens. you put the cords in nicely, but when you come back its all tangled and messed up. how you going with the untangling? &gt;me: i can’t get one cord right at the bottom. i tried reaching for the cord right at the back. it was too far. i decided to move the entertainment cupboard forward so i could get properly behind it. i started to slide the heavy unit forward. &gt;cuzdad: woah, what are you doing?! &gt;me: i can’t get my hand in far enough to get the power cable, so if we just slid everything forward… &gt;cuzdad: woah, no. thats where dust lives. i don’t want that stuff all over the house. i sighed again at my cousin who was looking at me expectantly. i just waited for his suggestion, knowing i couldn’t get back to the family gathering outside before all his ideas were attempted. &gt;cuzdad: i got it. my cousin went over to my spot and gave a swift pull at the cord. he managed to pull it out but partially split the outer insulation where the wire goes into the plug. &gt;cuzdad: f#$@. he quickly gathered up the console and moved it across the room, plugging it in right next to the router. next he couldn’t find the av cords to stretch across the entire room. eventually producing an entire basket of tangled cords in which he insisted a long cable was buried in. &gt;cuzdad: i’m not good with knots you know… as we started unbundling the mass of cords in the basket, i could hear the rest of my extended family having fun at the dining table. i internally berated myself for answering ‘yes’ when my cousin asked if i’d ever owned a game console. &gt;cuzdad: so how is it that everything always gets tangled? it’s like a life’s little joke… you know? my cousin seemed to answer that question himself moments later when we’d finally gotten out the cord we wanted, he stuffed every cord back into the basket we’d just separated out. &gt;me: it’s a mystery. &gt;cuzdad: lets see if this works. naturally the service was still horribly slow. this time however my cousin was off on another rant. &gt;cuzdad: three bars! see that? three bars of reception and it's practically sitting on top of the 'rooter'. &gt;me: **router**. and if you’re so worried about reception why not just plug it in? cuzdad went on a tirade about how that wasn’t even an option, and how my nephew should be able to play with his christmas presents *on* christmas. eventually he calmed down, and decided plugging it in could work, albeit temporarily. the download did not speed up. after eventually giving up we made it too the dining table. my dear cousin let it be known to all the younger generation, that even **i** could not get the beloved new game to work. he also let slip that **i** partially broke the power cord, which managed to badly upset my nephew. i shook my head in disgust at the whole event. so a new rule, for techies everywhere: **on christmas, you know nothing about technology, you’ve hit your head and forgotten everything for the day.** just another day at my telco when we all get an email from systems about a new policy: road techs will now install new software from /systems/qa on all the computers of new internet users to 'ensure quality of service' and 'immediately inform end users if they have any issues with their drivers or anything that may impact service - thus reducing call flow'. &gt; amelia: "guys, check your mail... or your spam folder for those filtering systems! we're into spyware now!" and she was spot on, as usual. it's exactly what it was. that thing called home with a ton of data that - while useful - was nsa-grade scary. and somehow senior staff only learned about it when it was authorized to be deployed in the field. what could possibly go wrong? &gt; bytewave: "nevermind the fact we should have known about this months ago, does anyone have a copy of this thing? boss?!" &gt; boss: "just learning about it too... i'll get you one right away. get out of the lines, i need you to test this thing and make sure the only problems with it are legal's..." soon after i get a copy of the software, and after some basic tests..." &gt; bytewave: "boss, there's a problem. or several, if you happen to care about osx." &gt; boss: "color me surprised. good news, bad news ... or just bad news?" &gt; bytewave: "well, the good news is that all 15 to 20% of our customers who are running the x86 version of microsoft's net framework will be able to be spied on as intended. those who aren't or are running x64 however, will get *this* incomprehensible, page-long error. as for the lucky winners using osx.... well these guys don't get blue screens, but any attempts to install our new spywa... software on macs appear to cause immediate kernel panic - or a sad face if you're running really old versions. do you need me to test this this on *nix, or have we already established this is amateur hour on top of the legal issues?" whenever i see my boss' face discolor this badly, it's a mixed feeling. on one hand, something has gone terribly wrong. on the other, i know it's not my problem anymore and it's going to get fixed promptly. &gt; bytewave: "so, you need me to speak to systems about this, or you'll..." he sighs deeply but keeps his usual professional cool. &gt; boss: "i'm on it. this will be delayed until issues are solved. good work." that was the last we heard about it for awhile. said spyware was ultimately never deployed in the field. we long had other tools to monitor quality of service and driver issues either way - this smacked of a wide tie trying to come up with a quick way to get some credit for lowering support calls without ever asking tech support how they ought to do such a thing. in short, business as usual. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](when i was a kid, both my cousin and i used to watch a bunch of [captain tsubasa]( anime (or, holly e benji for us guys who only got italian tv). so my cousin gets captain tsubasa ii on the nes, and he lends me captain tsubasa i and i play the shit out of that game. it was in japanese, and i didn't know what to do, but fuck it, you know? it's a football game (i'm sorry... soccer)... not that difficult to understand what's happening. so after a month or so, i give him back the game he lent me and we go our separate ways. not so fast, son. later in the day, his mum calls my mum and, as told by my mum, this conversation happens: &gt; aunt (\*fuming\*): listen, when my son lends you games, your son needs to take care of them! this is unbelievable! &gt; mum: what happened? &gt; aunt: you know what happened! you dropped my son's nes cartridge in the fucking water! &gt; mum: is it not working?! (\*at this point i'm seeing my mum eyeing me ready to kick my ass.\*) &gt; aunt: no it's working. &gt; mum: then what gave you the impression that we dropped it in water? &gt; aunt: the players are all smaller. like they shrunk. &gt; mum: \*hangs up\* later, we learned that the second release of the game the players looked bigger on the screen than in the first game. my cousin, having played the second game for a month, forgot how the players used to look in the first game, told his mum, and her first thought was "she must have put the game in the water, because the players shrunk down a size or two." tl;dr: my mum does tech supporti work as a consultant doing all sorts of sysadmin work and general tech support for various companies who hire my employer's services, like an it-janitor, one might say. one of our customers has a rather complex system which is maintained by another external party, and in the time where this story takes place, this other company was doing a substantial upgrade to this system. part of the upgrade was to implement an sftp connection which allowed the customer to utilize "the cloud" instead of storing everything locally. however, the other party kept running in to problems. "it's not working", they said, "please open port 22 in the firewalls between $server1 and $server2". we knew that the port was not blocked, but we did them the favour of at least looking in to it and verifying that the port was indeed open as requested. then we heard nothing for two months, until they suddenly sent in a new ticket with the same request, "please open port 22". this... interesting email exchange then occurred between me and their lead tech (though abbreviated, obviously): **me:** "we have verified that the connection worked using both $ftpprogram and $otherftpprogram, the port isn't blocked." **him:** "it is, too! our program isn't working!" **me:** "you have specified port 22, right? i mean, so that it doesn't default to using regular ftp on port 21?" **him:** "yes, of course." **me:** "what kind of program is this, really?" **him:** "it's a script, you can see it if you go to $programandlocation." **me:** "ok, well, i just looked at the script and i can see you are using $ftpcommand, but you are not declaring the port when calling the command, so it's clearly using port 21 which is the default. here is what you need to change it to: $correctpieceofcode. please correct it and get back to us if it's still not working." nothing was heard for a while after that. i had really gone beyond my responsibilities by troubleshooting their code - which i had never even seen before - and giving them a solution, and i was appalled by their incompetence. i thought for sure that they would manage to fix it now. but... then they came back: **him:** "we changed the port and it's still not working." **me:** "no, you didn't change the port. i looked at the script just now and you haven't changed anything. i have now changed it for you. please see if it works." after this, we mysteriously enough never heard from them again. who could have guessed? needless to say, we reported their incompetence to our customer, who had to pay the hourly rates of both me and the other tech, probably amounting to 10-20 hours of consulting for something that wasn't actually an issue in any way.in somes tales, i'm not kind towards the telco i work for; even aired some of our dirtiest laundry at times. they earned my ire through nonsense ranging from [atrocious subcontracting policies]( to [frivolously clogging courts to brawl with their own employees]( orders recently came from on up that every employee - be they sorting mail or sitting on the board - would have a 3-hour long 'information security class'. in language drawn by legal, everybody was to be taught via powerpoint and videos that opening email attachments not approved by their boss is worse than being hitler. most importantly, they focused on the notion that willingly revealing the horrible inner-workings of the corporation to the public would be a crime against humanity. when i heard about this, i chuckled. even though i'm always careful not to reveal where i work - i know they'd pay a bounty for "bytewave's" identity/head-on-a-spike. i simply posted too many tales about what's wrong here - placing me squarely on the (notoriously incompetent) 'corporate inquisition' radar. i was about to take my seat and silently savor the irony. but the vice-director (previously featured for his [keyboard issues]( supposed to give this mandatory "class" to my team, tsss, got emergency texts. fifteen of us working escalation tech support were now sitting in there, but his blackberry said he was needed 15 floors up, 15 minutes ago. and so he walked up to me with a binder, a thumb-drive and the projector's remote. the irony that i was assigned to teach my colleagues about the benefits of information security despite being unofficially in charge of [our shadow it]( had a few of my colleagues giggling five seconds after he'd left the room. that's often all you can expect when it comes to teaching classes here. it's a good day when i don't need to make up material on the spot. but teaching tech senior staff isn't exactly like teaching new hires. nobody sitting in those chairs needed to hear any of this. i still looked at the binder for a minute. as expected, it was all trite, inane and worthless nonsense someone with a very wide tie decided would cover their ass appropriately if a few thousand employees were forced to hear it. &gt; bytewave: "alright folks, this is a mandatory 3 hour class on information security... don't use weak passwords. even though [it really doesn't matter here.]( don't tell frontline employees things they shouldn't know. don't give instructions on recorded phone lines that directly challenge corporate policies. and don't be a fucking idiot in general. anyone wants to know more than that, the class' pdf and powerpoint will be on our drive. floor open to questions." &gt; frank: "heh, thanks for sparing us. i guess we just hang in here for the next 2 hours and 59 minutes?" &gt; stephan: "would beat taking escalation calls from subcontractors." &gt; bytewave: "well, the vd didn't even file this class on formal record. let's call it an extended break." so we all went downstairs and walked to the bar across the street. had a couple pints generally chatting about how insane and inconsistent the corporation's stance on information security is. and other stuff. on one hand, they're willing to spend tons to teach theory to employees - but will never spend a penny to make the tools we use remotely secure. even though union staff repeatedly pointed out that some practices have been out of league with industry standards for well over a decade, they'd rather teach everyone to keep quiet than fix the underlying issues. back at my old workplace, this would have largely qualified as a 'working lunch' even though all we ate was bar snacks. three-ish hours later we went back up the tower. i was expecting having to say i took the team outdoors and fib a reason why. &gt; low-level manager: "you guys done already? class ended up taking closer to four or five hours for most of the staff." &gt; bytewave: "what can i say. tech support's senior staff learns stuff quicker than most." [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!]( tl;dr: i provide the arcane secrets to efficiency! there were a few secretaries working in my office today (no hot ones unfortunately) we recently got a lot of wide screen monitors installed which is nice. one of the secretaries said that she'd have to get used to it, but she liked it. to which i made an idle comment: "yeah it's great. that way you can have two windows open at the same time." immediately they all wanted to know how to do that. such wizardry! so i showed them how to use the windows key and arrow keys to place windows on the left and right. and i was hailed as some kind of priest or sorceror. the awe, the amazement. it was...amazing... **edit:** i wish i had a way to show this trick to everyone in our company. it's so useful. but i can barely get them to read the manual for the business critical software we use. **edit2:** a lot of people are pointing out that they didn't know the hotkeys either. well happy to have been of help. more windows hotkeys can be found [here]( **edit3:** holy crap! gold?! thanks so much! or how to ruin an expensive computer. yesterday we got a client that ask us why his pc would smell burnt, what he brought to us, made me cry. he brought us it, guy had a quadro, yes, an nvidia quadro, a nice asus motherboard and some lightscribe disc trays plus a dedicated sound card. then once we were done admiring his build, we directed our eyes to the burnt cables, the power supply had burnt marks on the exhaust fan and on the cable plugs. &gt;$me: *hisses* ohh no no no... &gt;$client: what's wrong with my pc? can you fix it? we quickly disarm everything, sorting the components by order, the mobo power plugs were certainly burnt, and that quadro, the quadro didn't make it... who was the culprit? the $25 psu, all high quality components, and he shoved a chinese brand psu... his mobo, sound card and gpu didn't make it, but the rest of the components managed to make it out alive by some miracle. we sold him a quality psu and mobo while he arranges another gpu for cad stuff, so i got a bit of commission for the sale, enough to buy me extra food. but still, why do people spend $$$ in everything but the psu....? tl;dr: don't buy a cheap psuhello everyone, lurker here. this story happened a few years back when i was still in school and everyone had to do an internship for two weeks. being of highest technical expertise (in comparison to the guy sitting next to you in your informatics class), i naturally applied for a job in the it field. the next town over had a nice computer museum and so i applied. knowing the manager helped, but being the only applicant did its part too. so the very first day i start there, under the supervision of the $sysadmin, i am being introduced to the systems. while he explains my main task will be to take care of the exhibits, as some tend to be a little fragile and require frequent maintenance or reboots, $secretary comes in and just interrupts $sysadmin with following words: "the payment server is down. since friday." today's monday. he was on vacation for a week. with an absolute pokerface and a blank stare $sysadmin quickly shows me one exhibit that's been acting up lately. 10 minutes and an easy fix later i get back into the basement, walk through the server cabinets up to the very front cabinet, where 3 people and $sysadmin are standing. they all look at the servers and don't say a word. problem is: one, and only one, server has no power. it's the server which manages the payment of the employees, power company, isp and more. tracking back the power cable resulted in an interesting finding: it seems as if it was plugged into the psu. but someone actually plugged it into an extension cable. tracing back that extension cable required us to open the rack from behind, only to find that the cable was laying on the ground next to a normal wall outlet. $sysadmin admins face doesn't move a bit. he qickly plugs everything back in and checks if the server is doing fine. it seems so, except suddenly the firmware is upgraded. his anger is not to be seen from his body language, but only from his empty, merciless stare. calmly walking through the office, asking every single person if they did something with the server, he stumbled upon $software_engineer. $sysadmin: *hey, $se, did you do something on the payment server while i was away?* $software_engineer: *ah yes, i upgraded the firmware for you, because i hated that little popup, no biggie.* $sysa (in the calmest and yet most frightening voice i ever heard): *and you haven't noticed that the server is down since friday?* $se: *...* $sysa: *let me ask you a question: do you know what a plug is? and where it belongs?* $se: *... yes... i put it into an outlet.* $sysa: *and may i ask why you plugged it into an unconnected extension cord?* $se: *well, i needed to reboot the server, so i unplugged it, as i can't do that via cli. and then i needed to charge my laptop and that just plugging the server in somewhere else seemed easier instead of my laptop being far away from the server.* $sysa: *and why is the extension cord not plugged in?* $se: *well... i needed to reboot it a second time, but i was called away and... i forgot...* $sysa: *$moe, would you mind just grabbing a fresh drink for us from the cafeteria?* slowly i walked away, only to hear $sysa lose his pokerface. $manager ran into the room and tried to calm $sysa down, but there was no holding him back. slowly and scared i got 2 softdrinks and on my wazy back, $sysa comes up to me, looking more refreshed than he did after his vacation. happy and smiling, he grabbed his drink and got to work completely undo $se's mess. $se was only seen outside, smoking one cigarette after another that day.(this is my first post to tfts and reddit in general) the following happened about a year ago, when i, as a student, was called by a friend to debug the internet at his dorm. *note that this is a private owned ~ 12 room building* so i put some stuff into my backpack (laptop, extra nic, some cables) and cycled to my friends place. &gt; friend: the internet kind of works, but it is extremely slow. so i tried some stuff, a couple of pings and noted the following: $ ping 192.168.1.1 ping 192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=3263 ms i try to log in to the management page but get connection refused, clearly this router isn't listening on port 80. &gt; me: your router seems to be broken, where is it? &gt; friend: in the network closet that hangs on the wall in the hall &gt; *me looks to network closet hanging +2m high on a wall* &gt; me: and you don't happen to have the key for it? &gt; friend: no, but the landlord will be here on friday, can you come by then? &gt; me: np. so that friday i am back, landlord gives me the key and ladder, and i climb up there, the closet contains: * the cable modem * a large 24 port rackmount 10/100 switch * [this]( a piii compaq desktop (note that that pic isn't mine, i don't think i took any pictures, at least i can't find any) * lots of dust bunnies &gt; me: is that your router? &gt; landlord: it could be. it has been there since i bought this building 5 years ago. &gt; friend: could that be the issue? &gt; me: *puts hand behind the fan to check the temp, it is quiet hot* well, if it isn't now, it sure is going to be in the near future. i pull out the compaq, wire it up to a monitor, and it boots some ancient debian version with a 2.4 kernel. i open it up and it's full of dust bunnies. &gt; me (genuinely surprised): i'm surprised this thing still runs. &gt; landlord: well, if i have to get the isp technician come over to fix stuff, it's going to cost me €150 just in labour. *grabs wallet and pulls out 2 50's* here, do you think you can fix it for €100? &gt; me: well, yes, that should work. so i walk to the nearest it store, grab a cheap tplink 802.11n router for €30. put the router in-between the modem and the switch, everything works. set up wifi (note that there was no wifi before, just wired) test wireless reception on the top floor (just for fun), works perfecly. put the remaining €70 in my wallet. a couple of months ago that friend let me know that the landlord had increased the rent, because now there was wifi. lucky enough my friend had graduated, so he doesn't have to renew his contract. ps: i took the comaq to a friend and now it is happy in his collection of ancient machines (mainly servers). tldr: internet slow =&gt; broken router =&gt; router is an ancient compaq desktop full of dust =&gt; got €100 to replace it with a new €30 router =&gt; rent increased because wifi. edit: formattingabout 6 years ago or so i was looking to get out of the job i was in. just a lateral move as a network administrator but i thought i'd find someplace with an actual it budget, even a small one. after hitting the internet really hard i found a somewhat local school district was interviewing for a network assistant. problem number 1 was that even though i was on the border of this school district the main building i would work from was on the far edge of the next county. i thought well for the right money/perks i could live with it so i went into the interview. i go in and meet the man who would be my boss if i got the job. while being completely socially inept and awkward as hell he managed to tell me that the person i'd be replacing was only part time (the new job would be full time) but the outgoing guy didn't like the full time pay. ok so that's red flag #2. deeper into the interview the guy started asking me really open ended vague questions. after about 15 minutes of back and forth with this guy about my technical skills and him repeating: &gt; it's really important to take time every day to learn he asks me what i'm interested in. my natural response was to ask if he means professional or personally. i've had interviewers ask either or both to get a feel for who i really am so it wasn't odd. his response was one i never heard before: &gt; i don't give a shit about what you're interested in personally. i don't want to know you i just need to know if you'll work here. and with that, i got up and told him i most certainly wouldn't work there and told him he wasted his time and mine.just had a user try plugging the power cable into a usb slot and call me down because it wouldn't fit. literally a circle connector into a square port. goodbye tfts. it's been a pleasure. i'm going living a solitary life.i worked on a customer site once. management decisions were... interesting. the one which stood out was the one i got told by the technical lead of internal it. the big boss came up to him one day and the following conversation ensued: "i hear that smtp is not a 100% guaranteed delivery protocol." "that's true. there could be failures on the machines in between our email server and the recip..." "we need a 100% reliable protocol. our emails are too important to risk them going astray." "um. smtp is the global standard for sending emails. everyone uses it. we have to use it if we want to send emails at all." "i heard there's a 100% reliable, guaranteed-delivery protocol." "er... well, there might be some sort of custom protocol which will keep trying until confirmation is received, yeah." "good. find it and install it on our email servers. i want to make sure that all our emails get delivered." "but nobody else uses..." "don't argue. just do it." the technical lead paused in his tale, savouring the sheer distance that now existed between my jaw and the rest of my face. "so.." i asked, cautiously... "what did you do?" "oh, what we always do. i told charles to go into the server room for a day and surf the web. when he came out, i told the boss we'd done what he asked. he went away quite happy. i'll never hear about it again."[previous]( it rule three: descriptions are scary and hard, just fix it. &gt;long ago the motor car was invented, it was a complicated piece of machinery. it was so complicated that the average layperson could not immediately understand precisely what every part did. then we invented the computer, it was even more complicated. the layperson had no chance to understanding what was going on, this confusion led to the invention of it. &gt;much like our mechanical brethren we get users who do not understand even the basics of computer operation and maintenance. fortunately for our car fixing cousins, faults in motors are usually inherently obvious or can be described in terms like “a rattle”. unfortunately for us working in it, this basic descriptive fault observation becomes suddenly lost when thinking about computers. this lack of descriptive prowess usually leads to the following situations: 1. you’re looking down at a computer for the fifth time, the note taped to the screen just says “still broken, please fix.”. as you boot up the device and watch it perform admirably you scratch your head and wonder what exactly is broken. a call to the department leads to a chain people claiming not to know the specifics of the fault, leaving you with a headache and a seemingly working computer. you’ll box it up and send it back to that department with a note “*fixed(?)*”. 2. a user calls down to it, naturally the call lands at your desk. the screeching voice down the line tells you in panicked tones that they cannot login. your insistence that they read out the specific error message is met with confusion, followed swiftly by anger at your refusal to “*just* let them get on with their work.”. naturally this caller requests an escalation to the manager. as you fetch your manager he asks you what’s wrong, you’ll shrug and explain your user cannot login. he’ll ask why, and you’ll shrug, again. the look of exasperation that crosses your managers face will hurt you, come bonus time. 3. unicorns will be discovered before a fault is successfully diagnosed by a user. i can say this with certainty because if a user can diagnose the fault, they can fix the fault. however occasionally users with the ability to sustain a diagnostic conversation will arise, this will lead to the fault being swiftly dealt with. unfortunately these users are usually in charge of the least critical systems. the unstable, business critical system will always be left with a user too impatient to diagnose, they just want results/fixes. 4. sometimes a large error or fault will be discovered by a department, but due to shame or … it’s swept under the rug. these faults usually build up or are badly dealt with by the offending department, until one weekend in the early hours of the morning the entire service collapses. a later investigation will reveal a tiny, easily fixable fault ended up costing the company millions. hopefully the above examples are few and far between. regardless, here are a few ways to tackle the problem. 1. implement a ticket system, ensure that the description of the problem box has a one word minimum. tickets help work out who exactly is sending things down to the department, regardless of their problem descriptive abilities. — unfortunately a ticket system can also lead to people just leaving equipment to rot, some departments are too lazy for tickets and the casual employee that would send things down is now too intimidated by the 10 forms they have to fill out on there one day in the office a week. 2. refuse to fix anything without a description of exactly what is wrong. —your manager will love you. 3. enforce graded system, were the machines with descriptive faults will be fixed more expeditiously then the undescribed masses. —… that could actually work. if you’re lucky you’ll avoid the lack of descriptions with good company culture. don’t get complacent though, it only takes a single company executive to have a “problem” that you need to “fix.” and you’ve landed in a minefield with no map out. good luck! ***** ***example/story*** &gt;grumblecake: hey, so i need this fixed. grumblecake dumps a charred laptop down on the table. it looks like it’s been in a war zone. &gt;me: er… yep… i reached out and have it a prod with my pen, a charred piece of plastic fell off the side. &gt;me: it’s ruined. burnt to a crisp. unfixable. &gt;grumblecake: oh, i knew that. i just need another one. a small sigh of relief escaped my lips. luckily grumble cake wasn’t insane. i smiled and tried to work out the model from its charred remains. &gt;me: yeah okay, i think its a @$%@$ . we don’t have any on hand, but we’ll order one in. &gt;grumblecake: cool, cool. ummm so when will it be here? &gt;me: monday, i think. &gt;grumblecake: excellent, ill come pick it up tuesday. after you’ve installed all the programs. grumblecake had turned and started walking towards the door. &gt;me: wait, what?… what programs??! &gt;grumblecake: just the same ones that were on that. grumblecake didn’t turn, he just pointed to the black mess of plastic still lying on the table. &gt;me: what programs?? which programs?! it was too late. he was already gone. i shoveled the burn husk off the table and went to call the number on the contact form. it was blank. naturally. this is a quick tale of tech support. a customer called in claiming that there were viruses on her computer. this is the phone conversation ending in my complete loss of faith in humanity. customer: i'm not sure what happened, my computer says there are 6000 viruses, i get lots of popups, it locks up all the time. me: alright ma'am. can you describe to me what you were working on before all of this started? customer: i was checking my email and there was a message from j.p. morgan chase bank. it said my bank account was put on hold. it told me to click on a link in order to reactivate my account. me: do you have a j.p. morgan chase bank account? customer: no. *ten seconds of dead air while i stare blankly into my computer screen, contemplating human existence* what's up, tfts? i'm finishing up a long saturday shift and figured i would do a little venting about the garbage i deal with when i'm at home. a little backstory, quick: i work for gigantic_cable_company, and yes, you've heard of them. i mainly cover business accounts, which means getting yelled at for nine hours a day while scripting modems and fixing issues. before working in tech support, i was a field technician for this company, so i knew both the hardware and logistical side of the systems, which helps immensely in this position. when i go home, lately, i have made it a habit of not answering my phone because, usually, it's acquaintances that i haven't talked to in awhile wanting me to help them out. the latest one pushed me to now no longer answering my phone. this "acquaintance" called me, as in someone i haven't talked to in over a year, at almost 10:00pm a couple of months ago when it was still snowing. we'll call him "rob" for the story's sake. rob had a big ego and was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. i also butted heads with him on a lot of things because he just loved to argue. he was a very negative person that i really didn't want to talk to anyways, so there was nothing of real value lost when he stopped hanging out with our mutual friends. *rob: hey gnpunk, what's going on?* **gnpunk: oh, hey rob. been awhile.** *rob: yeah, sorry to bother you. you got a few minutes?* &gt;in the middle of adding on ridiculous hours to my skyrim profile.... **gnpunk: a little, yeah. what's up?** *rob: oh, i'm having issues with my internet. thought you could help out.* &gt;really? you haven't called me in like two years and you want me to help? **gnpunk: i'm not working right now. call residential support.** *rob: the queue is like 90 minutes!* **gnpunk: i know. i can't do anything about it. i'll at least hear out the problem.** *rob: well, i can't get online.* &gt;of course you can't.... **gnpunk: did you reboot the modem and router?** *rob: yeah, nothing.* **gnpunk: i can't access anything from home. you'll have to call the hotline.** *rob: dude, it will be four days before a tech comes out. can you just come out?* &gt;....this has to be a joke. i live in the suburbs of a city. he does as well, but he's on the opposite side. even driving through the city, it's a minimum half an hour one-way. at 10:00 pm after a long day of dealing with this, no chance unless he pays me. **gnpunk: alright, but you're going to pay me for my time.** *rob: what? you love dealing with this stuff. why can't you just come out?* **gnpunk: i love building computers. i do not love fixing broken modems. i do that because it pays the bills.** *rob: well...i'll throw you ten bucks for gas.* &gt;nopenopenopenopenope **gnpunk: no. you're asking me to drive late at night, in the winter, to do something i may not even be able to fix.** *rob: well just drive your work van over!* he had un-friended me on facebook and thought i didn't notice, so he obviously didn't see that i had switched jobs. i really didn't care that he un-friended me, either, since he never made an effort to do anything and always wanted people to drive to him. **gnpunk: i don't work in the field anymore. i could go and get my buddy's tools, but seriously, you're paying me if i'm going out in this weather. emergency rate would be $75 an hour.** *rob: whatever man, i figured you would help a friend out.* **gnpunk: i would help a friend out.** *rob: fuck you.* tl;dr: don't call me after working hours. i'm off, i'm at home, and i'm probably drinking. :) edit #1: fixed some formatting issues. *edit #2: woo! quote of the day on tfts from my story! thanks for the upvotes, everyone!*we spent ages on the phone trying to figure out the problem. the user's cd played fine in her car, but it no longer "fit" into her cd drive. she held the phone to the cd drive - the tray sounded like it was opening and closing smoothly, there were no funny noises, nothing stuck inside the drive. we were absolutely baffled, but she's one of the sweetest users we've ever had, so we stuck with it. we wanted to get it working for her! she said the cd simply no longer "fit." finally, we broke down and had her send us a picture. [she had recently moved offices and whoever set up her computer had put it upside down.]( she'd failed to notice that her power button and cd tray were now on the bottom of the computer instead of the top, or had at least failed to think it strange. back in the day, guiniveretoo was just a young whippersnapper doing web development at a small design shop. small means very small: by "web development" i mean "design, development, qa, and devops (whatever that means when there's just you)". my boss was the owner of the company. we were working with a local event organizer who needed a website and a way to sell tickets for their show. rather than using an external service like events-alight or similar, we went the \*fancy\* route with a multi-page form in-line in the website. one day, our client called boss. a website user had called client because he was stuck. client and boss discussed the problem; boss eventually gave up and said to have the user call us and guiniveretoo would help him out. client gave user our phone number, and boss tells us that a website user will be calling, and to be nice to him and help him out. user calls, and the secretary passes the call to me. this situation is unusual but not out of the question; client was not particularly tech savvy so it's quite possible that she'd been stumped by something, and if there really was a showstopping error in the website then i would need to fix it. &gt; **me**: hello, this is $me; how can i help you? &gt; **user**: hi yeah, i can't get the website to load right. i can't buy tickets. &gt; **me**: okay, can you load other websites? &gt; **user**: yes, my internet is fine, i just can't buy tickets. i start asking debugging questions: "what kind of device are you using?" "what browser and version? here's how you find out what version of ie you are using." etc. after a few minutes of this: &gt; **me**: okay, describe to me exactly what you're seeing when you load $client's site. *i expect a description of a loading icon, and maybe a time out error or popup from the browser* &gt; **user**: well, there's the regular website, and *{title of the ticket form page}* and then there's this green loading bar. and the green bar won't move! one time i left it there for 45 minutes and nothing happened! it clicks inside my head. i attempt to suppress a giggle, probably not successfully. &gt; **me**: oh! i know what the problem is! so, that's not a loading bar - it *is* a progress bar, but it just shows you how many pages there are left in this form. if you click the "next" button, you'll see that it says "2 of 7 pages" instead of "1 of 7" like it says right now. &gt; **user**: *dial tone*first time posting, long time reader. i am the neighborhood tech guy. everyone calls me, most the time it is fine and dandy and other times it can be a bit more challenging. this is where we meet bob. bob is a college student of one of the parents in the neighborhood. the parents give me a call and ask if i can call and help him. i get his number and give him a call as i'm driving down the road to go camping. &gt;me: whats the problem bob? &gt;b: my internet doesn't work and my roommate said there is something wrong. i have been getting a lot of pop-ups and virus's. &gt;me: ok, go ahead and download and run malware bytes and call me back. &gt; ...a few hours pass... &gt;b: ok, i did that and removed everything like you told me to, but now my internet doesn't work. &gt;me: ok, lets check your proxy... yup, you had some proxy spyware. got him up and running. turns out he was trying to install a "video player" and it was a fake app. (5 months go by) &gt;hey extremx, its bob. i need help call me at 555-208-1234. &gt;me: i call the number. his phone does not accept calls. heh. so i call his parents house and he happens to be there. &gt;b: hey! i have lots of virus, and chrome won't work and it does weird things! &gt;me: ok, bring it over. this kid has soooo much spyware and garbage on his machine. i spend two hours with him removing app after app after app. i give him the standard shaming of "if you don't know what it is don't download and install it" over and over to hopefully pound it in his head. i had to wrap up early to head to work, but there was still one app that would not flush. &gt;b: oh! its ok, i'll just live with this one, it will be ok! &gt;nope. you will be back tomorrow for me to finish. &gt;b: i, uh, ok.... he comes back the next day and we get it sorted out. the poor kid asks how much i charge. *sigh* i really hate doing free work as it means more free work later down the road. he pulls out a whole $7 from his wallet. *sigh* i can't take $7 from a poor college kid. i refuse. i did tell him if it had been summer he could have pulled weeds for me, but alas it is winter. i send him on his way. ...2 weeks later... *knock* *knock* it is bob's father at the door asking for me. "oh fun" i think, more support to be had. nope. the father came by to thank me for helping his son out. tells me how much he appreciates it. hands me two tickets. i look at them, 12th row center court tickets to an nba basketball game. :o the ceo of his company gave them to him, and he passed them on to me. holy. crap. he runs off before i could thank him enough. i'm excited and thrilled. my karma has come! :d tldr: help college kid out multiple times, payed with a pair of $275 nba tickets.monday afternoon. emergency heads of department meetings are worse then normal ones. they are like a surprise attack to destroy the day. the secretary walks in and asks everyone if they want refreshments. &gt;me: coffee, please. &gt;sec: the machine is still broken. i’ll see what i can do. &gt;me: if its instant, don’t bother. the vp walked into the room, he was looking proud. probably tied his own shoelaces today. &gt;vp: we’ve got a problem. a communication problem. a coffee arrived in front of me. i thanked the secretary. i took a sip. it was instant. i cursed the secretary. as i dreamt about the special layer of hell reserved for people like her the vp continued. &gt;vp: recently a junior technician took home a switch without informing anyone. this kind of miscommunication will now be a thing of the past. the vp paused for greater effect. i sat bored. &gt;headhr: how? &gt;vp: we’re getting company mobiles. we’ll be able to communicate more efficiently when at work. some heads looked very excited, the thought of a company mobile would make the gossip treadmill go into overdrive. fantastic. &gt;vp: the it department will handle the phone roll out and support. i looked down at the instant. coffee told me i should be paying attention. &gt;me: what?! &gt;vp: the roll out will come from your department, since you’re all professionals in the it field you’d be the best to handle it. &gt;me: we can’t afford phones. the it budget is stretched. remember i’m currently in an audit. sipping at my coffee, the vp looked pleased. not a good sign. &gt;vp: don’t worry airz. the phones won’t come out of your budget. in fact i’ve already ordered them, all you’ve got to do is hand them out. &gt;me: couldn’t you? &gt;vp: hahaha giving out free phones, your popularity will skyrocket. the vp gave me a smile. i wanted to turn it upside down, preferably from the neck. [next]( [older]( tuesday 8.30pm working nights is strange, the office is eerily familiar but the staff are all completely different. eveninglady stood at the door to my office a look of disappointment splayed evenly across her face. &gt;eveninglady: here again, airz? &gt;me: i was thinking of making it permanent. i flashed eveninglady a jovial smile. &gt;eveninglady: you know i heard whispers that one of the morning staff and you get along *well*. the implication hung in the air, my mind went into shock. &gt;me: what?! &gt;eveninglady: oh you know the one... if you work nights all the time you’ll never get to spend time with her.... &gt;me: nice try. eveninglady hung her head and started shaking it, the phone next to me started to ring. as i picked it up a growling voice shouted down the phone. &gt;growl: the printer. is broken. &gt;me: ahh, to whom am i speaking? &gt;growl: you’re it right? &gt;me: i am. eveninglady started symboling something to me. her arms flailed about in a mad panic, something about hanging up. &gt;growl: why is it then, that you don’t know about basic technology. &gt;me: sorry, what? &gt;growl: caller id. you know, that thing that tells you who is calling. god, where do we find these technology **professionals.** &gt;me: my phone doesn’t have a screen. growl had already aggressively hung up. i looked up to see eveninglady continuing to signal at me. it was a rather amusing performance and i was tempted to let her continue. &gt;me: he hung up. what were you trying to signal. &gt;eveninglady: thats growl! &gt;me: sorry, who? &gt;eveninglady: growl. he’s the most unpleasant person at the company. eveninglady went on to explain how growl was a businessmen who was so distasteful, so unlikable that no one would work with him. he’d driven so many secretaries to tears that he didn’t have one anymore. he’d decided to work nights because apparently “less stupids” were around the office. &gt;eveninglady: basically, he’s a b!%!@$^. &gt;me: okay. thats fine and all, but where is his printer? ***** i knocked at an impressive door to an office i’d never visited before. i’d never even been to this part of the building before. it looked nice. &gt;growl: come. i opened the door and looked around the office. it was an impressively large office, with large open windows overlooking probably the best view possible for the office. i couldn’t see a printer. a graying man sat on a swivel chair behind a huge desk. he did not look pleased. &gt;growl: are you here for a social call? &gt;me: social?! no. i’m here for the printer, from it. &gt;growl: ohhhh it. you can probably imagine why i was confused. since i called so long ago. i’d just assumed you’d completely forgotten. i glanced at my watch. it had been almost exactly 15 minutes since he’d called. i decided to just ignore the barbs, he wasn’t worth it. &gt;me: the printer? growl ambled up from his chair with a grunt. &gt;growl: it’s in the other room. i’d let you find it yourself but i’m afraid you’d get lost once you opened the door. i just shook my head at the man, who seemed to take the smile on my face with offense. his face had soured even more then i thought possible. we approached a printer, it looked reasonably new. its screen proudly displayed “ready”. &gt;me: and the problem with the printer ... is? &gt;growl: ah. &gt;me: ... ?! &gt;growl: well i was wondering to myself. how is it that someone who turns up so late, and can’t grasp basic technologies even has a job. turns out you just get everyone else to do your work for you. normally i would take offense to the stream of insults, but the smiles i gave him seemed to be making him even angrier. it was much more satisfying. &gt;me: it does seem to be working. &gt;growl: you’ve not touched it. i wish i could have your job, amble up everyday take a quick nap. go home. i turned on my heel and flashed an even bigger smile, making a beeline for the door. &gt;growl: where are you going!? &gt;me: naps, sleep, rest, whatever takes my fancy. i hope i don’t get lost on the way back. my voice said the words in a wistful way, the subtle implication of teasing masked in the tones of an idiot. growl’s face was that of concentration as if he were trying to work out if he was teasing an idiot or someone was teasing him. &gt;growl: the printer cannot scan to a usb drive. fix it. &gt;me: it cannot **or** you couldn’t get it too? &gt;growl: it does not. growl shuffled through it pockets for his usb drive, eventually producing it after pulling out a deck of cards and a handkerchief from his pockets. &gt;me: i think, you plug the usb drive into the printer, first. i was talking extra slow, in the tone of a teacher. making sure to annunciate every word. &gt;growl: you think?! i knew i should have just let you leave. this is useless. i don’t need a step by step guide, just get it done. &gt;me: then you press scan to usb. i’ll just find the button... print? no..... direct print? no, don’t want that one either ..... fax? .... i was playing up the idiot vibe hard now. it was too fun, i read out each individual option on the printer as if examining them carefully. growl eventually pushed me off the controls after i deliberately skipped the usb print option for the second time. &gt;growl: geez. he hammered the scan to usb button hard. glaring at my bumbling nature. i stood smiling at him. the printer sprung to life as the document feeder grabbed the paper and fed it through the machine. i heard a faint sigh of "finally". &gt;me: oh see, you can do it. good job. i patted him on the shoulder like a coach would a star player. the printer eventually finished. its screen lit up for the finish, i awaited that glorious job complete notice that signaled i could leave this hell. **error** &gt;me: oh. &gt;growl: an error. i cannot believe it, you think after calling professionals they’d get it done. just incompetence. if anything you’ve just wasted my time. i realized then the problem with playing up the idiot vibe. what if something really went wrong? you’ve lost all the respect to get it done. even if it is fun. &gt;me: calm down. let me fix this. &gt;growl: fix!? i doubt you could fix me a coffee let alone fix something as complicated as a printer. insults about my coffee making skills? this guy....first time poster. i'm a web developer actually, not tech support, but my organization doesn't have dedicated support for our websites so i end up taking calls from time to time for the ones i work on. i walk into work one day, not a care in the world... until the receptionist calls me over. &gt; receptionist: there's a lady on the phone calling about thedanbob'swebsite.org. she's swearing. &gt; me: *suppressing urge to run screaming from the building* i'll take it in my office. i guess she calmed down a little when she was transferred to me because she wasn't swearing initially. &gt; woman: i can't play videos from notthedanbob'swebsite.com. oh good, i don't have to deal with this after all. that's my boss's website, not mine. i'll just transfer this call and... wait, how do you... transfer button... stupid office phone... oh forget it, i'll deal with it myself. i go through some basic troubleshooting questions, figure out that she has a common android phone and that she can't play some standard youtube video embeds on one of our sites. &gt; me: i'm sorry ma'am, but i don't think i can help you with this. the problem is either with your phone, in which case you should contact the manufacturer, or possibly your isp. &gt; woman: i already talked with them and they said to talk to you. i just want to play your videos on my phone! &gt; me: i'm sorry ma'am, but it is very unlikely that the problem is on our end. on the off chance that there is an issue with android phones i'll let the developer of that site know to look into it. i knew that there wasn't, but at this point she was getting agitated and i just wanted to end the call. &gt; woman: wait, you don't even know who i am! huh? why should that matter... &gt; woman: how can you fix it for my phone if you don't know who i am or where i live? &gt; me: uh, well if there is an issue with android phones in general or your particular model, the developer doesn't need access to yours specifically, he will fix it for them in general. &gt; woman: i don't care about other people's phones, i want you to fix it for my phone! wat. how do you expect me to do that, fly out to your house and look at it in person?! needless to say the call ended pretty quickly after that, but not until after she started swearing again.a friend helps me repair my car so i promise to build him a computer. i finished and delivered that computer to him 1 week ago. today he calls me up saying that its been running really slow. it takes so long for teamviewer to open that i give up and have him reboot the computer in safe mode. once connected this is what i see needless to say, i will be taking the computer back and reformatting the drive. i will also be removing his admin rights. ftp. ltl. be kind. posting from phone. today starts like any other. headache and eye twitch, check. coffee, (a likely source for my twitch) check. phone, **ring ring**! ...check &gt;me:mega medical help desk, this is davethewizard. &gt;tempuser: hello, this is tempuser, i can't see my icons to do my job. &gt;me: ok, what applications are you missing? &gt;tempuser: *unrelated app* &gt;me: hmmm... let me check a few things. so first and foremost i should note, i can already tell the user is new. our users are usually pretty good about giving an ip address first so we can remote in. some even insist that we remote in before telling us the issue. she did not. i search the user's name in our ticket system, and find a new user create task that is half finished. i also see she is a temp for one of our more turnover happy divisions. &gt;me: it looks like the *correct app* access is being created now. since we just made your computer login, it hasn't been finished yet. you've.... &gt;tempuser: *interrupting me* then why, when i log in as my supervisor does it show up, but not under my login? another note, the program she is asking about is presented by xenapp, her group membership has not been added yet. &gt; in my head:**!! battle stations, battle stations, set condition one throughout the ship!!** note 3 this is a major breech of aup at our org. &gt;me: who's login were you using? &gt;tempuser:i can't tell you that... &gt;me:excuse me? &gt;tempuser:... &gt;me: ...well that is a security violation, and as such, will be reported. do you have any questions? &gt;tempuser:...**click** &gt;me: (sigh) so i report the user and lock her account in keeping with our protocol. the thing that gets me is, aup is drilled into users from the word go, is the first thing they see on the computers, on a form they sign before getting their login, and is even in the handbook. users man....hi all, this happened a few weeks ago, but i've only just discovered this wonderful subreddit, i'm sure i'll have lots of content to post here, as i am the only 'on site' tech for an office of about 300 + other smaller offices. so, a user calls in complaining that he recently changed his expired password, and now his account is locked and he can't log in (we use standard windows and active directory). i check ad and surely enough his account is locked, i tell him that after 3 bad attempt it will lock. he thanks me for unlocking and hangs up. 20 minutes or so later, he calls again complaining that his outlook is prompting him for a password all the time. i check his account again in ad and it's locked again. strange. i unlock it and say if it locks a 3rd time i will investigate further. surely enough 15 minutes or so later, he calls and says it happening again. the most common cause of this is personal phones or tablets which have had work email added them failing to auto-sync properly and causing a bad attempt. i ask if he's got a personal devices added to his work email, and he says yes, just one phone. i ask him to remove the account, he reluctantly does so, despite already having a company issue blackberry with his email on it. the account continues to lock every 20 minutes or so. i call him to confirm that he doesn't have any other personal devices at home which may be auto-syncing with the old password. he gets a bit aggressive and says 'i've told you already, no, now fix this so i can get back to work'. as internal support, i never get this kind of tone, i like to think i know most of the users here on a personal level, and can chat happily away while fixing problems. i say that i'll work on it, and go ahead and contact our infrastructure team for help. one of the techs tell me there are other devices trying to connect to his account, he will work on telling me exactly what in the next hour. i call the user and tell him what i know, he snaps back at me 'this is absolutely not my fault! i am so tired of it problems every week! i will speak with your manager about this!'. trying to avoid the obvious and point out that this is the first problem he's every called in about, i tell him that it's best if we wait for the logs before we make any final decisions. he just huffs and puffs and hangs up on me, what a dick. at request they give me a log of all the login attempts to his account, and even device id's. i find the problem, as suspected, not only was there the one personal android phone he told me about, there was also the following devices with his work email attached, all of them had attempted to sync with his email in the past 2 days: * two android tablets * an ipad * a sony android phone * a google nexus phone * some model of iphone * a macbook pro now either this guy is handing out his login details to friends and family, or he has synced with work email with 8 devices. **who even owns 8 devices?** i call him and share the results, there is a long silence. i break it by telling him that we can't allow his work email, with sensitive client information, to be snyced with all those personal devices. there is a reason we have issued him a company blackberry. he then tells chews into me saying he needs to be always connected and it's essential to his job and blah-de-blah. tired of his shit, i straight up tell him 'we have issued you with a lightweight yet powerful laptop, worth over £1200, and a blackberry which gives you access to your emails on the go, why do you need 7 other devices which do the same thing?'. ignoring the point i made entirely, he instead says he has recorded the conversation (what????) and will be taking it to my manager to, in his words, 'show my utter incompetence at getting even the simplest thing fixed'. i go to my manager first, show the emails and logs from infrastructure, and tell him to expect a snotty email from the user. my manager, who had been away for a few days preventing him from stepping in sooner. gives me the go ahead to disable his accounts and sends a 'wipe' request to the blackberry server, on the grounds that he is unable to keep his client information secure and adhere to our iso standards. manager then called him, and told him to come into the office for a 'meeting'. during this meeting (which i sat in on, just observing) he was basically schooled on how to use a blackberry securely, and to absolutely never sync another personal device with it again, under threat of account locking. i fed on his sweet sweet tears. thank you for reading. edit: formatting edit: thank you kind, beautiful stranger for the gold, i shall cherish it dearly.how a $3 light beer became a $1500 light beer. i work at a university help desk during the school year. [i've seen some things.]( &gt; female luser: my macbook won't turn on. &gt; &gt; slowa: okay, i can help you at this cube. can i see your machine please? &gt; &gt; fluser pulls out her macbook pro and opens it up. i immediately notice two things: one, there's a certain stick to it when the lid opens. two, there's the faint smell of terrible, cheap beer. &gt; &gt; slowa: what were you doing before it stopped turning on? &gt; &gt; fluser: i put my macbook in my bag yesterday, and when i took it out today it wouldn't turn on. red flag number 1. &gt; slowa: okay. let me try one of our shop chargers and see if we can get it to run mac resource inspector. &gt; &gt; i plug in the charger to the mac. the magsafe light doesn't turn on. against my better judgment i haphazardly think that it's just a dead magsafe adapter, but that wouldn't explain the battery too. &gt; &gt; slowa: it looks like your internal charging adapter is dead. let's open this up and see what the damage is. &gt; &gt; a few screws later, and the back cover comes off. upon removing, i'm met with a much stronger aroma of $3 cheap beer. one look at the logic board and it's pretty easy to tell what happened. &gt; &gt; slowa: did you...spill cheap beer on this? &gt; &gt; fluser: i didn't, i brought my bag to a frat party and someone spilled beer on and in my bag! how much is it to fix it? &gt; &gt; slowa: .......... *[attempting to logic why you would bring your $1500 facebook machine to a frat party.]* *[wat. wat. wat. logic not found.]* *[restarting...]* the liquid contact indicators were red-ish yellow-ish, instead of just the [normal red]( that they would be with something like water or coffee. this meant that not only had beer been spilled on it, but it wasn't immediately dried off. red flags 2-16. &gt; fluser: so how much is it to fix it? &gt; &gt; slowa: well...$779 for the logic board, $80 for the magsafe, your keyboard is sticky so it's $120 for the topcase, your whole battery needs to be replaced so that's another $150, your ram is probably dead so that's $75, adding in labor for all of this is roughly $1350. at this point, it's worth pulling your hard drive and seeing if we can get the data off it. have you got backups of your files? &gt; &gt; fluser: no. of course not. &gt; slowa: well, our hard drive recovery fee is a flat $40 for labor, then $15 for every 100gb. we can take your computer and see if the data is pulled off it, but we won't charge you if we can't get to the drive. &gt; &gt; fluser: okay, do it. i took her computer upstairs to the hardware diagnostics room. normally we're supposed to send it up in a stack with other computers, but i was curious to see if the hard drive had also gotten an alcoholic treatment. i plugged in our sata to usb parallel cable. nothing. no drive spinning, no being recognized by getdataback, nothing. adding to the total repair costs in my head, this made it about $1500 including a new hard drive. i walked back downstairs to deliver the news. &gt; &gt; slowa: your hard drive and all your data is gone. &gt; &gt; fluser: oh. that's...oh. &gt; &gt; slowa: ...yeah. if you're interested in new computers, i can recommend a few cheap ones that are pretty durable. &gt; &gt; fluser: are they macs? &gt; &gt; slowa: ...no. &gt; &gt; fluser: oh... i have to talk to someone about this before seeing what i can do. i gave her the now sealed macbook pro sans hard drive, which was sitting on top in a bag. &gt; slowa: okay, we're here monday-friday if you'd like advice. &gt; &gt; fluser: thanks, have a good day. &gt; &gt; slowa: you too. hope it gets better than this news. fluser left, i immediately told my co-workers i needed to go wash my hands as soon as she walked out the door. fluser never came back, which means that she probably bought another $1400 facebook machine. i work part time in a university library at a 24 hour computer lab. i do basic it support and other maintenance tasks. last night, at around 1am, a student comes up to my desk in a hurry, saying her computer is acting up. we walk over to where she was working and she sits down to reproduce the problem. she (let's call her kay) is a psychology student writing an essay in ms word. &gt;kay: look, when i type, it does all this weird stuff! i'm afraid to touch anything &lt;starts hitting a few keys&gt; text suddenly right-aligns, search box opens. &gt;me: aaahh, i see. i think it's just misbehaving i lean towards the desk, tap the top of the monitor a couple of times, and say &gt;me: hey, computer! stop that! while i subtly remove her textbook from the `ctrl` key. &gt;me: okay, try now. she has a look on her face which i'm sure you don't need me to describe. slowly she begins typing, and it magically works again. &gt;kay: what the...? how did you do that!? &gt;me: some times they just need a talking to. and the book? *a cognitive approach to situation awareness* --- ^ps: ^i ^did ^explain ^what ^caused ^her ^problem ^before ^walking ^awaytoday i rode the bus which would take us to board the plane. a lady was storing her phone in her purse. i noticed she was calling someone. she did not notice that. now i had a terrible introvert inner fight. should i tell her? will she ask me why i was perusing her phone? but being an it sort of guy i think: "bah, whatever, let's tell her. she might lose lots of money if the other side does not cut the call" -ma'am, it seems you're calling someone? i don't know if you intended to do that? -oh! oh! thanks! she hastily grabbed the phone, obviously to end the call. but... the phone was calling and her finger was just on the light sensor. so the screen wouldn't turn on and she wouldn't be able to end the call. "ok, am surely she'll move the finger any second" she swipes, presses the power button, swipes, swipes. "oh god... she won't" she swipes a bit more. holds the power button for a few seconds. swipes. tap. "ok, i hope i don't sound like a smartpants" -ma'am... your finger is on the... she hastily moves her finger and the screen lits. she seems annoyed at the device, but then smiles at me. -thanks she checks there wasn't anyone at the other side of the call. and hangs and stores the phone. yay! i can go back to my bubble.i used to work weekend customer\tech support for a tech company that provides software where the user base is (supposedly) technically inclined. the story starts with a phone call, as many do. &amp;nbsp; me: "thank you for contacting x sup" **train whistle pierces my eardrum** "port... is that a train?" customer: "yeah sorry about that, we are at a train station" me: "well that would explain that." **gathers enough info to start a ticket**. the customer's company is a train company, which means train whistles going off in the background at various points. &amp;nbsp; the issue is that our software isn't able to communicate with other computers running of our software. the customer mentions several times how he (the network admin) and the cio couldn't figure out what was going on while i gathered info to create the ticket. they had a call with their ceo fulminated in all three of them calling us while still in a conference call. &amp;nbsp; admin: **reads the error message, which is something similar to 'no connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it'** me: "ok so it looks like the issue is network connectivity. can you ping computer x?" admin: "lemme check. nope. can't ping." me: "well it sounds like you need to find out why the computer itself isn't responding" admin: **starts to go off on why this is an unacceptable answer when cio interjects** cio: "wait so would it help if that computer was on?" &amp;nbsp; now, you would think that years of working help desk would prepare you for questions like this--but when three people, two of whom are it and paid more than you, fail to realize that something has to be powered on to work you get stunned. this stun meant a few seconds of silence on my end while i tried to figure out exactly how much more they were paid. &amp;nbsp; me: "...yes. yes it would" edit: i can google how to format reddit posts! ltl;ftp i've wanted to write up this story for a while now and since it's the end of the year and things are looking a bit slow, now might be the right time. for the record: i'm a web developer. which means i develop websites and web applications for a wide arrange of customers... when i first came to work at a company, with my freshly printed bachelor degree, one of the customers had let build a website that was rolled out into multiple countries, with multiple domains and multiple languages. because the static content was the same for every version of the website, we used po files for translations (which is still standard procedure afaik). one of the first tasks i got, was to sit and think with a senior developer about the chinese version of this website. as it turned out, a certain form on the website gave a validation error whenever a user tried to fill in an address. the weird thing was that this only occurred on the chinese production environment and not on development, testing or acceptance environments. this made the entire issue a lot more complicated, since we had no easy way to debug the error. after a couple of weeks of thinking, hunches, trying, consulting and failing, we still weren't getting any results. to the great frustration of our dearest customer of course. now let me remind you that this was back in the day that browser did not have built in language detection or translations. after all this time, my fine colleague decided to translate the production website. he discovered that the fields of "address" and "zipcode" seemed to be switched around on the chinese production environment and only that environment. using this lead, he was able to finally track down the problem. as it turned out, the chinese 'moderators' of the site wanted the "address" and "zip code" fields switched around. because we don't understand a single chinese character, they had access to the po files we use for translations. so instead of asking us to switch around the fields, they switched around the labels on the form. this resulted in the zip code field being labeled as "address" and vice versa, which resulted in users filling in their address in the zip code field, which obviously resulted in the validation error... --- this is the weirdest story i can remember from my career thus far. maybe i'll come back to write up another story in a while. for ~~know~~ now i wish you a happy 2016! edit: fixed tpyo edit 2: as [pointed out]( by /u/bduddy i probably mean "postal code", rather than "zip code".my fiancee just sent me this, she works as a csr at a cellphone repair shop. gut laugh ensued. **customer:** so yeah this is the 3rd time we have brought this phone in and it's still not charging. **csr:** sir, there's bread in your charging port.[previous]( work was crazy. too many things to get done, not enough people to do them. i sat at my computer furiously working with a troublesome outlook. a knock at the door, saved me from having to deal with more .pst files. i looked up with a smile, hoping the knock at the door would lead me away from outlook. &gt;headhr: hey airz. i’ve been thinking… uh oh. &gt;headhr: the kids are coming soon and this place… head of hr swooped her arm over the doorway, dramatically. &gt;headhr: well its a little dull isn’t it? i looked around at the department. looked functional. perfect. &gt;me: i think its fine. i really should be getting back too… i didn’t really want to get back to outlook, but its better then interior design. &gt;headhr: no, don’t get offended. i just mean some small changes, make it look a bit… you know… &gt;me: right now, it looks like a work place. i want to give those kids an authentic experience. my smile at head of hr held until i turned back to outlook. headhr didn’t seem to find that as a cue to leave however, instead she walked further into my office. &gt;headhr: well earlier today i was talking to grey. you may not know him. lovely older man down in …. &gt;me: yes, yes i know him. i really wanted to rush this along. it work was piling up. &gt;headhr: he asked me what kids liked. he said i was good with children, i helped him pick a background picture… backstory… really? i thought as i tried to work and listen at the same time. &gt;headhr: anyway that got me thinking, since i’m meant to be helping you… maybe we should make this place a little more welcoming…. head of hr had paused for a reply. i however was too busy actually working. eventually she continued. &gt;headhr: so i got these it related posters. headhr bent down to her bag i hadn’t realised she was carrying. she unfurled the first poster. **men in black 2** &gt;me: errr… i didn’t know what to say. it wasn’t the worst poster she could have picked… i guess. &gt;headhr: i know, its a little old but… we could only get older posters. nice helped me pick these it related posters actually. she said she might come help you with the children too. &gt;me: these posters are it related? headhr was busy unfurling the second poster. **the matrix - reloaded** &gt;headhr: the matrix is all about, computers and stuff, right? i guess i couldn’t argue with matrix. head of hr then unveiled the third poster. &gt;headhr: this ones my favorite. **ghost in the shell** &gt;me: where did you…. &gt;headhr: personal collection. i slowly took in the whole third poster. it was completely japanese. &gt;me: its got a semi naked lady on it! &gt;headhr: you’re getting teenage boys. they’ll like it, trust me. i tried to continue working, ignoring headhr, but she was smiling at me. waiting. &gt;me: i don’t think its.. appropriate. to put up posters at work. &gt;headhr: ive got them in my office! headhr seemed offended. i tried to correct my stance. &gt;me: posters are fine for a personal space, but i can’t put them up on shared walls. plus i don’t even know what that last one is… &gt;headhr: it’s nice though, right? don’t worry. i’ll put them up. nothing to do with you. headhr smiled at me. i decided to just get back to outlook. no point arguing, just block out all sounds. just concentrate. i looked back at my screen, outlook going fine. i looked out my door again. head of hr had put up posters around the department. i couldn’t see the ghost in the shell poster. &gt;me: must have changed her mind about it. i said to myself as i got up to close the door. sitting back down on my chair i tried to relax before continuing work. i stared into space. then i noticed it. ghost in the shell poster. stuck to the wall of my office. [next]( so this started off as a reply to another story and turned into a full blown (if short) tale in its own right. it is kind of a brag but... oh well. if you don't like it, downvote it! a while back i was working a weekend shift when a lady called in with a vpn issue. specifically she needed vpn and the two factor authentification app installed (registered and tested). this takes about twenty minutes start to finish and goes faster when i just remote into the computer and do most of the setup myself. which is what i did. now the place i work uses a rdp app that causes the wallpaper to disappear as soon as i arrive in the pc. usually people kinda freak out when this happens. this lady's response was completely different. &gt; **her:** hey! my wallpaper has disappeared! &gt; **me:** don't worry, your wallpaper will return... &gt; **her:** no! i like the solid black! is there anyway i can keep it? &gt; **me:** seriously? you want to keep it? &gt; **her:** absolutely! it is `so` much easier to read! &gt; **me:** okay then! let me show you to do this. turns out she has a vision issue that made it hard for her to read the names of icons against the normal default wallpaper. something to do with contrast? anyway, when explained this to me, i introduced her to the high contrast themes that windows has available for this purpose. then i set her up to use vpn. ---- edit: more of my stories can be found [here](in the same vein as my other pilot story i thought i'd share a more cringe worthy one. our runway was being repaired so all of the aircraft where operating out of a local army helicopter field. for about 3 weeks everything was going good. that was until "the best damn pilot ever" needed to log some hours. we marshaled him out, and he immediately goes the wrong way. we call the tower and tower radios for the pilot to stop because there is no room to turn around. the pilot proceeds to not listen and goes nose off into the field around the taxiway. this is where it gets good. there was gravel where they ended up running off the way taxiway. instead of listening to the tower who told them to cut the engines while we get the two vehicle to pull them out. they proceed to throttle full reverse, this was a c-17. i then heard the horrific sound of 2 of the engine ingesting gravel and fodding out completely. they then shut the other engine down. the pilot and rest of the crew go to leave when our colonel shows up and asks them where they were going. the pilot who made the call to reverse told the colonel that since the aircraft was grounded he was going home. i have never seen a colonel lose his sh*t before, but it was the most hilarious and frightening thing i ever saw. the next day "the best damn pilot ever" was out with use helping change the engines while the colonel stood there making sure he was doing the work.friday afternoon i looked down at the paper in my hand. i was pissed. earlier in the week i had given the entire phone roll out to youngsec, i should have payed more attention. youngsec had given out all the phones successfully, but on friday he came into the office. &gt;youngsec: boss, i’ve given out all the phones but i’ve run out of vouchers. &gt;me: sorry vouchers? &gt;youngsec: pre-paid vouchers for phone credit. he passed me some papers showing our business account. i saw red. had the vp really gotten pre-f***ing-paid? and a months worth of credit for the entire company charged to the it account. &gt;me: leave it with me. i gotta go see the vp. as i marched upstairs to the vp’s office i dreamt about a world where work was actually done in an office. it was weird. when i arrived at the office the vp wasn’t around, his secretary informed me of the 5 minute wait till he returned. i decided to get coffee, from the executive tea room. the coffee machine i had been led to believe was broken, but it didn’t look broken. darn secretary was just keeping me from my coffee, evil witch. i got a cup, pushed down the grinds and flicked on the machine. *** crunch *** *** snap *** *** pssssssssssh *** it sounded pretty darn broken. i looked over at the secretary, she didn’t seem to care. she was so lovely. i picked up my company mobile and called the sales manager, who was still head building maintenance. &gt;me: hey sales, i’m calling in that favor. &gt;sales: what is it? she sounded suspicious. so untrusting. &gt;me: can you get maintenance to fix the coffee machine in the executives office? &gt;sales: that all? &gt;me: yep. that's it. &gt;sales: ill do it. but… why? it’s been broken for months. &gt;me: maybe with coffee this place will start working properly. the vp arrived at his office, i walked over to his office from the break room with a water. &gt;vp: airz! i hear the phones are going down a treat. congratulations on a successful roll out. &gt;me: they’re all pre-paid. &gt;vp: yep! i talked to the guy from the phone company, he said pre paid means we can keep track of spending the easiest. i took a sip of water for strength. it was see through. &gt;me: you said you’d cover the cost of the phones. why is all the ongoing costs being put on it budget? &gt;vp: no. no. remember i said i’d cover the cost of the phones. not the credit. the water was urging me to calm down. be fluid, go with the flow it was telling me. no, i thought. water was wrong, and stupid. &gt;me: no. i’m not covering these costs. no chance in hell you can dump this on me. &gt;vp: look its about better communication for an in increase information flow, and its a new technology for the company. so basically its an information technology or it. i picked up the glass and drank the entire thing. hoping the soothing go with the flow attitude of water would transfer over. it didn’t. &gt;me: ring the boss. &gt;vp: i don’t think… &gt;me: now i almost shouted. it was close. my rage was being held in check by a string, and it was fraying. &gt;boss: hey vp, &gt;vp: boss, ive got airz here…. the boss was always fast. &gt;boss: and he’s wondering about the phone credit situation? &gt;vp: yes. i was just telling him how it’s an it expense. &gt;boss: airz, he’s not wrong. the vp got a huge smile on his face. it was the same face i’d have if the vp got hung upside down. &gt;boss: but you shouldn’t have to offer new services without an increase in budget. that wouldn’t be logical. the vp hung up. looked like in anger. he wasn’t smiling anymore. &gt;vp: fine. you’ll get a $10 per month budget increase for every phone. &gt;me: but people are burning through that sort of credit in a week… &gt;vp: well… you’ll just have to stop them. the evil smile was back. with a vengeance. i walked away. i hate the vp. and with $10 a month phone credit i could sms him that once a day... for 2 whole days. :( [next]( [older]( vp to budget. check. [previous]( heads of department meeting i sat down with a heavy heart, everyone was chatting, they all had a pda. i nervously watched as the other heads of department showed eachother different capabilities of the pda's. nothing good can come of this, my mind screamed. &gt;saleshead: hey airz, i've er... saleshead dropped her pda in front of me, the screen was broken. &gt;me: seriously?! what the... &gt;saleshead: can you just get me the forms and fix it. lets skip the incredulity. the vp walked into the room at that moment, he smiled at all the pda's being displayed. he walked like he was daydreaming. &gt;me: it's your fourth! four! in a week!? what are you doing with these pda's? a throwing competition? &gt;vp: hey, don't stress airz. it's just a screen, no use ruining a lovely day over it. i watched closely as the vp took his seat. he wore a smile, his tie was loose. it looked odd. &gt;me: she's broken four screens, in a week. i think perhaps we should revoke ... &gt;saleshead: revoke?! no. i need my pda. vp... saleshead looked pleadingly over at the vp, who was leaning lazily back on his chair. &gt;vp: ahh, no. don't worry, i wont revoke any pda... err.. privileges. airz will just have to fix it. &gt;me: vp, it's been four screens now. the cost of keeping her with a working pda is just to high. &gt;saleshead: it doesn't even cost you... the vp smiled at both of us. he held up his hands to stop us from talking. &gt;vp: you both look stressed, relax a little. airz, luckily you wont have to cover the costs of replacing the screen, that'll continue come from my operational budget. okay? &gt;me: it's not just the price, it's the time! saleshead looked furious. she almost screamed. &gt;saleshead: they only take 20 minutes to replace! &gt;me: per screen! you've had four, in a **week**. i looked down towards the vp, waiting for him to just assign the job to me. however he lent forward, and put his hands together. &gt;vp: i'll do it. &gt;me/saleshead: ...? &gt;vp: i'll fix the screens from now on. &gt;me: do you even know... i remembered just in time who i was talking to. i shut my mouth. i looked worriedly over at the vp, however his face was back to smiling. &gt;vp: i know what you were about to say, and don't worry, it's my project. out of your hands now. &gt;me: i'm not sure if this is.... the vp cut me off. &gt;vp: all this mistrust of your coworkers, airz. it's a good thing i've organized a three day team work exercise. looks of confusion spread about the room. the vp however was relaxed and smiling. &gt;saleshead: it is going on a team building exercise?! why not sales... &gt;vp: no not it, all the heads of department. a hand from the other end of the table creeped slowly upwards. &gt;vp: yes, before you ask acchead. it is mandatory. acchead's hand fell down with a thump, his head lowered dejectedly. darn. double darn. [next]( this story takes place when i a student tech/content updater/web designer/whatever they needed that day for $public_university, working in the financial aid office. my users were all office workers who, despite working on computers all day every day, managed to learn as little as they could about them. it was a day like any other day when i receive an e-mail from upstairs with the subject "i kkkkkkcakkkkkn'tkkkk kkktykkkkkpekkkkkk", and no body. *well, this is odd*. i head upstairs and find $office_workers desk. &gt; $me: so, what seems to be the trouble? &gt; $ow: i just bought this new ergonomic keyboard last week, but today whenever i put my mouse into word or outlook it just starts typing the letter k over and over. &gt; $me: huh...do you know where your old keyboard is, just so you can have something to work with while i investigate this one? *oh god, i know nothing about hardware. i hope there's nothing wrong with this keyboard* &gt; $ow: yeah, it's right down here. *points at the tower under her desk* so apparently instead of unhooking her old keyboard, $ow had just found an empty usb port, plugged in the new one, and moved the old keyboard to the nearest flat surface off of the desk. and there's nothing wrong with this, and everything was working fine, but that morning $ow had moved a book off of her desk and on top of the old (still plugged in) keyboard. i pick up the book. &gt; $me: ok, try putting your cursor in word now... *click into word* and no stream of k's. &gt; $ow: *look of embarassment* don't tell anybody about this... edit: formatting and spelling*i originally posted this to tales from retail but it never got approved so...hopefully it's moderately technical enough for here.* this is an...interesting tale. it happened (mostly) a few years ago, and i decided to keep it to myself because i didn't want to expose anything. as the tale will tell, though, i don't believe i need to hold back any more. my current job is somewhat retail related. i do mostly pro av system design and sales. while we have a small store front with some display cases, most of our clients are big corporate, education, and government. the store front is, for all intents, my office. the flip side of this company is production services. we do a lot of concerts, corporate/hotel av, festivals and one-off events in our area. wireless microphones are the flavour at most of these events and the pro-level ones we use all take a 9v battery. we will always change batteries during breaks or after an act to make sure things don't drop out. we often wind up with trays of half-dead 9v's for recycling after a show. as a courtesy to some customers, we will give out some of these 9v's. they're still mostly good, and they will run small things like a radio or a guitar pedal for a few hours. so, if asked, we're usually pretty generous with them. one day, about two years ago, a guy pulls up in a rather expensive car (not naming brand because it might narrow things down) and asks if we have any used 9v batteries kicking around. sure, i say, and grab the beer flat they're sitting in out of our repair bay. the guy grabs a dozen or so and heads on his way. a couple days later, he shows up again, this time with a multimeter in hand. he explains to me (in a clearly not satisfied tone) that some of the batteries were completely dead and they didn't work, so he was going to test them this time. a bit irritated about being reprimanded for the free batteries he wasn't happy with, i grabbed the box and let him have at it. as he picked through them, getting a little bit upset about how many were dead, i asked what he was using them for. oh, i'm the landlord in an apartment complex. i replace all the smoke detector batteries with these ones. at this point, i took my tray back and told him to get out. we weren't going to be a party to him being a cheapskate for not spending a couple bucks on 9v batteries. no incident, he just left. what makes me tell this story is what happened today, however. i see the distinctive car pull into the parking lot (which i remember, because it's rare around here and one of my dream cars). c: hey. you guys used to have used 9v batteries here. can i have some? me: no, sorry. we don't give those out anymore. c: oh? i used to work at a theatre and we'd come get them from you all the time. me: yeah. some a-hole was using the dead ones in his tenants' smoke alarms so we had to stop. i looked him dead in the eyes. he knew i knew who he was. he just nodded and left at that point. dude, don't cheap out on the safety of people under your roof. i'm not going to be a party to it and now you've forced me to tell this online. tldr: cheapskate landlord goes up in smoke.as you all know, in the eyes of the dreaded end user, being it literate means that you have an affinity for fixing anything with a screen on it. i thought this one took the biscuit though. &gt;**me**: *happily typing away pretending to be busy* &gt;**end user**: there you are! i hadn't moved all day &gt;**end user**: got a bit of an it issue in reception. can you have a look for me? &gt;**me**: what kind of issue? &gt;**end user**: well it was working fine earlier but now it's not. descriptive as ever. i assume it's the usual label printer crap i always get from her and head to reception. i start walking towards her pc and get stopped short. &gt;**end user**: no, over here! *points at coffee machine* &gt;**me**: errrm... what? &gt;**end user**: so i was putting the tray back in and accidentally broke the... &gt;**me**: can i just stop you there? this isn't an it issue. i wouldn't know where to even start with this. you need a... coffee machine engineer or something from the supplier, sorry. *puzzled look* &gt;**end user**: well this one is so high-tech i just thought it'd be practically the same as the other computers. what do you look after then? &gt;**me**: hardware and software supplied by it. so stuff like your desktop pc, your label printer and a few programs. *long silence* &gt;**end user**: what about the radio? because that's broken too.i was a guest at a big amusement park, i can't remember which one at the moment. coming off one of their flagship roller coasters, the exit led you right through a little pavilion with about eight self-serve kiosks where you could view and order overpriced prints of yourself looking foolish at strategic points on the ride. there was one young lady circulating among the kiosks, helping guests with any questions; one kiosk was powered on, but with an out of order sign, displaying a message like "connection to server lost" on the screen. waiting for my anklebiters who wanted to ride again, leaning against the wall by the offline kiosk, i noticed the ethernet plug was not fully seated in the network jack on the wall. actually, that's an understatement - it was just barely inserted at all, held in place by rainbows and happy memories and virtually nothing else. &gt;me: excuse me, miss? this kiosk that's offline, i noticed it isn't plugged in to the network, and that would explain the error on the screen. &gt;parkemployee(pe): oh, i really don't know anything about computers or networks or anything ... &gt;me: i'm an engineer at $bigtech, and while i don't know your system here, i can tell you with 100% certainty that this network plug is not inserted correctly, and could very well explain this error message. it really can't hurt to go ahead and plug it in. &gt;pe: i don't think i'm allowed to touch those. i don't want to get in trouble. &gt;me: ok. just so we're clear, you did *not* give me permission to do this. and i plugged the cable in. the error message went away. &gt;me: hey, look, it fixed itself! 8-) &gt;pe: i... but... you can't just... uh, i mean, thank you! &gt;me: for what? it fixed itself, remember? ;-)so i was fresh faced in my first real "it guy" job. the day i started, i found out after 2 weeks with the current it guy, i'd be on my own, as he was moving to another position. we dicked around a bit in the morning waiting for something to do, and then bill called. bill started with the company about 30 years ago. he installed air conditioners, and now he's been at the company longer than just about anybody. a lifetime of hauling loads up ladders had ruined his knees, so he'd been parked in the office, scheduling jobs for those younger than him still out in the field. after my trainer hung up the phone he warned me. "bill is a pc destroyer. he is the definition of murphy's law. get used to it, you'll see a lot of him." and he was right. for the first two months i worked here, i saw bill more than any other employee. it was infuriating. why didn't he just stop fiddling with settings? the issues were never big, there was just so many of them. no one else gave me these issues. so i just asked him. "i'm a tinkerer." bill said. "i guess after all the years of finding ways to install the air conditioners, i get a bit bored with the day-to-day in the office." i thought this over and it made sense, so i started to take a different approach with bill. when he had an issue, instead of giving him the fix and sending him back to work, i started showing him how to fix it himself. if i didn't know, i showed him how to google a solution. over time bills calls dropped from 3 a week from bill, to 2, then to 1. i'll never forget leaving work one friday and bill grinned ear to ear at me. he hadn't called me once that week. so now we fast forward to a month ago. the company had grown a lot since i started, and recently changed ownership. my workload was getting a bit big to handle on my own. the new owners were all about efficiency. of course their first order of business was to remove users internet access. they were kind enough to let me put a pc in the break room for employees on lunch. and what happens when you let 50 people have access to 1 pc that none of them need to do their job? it gets treated like dirt. at this point someone told me the fbi wanted money to unlock the "internet computer." i put my head between my hands and sobbed. i had so much to do, this could wait until tomorrow. come the next morning i check the computer, and it boots just fine. i asked the girl from bills team who had reported it to me. "yeah bill fixed it last night. he's so good with computers." i was gobsmacked. the constant problem that was bill, had googled a solution, and fixed it for me. turns out he'd been the first point of call for his whole team before they came to me for a few months now. then we come to 2 weeks ago. as the newly named "head of it" (though for now it was still just me) i was sitting in on my first management meeting. we were discussing a new it hire. i was given approval to seek out someone to be my assistant. and that is how bill came to work it it. this guy in his early 60s has a thirst to learn that most people half his age lack. he's big enough to admit to a mistake, and is willing to take on any challenge. this morning during a quiet period, he proudly showed me a website he had built in wordpress for his nephew. all self taught. he never ceases to amaze me. goes to show that some users are idiots, others are just untrained it staff. i do desktop support for a k-12 private school, and do freelance work on the side. due to the nature of my job, many of my clients are referrals from users at my day job -- usually their home computers or mobile devices or kids' computers or the like. a couple of months ago, i got a call from a recently retired staff member who used to be the administrative assistant for the athletic department. surprisingly for her age, she is actually decently tech savvy, but still at a user level. she figured out that she had accidentally gotten a virus, and wanted me to make a house call. so i get there right after work (conveniently, her development is about 500 feet maximum from the school -- yeah, she worked there a while). i jumped on her computer and took a look. everything looked fine, except for a file in her downloads folder. it wasn't an executable, though. it was a jar file. &gt; me: well, that's funny! it looks like the virus is written in java. i'm sure it's harmless. i'll make sure it's no longer running, and you'll be good to go. i did a cursory check, and it seemed like it was running from the downloads folder, so i deleted the jar and went on my way, thinking that was that. no such luck. a week later, i got a call from her at work. &gt; athaa: i think there's a big problem with my computer. my bank account was hacked, and the hackers transferred $3400 from my savings account to my checking account and tried to do a transfer out of the account. luckily i caught it in time and the bank is monitoring, but i need to get this fixed. normally, i don't do freelance "on the clock," but given the urgency of the situation, i decided to make an exception. i had her fire up teamviewer and remoted in. &gt; me: okay, let's take a look here. that's weird, java is running! the jar had, of course, copied itself to the appdata folder. cursing my careless rookie mistake, i went into damage-control mode. i took a look around the appdata folder, and found a text file that looked a bit weird. i opened it. &gt; me: oooh, this is not good. there's a bunch of stuff in here that looks like usernames and passwords. yep. that harmless java virus was actually a keylogger. they stole the password to her bank account that way. i did a significantly better job of cleaning her computer this time, and a week later, i managed to verify that i actually had cleaned it properly. but i am getting ahead of myself here. two days later, around 9am, i received an email from her, sent over one of our distribution lists. &gt; from: athaa &gt; to: all faculty and staff &gt; subject: important &gt; please refer to the attachment carefully &gt; thank you &gt; attachment: payment_invoice.jar yep, that's right, a jar file. the people who were using the keylogger to steal passwords had stolen the password to her school email account, and sent out the virus to everyone in her address book. we suspended her email account, but the damage was already done. as the athletic department administrative assistant, she had previously sent email to all the faculty and staff. she had sent email to parents and to athletic employees at other schools. she had also sent email to the lost and found list, to which everyone at the school with an email account was subscribed. this included all faculty and staff, plus all students grades 5-12. of course, users being users, many of them opened the attachment. the rest of the morning was spent in ultra mega all-hands-on-deck damage control mode. most of the students who clicked on it had macs (that did not allow the jar to open because it wasn't from an identified developer) or chromebooks (which do not have java). a few people tried to open it on mobile devices, which also didn't work. but about two dozen faculty/staff tried to open it on school-provided desktops or laptops, and about half of those people got infected. we did a lot of re-imaging that day. i also took her computer home at the end of that day to re-install windows, but ended up figuring out that i had properly cleaned it the second time (after seeing this virus on a dozen computers, i got pretty good at seeing the symptoms). tl;dr: don't judge a book (virus) by its cover.first time poster with a short one for you: years ago, i was the de facto tech support for a small company. we had a fairly new $manager to handle relationships with the banks. he tells me that he hates his windows pc and needs a macbook, because everyone says that macbooks are easy to use (foreshadowing). i order his macbook and get to work making sure everything is ready to go for him the next morning. printers, shared folders, email accounts all set up. i set it up on his desk, hook it up to the external monitor and other accessories and give the whole set up my nod of approval. an hour and a half into the day, i had become suspicious at the lack of questions about his brand new setup when $manager appeared suddenly at my doorway. &gt;$manager: i have a problem. he motions for me and without saying a word, i pursue him to his office. he walks to his laptop, calmly sitting on the desktop. he points exaggeratedly and says: &gt;$manager: ...how do you open the damn thing? i honestly had a lack of words. my mouth opened, but i was speechless. i regained my composure, leaned forward, and with a single finger, lifted the lid of the macbook. &gt;$me: like... this. &gt;$manager: *sigh * *nods head * we can't even look at each other after that. i force something out along the lines of "you let me know if you have any other questions", but we both know there will be more questions. a lot more.i'm not a professional tech support but since im a programmer i do it sometimes for my family, or friends (and their families). someone has recomended me to their friend so i got another 'job'. as soon as i got to the place i follow the mother to the room with a pc. (it seems that this was a normal 2+1 family with a semi-tech-savvy son and two rich parents who got him a giant gaming pc). while the machine was booting up after i pushed the power button the mother said that ''since they bought the pc for their son on his b-day he sits more in his locked room''. so the windows booted up, she points the ''daemon tools'' icon on the desktop. she's sure that this is satanic program and it keeps her son there. i hardly resisted to facepalm. the next 30 mins i spent explaining this that it's not devil's software and this program is needed for cd to work. (i didn't want to explain her what is emulation and why it's needed). good thing taht her son came back and with his help i explained her that this is not evil. well, i knew that most people in poland are very religious, but i haven't met someone so faithful. (no offence) *edit: i know what's a daemon. i've been using linux for 12 years now. somehow she tought that it's satanic demon*[previous]( as arrived back down in it, not even the crowd of begging users could dull my mood. i grabbed a coffee and headed straight for my office. with a smile on my face i was met with redcheer, who oddly hadn’t left my office. &gt;redcheer: airz! back so soon. &gt;me: everything is sorted. i smiled and took a victory sip of sweet coffee. &gt;redcheer: so quickly!? but how did you… wait where is defiant? &gt;me: causality of battle i’m afraid. don’t worry, he’s in a better place now. i couldn’t help but joke around. i’d won. redcheer looked at me oddly, but took it as a sign to leave. i decided to get some real work done. email time. i read the first email, it was from the vp. **new email** to all heads of department, recently it’s come to my attention that it has older pda’s it is handing out to staff. these pda’s are mostly for notation and as a diary. however i’ve personally looked into the market and found newer models with wifi and emailing capability. i believe these would greatly help heads of department day to day. therefore i’m convening a meeting this afternoon to decide which pda would be best for all heads. —the vp. &gt;me: oh god. the phone on my desk started to ring. the coffee in my hand told me not to pick it up, but i had too. &gt;vp: airz! it’s the vp. &gt;me: oh... &gt;vp: gotta make this quick, but can you make a presentation on the different pda choices for the meeting this afternoon? &gt;me: wha… &gt;vp: great, thanks. gotta dash. bye. the vp had hung up. as i sipped my coffee i realized, this wasn’t the coffee of victory. it was the coffee of defeat. i pushed it away with disgust. i went to get another coffee. a planning coffee. ***** upon arrival at the meeting i was jumped by an eager looking vp. &gt;vp: thanks for this by the way. he proceeded introduce me to room. &gt;me: ahem. okay… first off i’d like to ask if anyone has any pending concerns about pda’s… i was staring directly at headhr, who was trying her best to avoid eye contact. weirdly the head of security had his hand up. &gt;headsec: does this presentation come with a slide show? my head fell in defeat as i realized headhr wasn’t going to honor our initial agreement. luckily i had anticipated the reluctance of headhr’s help now the vp wanted pda’s. &gt;me: yes. headsec bounced off his chair and eagerly collected the usbkey i held. he was strangle attached to slideshows. i smiled at the audience and prepared myself to start plan b: *befuddle everyone to death with useless information and make the choice of pda murky and delayed, and hopefully never happen.* ***** &gt;me: …and that’s why the dell axim with it’s video card will have 3d performance for some applications. i took a sip of water and looked around. i’d just finished a 45 minute speech on the difference between 4 almost identical pda’s. half the room had tuned out, however the other half was still wrapped in attention. &gt;vp: i see. well thank for for that *enlightening* talk, airz. i’ll open it up to the floor for discussion, which device do you think would be best? talk of “lifedrive” or “tx” filled the room. accounts seemed enamored with the dell axim. it was pandemonium, no one could agree, i heard headmarketing fighting with headcleaner about the ipaq as a brand over palm. the chorus of fighting seemed to make the vp angry. however the louder the room fought the bigger my smile. &gt;vp: everyone. *stop* the room eventually quietened down. &gt;me: vp, can i make a suggestion? if we waited just a little, we could see the newer models come out… they’d have even **better** features. i smiled conspiratorially to the crowd. nod were seen throughout the room. the vp however was not nodding. &gt;vp: no, no. i think we can all agree that windows for desktop is easy to use… therefore windows for mobile should be easy to adapt to... uh huh. [next](thursday afternoon: "ok, mr. teacher, i'm going to upgrade your computer. i'm going to move all of these files you have saved on your desktop up to your home drive on the server for safekeeping, ok?" "sure thing, mr. techguy!" friday morning, 5 minutes after school starts: "mr. techguy!!!!!!! where are all of my files?!?!?!" "good morning mr. teacher. i put them in your f: drive on the server. remember?" "oh. yeah. thanks!" 10 minutes later: "whoa, mr. techguy, what did you do to mr. teacher's computer?!?!?!" "good morning ms. teacher -- i upgraded it. what's up?" "all the kids are saying you lost all of mr. teacher's files!!!" thanks mr. teacher. i really appreciate all the kids telling everyone i'm incompetent because you don't listen. i do have to admit i'm pretty impressed with how quickly you managed to spread that nonsense, though.in the early/mid 90s i worked for a small firm that did software dev/training and hardware repair for local businesses here in the uk. a customer firm had an issue with one of their users. whenever she typed she would get spurious characters appearing in documents (wordperfect mainly i think). the characters were generally space characters, but others could appear too. the customer it dept had tried replacing the keyboard, hardware drivers, performed virus checks and all the usual stuff and were at a loss as to how it was happening. also - they couldn't duplicate the issue either when they tried using her machine. it only happened to her. so anyway - my company's tech guy got called in. he was a mild-mannered vietnamese man whose english wasn't perfect, but by golly, he knew his stuff. he visited the user and as per the previous attempts, he couldn't duplicate the issue, nor find anything wrong. a little perplexed, he asked the lady to do her usual work while he observed and thought about it. the problem started happening again almost immediately, and he could tell why. the lady was middle-aged, very short, very round, and very unsupported in the ample breast department. this poor man. this mild-mannered, meek man. this man with a less than perfect grasp on the english language had to explain to the lady that the cause of her problem was her great big tits bouncing on the keyboard as she typed. problem solved. she required a different kind of 'support'i'll be fair to this lady, and tell you up front that her native tongue is slovakian. that said.. i get a helpdesk ticket that basically says that she's been working on a project for her class (she's a teacher), and she's lost the files she was working on in a specific folder. so i log into the school system, and have a look. to be honest, i can't even find the folder she's talking about, so i email her back, asking if she's sure that's where the files are that she's lost. i literally do nothing, except to look for that folder. about an hour later i get an email back : "i haven't lost any files, i just lost the colour blue in the files. but the problem is fixed now, thanks for taking care of that for me". totally confused, i consider trying to figure out what had gone wrong, think better of it, and send her back a nice "no problem" email.  i'm doing tech support at a little computer store in the mid 2000's one day, i'm asked to meet with a few lawyers who want to start their own firm and need someone to set them up with all their it needs. they're starting with nothing. i spend about 45 minutes talking to them. i work harder than i should to come up with a fairly tailored approach - to save them money but also in the hopes that i can ask them for work once i finish law school. my pick list is fairly short: * 8 new imacs or powerbooks for the 7 lawyers and 1 paralegal * 1 cheap nas for file storage * 8 microsoft office licenses * a monthly fee for mail/web hosting * 2 laser-printers * various sundries, like cabling, switching and the like. somehow, they get sticker shock. i walk on over to talk to them about it. jerry is the most tech savvy, while gary is finance minded. gary:"which of these can we do without?" me:"well, not much unless you have some existing hardware or licenses." jerry:"nope. we're all making a clean break from our firms, so we won't have anything" gary:"what about this line. why am i being charged a nas fee?" me:"it's a component that you store files on." gary:"can't i store files on my laptop?" me:"what if you want to share it with someone else? what if your laptop breaks or is left in your car?" gary:"that's not my problem" me:"ok. what if jerry asks you to cover a hearing for him and you don't know what it's about? you could just grab it from the file share on the nas and bingo, you're ready for the hearing" gary:"we'd have to do a lot of hearings to pay off that nas thing" jerry:"why do i need to buy email hosting?" me:"well, i'd imagine you'd want your own domain name." jerry:"but my mac has mail already" me:"right, but it would be cheaper to use a mail host than give everybody .mac accounts. it'd look more professional, too" jerry(turning his laptop around to show the mail application):"no, my mac has mail already" me:"right. i thought you'd want separate email addresses so you can keep work separate from personal email. privilege and all that" gary:"whatever. why do we need so many office licenses?" me:"well, law practices tend to be word and excel heavy. makes sense to give everybody access to that tool" jerry:"but office comes with macs" here's where i screw up. me:"well, if you have a cheaper source for office licenses, have at it." we go back and forth some more, even to the point of quibbling about the lengths of cat5 cable to string everything together. eventually we come up with a proposal, without the office licenses. we set up the macs in their new office, configure shares on the nas and leave them be. until 90 days later when their demo licenses of office expired. i never mentioned that i was a law student. i realized that i'd rather work at a retail computer shop than work with these lawyers. another day taking escalation calls at my telco when question marks pop up in the eyes of my closest colleague. &gt; frank: "you won't *believe* the call i just put on hold. somebody called frontline asking us to seed a torrent on about a dozen different trackers for their own movie." ... &gt; bytewave: "why?" &gt; frank: "something about it's going to be there anyway, so let's make the top result be a quality 1080p copy with multilingual subtitles. they want it to go up simultaneously with a hundred seeds per tracker." &gt; bytewave: "well i can respect that. it's not like i don't have multiple hdds full of torrented movies and tv shows at home. well seeded torrents are actually a pretty great way to advertise. and if they want to pay, we might be able to do it." &gt; frank: "no way. what department would..." &gt; bytewave: "unusual requests. four man team that just sits around all day waiting for this kind of thing to come up." &gt; frank: "never heard of it?" i reach for my most powerful tool - the contact numbers - and dial. &gt; toby: "commercial services, unusual requests division, toby speaking?" i patch him to frank. this may be the most useless department in the whole telco, on a good day they get two calls. they're there to offer creative solutions to any commercial client who wants something unusual vaguely related to us. i very much doubt that such requests even pays their union salaries, but at least we can say we have it. a couple months later... bored on a slow night. we happen to be both working overtime­. &gt; bytewave: "so, that movie aired tonight, normally if they went through with it, the torrents ought to go up soon, right?" i never downloaded a professionally seeded torrent before, worth a try for fun. &gt; frank: "yeah, it's freshly up on tpb, at least. listing 104 seeds." &gt; bytewave: "i want to know what we're seeding it with. let's try with the new trt link in our lab." in theory, we aim to eventually deploy 1gbps connections with that technology, though it'll only be possible in certain urban areas. the telco wants it ready 'soon', so maybe this decade. &gt; frank: "okay, it's on. hah, look, all the seeds have ips that can be traced right back to us with one look at arin. this ip class is for corporate use only." &gt; bytewave: "hah! but it hardly matters since we have the authorization of the copyright holder. what speed do you have?" &gt; frank: "hmm, i'm very far from the theoretical limit. we suck at seeding." &gt; bytewave: "there's only 6 leechs, we can't suck that bad." we run other tests and get similar figures. frank looks at the router, i look at the cables. &gt; bytewave: "oh ffs, who put non-e cat5s behind the router we're supposed to use to test a 1gbps link?!" whoever set it up failed to realize these ethernet cables rated for 100/10 weren't meant for this. we swapped it for cat6, and immediately got 1gbps. at the senior staff meeting later that week, frank told this story and we decided to send out a memo to all locations saying to replace all remaining non-e cat5s from our labs. not too bad given this started over testing a torrent. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!]( short and sweet. anyone who has worked help desk/service desk has had a "customer" (employee) who is old and is used to their old methods, and can't grasp the concept that the old way is not going to work anymore. my job has it posted on the internal homepage that to view your paychecks, you must click this link. it's a very detailed section explaining why you must click this link and why the new software replaces the old software (basically, new software works w/active directory, so it saves me time from having to reset weird credentials once a paycheck.) lady called asking for the old software credentials to be reset. i told her 5 times we don't use that software anymore to view paychecks. told her we use blank now. she never asked how to view them....just kept insisting she needed her old software credentials reset. i remoted in for fun, reset it for her, and watched her try to view her paycheck..... "where's the paycheck????" i then had to direct her to the homepage, give her a brief reading of what the homepage clearly stated w/the big ol link, click the link, let it auto-log herself in, and then get her to the link that said "view paycheck". i then closed my connection as i was sure she'd open it in front of me. yes, she almost did, as the page was loading as i was closing it. i'm glad i tether my phone when on reddit while at work and use my own laptop, as i'm sure the network admin would read these posts and crack up laughing elsewise...*cue iphone ringtone* i reach over and grab the phone. it's 6:12am and the number staring back at me is listed as "&lt;-!contractor!-&gt; noc". we're cutting back on resources, so we recently brought in a company that will handle help desk, all of our alerts, and after-hours call. that way we can free up resources. they will handle all tier 1 and 2 stuff, we only get involved after they can't fix it or if it's a serious problem with one of our 4 datacenters. i'm the network lead. i gave very specific instructions to these guys on when we should be contacted on things, and on top of that, i'm not the engineer on call, so i'm the absolute last line of defense. my phone ringing from these guys so early in the morning can only mean one thing; it's the end of my network as we know it. about the only thing that could have snapped me out of a deep sleep faster was a phone call that something bad had happened to my daughter or wife. &gt;"this is kiltedcajun, what's going on?" &gt;*"hi, kiltedcajun? this is ajay in the &lt;-!contractor!-&gt; noc. we're having a bit of a problem over here...*" great. i knew it. the sky is falling. the only time i'm supposed to be contacted like this, especially when i'm not on call, is when all hell has broken loose. the main datacenter just blew up or something... i just know it. has there been a terrorist attack? earthquake? oh, dear fsm, this isn't going to be pretty. did that giant asteroid i was reading about the other day hit the earth? i start rushing to my laptop... &gt;"what's going on ajay? be very specific here, what exactly are you seeing?" &gt;*"the retail store in (13 miles south of bumfuck nowhere) isn't responding to snmp, and when we tried to login to the device we couldn't. it appears that the password on our support account has expired. can you reset it for us?"* &gt;"wait, what?" &gt;*"the password to our support account isn't working. i was wondering if you could reset it for me?*" i stopped so fast that my feet actually came out from under me and i landed on my ass on the stairs. &gt;"ajay, did you just call and wake up the absolute last number on your phone list to reset your f#¢&amp;ing password so you can troubleshoot an snmp issue on a store that doesn't open for another 5 hours? i'm sure he could hear me contemplating his death on the other end of the line. &gt;*"should i have called someone else?"* i don't blame ajay, i blame the people that trained ajay. i've never spoken to ajay, i've never met ajay, i've never even heard of ajay until this very moment. that doesn't mean ajay got off easy. after a quick tongue lashing and telling him to have their project manager call me as soon as he gets to the office, i explain that i am not a domain admin. i do not have the ability to reset his password. also, aren't you guys our help desk? why don't you reset your own password? &gt;*"yeah, i think that's a different department here. we can't do that."* &gt;"well call the fucking department that can! {breathe} better yet, call &lt;-!server lead that doesn't like me very much and who's visiting family on the west coast this week, but it's a working vacation and he's a dick anyway!-&gt; and get him to reset it." &gt;*"ok, we'll do that." click.* i calmly try to lower my heart rate as i walk back to my bed. i work from home, so i don't have to actually be awake for another hour and a half. i throw my phone on the night stand and curl back up under the covers. a couple minutes later my phone lights up and makes the text message sound. i reach over, grab the phone. it's from the server guy. &gt;*i'm going to kill you. this means war.* i smiled to myself and closed my eyes, hoping to get a little bit more sleep before i have to get this day started. after all, it is monday and i have a war to fight. whilst working at $itcompany i discovered many deals and 'favours' had been called in due to the 'kind heartedness' of the $itmanager. one of which took up an entire day. $itmanager's friend $badwebhoster decided to shut his business to become a home decorator. $itmanager thought (that over 40 clients) wouldn't be any trouble, and promised to look after his venture for free. he basically acted as the intermediary between the customer and domain name hosting companies. our problems started when $hostingcompany began domain server migrations, so many customers had incorrect mx records and other hosting technicalities. calls like this carried on throughout the day, from 8am to 2pm. most calls went like this: $discogesmic: hi, how can i help you? $customer: my website is down and it's your fault $discgoesmic: ok, we are acting on behalf of $badwebhoster. we were not aware of these changes and apologise for inconvenience. $customer: well you should be aware i've lost so much business. if you don't sort this out i will leave your service. the above conversation continued for around 40 minutes with an angry $managingdirectorcustomer, who used her website to give her email address and phone number only (basically a business card). she was resorting to personal attacks and denying us to help her. eventually $itmanager interjected, thoroughly annoyed at $badwebhoster for not informing us of changes (turns out $badwebhoster was informed this would happen). after the $managingdirectorcustomer not listening and generally being insulting, my $itmanager took the phone from me and said: $itmanager: i can understand why you are upset but after listening to this call you are offending my staff and being entirely unreasonable. we do not accept personal attacks or using bad language toward support staff when they are trying to help you. if you had listened you'd know we are not being paid for this service to you, and we don't wish to hear from you again. please find a new provider. while most clients were reasonable (and most had issues rectified), this could've been avoided if $itmanager didn't offer to pick up slack for free. to this day, the clients website is still down because she wouldn't let us help. tldr: don't do anyone free favours in it unless you want to waste an entire day.screechy was more of a dog, then an auditor. she followed everything i did, practically walking in the bathrooms with me. thank goodness for workplace laws, preventing co-ed bathrooms. getting back to my computer i picked up my coffee. i took a sip. tasted monitored. the screen flashed red. huh, that never happens. i took another sip of coffee. it never reached my mouth. the server room was reading critical temperature. i ran. when i arrived i looked down at our server room; half the equipment had hit temperature warnings, the other half wasn’t responding. &gt;screechy: why’s it so hot in here? &gt;me: i don’t know. the air conditioner isn’t working. we went outside and found the problem, a bar was sticking out through the silver fan of the air-conditioner. &gt;screechy: i’ve never seen an air conditioner self destruct before. i examined the air conditioner situation, a large metal bar was placed between the fins on the fan of the air conditioner. &gt;me: that's not self destruction. that's sabotage. &gt;screechy: who’d destroy a air-conditioner? i looked at my hands, i was still holding my coffee. i hadn’t split a drop, and i’d been running…. good. i took a sip. it was a good question. [next]( [older](i'm not it for our company, but i help a lot of the people in our office on basic things (non-admin rights stuff). i share an office with our sales guy, who struggles to write an email on a good day. he has an iphone 4s that is tied to our company's byod program and secured with mobile iron. this means that the lock code has to be 6 digits and changed every 6 months. &gt; $sales (on monday): hey, so i had to change the pin on my phone on friday, then forgot it, and tried too many times and now its asking for this ithing password. &gt; &gt; $me: let me look. oh, you locked it and tripped the anti-theft lock. you just need to put in your icloud password and it will re-setup. &gt; &gt; $sales: i don't have an icloud though. i never made one. &gt;$me: you do, and this phone is a brick until you remember the password for it. i open up the icloud website and try to reset the password on there, but he can't remember the answers to the security questions and the "e-mail me" link didn't work. &gt;$sales:f%#&amp;! i don't know what to do. all my clients call me on my cell. &gt;$me: lets try calling apple, maybe they can help. we call apple on speaker so i can talk for him, and they patch us to account security and he somehow satisfies their needs. &gt;$apple: we will email you a reset link to the new address you gave us in 24 hours. thank you. we wait 24 hours, and he gets the link. clicks on it and it takes him to the page to create a new password. $sales think very hard about a good password and carefully types it in one by one. enters it again. studies the dots, and clicks ok. &gt;$pwresetform: you must choose a password that you have not used previously. /facepalm.this tale took place yesterday, now i'd like to preface this with i've been with my current, swiss based company for under six months. i haven't once had an "out there" tale until yesterday, and i nearly lost my job because of it. we had just hired ten new service specialists, it was my job to ensure all of their personalized computers were running our custom bios alongside a supported version of windows xp (the company relies on programs designed in the '80s. they refuse to hire anybody to update them). all of our service specialists are rocking dual monitors for ease of access, the goal of this new team is to speak to brokerage firms, where the company make their big bucks, everything needs to go smoothly otherwise they may take business elsewhere. then, it happened. one uneventful saturday afternoon, my phone rang. it was 4:47pm. i knew if i took this i would miss my bus, but alas, i'm paid to do a job. so, it unfolds.. &gt; **me:** hi, it department, what's the---- &gt; **site director (sd):** it's sd on the phone, get up to service now!! *now, usually i would just open a ticket from my nice perched seat and have the issue sorted out before five or prioritize it for the next working day. this was different, this was the guy who pays my wages, and the guy who could just as easily take them away* &gt; **me:** of course, i'll be there in two *hastily running to my bosses bank in the customer service office, i knew i couldn't forget my backpack. stuffed with everything from 10m of cat-5 ethernet cable to plug and play usb fans.* &gt; **me:** hi (sd), what's the problem? your pc seems to be on and in working order &gt; **sd:** please, tell me what i pay you for. if you can't see the issue, i don't think you deserve to work under my wing &gt; **me:** sorry, do you mind telling me what is wrong? if i could have a picture, i could work to diagnose the issue for you &gt; **sd:** look at the two computers!! &gt; **me:** *[trembling, was i going insane?]* sorry sd, i don't see two computers, there is only one computer on this entire bank of desks, for the new service team leader, as you requested &gt; **sd:** *[turning a monitor in a fit of rage, pulling out a power cord in the process]* look! this says dell. get it? d-e-l-l. the other is hp. you know.. h-p!!!!! fix it, now! *he really thinks you can't just use a dell and a hp monitor on the same system. now, i knew what was wrong, how do i possibly word it without sounding patronizing?* &gt; **me:** well, usually we would order dell monitors as they're cheaper, but (supplier) was out, we took a batch of refurbished hp monitors to stay within budget. &gt; **sd:** but that doesn't fix my issue!!!! &gt; **me:** there is no issue. you were using your pc perfectly fine until you found out you had two differently branded monitors, there is just no issue. it's fine. &gt; **sd:** b-- but i was told by laura that it can't be done! something about pins or what-have-you *wait.. hold your horses.. my boss thinks a monitor is a processor? for context, laura is my boss, unfortunately. not all it service guys know and/or care for their job. i was told once she tried to convince one of my late peers (left for a better pay) that cleaning a pc is best done while it's one as the fans will circulate the air and dust for you.* &gt; **me** you're thinking of a processor, that's more behind the scenes stuff, different brand monitors is just fine, is there anything else i can help you with? &gt; **sd:** *[muttering]* no, thanks. i'll call you if i need any more help i raised a resolved ticket as soon as i got back down to my building, managed to troubleshoot one final problem too.. the best thing; i still caught the bus. **edits** - my laura + by lauraanother short tale from days long past. only partially related to the actual tech support part, forgive me :) a few years back i was working for a travel agency in the it department and we had an issue with our airport desk. tldr: router hardware failure; so the desk computers weren't able to connect to our network and they couldn't easily verify flight reservations etc.. as you can probably imagine, a huge issue, so off i went to restore the connection. now of course i was it. no uniform: i was wearing blue jeans and a geeky t-shirt. since the network equipment was at the front desk i took a seat there and got to work, with the two ladies actually working there standing at the next desk maybe five metres away from me. and to make things extra clear the sign on top read 'desk closed'. try to picture it: two desks for the same company, one staffed by ladies in uniform waiting to help people, the other for all intents and purposes closed with someone sitting there not wearing any kind of uniform or looking up at all. i wasn't sitting there for five minutes when the first people came to *me* to ask for assistance, even though i was pointedly ignoring everyone. as best i can tell it was simply because i am a man... eventually, as i had to spend several hours there until i had everything up and working again, i made a little sign out of paper simply saying 'next desk' with an arrow to the correct desk and placed it in front of me. and *still* some people came to me first. (x-posted with some edits to /r/idontworkherelady )company recently fired their it staff and outsourced it to my company as a third-party. the cfo of the company is very paranoid that the old it staff still has access to their network and computers, despite reimaging their machines and locking down the firewall. earlier this week, the cfo came storming into our room where we were at. "they're hacking my computer! right now!" i asked "what's the issue?" she responds, "every time i try to highlight a word, the entire page gets highlighted. they're highlighting everything on me! they have to be moving things around!" i turn my head back to my computer and say, "i'll be up in a second." looking at her desk, she has a gigantic stack of papers all over the place. on the corner of her laptop sits the biggest stack of papers, right on the shift-key. i move the stack of papers and all of the text highlighting goes away. we joke that we need to bring tinfoil hats into the office when we're here, but some days, i feel i truly need one...this happens more frequently then i'd like to admit: &gt;me: "that you for calling tech support, can i have the phone number for your account please?" &gt;cx(customer): my what? &gt;me: your phone number please &gt;cx: my phone number? (obvious confusion in voice) you mean for my account? &gt;me: yes, please &gt;cx: is it on my bill? &gt;me: it should be yes &gt;cx: ok, -talking to self while reading bill- phone number, phone number, is it -16 digit account number- &gt;me: -sighing to self and bringing account up- .....awesome thx... how do these people who call in not know what a "phone number" is, i can understand if you don't remember your own number because who ever calls themself, but seriously these people give the impression of not even know what a phone is let alone how the buttons on the front of it work. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ alternative ending: &gt;me: can you have your number please &gt;cx: -gives 7 digit number- &gt;me : and the area code aswell please? &gt;cx: -gives mailing code- &gt;me: no the area code for your phone number, &gt;cx: isn't it -mailing code- &gt;me: no, like -gives most common 3 digit phone area codes- &gt;cx: oh! it's -you get the idea if you've read this far- tl:dr forks will not help you relate with your customers better, no matter how many times you stab your brain with it. edit:spelling isn't important it's a phone conversation it all sounds monotone anyway (aka: i fixed stuff )hi everyone. i work tech support for my local internet provider, and although i get many calls a day regarding issues that are eye rollingly easy to fix, this one really takes the cake. let me start off by saying i am no expert, i was trained and have been working with the company for over a year now though, and in terms of fixing the internet over the phone i know my shit. i get a call today, a new customer who's just received his router and stuff in the post. the first thing he says indicates exactly the type of person he is and i know it's going to be an excruciating call. customer: hi, i got your gear today and it's not working already, i knew i shouldn't have signed up to you guys, it's absolutely atrocious. me: okay sir, i apologise for any inconvenience you've experienced, what's the name of the router you've received? - (it's worth noting that whilst i ask these questions i'm pulling up their account and line on the computer my side, he's right, the router hasn't signed up to us yet and the line is showing as inactive - we also send out a few different kinds of routers depending on what the customer wants, and usually asking them is quicker than bringing it all up this side) customer: *gives name* it's not working. me: i can see on this side the router hasn't come online as of yet- customer: exactly its absolutely ridiculous the service im on the verge of cancelling ive only just bought the damn thing. - (the engineers have noted that it all should be up and running, so i carry on despite him shouting now, thirty seconds into the call) me: right okay, and what lights can you currently see on the router. - there's a long pause where i almost think he's put the phone down, but no he's still there. customer: well, none. me: so not even the power light? customer: no, i can't see anything on there. me: are you near your router right now? customer: yes, it's still in the wrapping it's brand new. - here i actually pause for a good few seconds. he said its in the wrapping, so has he unboxed it at all so far? me: so the router is still in its original packaging? customer: yes. - so by this point after listening to countless insults (not included here because it's too long to type out) it got me a little irate, so i was a bit blunt with the customer. me: so how do you know it isn't working? customer: well, i just assumed, i've heard stories- me: so you assumed your internet wasn't working instead of trying it out yourself? customer: i was right though. - i want to slam my head on the desk at this point. me: how do you know you're right? customer: cos it's not on! me: sir that's because you haven't tried to even plug it in yet. that's like buying a car and never driving it because you just assume it won't work. customer: oh, well, i'll try it and plug it in. me: okay sir, once you have see if it works, if you have any more trouble give us a call back. i put the phone down, keeping his line up. i check his line five minutes later and magically he's online. it's amazing what happens when you actually plug in your shit before assuming it's all broken. i honestly thought this was a hoax call but the guy was being deadly serious. a few years back i used to work for a computer repairs company and i was the one receiving calls and assigning techs to jobs. one of the things i learned early on in the job was to ask customers exactly what the fuck "nothing works" means, generally by asking them to boot up their machine and talk me through what they're seeing. this was because "nothing works" most times means "this software i'm trying to use doesn't work the way i want it to". one morning i got this call: **guy**: my mac won't work. **me**: ok sir, what do you mean? **guy**: what do you think i mean? i turn it on and nothing happens! **me**: can you please go to your computer and turn it on? walk me through what you're seeing or what's happening exactly. *now i hear the guy walk through a few rooms and sit down on a chair* **guy**: it's loading. **me**: ok&amp;mdash; **guy**: there's the windows flag on the screen now. **me**: wait, what? **guy**: the windows loading screen thing. i'm not sure why you're having me do this. i already told you what's the problem. **me**: sir, i thought you said you had a mac. **guy**: yes. this is my wife's pc. **me**: i asked you to boot up *your* computer. **guy**: but mine's not a computer, it's a mac. *face meet desk.*so i work for a major isp and at the time i was doing residential internet support, which entails basic ethernet and wifi connectivity. to preface, this customer, who we will call mama, had called in multiple times prior to speaking to me that day. me: thanks for calling isp this is baelfur speaking, how can i help you today? mama: yeah i have been speaking with you stupid m*%&amp;#$ f*#*$@# for the past 7 hours trying to get my s@*$ hooked up and none of you idiots can seem to figure it out. me: okay ma'am can i please get your (insert verification requirements) mama: (swears for 4 minutes about verifying information before providing) me: thanks mama, now from notes i see that you are trying to connect a few tablets, an xbox and a laptop is that correct? mama: i don't know what the f*#( this all is, its all my mans s*%&amp; and he told me to call you idiots to get it hooked up, you all suck by the way. *at this point i'm guessing i am going to have to walk her through a direct connect to retrieve the wifi password from the router, so time to find the router* me: okay mama, do you know where your router is, and can you tell me if it is plugged in? mama: i've told you f&amp;$*%#s it's this thing hanging on the wall with all the blinky lights, me: okay, thank you for verifying that, now can you see if the little 1-4 are lit up so i know if you have any devices plugged in over ethernet? mama: all the stupid numbers are lit up a*$( hole me: thanks for checking that, so 1, 2, 3 and 4 are lit up, so you have 4 devices plugged in, are any of those computers available? mama: there aint nothin plugged in to it a&amp;$ hole, unless you want me to rip it off the wall and look at the back me: so there are no ethernet cords or power cords plugged into it that you can see... mama: didn't i just tell you that idiot? me: but the little 1, 2, 3 and 4 lights are lit up... mama: i told you, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 0 are all lit up you stupid f($* and if you ask again im going to loose my f%(#)%( temper wit you *our routers are 4 port standard routers, the wtf could clearly be seen on my face* me: .... where on the wall is this router located mama? mama: right next to the f#*$(%&amp; heater thing where your f#*$((*% guy put it, why the f#)* does that matter? me: so there are numbers 0 through 9 on the router, they are lit up , the router is mounted on the wall, and there are no cables that you can see.... mama: *launches into a flurry of high pitched squeals and swear words* *suddenly, epiphany* me: does this box have buttons that say police or fire? or maybe little pictures of a cross or a flame on them? mama: yeah, why you sayin i gotta press these and get tha police to come fix my internet?!?!?! me: no no no no no no, don't press anything. that is your alarm system, not your router mama: you tryin to tell me this not my internet box? are you high mother f*$)%# *my head is in my hands, staring woefully down at my keyboard. also at this point mama starts scream/ crying and cussing and she either tossed the phone down and walked away or threw it across the room... either way she became background noise. but then, i hear a childs voice getting closer child: mama did you get daddys xbox working? *mama's scream/ crying in the background and the child picks up the phone* child: hello? me: yes i'm here, did your mom not want to me to help her anymore? child: i donno, shes in the bedroom yelling about you... me: whats your name miss? child: kimmy mister. can you make my daddys xbox work so i can play it? me: do you know how to use the computer kimmy? kimmy: yes mister, i use it to play games and sometimes for homework! i'm only in the 3rd grade though, so not so much for homework me: okay lets see if we can find your router... the rest of the interaction with kimmy was just as adorable. basically i walked this ranting lunatics 8 year old daughter through hard wiring to the router, logging into the gui, resetting the password and wifi name, and getting the xbox, both tablets and the laptop connected. it took us a little over 20 minutes for everything start to finish. i wish it wasn't so insulting to just ask for someone under the age of 20 to troubleshoot customer issues :(me: retail i.t. support. how can i help you? store manager: yeah so our receipt printer was printing really slow. and a customer got so mad because it was printing his receipt printer so slow that he started grabbing the receipt printer and slamming it down on the counter… me: what the… are you serious? store manager: yeah he got really violent and started calling me names and threatening to break stuff in the store. me: whoa… you should’ve called security. store manager: well we’re in detroit. i’m just glad i didn’t get stabbed. me: hey thats not funny. you have that guy’s name right. you should call security. thats not cool. store manager: yeah maybe i should. but stuff like that happens all the time. customers cussing. tipping over clothing racks. threatening to come back and break the glass. me: are you kidding me? we need to report this guy. so the printer is busted now? its going to take a couple days to send another one… store manager: well… actually…. after he did that to the printer, its been working really fast now. me: oh…. store manager: yeah… i think his violence fixed it. should i still report him? me: hmmm. maybe he can come back and fix the rest of the issues at that store.everybody reading my tales knows i work as a senior tech for a unionized telco, but one topic i've not written about yet is that i've also done quite a bit of it for the union itself. it was many years ago. i can live with pseudonymously airing corporate secrets more easily than our union's. but still, there are a few tales worth telling safely by now, including how it all began. one morning at work, many years ago, while i was pushing tickets in my cubicle, there was a bit of a commotion. a rare celebrity had just been spotted below my half-floor; the union vice-president for call centers, flanked by a few stewards and a secret-service-looking goon. since most it personnel in north america is non-union, it may seem weird, but here we say your manager is the boss you hate and this guy is the boss you love. always had our backs, always the guy in the way if management wants to fire someone without extremely serious cause. if he shows up, people drop any work just to get in line to shake his hand. he shook many but eventually came to my desk. i hit the hard switch on both my phone and my wireless headset. he nodded at one of the stewards with him and asked me quietly to meet with the guy downstairs over the break. i was already known to have the union's interests at heart, but that was the day when i learned they trusted me back. downstairs, soon after... &gt; steward: "gotta be brief. we think the union offices might be bugged. we need someone from tsss (tech support's senior staff) to go over everything and say if there's any chance the company are using their network to spy on us, and if so, to offer to the executive the best options to ensure this is no longer possible. people on the council vouched for you, but it's going to be off-hours, off-books. in or out?" that meant despite the union's ability to formally order the release of any union employee from work hours with full pay, i'd be doing it on my own time because it was too sensitive for the company to know i'd even be over there. i was flattered, but i was definitely not a 'sweep for bugs' guy. &gt; bytewave: "in. but i'm not sure you want me. it should be handled by one of our union rf leakage guys if you think our offices are bugged." there is a huge union team dedicated to rf leakage working closely with regular road techs, [previously wrote a story about the kind of work they do here]( ... even [csis]( uses equipment they'd be familiar with, as our rf leakage team's multipurpose gear is entirely able to deal with bug-detection too. &gt; steward: "well, uh, just come around 19:00, it's not a rf issue." and so i did. i've never been too shy to admit my primary loyalty is to my union over my corporation, and the mere thought the corp might be eavesdropping had me torn between being angry at the corp and being disappointed that the union were actually using the telco's network at all - weak move, whether there's foul play or not. later that evening, at the union's headquarters downtown, after going through the sergeant-at-arms and the security door (while - sadly - there was a perfectly normal door without any sergeant-at-arms in the back) i was greeted warmly by the executive. it's not uncommon they work till 10pm. the steward from earlier led me to 'the evidence'. poured me a whiskey like we're in a movie, just as he powered up the computer i was meant to look at... &gt; steward: "so, we've had this series of bouncebacks since last friday. dozens of them. it's from some weird email address but has the telco's business domain name. this means they're trying to spy on us but screwed up somewhere, right?" it just took a single long glance before i groaned. just because you work for a telco doesn't mean you have any technical expertise. there are dozens of departments here with zero tech knowledge whatsoever. in fact, remarkably few union people are working technical jobs. from sales to recoveries to dozens of others, many routinely call in-house it because rebooting is hard. i'm still not sure how they made the leap from 'bounceback' to 'spycraft', though. &gt; bytewave: ... "yes, it's a bounceback, no, it doesn't mean the telco hired james bond to screw us over." i took out my phone and sent an email to the same address, instantly got the same bounceback. &gt; bytewave: "they have an email that we're constantly mailing to that is simply no long valid on their domain." the 'weird email address' was simply the default for corporate replies, and the hr person the union was communicating with had 'left' under unclear circumstances without notice - meaning a disabled corporate email within the day. because this guy used to be a liaison with the union, he was automatically copied on several low-priority/secrecy emails - just as the union was on several of hr's. everytime the union automatically mailed something to the now-defunct address on their domain, they obviously got a bounceback. i explained that this whole thing was about a low-level hr goon quitting. and then i started scolding. &gt; bytewave: "over the last dozen years, we've had *more than ample* evidence the corporation isn't playing fair. i'm not here to fix stuff anymore, i'm here as a dues-paying member expecting reasonable representation from my labour union under the (labour) code and the (union) charter. i want to know who the hell ok'd that the union headquarters use the only network where we can be plausibly spied on without any shred of trace or evidence - nor any involvement by the authorities - by the company which repeatedly suggested everything would be better if there was no union at all - and played dirty at every chance?" those who read all my tales will understand that i wasn't kidding about the company not always playing fair... union execs soon wanted to hear my point of view, and thanked me with free chicken, before taking me to the basement after dinner. at union hq, sensitive conversations are held in the basement because nobody is physically allowed down there unless they are completely trusted. no computer or smartphone ever made it down those stairs. as unhealthy as it may be, you can still smoke down there and nobody cares. that's where they asked me to be the union's tech support. days later, i got a 'release card'. simple name - but they're offered only to union execs, stewards and critical union-related staff. they only work up to just about a dozen thousand hours a year as per the work contract; afterwards, the union has to pay the 'release' costs. therefore, the union can't give them to just anyone, and it's a bit of an honor to get one without being elected to union office. it meant that i could afterwards just walk away from my job - fully paid and without notice - on union business at my own say-so. from that moment on for about a couple years - on top of my normal job as senior tech support staff at my telco - i was also my union's tech support, and there's a few tales i'll write about that! &gt; tldr: my union confused legitimate bouncebacks for spycraft, then hired me as their formal it guy. it meant privileges including being able to discard my work at any time because they were impressed i figured out their non-issue in six seconds. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](so, this is not a tale of networking heroics, nor is it tale of inept users. instead, it is a wonderful combination of happenstance that i think you all will get a kick out of. so i work for a small company, only 20 or 30 users, and i do pretty much all the tech work, including maintaining our servers. we recently added four more into our rack for another company that we work closely with who is also in our building. so the other company's tech guy and i are working in the server room, diagnosing some network issues he is having with his new servers. i am at the back of the rack, pulling wires while he is working on the machines, twiddling with network settings. i hear a small *braaap* and then smell a horrible, foul smell. the other tech has decided to rip a massive fart in the tiny server room, which was immediately pulled in by all seven of our servers, warmed up to a lovely hundred degrees or so, and then blown directly in my face by about 20 exhaust fans. and old lady, extremely technologically illiterate, called to ask how to keep people from tipping her monitor. upon further probing, i discovered she was upset because the icons on her desktop were reset neatly to the left side every time she logged in. she had called previously and the agent she got on the phone told her the icons were sliding to that side because her monitor was getting tipped to the left!wife: while i'm at the store can you fix the vacuum cleaner? me: i don't know anything about vacuum cleaners. wife: just do what you do half the time at work; act like you know what's going on, google the correct answer, play on reddit for an hour, then go fix it. -------------- (she works in the mental health field) wife: every time i talk to you about the hours you work, how much you make, it always makes me question my career choice. i have to stop and remind myself that i *want* to help my clients and am not supposed to worry about money. you don't actually want to help your clients.this is a short story, from about 6-7 years ago in my days as isp support. i was speaking with this woman who was having issues connecting online, doesn't really know how to use a computer, but we were making slow, but steady progress. i go to give her a new dsl password since she forgot her old one. ok, so i have just provided you with a password. can you please repeat it to me to make sure you have it? her: sure, it's a as in alephant, b as in boy, c as in chris me: mam, it's actually a as in alpha, not e as in elephant her: that's what i said, alephant! me: mam it's actually a not e her: but elephant starts with a! me: yes mam, you have the right password. her: i thought so!! thanks! all went well after that. she connected, even though there was an alephant in the room. tl;dr: alephant, get it right. edit: seems like once i brew an ale, i found myself a proper name. question is, what kind of ale i should brew... maybe something heavy? hahaalrighty guys! deepest apologies on the big delay in between, we had an urgent installation due on a ship that wasn't due for a few days come in today, and i had to sprint a good 200km's to get there and fix it before they deported again. anyhow, the epicness of our meeting shall be revealed. going to give more info than originally intended because you'll see: *2:40pm and 4 of us are outside one of our meeting rooms waiting for mr. boss. myself, derp, receptionist and receptionists husband (henceforth known as foreversad)* mr. boss: come in, take a seat. *awkard shuffle to the table, sit down. we are all nervous as mr.boss is kind of intimidating in formal situations. after reading a few papers readily prepared for him, meeting commences.* mr.boss: it has been brought to my attention that there has been some breach, or attempted breach, of confidentiality in this office - receptionist: sir, no there - mr.boss: - and further reports of harassment and lies being spread throughout the workplace - receptionist: - no, that's not true, i just - mr.boss: - and countless.... will you please stop interrupting me, receptionist? it would do you good to listen. receptionist: sorry.... mr.boss: derp has spoken to me about an incident which occured earlier today regarding 'file permissions', could you please explain x. x: uhm, sure. the short story is that i was asked by receptionist to provide access to her husbands payroll file via sharepoint. i refused to do so, and explained why, and she got irritated and told me to just 'do my job', which in my opinion is what i was trying to do. foreversad: really. c'mon receptionist, i show you my slip every month. receptionist: no that is not true, x is just making that up to make me look bad. derp: so this conversation never happened? receptionist: no, it didn't. derp: and even though i was there speaking to you two about it together, you are saying it didn't happen? receptionist: no, well, sort of. i thought it was a different file. x: but i *told* you what the file was and why you couldn't access it, and you told me to do it anyway. *awkard silence.* receptionist: i only wanted to see what was in there because - mr. boss: that's it, i've heard enough. you know why we hired you, right? because your husband is a solid worker, and i personally thought you would put as much effort into your work as he - receptionist: i'm sorry, i just have issues with - mr.boss: - do not talk while i am speaking! you have caused nothing but problems since you have been in this workplace! i have had countless incident slips and complaints regarding your conduct in this office and you have pushed your limits. foreversad, is there anything you would like to say? foreversad: no.... i've just had enough of her and this bullshit that goes on... sorry, we will speak at home. i sincerely apologise for these issues. derp: it will not reflect on you at - mr. boss: it won't reflect on you at all, foreversad, you haven done nothing but good while you have been here. *i'm starting to feel a little bad at this point*. mr. boss: receptionist, is it true you told susan (random name) her granddaughter should have had an abortion? reception: well.... she was only 17, i mean - mr.boss: - i have never been as ashamed of having a person with that attitude working in my office. x, how would you suggest we resolve this issue with the privacy and such on the computer networks just in case? x: well, she only really needs office 2010 for emails and word, maybe excel. she doesn't even need to be hooked up to the net - receptionist: - but internet! *boss just gives her the death stare.* x: technically, we can give her a netstick, that will give her internet access and no network access, which is not needed. mr.boss: perfect. set this up as soon as this meeting is concluded. x: sure, no problem. mr.boss: do you want an apology from receptionist? x: no thanks. i don't really want to speak with her if i can avoid it. mr.boss: i understand. receptionist, x will do what he does with your computer and you will live with it. it won't be for long, i'm opening advertisements for your position this afternoon. you will continue working for us for two weeks, and will train any person we hire for your position if we find a suitable candidate within this two week period. you will receive a further 4 week severance payment (actually quite generous) and will be paid your holiday time accrued in full. if you provoke or upset a single worker under my employment, whether it be by opening your mouth unwanted or by farting in their presence, you will be escorted from the building. do i make myself clear? receptionist - but... no... wait... but... sorry *sobbing* foreversad: crystal clear, sir. mr.boss: and for the record, x, your outburst towards receptionist was inappropriate and unwarranted. i understand you were provoked, and your job is strenuous, but please keep your temper under control. if it happens again to receptionist, you will recieve a formal warning (i have 0 of 3). understand? x: i do, my apologies. derp: it will only be for a couple of weeks, avoid the people you don't want to speak to. *whilst staring at receptionist*. mr.boss: x and derp, you may leave. derp and i in unison: thanks. *as we are about 5 feet away from the door, closed and made of hardwood, derp starts talking about how he is finally glad that she will be gone when we hear:* receptionist: fuck you you fucking asshole, i know you fucked sheryll and i know that's why you won't give me your password. you've been buying her shit for the past two months! that's why you won't show me your paycheck! foreversad: first of all, what is wrong with you, woman? i can't believe you just accused me of that in my workplace, and are stupid enough to think that my outside purchases would appear on my fucking payslip! *at this point i just ran away from the door, just about pissing myself laughing while derp was just standing in awe. i felt bad about what had happened to her in a sense, but my god is she one loopy bitch.* what made her comment all the more sweeter about sheryll* (fake name) is that sheryll is derps fiancee. from what i understand, receptionist was escorted from the building by security (i am still working on her laptop tomorrow as i have no 'official' word otherwise) and foreversad has been given some time of for 'family matters'. i don't know if i should feel sadness, win or epic fuck yeah about this, but one thing i do know is this: that loopy bitch had to go, and i'm gonna love my job *that* much more. any questions? i feel like i've missed so much of the event in this post, it's a 'you had to be there' type thing imo. update*** hey guys and girls, thanks a ton for reading what turned out to be a three part series - i hope you enjoyed it. i am going to sleep as it is late here and i have a really long shift tomorrow, but i'll be back to check on everything throughout the day (oh, the glory of working on wizard machinary). i'll try to keep up with all questions asked and will respond asap. goodnight guys, see ya tomorrow! update 2**** having a heavy workload today, will be back to check on everything in approx 10 hours (i know, looooong day ahead including 450km's travel by car). thanks for the overwhelming response, it feels good to know that my experiences haven't been in vain! and i would also like to say thanks to the anonymous redditor that sent the gift, you know who you are and i sincerely appreciate it! update 3***** just going to paste the links to [part one]( and [part two]( for everybody to find and enjoy. thanks to the others that have posted them in the meantime, very much appreciated!previous tale [here]( *** i'd like to thank the three kind souls who have gilded this post. i am opening an account for frodo named: college and studies histrionics aka c.a.s.h. he has a future now thanks to you guys. *** **foreward** i'm looking after my godson yesterday and today (and probably tommorrow too), because of no school, and his parents work. we played video games, binged on pizza, all the fun stuff you do to spoil a kid. due to the on-call nature of my two jobs (condo building general hardware it stuff, and sysadmining for theboss), i brought him along on my calls. most of them were pretty basic, and not worth tales here, but here are the tales that he solved. *** **cast** **frodo**: my godson, the hero of these stories. absorbs information like a sponge. my pfy of these stories. named thus because his mother dislocated two of my fingers in the delivery room. (i was there due to fate kicking me down, and then stomping me repeatedly afterwards). coincidentally, his hair is curly too. eight years old. **theboss**: client i'm sysadmining for. seen in a [previous]( tale. guilty of repeating previous issues. **thefiance**: fiance/assistant to theboss, seen in previous tale. **$ecurity**: head of security at the condo complex. takes his job seriously. listens to instructions, only calls when necessary, all the makings of a good user. **luser**: desk drone from hell. will complain about any and everything she can think of. *** **inspections are really useful** yesterday, 4pm. get a call from $ecurity, a security camera is down. this was an important one too. it pointed directly at the playground. it was mostly a redundant camera, but it has a closer, unbroken view of the playground (in case anything happens *knocks on wood*). it's had a troubled history, and usually goes out when it rains. so we head out to the security office. make introductions, exchange pleasantries, drink an obscene amount of coffee. check the security monitors. yep, it's down. switch ports, still no go. so, we decide to go check it out. it's raining pretty good out: a nice freezing rain. check out the camera through my cell phone camera. nope, no ir light, so in my infinite wisdom, i decide that the camera is broken. i leave frodo with $ecurity, and go fetch a replacement, and a ladder. i return, to see frodo on his hands and knees looking at something on the ground, with $ecurity crouching next to him. &gt;frodo: what do you think it is? &gt;$ecurity: looks like a gasket. a gasket, eh? i come up to check it out too, not wanting to be the guy left out of things. &gt;me: looks like one of the gaskets for the conduit box that holds the camera ba....... crap. so i head back to the storage room for a balun, and an umbrella. and head over to the security office to unhook the camera. i return, get up the ladder, open the umbrella and unscrew the conduit box cover, while water is just draining out onto my hands. good thing i unhooked that cable, 12v is a joke, but it feels annoying. take off the cover, and unhook everything, dry it out, and hook up the new balun, and reattach the cover with the gasket. have $ecurity go back to the office and hook the power cord labeled 09 into the socket #09. he gets it right. on the first time. with nothing catching on fire. he radios me to tell me the camera is up. i climb down the ladder, and confirm with my cellphone camera, yep, there's the ir light showing up. take the ladder down, hand frodo the camera, and we head back to put everything back. i call both the building it guy and $ecurity, and have them schedule a meeting to talk about better camera systems, as we are currently using analog signal to dvr, and while not quite bad, but not as advanced as the owner would like (he wants everything digital, redundant systems, blah blah blah i'm rich do it, in this case, i agree with him). me and frodo go back to the condo for showers and celebratory coffee (his was heavily watered down with milk and sugar, but hey, it's a start). i email maintenance to report about the gasket, and to find out who lost it, because it sure wasn't me. *** **reading sure is useful** today, 8am. this morning, i did not feel like cooking breakfast for us. so, i brought us over to theboss' place to ~~mooch~~ i mean... see if everything is alright, yeah, let's go with that one. naturally, thefiance is making breakfast, and offers us some! i help her out with setting the table and whatnot, while frodo is watching tv in the office. all the while, i can hear grunts of frustration from the office. just as i'm about to go over to see what's wrong, i hear: &gt;frodo: what's wrong? &gt;theboss: can't access company x files. if you have read my last tale, you can see where this is going. &gt;frodo: *reading out loud* "company y computer" what does that mean? **my signs worked!** yes, he was being sarcastic. sure enough, i hear the chair wheels skidding across the floor, some typing, and a relieved "ahhhh, thanks kid." thefiance and i are trying to laugh as quietly as possible. those pancakes tasted like victory. as we are heading back to our condo: &gt;frodo: are they all like that? &gt;me: who? &gt;frodo: everyone you help. &gt;me: no, he's aggravating at best, but he's not the worst i can get. **check my phone** come on, let's go enjoy ourselves for a bit, we have one of the worst ones up later. a pfy is born. *** **imagination is the key to dealing with lusers** today ~12:30pm after a good binge of minecraft, pizza, and grape soda, we head down to the it room for the thin client deployment (that i have to do for someone that couldn't come in due to car trouble) for the condo office. on our way down, i explain what i do know about thin clients to frodo, and what we have to do. frodo is excited, this is something he can finally help with (in his mind anyway, he was tons of help in other places). we get the cart of eight thin clients, and go to the desks. i unhook the old thin client, and hook up the new one. i give frodo a bracelet with the security cable key on it, and threatened him about what should happen if he loses it. he puts it on and says he won't lose it. i watch him set up one, to make sure he sets it up the right way (four cables and a security lock unlock/lock). would you believe that he plugged in every usb cable on the first try every time? i make a mental note to ~~test him for witchcraft~~ ~~take him gambling~~ ask for his secrets later. i finish my half, and am on the phone with the head of it when frodo comes back. &gt;me: can you cancel luser's rdp (it's lunch break anyway) session? i'm not going near her, you know how she is. he agreed and did it, and while luser let out a cry of dismay and ran off, me and frodo got to work. we almost made it. of course, if we did make it, i wouldn't be posting this in here (typing in all caps is tiring, and wrong. just imagine her shrieking, and the text is in caps.) &gt;luser: what are you doing! &gt;me: upgrading your thin client, it has more-- &gt;luser: why? i liked my old one better... &gt;me: i'm just doing what i'm told, and this one has more-- &gt;luser: what about my files? i swear to god, if you lost my files, i will end you. please note that i am dating the owner's niece, and i am probably as bulletproof as you can get. well, as long as i don't break anything important, set anything on fire, etc. &gt;me: these thin clients don't work that way, everything is server based. &gt;luser: no it doesn't. you ruined my files. frodo walks up to the windows. &gt;frodo: actually, thin clients are like this window. **closes the blinds** see, you are logged out. **opens blinds** now you are logged in. see that tree? that's your files. **closes blinds and walks to the window next to that one and closes those blinds** this is another thin client, it is logged out. **opens blinds to that window** see, the tree is still there. i am shocked, i'm standing there with my mouth open. that was pretty accurate, and it.... worked. luser just sat down and stared at her monitor until we left. we're back in the office of it head, and frodo is explaining thin clients again. the it head's reaction was the same as mine. he began furiously taking notes. &gt;frodo: can we head back now, i think our ores are finished macerating. the moment is ruined, and we went back to our minecraft server. *** i've been showing him the insides of a computer since then, and he even put one together (sans processor) under my supervision. he has drank the it koolaid. this kid is eight, and better than most users. i just found out school is cancelled tomorrow too, so i might be back with more then. *** edit: clarification on computer building. edit 2: spelling errors.back in december 2010, when gawker got hacked and their ~1.3 million passwords leaked, i was following the breach and downloaded the file with all the passwords, just to verify that mine wasn't part of the ones released. mine was safe, however, i found around 10 or 20 email addresses belonging to my university with cracked passwords and usernames. i decided that i'd shoot off a quick email to the users involved, hoping that they might at least pay attention to me if only because of the fact that the email would come from a university address. i typed up the below message and sent it out, not expecting to hear anything back but felt good that i might have prevented at least one or two people from having a major security issue. &gt; hey guys, &gt; &gt; i don't know any of you personally, but your name is on the list of compromised gawker passwords. if you haven't already heard the story, go read one of the articles here: or here: long story short, these guys got into gawker and took ~1.3 million usernames &amp; passwords. &gt; &gt; thought i'd pass this on from on [university] student to another. stay safe out there. i got a few scattered emails throughout the next week or so from people thanking me for the heads up, and i figured that was the end of it. fast forward a few weeks - i get an email from the campus post office telling me i have a package to pick up. i know i haven't ordered anything recently, so i have no idea why i'd have a package to pick up. i decided to trek over and see what it was - when i got there they handed me a small box with an amazon label on it. now even more confused, i open up the box to find a white beanie and a gift label with the following message: &gt; hey there! &gt; &gt; i looked your address up on the campus directory - i wanted to give you a little something as thanks for letting me know about the gawker password leak. here's a white hat for a white hat. happy holidays! **tl; dr: random guy gives me a white hat for telling him his password got leaked.**been lurking in the shadows, first time posting. i work at an it help desk for a large company serving as front line it support. i just had this call about an hour ago: &gt; **me:** thank you for calling $company it service desk, this is wiscomptons_finest. how can i help you? &gt; **customer:** hi, i'm having an issue with my account. sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. &gt; **me:** alright, let me take a look at your account. one moment please. from the caller id, i notice he's calling from one of our kiosks we have in public areas. these computers are for production floor employees (who typically don't have their own computers) to access their personal benefits and other information. generally speaking, they're not the most tech savvy of the callers that we get, so it's usually a good idea to remote onto the machine and see *what exactly* they're having an issue with. with his permission, i remote on and see that he is in fact logged into the system. there are no errors, and nothing seems out of the ordinary. &gt; **me:** so what exactly are you having trouble with? from what i can see, everything appears to be fine. &gt; **customer:** well, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. &gt; **me:** what exactly doesn't work? i see that you're signed in and i didn't see any issues with your account when i checked earlier. &gt; **customer:** i have to get back to work now. *uhh... okay.* &gt; **me:** okay, no problem. would you like to give us a call back later when you have some time? i'm still not sure what problem you were having. &gt; **customer:** i don't know, sometimes it doesn't work. i have to go back to work now. bye. i know it's friday, but it feels like a monday...my company does actually hire new employees at times. we have an ironclad rule: *all* work gets saved to the network drives. all computers get everything deleted every two weeks unless you've saved it to a network drive. all new employees are handed a packet of information that they *must* read through and initial after every paragraph that they've read and understood it. this packet is then taken and stored in their personnel file. the information about all work having to be saved on the network drives is one of the things they must read and confirm by initialing that they understand. call comes in yesterday. &gt;"this is jimmy serrano, how may i help you?" &gt;"this is ken hartley reid. i was just hired about two weeks ago. some of my work is gone." &gt;"that shouldn't happen. did you save it to the network drive?" &gt;"no... i saved it only to my local computer." &gt;"there's your issue. you have to save it to the network drive or it gets deleted after two weeks. just like it says in the new employee packet that you read and initialed to confirm you understood everything in it." &gt;"no one reads that! it's all just boilerplate!" &gt;"all the other new employees whose work was all saved to the network drives would disagree. please save all your work to the network drives. goodbye." i don't think ken is going to last.scpa first day on the job: my interaction with scpa here: missed deadlines: should not have sent that email: all good things must come to an end. did i mention scpa had a cell phone? no? well to be fair, up until now it wasn't really relevant. it's relevant now. we basically have 3 different options when it comes to cell phones. option1: we issue a new number on corp plan(number is owned by company) option2: you can use personal phone number, we'll reimburse monthly provided you fill out the forms(you own the number) option3: we agree to assume financial responsibility of your personal cell number and put it on our corporate account and provided we part ways amicably we'll release the number back to you(this is done by those that to us to pay for the number, but don't want to hassle with reimbursement requests.) she went with option 3, signed the byod policy regarding this. it's scpa's last day and she is finishing up doing whatever it is she does, and the cfo stops by: cfo: "at 5pm today, can you please terminate scpa's access to all systems, however we've made an arrangement with her to keep her cell number on our corp account until she is able to get switched over, she has 2 weeks to complete this. during this time she's agreed to answer any questions we may have about anything she was working on" me: "okay" i get her personal account information, formally release the number. all she has to do at this point is contact verizon and the number is hers. i set my calendar. fast forward 2 weeks, i come into the office fire off the email to vzsupport: "please cancel (666)666-6666" if scpa did what she was supposed to, i'll get an email back stating this number isn't on my account and the request can not be completed. vzsupport: "your request has been processed." - oh crap. here we go. about 2 hours later recep: "raven, scpa is on the phone, do you want to talk to her" me: "yup" scpa (from her husband's cell): "my phone isn't working! i'm travelling and i need it" me: "it's been 2 weeks, i was told send the cancellation request. the number has been cancelled" i hear her take a deep breath, i think she's grasping the situation. scpa: "what!?!? you cancelled it, you can't do that, you need to get the number back. i need my phone." me: "sorry, the request was already processed, the number is likely gone" scpa apologetically: "oh no. i will request the transfer today, i didn't realize it had been so long, i'm so sorry, can you get it back" now anyone who has to deal with vz enterprise knows that the consumer vz dept and enterprise vz dept don't exactly play well together. while i could probably get her number reactivated, reauthorize the transfer and she could get it, it would require some additional effort, if not, that number goes back into the pool. so i shoot the cfo an im. me: "scpa never transferred her number and i cancelled it this morning now she is requesting we reactivate so she can get it back. are we under any obligation to do so?" cfo: "no." me: "scpa, yeah, i'm sorry, it's already been processed, not much i can do, you can try to call them and see what they say" scpa: "this can't be, is there any-" huey is now standing at my desk. me:"hang on scpa" -mutes phone huey: "i can't login into sap, when you're done with your call can you help?" me: "sure, give me a sec" unmutes phone. me: "sorry scpa, network's down. i gotta go." - click edit: formatting/words it was slow last night, post 4th partying or something. most of the calls were simple.. "we're doing server updates, your internet will be up by morning." that kind of stuff. then i got this one call... this impatient, incorrigible man. he had an attitude from the get go. after getting what minimal information he would give me, i tried to get his os from him, just in case. he refused. wanted a supervisor because i asked for it, so i dropped it. turns out he can't get online. ok, he's not in the area with the updates. damn it. run a scan, no issues with our network. shit. this is going to suck. so i start asking him what his symptoms are. he can't ping out, or get to the router. ok. let's see..there's no ethernet connection according to the router information i can pull. i verify it's plugged in to both ends, then ask him to do a loopback for me. he grudgingly complies, huffing the whole time and complaining "it's not my computer!" well..both lan ports light up, and flash. i tell him that shows us the router and ethernet cables are working, and at this time i need to know his os, because we need to check something. he throws a fit, tells me i'm being rude and i have a shitty attitude, but complies a little more. (i can say right now, i was being as nice as humanly possible to him since he was being so rude... kill them with kindness, right?) i have him check his device manager. he won't give me any information. i ask him to run ipconfig. won't give me anything. i am trying to explain what we're trying to accomplish, and he asks (screams) for a tech. i tell him, sure, but i need to get approval for one to come out from a supervisor and he needs to accept possible charges because we're unable to finish troubleshooting and if it's not our equipment causing the issue (router, ont) then there's a possible charge "quote price".. aaand he flips out, tells me i have no idea what i'm doing, he needs someone else who doesn't have an attitude and is a... male... ahhh.. that's his issue. i have a vagina. well i tell him i'm just as qualified to help him as anyone else here, if not more (tenure and past positions) and i'm sorry i can't transfer you to anyone else. so he wants a male supervisor. not an issue, because the only overnight female supervisor is on vacation. but, my friend, who i went through training with, is a supervisor on duty tonight and he loves these kind of calls. he takes my headset. repeats everything i did, step by step. he makes the guy reset his router just because, then hey.. it's still not working and no i'm not sending a tech unless we're sure it's our equipment. he gets to where i left off, and has the guy do an ipconfig release and renew. hmm. what do you know...it's working. my friend says "it *was* your computer." the guy apologized to my friend for giving him a hard time, but refused to acknowledge i had been on the right track. tldr: guy can't connect, thinks it our services, won't work with me, admits it's because i'm a female. supervisor takes over call, does exactly what i did, plus what i was about to do, fixes issue.. it was the customers computer at fault. edit: sorry for missing words and stuff, i'm on my phone. edit2: you guys are awesome! the support on here is great. i didn't expect much by posting this, i just wanted to complain about an asshole! also, thanks /u/hiyosilver64 for my first month of reddit gold! a client comes in, buddy of mine, older gentleman. says he can't remember his password. ok, no biggie, let's go through the password reset steps. first question, last 4 digits of your social. no problem, he puts that in. second question, ein number, got it. 3rd and last question, what is the color of your first car? he types in "black and white." "black and white?" i say....puzzled. then ask him, why wouldn't you just put down one color so it's easier to remember? he just shrugs and laughs. i said "ok, try just black" doesn't work. "try just white", nope. "just try random colors", i suggest "green." now it's his turn to look at me puzzled. "green???" he says, totally flabbergasted. i was like "yea, or blue, just try typical colors of cars." "car??? i thought it said cat!" he squints and presses his face up to the monitor. "shit, i need glasses." at this point i'm roaring, "why would it ask you the color of your first cat???" he laughs too, "i don't know! that's why i said black and white and then was confused when you said green!" ah good times, he finally got the color right but that point his account was locked out from trying too many times. we put in a ticket with the system and got it unlocked. i see him almost every day and i'm not going to let him live this one down. a quick tale while i'm on my lunch break. so, i host a minecraft server that me and my friends play on. while i'm not the primary administrator of this server, i do step in when i'm needed. we recently encountered a problem, where the server was pegging a core on the host at 100% usage, and nobody could connect. long story short, i was able to use a java debugger to find the block type causing the issue, but we couldn't connect to remove it. we spent a few hours trying to fix the issue, including loading the world in an external editor (mcedit) to remove the block. nothing worked. then, one of our non-tech savvy users piped up. "umm, don't you guys have a backup?" cue every tech person in the chat room face-palming. between the five of us, nobody had thought to restore from a backup. i mean, this is exactly the reason we have backups, isn't it? yet, nobody thought to use them. so, we restored from a backup, and all was good. the next day, i get a message from one of the users. note that the user could not have known the block they were using was bugged. &gt;**user:** i promise i will try not to fuck up the server again. but i also want to thank you for your hard work last night. &gt;**me:** heh, not that i did anything useful. &gt;**me:** no worries. then, this happened. &gt;**user:** being in it is often a thankless job. just wanted to make sure you knew how much i appreciate that someone was in a position to help. &gt;**user:** and don't say you didn't do much. you put serious effort in and made alot of progress. much more than i did just throwing ideas around. this... this user gets it. and now the world is all blurry. (edit: me fail english? that's unpossible!)although i work in a retail store, my actual job is tech support, so i felt like this would be the proper place for this story. i work for a cell phone provider as an in-store technician. a customer came in today because he couldn't get into his gmail account. this was his 3rd visit to a store for this issue. (i have reset hundreds, maybe even a thousand gmail passwords in the last 5 years doing this job.) i find out that he has 2 step verification enabled on his gmail account and that he wasn't getting the text message verification code from google. i suggest that we try to login to the account on a desktop computer instead. i swing my monitor and keyboard around for him and tell him to sign in. i guess he expected that i was just going to do it for him because he makes a big show about how hard it is to use a keyboard. he says, "this is all foreign to me, i'm used to typing on my phone." he goes on to ask me "how to make a 1?" you hit the button with a 1 on it... he was also using caps lock to capitalize letters. after several attempts, he finally gets the password entered correctly. next step is to enter his cell phone number to send the verification code. this is where it gets tricky. it turns out that whoever set up his gmail account for him, not only enabled the 2 step verification, but also typed his phone number wrong which is why he isn't getting the verification code. he asks me to "call google" and fix it for him. at this point i'm starting to get frustrated with him and i inform him that no, i can't "call google for him." a reasonable person wouldn't expect their cell phone service provider to call google for them because they are locked out of their personal email account. i explained multiple times that i was not going to call google, but did offer to physically dial the number for him so he could talk to them. apparently that wasn't enough because he left in a huff because i "just didn't want to help him." if he hadn't been so lazy in the first place and set up his gmail account himself, he probably wouldn't have been in this mess today. and i do not have sympathy for people who are not willing to do things themselves. i've been reading tfts for a while so i thought i'd give back. i'm not in tech support but i was always better at resolving issues than most lusers, so i was made a power user for my department - not quite helpdesk, but the first line of defence before their first line. you can imagine what a wonderful job that was. so i worked in a government department that dealt with property taxes and employed about 1,100 people. given my elevated status, i was often given the more complicated accounts to manage. this job also required me to run certain quarterly reports. normally, these were fine, except for a set of around 50 accounts. these accounts were for large organisations that rented out property and each account contained several thousand properties to manage under one account. i had to run a report on one of these larger accounts and, after sitting there for a while, the report timed out. this never normally happened, so i called one of the more helpful members of our helpdesk and told them about the timeout issue. they were pretty surprised too. they said that it shouldn't happen and that i should try and run it a few more times until it worked. a little alarm bell began ringing in my head. i felt like a user that has a problem with a print job and was expressly told to hit print another 50 times... so, i dutifully re-ran the report, as instructed, re-running it every 5-10 minutes each time it timed out. while i was waiting for the report to run, i was doing some other paperwork, blissfully ignorant of the chatter around me. slowly, ever slowly, i began to hear more cries of "it's not working again!" or "is it running slow for anyone else?". that alarm bell began ringing a little louder. but the alarm bell was punctuated by the friendly 'beep' of my outlook delivering a priority 1 message to all staff informing them that our system was down. we couldn't take calls from customers, couldn't access accounts...those alarm bells were getting pretty loud. i was just about to lift the handset to call up my friendly tech when i see someone standing in front of my desk. you also know it's not good when you look up to see that it's the head of it...and not just the head of the helpdesk but the *head* of it. &gt; what did you do, and how did you do it... the buttock clenching nervousness that one experiences when you have a clearly peeved executive in front of you is not pleasant. what none of our helpdesk knew was that despite the report timing out on a users machine, it still doesn't kill the process running on the servers. so, each time i re-ran the report, it created a duplicate job running simultaneously. so, half a dozen reports analysing tens of thousands of properties in total, trying to pull back around (at best guess) around 5 million transaction records...oops. it's no wonder i managed to crash the servers. in the end, a reboot and my recommendation of an addition to the report about only allowing accounts with up to 200 properties to be run in real time sorted the problem. head of it was actually pleased that i'd managed to find this issue and help resolve it. now that he knew my name, it actually worked out pretty well and we collaborated on a few projects from then on. my colleagues were pretty pleased they'd managed to get an impromptu 30 minute break too. they were a little disappointed that the helpdesk patched the hole so they couldn't intentionally crash it again. i was able to theorise how we could still do it again and work around the new addition to the report, but i thought it best not to arm the lusers with such a dangerous piece of knowledge... working in a government department, it seems that they employ a higher standard of luser. there's a few more stories of my time there, which i can share if there's any interest.hello again, tfts! necessary background: i work at an isp that handles a lot of traffic from rural america. &gt;thank you for calling [isp], this is uwbw, how can i help you today? "yeah, uh, my modem is broken. i need a new one." hmm. 99% of these calls are actually issues with the outside line, not the modem itself. i'm already prepared to completely dismiss what the customer is going to be telling me for the next 2 minutes as it usually amounts to "my internet is broken because my modem is broken because internet because reasons." instead... "when i plug your modem in, my mouse starts moving on its own." wha-? "the mouse just sort of jitters all over my screen randomly, i can't control it. i turned the modem off, and it stopped." &gt;that's... interesting. have you tried turning it back on? the customer says that they have been too weirded out to power the modem back up, so i tell them to do it for me while we're on call. "hey, would you look at that! no problems anymore. i can control my mouse again!" &gt;that's great! i guess! "hey, and now that the box is back on, my internet works again too! i was going to ask you about that next." facedesk.&gt; **edith**: what did you say???? twas another night at company x and this time the problem was multi-faceted. &gt; **me**: turn it off! then back on! &gt; **edith**: you want me to turn it off and back on? &gt; **me**: yes! &gt; **edith**: okay! (30 seconds later) &gt;**edith**: that worked! thanks! that was one problem solved. the other problem was a bit more persistent. &gt;**me**: anytime! call back if anything else happens! &gt;**edith**: you know i will! yep, she would. edith is one of my more frequent fliers. she was also growing ever more hard of hearing. every so often i could badger the local support people into buying someone a new computer. too bad i couldn't do the same for edith's phone. or could i? edith is an employee of site beta. i'm on good terms with the techs there. perhaps this would be doable after all. so i composed a quick email to the site manager there. hey rob, how's it going? so i just got off the phone with edith and i can't help but notice that she deafer by the day. would it be possible to get her an amplified phone? hearing issues don't generally resolve themselves and it would make it a lot easier for me to help her with her computer. right now i'm having to shout at her like a drill sargaent. -sim a few days later i received a response. hiya sim, yeah, edith is definitely turning the corner on stone deaf. some accomodations have been made for her, but that hasn't been one of them yet. do you know where we could get an amplified phone. it has to be compatible with the new voip system. if you can find a compatible part, i'll pitch it to her boss. so i did a bit of googling and found....nothing. checked amazon. still nothing. then inspiration struck and i called the vendor. &gt;**vendor**: (*yawn*) voip support, this is chrissy, how may i help you? &gt;**me**: hi chrissy, simality here. look, this isn't strictly tech support but maybe you could help anyway...*explained situation* any ideas? &gt;**chrissy**: *(sounding noticably more awake)* hmmm...let me do some research on this and i'll get back to you. i may have to rope one of the engineers in and they've gone home. can i have a callback number? a couple days later i get a call back. &gt;**me**: internal it, this is simality, how may i help you? &gt;**voip support**: yeah, this is tim with voip support. chrissy said you wanted a special phone? &gt;**me**: not for me. one of the people here though. *explains situation*. &gt;**tim**: that's the problem with these phones. they weren't build with this in mind. but i think i've come across this situation before. let me do some research and i'll send you some suggestions. a day later i get a short email. my recommendation is amplified handset for voip phone. part number 123456789. --tim i forwarded the recommendation to rob. one week later (yeah, we do things slow here) i get cc'd on a part request order. guess which part? this was quickly followed by a note from rob. turns out her boss has been trying to get something like this from hr for ages. thanks for your help. --rob. ----------- tl,dr (courtesy of /u/moneytreefifty); fixed phone issue when requests for phone sets for the hard of hearing fell on deaf ears at hr. edit: added tldr 2nd edit: thanks for the gold! 3rd edit: finally fixed formatting.this is a personal story, stemming from my brilliant aunt who is a want to be technical genius. first, some background: my cousin (19 yrs old) and her have the same cell phone, the gs2. they are up for contract renewal at the end of december/beginning of january, so they will be getting new phones at that point. now the story: aunt sits down beside me: biohazard, can you **believe** that cousin has used up 75% of his data already?!? me: okay, so what? i use around that amount. it resets on a monthly basis, so don't worry too much as your new billing date is today. aunt: no! that's not how my plan works!! i have x amount of data (she couldn't remember how much) for the entire 2 year duration of my plan!! can you believe he managed to use 75% of it?! i've never used that much and i'm always on facebook and twitter!!!! me: no, that's not how they set up plans, and if that's how yours is you've been screwed. check your phone bill next month, and you'll likely see everything is fine. her: well, whatever, this is stupid. i can't wait to get us new phones in a couple of months so this doesn't happen again! me: um, this could happen again on your new phone (gs4)... it works the same on the data plan that your current phone does. her: no! because then he'll have more space on his phone and we won't reach 75% again! at this point i ask to see my cousins phone, navigate into the phones storage settings and see that he's reached 80% of his internal capacity. my aunt is still convinced she's going to get charged overages. **tl;dr - not-so-technical aunt thinks my cousin has used 75% of his data, he's used 80% of his internal storage** edit: technical termhello, obligatory first time poster, long time lurker, etc. some background: i work as an it manager for a large private jet catering company, as well as head tech for my high school (i'm a senior in hs), so i often have to leave class to answer tickets briefly. anyway, this tale comes from the catering company. to preface this even further, all of the computers at the company have been custom built. they're not anything crazy with graphics cards or anything like that, but they're certainly a step up from the hp computers from best buy or something. anyway, so my day is just getting started, and i receive a ticket that says "ram fell out, computer won't turn on". immediately, red flags go off for various reasons. i walk over, and this is how the conversation goes: $skull: &gt;so the ram fell out? what were you possibly doing? $smartypants: &gt;i decided to try and upgrade this work station, so i bought my own ram to replace the stuff in here. i look to see multiple sticks of ram laid out on the desk and the computer turned on its side, with the side cover off. i confiscate the replacement ram, tell him that the ones we have in the pcs are fine, and why did he do this? $smartypants: &gt;my station was having issues, and i determined it to be the ram after reading somethings online, so i tried to replace it as i didn't want to bother the it department. so after hearing this, i replace the ram in the machine, and boot it up. before the os loads, i spam the the "delete" key to enter the bios to make sure this tech savvy user didn't try to screw around with any settings. after realising what key i was pressing and he grabs my hand and pulls it away from the computer and says: $smartypants: &gt;what are you doing? quit trying to delete my computer, i have important files on there! edit: for visibility, some have (and fairly so, i certainly don't mind answering questions) doubted the legitimacy of several aspects of this situation, so let me clear those up. i've responded to several comments, but i'm putting it here for visibility. on the subject of a work schedule, i only go to class 1 hour a day, as i only need one more credit to graduate hs. i applied to this company to start as just a regular in the department, and after the previous manager quit, i had been working just over a year and a half, and could dedicate more time to my job. that, and combined with having past degrees of leadership in the past (marching band!) i was given the position of manager. i used the term confiscate rather poorly, and for that i apologise. i was trying to convey that i removed the user brought in ram from the picture. i gave it back to him a he did technically own it, but i of course told him not to try and put it in any work computer again. a while before i started working, the company invested very heavily in a server overhaul, and 70% of that money went to it, but our rather tech knowledgeable boss approached the previous it manager and asked for a sort of "bulk" parts list for computers to replace the older dell machines that were previously in use. the department ordered parts for 50 of these new "customish" pcs, as those were all that were needed at the time. the company has since grown to about 175, and the machines are mixed between the older dell machines, the previously ordered pcs, and varied other off the shelf computers that had to be hastily bought to accommodate employees. we divvy up the computers by basically having highly essential jobs operate on the better computers. in this specific case, i was dealing with an ordered pc. to address previous question posting: i will admit that they are basic, but they come from several places. some of them are for my personal use at home, some are just legitimately lack of knowledge, as in the business, it's my belief that it's not necessarily the info you know, but more so how to obtain the information. sometimes questions are asked because i want to verify the process of doing something or making sure it is an actual issue. lastly, i'm not on some crazy fixed salary as a senior, i'm still technically paid by the hour. some background: cellular internet devices don't have unlimited data usage in canada me: hello, your on the phone with drewgarr from tech,how can you help me waste my life today cust: i just saw my bill and there is no way i have used 74 gigs. me: i understand. let's see if we can figure this out. do you mind telling me what devices you have connected to modem?

(and they all have nicknames, of course.) his latest aquisition was one of the latter - super expensive, super sleek, and capable of flying up to insane heights. we all ooh-ed and ahh-ed as he made it circle above our heads and track our movements as we ran ahead of it. however, when we were heading back in, drone pilot (dp) pulled me aside. &gt;dp: empressharuhi, you live at &lt;address&gt;, yeah? just up the hill? &gt;me: uh, yeah? why, planning to break in? &gt;dp: nope, but i need your help with something. when you go home for lunch, put on your &lt;company&gt; shirt and go onto your balcony, okay? &gt;me: alright, but if what you're doing turns out to be illegal, i'm blaming you for everything. two imporant things to note, here - i lived a very short walk away from the company, in a tall apartment building, and our comapny shirts were bright orange. so, when i returned home on my lunch break, i put on my shirt, and went to stand on the balcony as requested. after five minutes of staring at the building across from mine, trying to determine if the lady on the seventh floor really had painted her walls that shade of magenta, i was startled by a loud whirring, and looked down almost in time to get smacked in the face by dp's newest drone. &gt;me: what the hell?! a beep from my phone signaled a text from dp. &gt;dp: (via text) walk from one end of the balcony to the other! as i did so, the drone continued to hover just beyond the railing, tracking the bright orange of my company shirt. &gt;dp: (via text) now go onto the roof! i ducked back inside, and climed the stairs to our buildings roof, a good 15 stories above the ground. as i emerged, i was once again greeted by the whirring of the drone, bouncing through the air before me like an excited (and noisy) white puppy. &gt;dp: (via text) now run around again! i want to see what range i can get! lets see if we can draw a snowman with the gps! for the rest of the afternoon, i got to run around my building's roof and parking lot, making patterns, chasing the drone, and generally having a fantastically good time "testing" the new drone with dp. upon returning, exausted, to my apartment, i was startled by a whirr-tap-tap on my balcony window, and opened it to find the drone, hovering before me, with a note taped to it's front: &gt;my new nickname is &lt;my real first name&gt;! thank you for playing with me today! **tl;dr: techo puppy wants to play!** ___________ **edit: for those wondering about battery life, yes, we did take breaks to swap out and charge batteries, it wasn't one continual flight.**recently i have gotten a new job as a technician. about a few days into the job i had a situation where a guy brings in his laptop because it blue screens on startup. its no big deal since his data was backed up and a reimage didn't take that long. while i was documenting the incident my trainer was there watching me making sure i did everything right. i was typing in "bsod on startup" when i was stopped. trainer: " you can't put that in" me: "what do you mean? it was a bsod." trainer: "i know but you have to use blsc" me: "ok, thats kinda odd. is bsod used for something else" trainer: "no thats not the case. even though bsod is a standard industry term, some manager over at the west cost was offended at the words 'of death'. so it became company policy to use the term blsc." me: "you are kidding me" trainer: "no, i agree its the dumbest fucking thing ever" update1: blsc stands for blue screen. its bsod without the death update2: i am keeping my job. one little thing like blsc is not going to ruin it. ltl, ftp, and all that. (i'm also new to posting to reddit.) as many others here i don't actually work in tech support, i just help with family and friends. this happened a few days ago. my family just moved in a new house and we don't yet have internet service. coincidentally, my brother accidentally deleted all the music on his phone. i will be $me and my brother will be $brother. &gt;**$brother**: hey, my music's gone. &gt;**$me**: let me take a look. *brother's music is gone, need to redownload. but, as i said before, we have no internet at home.* &gt;**$me**: ok. your music's gone, when we get internet i'll turn on wifi from my computer and you can download the music. &gt;**$brother**: ok *that evening* &gt;**$brother**: hey can you turn on your wifi thing so i can download my music &gt;**$me**: sorry, no can do. remember we still don't have internet. &gt;**$brother**: oh, you need internet for that? *facepalm*[previous]( i sat staring down at the screen assembly that the vp was slowly easing onto the pda in front of him. &gt;vp: so the orientation is this way up, correct? &gt;me: yep. you could just let me handle this. my back was aching from leaning forward to watch the vp trying to repair pda’s for over an hour. &gt;vp: no, i want to learn. it’s my project after all, i should know the fundamentals. the vp smiled away as he slowly tried to push the parts together, every slight resistance he would stop and re-evaluate. it was taking forever. &gt;me: would you like me to show you again? i held my demonstration pda in hand, pressing the pieces together firmly and ignoring the snaps of plastic that indicated it was firmly in place. &gt;vp: no, no. thanks, but maybe just watch, you’ve years of training behind you. you know you’re not going to break it. &gt;me: you won’t break it. it just needs a little more force to clip in. &gt;vp: my problem is i don’t have your years of experience yet, so i have to take it a little slow. gentle. &gt;me: it won’t ever go in unless you just press down. i reached out to grasp his screen assembly and push it down firmly, however the vp pulled it away sharply. &gt;vp: see airz? this is why we need a team building weekend. we need to learn to trust each other. let me go at my own pace. i sighed heavily and sat back in my chair as the vp continued to daintily press upon the screen, never committing to an actual press. &gt;vp: speaking of, are you excited? a whole three days off work! &gt;me: oh, … yes? you mean the team building exercise? &gt;vp: it should be fun, everyone camping out together, with activities and delicious food. &gt;me: wait… what? camping? the vp smiled and looked up. he loftily held his half assembled pda in hand. i was tempted to reach out in fix it myself. &gt;vp: don’t worry. we’re in cabins not tents. &gt;me: i thought it was just a day thing? &gt;vp: no, no. we’re going to (place far away). &gt;me: executive is going on a camp? an actual, stay out of town/city camp. the vp nodded his head vigorously. i tried to swallow my rising panic. the vp gave the screen a slightly stronger tap a small snap could be heard as a connector clicked into place. &gt;vp: ahhh! &gt;me: it’s okay. that;s the sound its meant to make. after a few screws in the back and face plates reattached the vp held aloft his reassembled pda. i smiled as he powered it on, grateful at the chance to finally leave. unfortunately the screen did not display the manufactures logo as expected, in its place was a giant crack across the screen. &gt;vp: oh darn. i think i put the broken screen back in. i must have got muddled. &gt;me: that’s okay, its exactly the same process with a broken or non-broken screen. do you think you’ve got it? vp nodded. i got up from my chair happy to finally be able to leave. &gt;vp: no, no. don’t go. i haven’t even fixed **one** yet. i watched as the vp started un assembling the pda. he reached for the screwdriver &gt;vp: like you told me before… lefty loosey, righty tighty. which left was it again? my mind chanted *“he’s trying to learn, he’s trying to learn, he’s trying to learn”*, it became my mantra, to keep me sane. [next](so back when i was working first line support, i got lots and lots of fun calls. one of them went like this. &gt;me: welcome to the service desk, this is mustibrust speaking! &gt;$randomofficeguy: hi, i can't connect to the servers. &gt;me: oh, okay, does it give you an error message or something? &gt;$rog: no, it just doesn't connect. &gt;me: okay. have you checked that your pc is properly connected to the network? &gt;$rog: yes yes, everything is plugged in. &gt;me: okay. is it only you with this problem, or is anyone else affected? &gt;$rog: no, it's just me i think. so i start doing some tests, and find i can't ping his workstation. i ask him again to check his cables, but he says they appear to be properly connected. suddenly, his machine starts responding to pings again. &gt;me: hey, it seems i can reach your machine now. did anything happen? &gt;$rog: yeah, the power came back on. &gt;me: *strangles myself with the headset cord* edit: headset don't make music. edit2: for clarification, he was using a laptop in a docking station, so his computer was running. nothing else was, though. one of the first rules of consulting is that you _never_ give free advice. even if you know the answer, you make the potential client wait until they’ve signed a contract. one of the rules of being a decent human being is that you never let a fellow techie spin around uselessly. sometimes these rules come into conflict. usually professionalism wins over human weakness, but this is a story about going the other way. jeanette is a fellow techie at big sprawling organization (bso). bso has a reputation for being a good place for techies to make their bones, but it has a reputation for a kafkaesque bureaucracy, technical debt and legacy stuff going back years. i’m supposed to meet jeanette and hang out for a few hours, but she’s stuck in a dilemma. she’s stuck between a few different policy requirements: 1. data must be classified according to its sensitivity. 2. sensitive data must be encrypted if it leaves bso’s control. 3. if the data doesn’t have a classification, it’s to be treated as sensitive until determined otherwise. 4. data older than the document retention policy must be securely destroyed. 5. obsolete and unrepairable it components are to donated to a specific recycling company that makes no guarantees about security. jeanette wants to clean out a pc graveyard in a basement. a gamma minus checkbox checker in compliance issued an edict to comply with the rules above: jeanette will mount each drive, encrypt the contents and ship them to the recyclers, where they may be destroyed or re-used. of course, once mr. checkbox checker has made their ruling, they are routing phone calls to voice mail and email to /dev/null. so, jeanette cannot enjoy coffee with me. instead, she’s got to beg/borrow/steal every ide-&gt;usb adapter and go through a wall of systems. i bring two go-cups of coffee and meet her in the basement. she’s perturbed by a daunting amount of pointless work, but the great compliance has spoken, or at least mumbled incoherently. i see an obvious solution. me:”this has to be be the dumbest shit i’ve heard this week.” jeanette:”i know. i’m going to be catching up for weeks” me:”no. no. i need three things and this problem is solved: we need an intern, a maul and a philips screwdriver” jeanette:” if compliance thought we could just destroy the hard drives, don’t you think they would have mentioned it?” me:”of course not. if a bureaucrat has a choice between them doing work considering the problem or you doing work fixing a problem, they’ll pick you every time.” jeanette (looking at me sideways, like she knows i’m going to say something crazy):”but we can’t just recycle the drives” me: “we’re going to recontextualize the problem. hard drives containing data must be encrypted before they go to the outside vendor. but aluminum scrap, well, is just aluminum scrap. it doesn’t contain data. “ jeanette is looking at me with a worried look as i rummage around and pull out two steel cased desktop pcs, which i place on the ground about 3 inches apart from one another. me:”jeanette, trust me. clients of mine with tons of hipaa data have approved this. if you get arrested, i’ll represent you. we can do it ourselves, but this is really a learning experience for an intern.” jeanette:”sigh. fine.” jeanette leaves me alone in this basement. i look around and find an 18” screwdriver that looks like its only purpose has been to open and stir cans of battleship gray paint. i also find a fist sized hunk of steel with a very nice heft. jeanette returns with sanjay, an eager, young it intern. she’s found him a white lab coat, safety goggles and a philips screwdriver. me:”sanjay, do you know why you’re here?” sanjay:”i think so” me:”there’s the task at hand, and there’s some stuff to learn. follow this procedure exactly. first, place the drive between the two pcs.” sanjay:”ok.” me (putting the big ugly screwdriver on the casing of the hard drive):”second, place the tool halfway between the spindle and the edge of the platters.” sanjay:”ok” i raise the hunk of steel above my head. i wait a second then shriek: ”ia! ia! c’thulhu fhtagn!”, then drive the screwdriver through the hard drive . jeanette looks annoyed with me, and sanjay seems startled. i pull the drive off the screwdriver and shake the drive. the platters are clearly shattered. me:”sanjay, there are a three lessons you should learn from this exercise if you want to be an it professional. one- there are rules for a reason. two- knowing when to bend the letter of the rules to follow the reason behind the rules is the mark of a professional.” sanjay:” and the third?” me:”when you can, have fun doing it” jeanette and i left sanjay to his work. as we walked back to her work area, she asks one question: jeanette:”did you have to do that?” me:”i figured a pentagram might be offensive” i asked an old coworker if he remembered any good stories from our time as small network admins so i could share with reddit. he said "remember that time you came back to the shop bleeding and muddy and said you didn't want to talk about it? it's time to talk about it." it began innocently enough. i received a call from one of the sales team about a new client who needed an initial assessment of their network and pcs. this was a new(ish) japanese restaurant in a declining part of town. this restaurant was the only business still afloat in a much larger building that once held a movie theater and some sort of shipping warehouse. i walked in, introduced myself to the nice korean couple who owned the place, and got to it. as i got down to business i was informed all the previous tech work was done by the next door neighbor's son. i took this to mean "we're used to paying $10 and a plate of chicken and rice for tech support." i was not surprised to find a lot of work to do, but nothing out of the ordinary. the first complaint was the point of sale machine. it was unusually slow even considering the lackluster hardware. i could not bring it down as they were still checking out the last of the lunch "rush". so i brought up msconfig and decided to see what i could disable and turn off. i remember going to the startup tab and thinking "wow, what a bunch of crap!" scrolling down... "holy cow!!!" scrolling down... ok, we're turning everything off and instead looking for what needs to be turned back on. after this it was working better but still needed some deep cleaning or a reformat. for some reason the internet was still dodgy. i pulled up a command prompt and did a continuous ping to google.com and let that run for a few minutes. when i came back i found high latency and lost of lost packets. no big deal, we'll try to reboot the router and modem and see if that helps. so i asked what i considered a simple question "where is your router and modem?" to which i received in answer a puzzled smile. they were not sure what i was talking about as they had only recently moved from dial up. ok, time to switch gears. "who is your isp?" no idea. "who do you pay for internet access?" nobody. apparently they used to pay for internet access, but the teenager set them up with free internet. big red flag was raised. this just got slightly interesting. i tried following the network cable but it disappeared into a hole in the floor. similar story in the back office with the accounting machine. so i tried to log into the router and at least get an idea of what i was looking for. i encountered the dd-wrt password prompt. that's cool. i prefer tomato myself, but we've got a tinkerer. a tinkerer who thinks it's a good idea to change the default password for lan access (why???). i point out the network cable to the owner and ask him if he knows where it goes. as he looked at me the room grew dark and foreboding. it got noticeably colder. "the crawlspace. i'm not sure what that cable goes, but he took a whole box of cable into the crawlspace and then we had internet." "ok, can i call him?" i asked. "no, he's gone off to college. that's why we hired you." a second later i'm standing in front of an open trap door in the floor behind the stock room, shining my flashlight into a dark void. there is a dirt floor and it smells. an old stepladder is there, but i don't trust it and just jump in with tools and laptop case in hand. my first thought was surprise at how big it was. my flashlight didn't reach the far two walls. it was a forest of concrete footings and steel supports. there was a lot of power conduit and water pipes to duck under, but for the most part you had about 6 feet to stand up. it stunk like death and decay. i found the two network cables and an extension cord and start off on my trek. do you remember the aliens movie (i forget which one) where the guy is following candles in the dark hallways and there are monsters stalking him. this is what it felt like. i tell myself that it can't be that far because extension cords are only so long. at the end of the cord is another plugged into it, then another plugged into that one. ok, well at least they can't run cat5 cable longer than 300 feet. it's quiet and stinks worse all the time. i keep thinking i hear something or multiple somethings moving around. eventually i see green leds ahead of me and find a small network switch. the two network cables from the pcs plug into the switch which is powered by the extension cord, and another cable continues onwards. my only hope of a 300 feet max was dashed. i had always thought i was the type to keep a cool head in an emergency. i didn't think i was the type to panic. well, i learned something new about myself a few score feet beyond that switch. as i continued to recall every scary movie i had ever seen i shone my light ahead and saw two glowing yellow eyes looking back perhaps 30 feet away. a chill ran up my spine and the hairs on my arms stood up. something in my head snapped and an ancient, primal part of me took over. for reasons i still don't understand i hunched over and screamed into the silent darkness "an alligator!!!" and just like that it became real in my mind. a 20 foot alligator with long teeth faced me. like a pudgy uncoordinated ninja i grabbed my screwdrivers, punch tool, and wire crimp and threw them at the eyes. and then i ran, screaming like a little girl. i must have hit my head in my disgraceful retreat because i ended up with a small cut and blood in my hair. i got back to the stepladder and found they had closed the door! what kind of monster would close somebody into a pit of alligators like that? i threw it open and jumped out in a single leap. i found myself face to face with the waitress who screamed. i screamed back at her. the owner rushed in and looked me over with great concern. i managed to compose myself and said "she startled me. i think i bumped my head, may i use your restroom?" i splashed cold water in my face and was ashamed of myself. an alligator? really? here where we have more snow days than warm ones? it was likely a stray cat and i might have just killed it. so i am back in the hole retracing my steps. i keep telling myself i'm not afraid, but i still wish i had my 22 target pistol in hand. i get to the switch and then beyond it my tools scattered over a large area. the slot head screwdriver had blood on it, which frankly amazed me that i actually hit the poor creature in my panic. so with the bloody screwdriver in one hand and a flashlight in the other i continued my search for that modem. at the far wall i found the router. standard linksys blue box zip tied to something holding it up. and nothing else, no modem. how in the heck were they getting internet? i plugged in and tried again to guess the password without luck. then, remembering some of the features of dd-wrt, i checked for open wireless signals of which there were two from establishments on the other side of the road. so my best guess is the teenager had bridged the router to one of those open wireless connections and thus provided free internet for the restaurant. i power cycled the device (which didn't help at all) and went back. i must have been a sight. the owner quickly agreed with my suggestions and promised to call the local cable company come install their own internet tomorrow. i was ushered out the back door without even a glass of water. we kept that contract, but the restaurant owner requested a different tech be assigned as he was not sure about me. i did not complain. imagining he must have heard me screaming and crying under his restaurant and then screaming at his cute waitress, i really didn't want to face him again.today i tell the tale of a user in peril an emergency indeed, if we are not careful they phoned me up in a panic indeed "i deleted all my pictures, the wrong button i have keyed" further questioning revealed the recycle bin was empty this might or could actually be an issue, maybe? "don't worry", i cried ready to man action stations "i'll pop down in a mo' and we'll sort this situation" down i hurried thinking to myself in puzzlement did the user confirm a permanent deletement? in i went to see the user in a panic i sat down at the desk, ready to get at it of course i immediately see the fix and solve it with a mere two clicks "but how?" he asks, bemusement abound "i'm sure it was gone, i even clicked around" as i left the room, i paused, turned and said "you deleted the library, the thing that points at it" so my readers when issues happen and it gets in your head just remember users always lie, even if they don't know it. **** edit:spellingworking in a medical office, we're required to wipe all data off of a hard disk before we can dispose of it. even though we access all our information through rdp, so nothing is stored locally. but whatever, if i have to do it, i may as well have some fun. [this is how i do it.]( to explain for non-medical people. yes that's an mri machine. yes the disks are practically floating on a single corner. no the oxygen tank is not magnetic as it's designed to be used inside an mri room. no i did not take my camera into the room, but zoomed in from the doorway which explains the crappy quality. yes the windows behind the machine are still shielded so there is no interference.so this happened quite some time ago, so all of this is well behind me, but it was quite nerve-wracking at the time! i was 18 and had taken a low-level tech support job at a local branch of $massivecorporation for the summer before university. my responsibilities were primarily for restructuring data files, but i also helped out with basic software support for people that didn't want to bother raising a proper it support ticket. word got around that i was a useful dogsbody, and eventually i'd get calls about hardware issues as well - usually just turn thing off and turn it back on again. one day i get a call from $alice from $department. i'd never met $alice or even heard of $department before (i don't even have access to that floor), but my number had somehow made it to her. $alice was an accountant a few floors above me, but she had a frantic issue with one of the printers. i start going through my usual troubleshooting spiel, but she cuts me off and explains that it have been there and replaced the printer twice before and can't find any electrical fault. she explains that she's getting electric shocks when she touches this printer, and it happened with the previous two printers as well, and it people must have wired it wrong and she can't go back to them and she can't use the printer and wants me to come fix it. she seems very worked up. i begin to suspect i know what's happening, but i want to be sure, so i ask her '*may i ask, what sort of shoes are you currently wearing?*'. $alice replies '**...what?**' and i repeat '*what sort of shoes..*' but she just hangs up. bit odd, but i get back to my data files and quickly forget about it. about two weeks later, my boss comes to me furiously and tells me i have to attend a disciplinary meeting the next day and that i ought to spend the rest of the day packing up my stuff (not that i had any) and getting my files in order. going into this meeting, i have absolutely **no** idea what this is about. i know that my data work was kinda slow, but i didn't think it was that time-sensitive, i'm 18 and this is first 'real' job and i'm terrified. my boss is there, my boss' boss ($bob) is there, and the head of hr. $bob goes through a long speech about how at $massivecorporation, they take sexual harassment in the workplace *very* seriously and that hr is going to interview all of my colleagues about me and that they expect me to fully comply with whatever action they deem necessary and how this might affect my university applications and future career. i nervously stutter out that i have no idea what they're talking about, and the head of hr explains that this is about a 'lewd phonecall'. i *still* have no idea, and my boss bursts out '*you're saying you've never called $department?!*' i then finally remember $alice, and then explain that she called me about an issue with the printer. hr asks if i recall making lewd remarks, i say that i don't, but i explain that i was asking about her shoes because i suspected that she was building up static charge, insulated by her shoes (if they had rubber soles or some such), and she was discharging when she touched the printer - and experiencing an 'electric shock'. my boss asks why she'd called me rather than it, and i explain the whole thing about how i help out with tech support sometimes. they ask me to leave and talk amongst themselves. i don't hear anything more about this for days, i've not been told that i've been fired (and i'm still being paid), so i nervously turn up to work every day. eventually i see a company-wide e-mail about 'it support policies' reminding all employees that it support issues must be raised by the ticketing systems, and that 'outside support' will no longer be tolerated. i'm only there for a few more weeks after, and my boss acts as if nothing had ever happened and i never hear about it ever again. edit: i've had many years now to think about this, it kinda shook me up for a long time afterwards, even after i graduated i was worried that there was some sort of 'permanent file' that'd crop up when i was applying for jobs and i haven't really told anyone about this. i maybe should have said it differently, explained why i was asking about her shoes before i did, or something. i was never really angry with $alice for the misunderstanding, but i am kinda angry that there wasn't anyone in the meeting 'on my side'. i now work for a small company, and i'm quite distrustful of layers of corporate hierarchy. me again! 2nd post now, and proud! i work for an appliance manufacturer booking engineers for domestic appliances and providing tech support for customers, and today i got a pretty p****d customer on the phone. for reference, we're uk based. it went a bit like this: &gt; me: good afternoon, your through to helpful person, what can i do for you today? &gt; cust: hello, i've been passed around a lot and now i just want to get this sorted. &gt; me: okay, i'm sorry about the inconvenience, what exactly is the issue you've been having? &gt; cust: i've got an appliance at a holiday home in italy that's broken, and i need to get it repaired, but no one seems to know what they're doing with this. &gt; me: okay, unfortunately i think there's been some sort of mix up, we don't deal with appliances outside of the uk, you'd have to speak to our engineering company in italy to get the problem sorted. &gt; cust: this is what i keep being told, but the fact is that you produce the machine and should get this resolved! &gt; me: i can certainly agree that we need to sort it, however we don't send out our engineers to outside the uk, nor can we book any of the engineers in italy because the systems are not interlinked. you need to speak to the call centre in italy to get this resolved. &gt; cust: (now quite shouty) but they don't speak english! you should be booking this repair because i'm and english speaking customer! this is awful customer service, i'm going to post this all over facebook about how bad your company is and why no one should buy your appliances. *click* tl,dr: customer think we give awful customer service because italians don't all speak english.you don't know you don't have a computer? yesterday..i sold a monitor, keyboard + mouse, and speakers to a guy. figured he would go home and hook it up to his computer no problem..i get a call this morning, 7:30 a.m., guy is telling me he can't hook up the mouse or keyboard to anything. i tell him keep looking, usb is a universal application and there will be a port. he insists there is nothing, so i end up going to his house to see what the problem is. i look at the stuff i sold him, look for the computer to hook it up to, and soon realize what the problem is........the guy doesn't have a computer. anyways, explained it to him in the most respectful manner possible, and ended up selling him a dirt cheap desktop. gave him a really good deal because honestly..i felt a little bad. [**part 1 here**]( *target : trevor wanted for: sabotage of end-user equipment, history of terrible work and stupid questions. objective: terminate before end of shift. time left: 74 minutes.* with the mission parameters clearly defined, i get to work. first step is to call the subcontractor's batphone, i could end this in minutes if i got ahold of the floor manager there and explain the situation. of course, nobody answers, because it can't be that easy. check his boss' schedule, been gone for well over an hour. i *could* just send an email and let them sort it out tomorrow, but that would fall short of the mission parameters! sure there's the angry customer, but mostly if you want to be an epic waste of my time, i *want the kill*. &gt; systems: "systems." &gt; /u/bytewave: "hey again, systems. i got the info i needed, this time i have a login for you; trevor. this subcontractor has voluntarily and repeatedly compromised the service of a end-user, and it's ongoing, as you'll see if you look at the logs you sent me. can't reach their floor. given a customer is affected by this right now, can you shut down his station and disable his system and diagtools logins?" &gt; systems: "well yeah, but i need a manager's authorization." &gt; /u/bytewave: "yeah well mine left. i can fetch an entry-level suit&amp;tie if we must, but this is time-sensitive, and you're the guy who sent me the evidence. 6 hours, averaging 25 manual resets per hour. i listened to their call, it was *bad*, and he purposely avoided logging it in remedy before starting his reset-vendetta. this moron is done." &gt; systems: "hey, all you gotta say is that your manager approves and i'll do it. i just need a name to put in the file." i was grateful but also a bit disappointed. just need a name, really? no written authorization? with systems this lax, any half-decent social engineer could have the building metaphorically collapsing on us in ten minutes, if not the network. &gt; systems: "alright, this trevor is locked out. how does this play out now, if you didn't reach anyone over there?" &gt; /u/bytewave: "seems their management can't pick up their phone but i have other options, all good... hey, systems?" &gt; systems: "lima charlie." &gt; /u/bytewave: "what's your name?" &gt; systems: "gregory." &gt; /u/bytewave: "thanks for your help, gregory. i'm adding you to my [in-house instant messenger], if you need something from the tech senior line, don't hesitate." was a good deal. we need them more often than they need us. numbers and contact infos are one of the most precious weapons in my arsenal. everyone has a list of phone numbers. every department they're *supposed* to interact with, emergency contacts, stuff like that. i like to go deeper. cellphone numbers of executives i have no reason to interact with directly, just in case? okay, plenty of people like to collect that. the number of every single security desk in every building we own or that works for us? now, that's not anywhere on the intranet. &gt; /u/bytewave: "bytewave, senior staff at [isp]. this is a time-sensitive call. given we were unable to reach managers, systems has just disabled access of one of your company's employees; trevor. we have hard evidence that trevor was repeatedly sabotaging a end-user's equipment. his ability to damage the network has already been contained on our end. he *will* be fired in short order, but for now, it's critical that you ensure no physical..." &gt; zealous underpaid security; "i get it. going in now. crap hats, move!!" never quite understood that, that's military terminology for second-tier british parachutists, extremely weird to hear that from an hired gun in canada, but whatever works i guess... and again, grateful for unexpected cooperation, but what the fuck. teach the guards *something* about social engineering. *i wasn't even id'd, a random john doe with the number could have called this in!!* within a minute, their security was all over trevor. i'm told he was calling systems from the lab to figure out what was wrong with his computer and that some security kid actually drew a taser on him - thankfully didn't fire - for zero reasons. 'hey why not, some guy we don't know told the boss he was a bad guy?' ... he was then 'temporarily taken to a secure room'. almost like they were all padding their resumes to apply for city police. after this went down, the floor manager was suddenly a lot more interested in answering the batphone. &gt; floor manager: "but that can't be done without telling us first!" &gt; /u/bytewave: "when you don't answer your batphone and a customer's service is being actively sabotaged? looks like it can be done. i'll cc you on the report i'll be sending to his manager, mine and our subcontractor quality director. it'd be nice if we had a reply confirming termination before the latter sees it." ah, the sqd. this guy is betrothed to his blackberry, he'll know all about this before everyone else. given his title and his job, his informal nickname is 'oxym'. because his title and his entire job description is an oxymoron, and also rhymes with his first name. the floor manager was immediately cooperative after he merely heard the title. as usual. it's practically cheating. almost done, but i still had a guy on hold. &gt; /u/bytewave: "hey, thc, you enjoyed your half hour break?" &gt; thc: "huh, has it been that long?" &gt; /u/bytewave: "yep, but that's alright. problem was caused by the previous guy... subcontractor was resetting the modem. i'd say it was an half hour well spent, he's being terminated. we can't tell the customer that - explain the 2 minutes resets issue is solved with minimal details and schedule a service call for saturday am for the rf issue." &gt; thc: "hah, seriously? he was doing it like, on purpose?" &gt; /u/bytewave: "yep, i know, right? *you got to have absolutely zero professional ethics to work like that...."* &gt; thc: "heh heh, yeah that's fucked up. alright i got the rest, thanks for the assist. see you, man." the story of the subcontractor who reset a modem 150 times in 6 hours and how he was ultimately effectively fired in a secure room before his manager even knew about it eventually became public knowledge within the company, but thankfully the few who knew all the details never revealed my name. i didn't want that kind of fame - polarizing figures can't get anything done. ultimately, just a bucket of water in the sea, but we take what victories we can get. *mission complete!* [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](i was relatively new as a union representative at my telco. i was sitting in a room where i was certain a union employee was getting fired. the department director, his manager, a new manager, the union vp, the employee and myself were there. the employee's official sin was using 'company time' to improve the intranet. they had been on his ass for awhile because he did not meet their performance targets. but it wasn't ill intent or lazyness, the guy just had a hard time to strictly adhere to procedure and statistics if he believed he had a better way to do things. and he did. he spent a few hours rewriting code for the company's intranet and shared his results with many of his colleagues, essentially creating a better 'shadow intranet'. union staff loved his work, it was a clear step up over the crappy intranet we used back then. but for his direct manager, it was a great opportunity to pull the plug on a guy who didn't make the 'performance targets' (something they can't fire anybody for under our work contract) by underlining he had spent employment time doing something not ordered to by management. (something they can fire you for.) &gt; director: "so we have ample evidence of misuse of company time - the facts are not even in question, as per the logs. we are terminating employment on time theft grounds, effective immediately. as per the work contract, the union is now free to voice objections if they believe there is cause to do so." usually, this is only something they say because they have to. but that day, the new manager in the room - sekou - was the first to speak. he had nothing to do with the union and he was a relatively new corporate hire, didn't even have his citizenship papers in canada yet, a fresh immigrant from gabon, africa. he was hired by the corporation due to extensive experience both as a system administrator and a manager back in gabon, but nobody truly noticed him until that day. sekou was quiet and effective. nobody had any problems with him back then. management saw him as useful, the union saw him as balanced and neutral. &gt; sekou: "before we get to that, we have to look at the improvements to the intranet. three people on my team came out to say they made their work easier and more efficient, and i agree. i don't know why we'd punish this employee for improving the..." &gt; director: "come with me sekou, let's speak outside for a moment." we never knew for sure what they spoke of outside, but it's pretty obvious. if you don't toe the line and you are non-union staff, the hammer will fall down almost instantly. the next day, we knew he was 'leaving to pursue new challenges' - aka, politely fired. i was having lunch with the same union vp when our cellphones beeped with confirmation this was happening. &gt; bytewave: "it's not the first time he stood up for union staff. he successfully argued before in front of the whole management team that multiple of their policies ensured workers could not reach the upper echelons of [maslow's pyramid]( clearly he had spent quite a bit of time studying the concept and cared about it deeply. some union staff nicknamed sekou as 'maslow' ever since." the union vp was curious and so i explained at length. sekou (correctly) believed the company was overly focused on productivity and that it harmed employees' ability to have a balanced life, and that it in turn damaged productivity. that's extremely unusual for any manager to say aloud, they typically always toe the line. our conversation over lunch infuriated the union vp - he wanted to save this guy's job, but he couldn't. sekou's 'resignation' was already effective. but with an important twist - despite essentially firing the manager, they agreed to give the employee who improved the intranet 'one last chance' over his plea. years later, this employee is still with us thanks to the fact this manager spoke out. but even without hindsight, the union just couldn't let someone who lost their job over one of our own out in the cold. the union immediately tried to get sekou a union job somehow. but it's not easy - management retains the right to hire. for a few days, it seemed unlikely we could get him a job because hr would block moves through proper channels. but the union doesn't always go through proper channels. i suggested a few unorthodox possibilities and one stuck. a few days later, we came up with a potential solution. &gt; vp: "are you sure they won't be able to tell?" &gt; bytewave: "no, i can't. he still has the same name. just because we'd be putting his curriculum vitae straight on top of hr's e-pile doesn't mean they won't figure out he was a manager a week ago. but we're not tied to it, and he has nothing to lose, and we know for a fact they don't do proper background checks, right?" ... and they still don't. sekou's lightly-updated, and union-redacted cv was picked up by the company' huge hr department, and they gave him an interview for a union sysadmin position - as opposed to his previous non-union management position. given his new union sysadmin job was in an entirely different city, nobody immediately figured out the scheme. after his extensive mandatory trial period was over and he had full union protection, the story got around and everybody laughed their guts out. sekou is currently one of the better sysadmins we have over at networks, and the top contact my department - technical support's senior staff/tsss has over there. union staff learned the story and he has had a nickname ever since - maslow. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](quick little nugget here. i work part time as an independent field tech for a small consulting company. we have a bunch of contracts with mostly local medical practices to oversee most of their networking and hardware needs. and by local i mean anything in the 5 boroughs of new york city... this was from the winter time: december 2013, i'm sitting at home playing some games because both my main pt job and this pt job have me off. suddenly i get a call from my boss. &gt;me: "hey $boss, what's going on?" &gt;boss: "hey, i just got a call from the downtown center (this contract was with dialysis org that had several locations around the city). one of the social workers says her computer is dead and she has critical patient data on her hard drive that she needs salvaged asap. could you check it out?" &gt;me: "sure thing (so much for a day off), i'll be there in a half hour." fast forward through one annoying train ride. i arrive at the center, head upstairs, find the office, say hello and begin unloading my kit. because they described it as a full failure and because no one had thought to remotely check the machine, i was prepped for data transplant surgery. ide/sata/usb adapters, power adapters, laptop, the works. and then i actually walk over to the machine. and i ask the lady about what i see. &gt;me: "so, did it start saying 'no input. check signal cable' after it died? did you smell any smoke or anything burning?" &gt;sw: "no, it just said that and the mouse and keyboard don't do anything. or when i press the power button on the computer." i don't like where this is going... &gt;me: "hmm. bear with me then. *plugs the loose vga cable into the monitor and screws it tight*" &gt;sw: "oh my god how did you do that? what was wrong with it?" &gt;me: "usually, if it says check the cable, you should check the cable before calling us. now, if that's all, i'm going to head out. hopefully your administrator doesn't mind the service call, because we bill you guys hourly even if it's just a 5 minute cable plugging issue. have a nice day!"user says a piece of software they call "contact management" doesn't work. i log in and make settings adjustments then open the software. contact management in big letters now on screen. **me:** "could you please log in here?" **them:** "log in as myself?" **me:** ". . .yes." *tries logging in and fails* i remind her the username is usually numbers. "i don't know what log in this is. is this the log in for contact management? i thought i was just logging into my computer." *see previous line about contact management in big letters across the screen* she has to text someone to get her username. . .her username for software that she now says she hasn't ever tried to use, but reported it didn't work. **me:** "ok well just call me back if you still have issues after you get your username." **them:** "what do you mean?" **me:** "call me back if it still doesn't work." **them:** "i don't know." **me:** "what?" **them:** "what do you want me to do?" **me:** "get your username. try logging in. call me if the software still doesn't work." **them:** "uhh. ok. bye." i'm the it manager for my company. system administrator. well, i'm the sole it guy for my company and i'm responsible for pretty much everything that plugs into an outlet or runs on battery. needless to say, i'm busy. several days ago i had one of our head salesmen approach me regarding one of an in-house program we hand out to customers that essentially spits out assembly specs for different things we make and sell. it's not too complicated, but it was written by one of the previous it guys about 6 years ago so there is no support for it. this program needed to be updated to include new parts and specs for existing parts but modification was password locked by the creator. apparently this has been a growing concern for months but nobody bothered to tell me about it until friday afternoon. at this point it was top priority and required me to put other projects on the back burner. sales: hey zero, we have this program and it's password locked. can you get into it? me: i can physically open the program, yes. i don't know what the password is though and there's no documentation of it anywhere. sales: can't you, like, do some hacker shit with a password cracker program from the internet or something? me: no, but i'll see what i can do. as i started looking into it, i realized i had no idea how this application was written. aside from the .exe basically every other file extension was some obscure file type i wasn't familiar with. (it ended up being written with pellesc) after 2 days of (intermittently) trying to figure out how to get past the password lock, i finally posted the application and my issue in /r/techsupport. after cross referencing to the guys in /r/reverseengineering, it only took 3 hours before someone had successfully modified the application to allow me past the password screen. i know it was something simple, but i don't code in c so it was beyond me. told the boss that i called in a favor with some people i know, which made me look great and earned me some brownie points. sales was happy, boss was happy, and i was happy. that's how reddit helped me do my job. thanks guys, i owe you a beer.good morning from weekend support, tfts. here's a goodie from awhile ago... of course, i'm still doing support for $gigantic_cable_company and the weekends are somewhat of an enigma around here. half are misrouted calls, the other half are usually people just helping someone out and don't know a thing about computers. this call falls into the second part. **punk: hello, this is punk at $gigantic_cable_company tech support. how can i help you?** *customer: yes, i'm having trouble getting online.* **punk: alright.....** &gt;modem online and pinging. **punk: ma'am, what is the error message you're receiving?** *customer: internet explorer has stopped working.* **punk: okay, that is an error with the program itself. do you have chrome or firefox?** *customer: firefox.* **punk: try to get online with that.** &gt;long pause and incoherent mumbling..... *customer: okay, i can get to fox news, but that doesn't help me with internet explorer.* **punk: again, that is an error with the program itself and i do not support that. you are able to get online.** *customer: but it's an error and i want you to fix it! i use explorer for everything!* &gt;/sigh...why me? **punk: you will need to call the tech support of the program, which would be microsoft, or you can contact tech support of your laptop's manufacturer.** *customer: you just don't want to fucking help me!* **punk: don't swear at me, ma'am. i support your internet as your isp. this is not our issue.** *customer: the hell it isn't! fix this or i'm reporting you!* **punk: is there anything else i can assist you with?** *customer: yes i want you to do your fucking job!** **punk: this is no longer a productive call. thank you for calling and have a good day.** *customer: fuck you i want you t-* &gt;click **tl:dr: lolinternetexplorer**friday - i wondered how hard it was to hire a security manager. takes months apparently. i sat down for the start of another endless heads of department meeting. the secretary walked in. &gt;sec: coffee anyone? &gt;me: yep one for me, hows the machine working? &gt;sec: after it was fixed the vp decided we needed a new one. &gt;me: why get a new one after a repair? &gt;sec: no idea. actually i don’t know how to use the new one yet. tea instead? &gt;me: coffee? &gt;sec: mmm maybe next time. she walked straight out of the room. i was coffee-less again! the vp walked in the room, he didn’t look too happy. as if fate where smiling down on me. &gt;vp: okay. lets make this quick. firstly i’ve been getting a lot of emails about the new phone system. can i get all the managers to inform employee’s they should direct budgetary concerns to airz. &gt;headhr: all budgetary concerns? &gt;vp: no. of course not all budgetary concerns. people keep sending “we need more then $10.” to me. just those sort of phone related things should go to airz. head of accounting was looking thoughtful. he had an idea. must be a first. &gt;headac: why is airz running the phone budget? surely its a job for accounts. &gt;me: yes. accounts have a central location, makes it easy to pick up vouchers! the vp didn’t look well. he seemed weak. &gt;vp: airz you’re accounts…. the vp seemed to remember something. &gt;vp: your accounts are under review! &gt;airz: speaking of, i haven’t seen the auditor for ages. if coffee was around, it would have told me saying that was a mistake. but it wasn’t around. as if rising from the dead the vp’s eyes started to sparkle. he was looking much much better. &gt;vp: seeing as the first auditor has absconded, it’ll have to find you another. &gt;headac: i could send one of my accoun… &gt;vp: no. for something as important as it. we’ll need someone external. someone impartial….. -0-0-0-0-0–0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0 as i got back to my office, auditor was standing near my desk. &gt;me: what are you?….. &gt;audit: haha missed me? i’ve been pretty ill. don’t worry nothing contagious. -0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0 monday morning a skinny lady with a screechy voice arrived at the office. &gt;screechy: i’m here to audit this office! &gt;me: sorry, we’ve actually already got an auditor…. and that's how i ended up with two auditors. lets hope the numbers all add up. freaking numbers…. [next]( [older]( [this tale]( reminded me of something similar that happened at my last job. it too involved shared files. it too involved failure to understand the word **off**. surprisingly, it also involved people using the shared drive like they were supposed to. (seriously though, most people there were reasonably competent most of the time. you only hear about it when they weren't.) one day one of our nas servers had to go down for some reason. whatever reason that was also meant it had to go down in the middle of the work day, which was highly unusual; systems guy was usually much better about that sort of thing. so here's how it went down: &gt; **event minus one week** flurry of emails between everyone in tech confirming that this has to happen this way. **event minus three days** email warning goes out to everyone affected and then some. email follows our normal downtime notice template which goes something like: &gt; scheduled downtime. the nas in the suchandsuch office will be down on $date from $time to $time for scheduled maintenance. this change means that the $foo drive will be inaccessible. this change will affect larry, moe and curly teams because the $bar $baz $moo folders will be inaccessible. $insincere_apologies $cto_rubberstamp. **event minus three days -- the evening** reply-all bomb ensues in all its glory. everything you could possibly expect from a reply-all bomb happened. the responses come in fast and furious for several hours, then slow to a trickle which continues until... **event plus 10 minutes** tickets begin flowing in from people complaining that "the files are down." tl;dr we all know that "i acknowledge i have read and agree to..." doesn't mean shit. edit0: added detail for additional cringehello again! since working at a [hospital]( tier 2 support desk last summer, i've moved on to a saturday job at a small computer repair place. even though it's not paid very well, i enjoy working there. i get along with my colleague pretty well, my expertise is appreciated there, and most of the time it's pretty quiet. my boss is a bit of an odd character though. often over-selling our services, or being not-very honest to get a sale. ("yes, your computer is definitely dead, but i can give you an offer on a replacement.") after coming in yesterday, and solving their internet outage that had been ongoing for two days in under an hour (they had replaced their router while the fault lied at an unmanaged switch which had been connected to itself because of poor cable management) my boss pointed me in the direction of a *printer*. &gt; me: uhm... what do you want me to do with this? (i'm not a printer tech in shape or form, i'm a networking/linux guy mainly.) &gt; boss: the heads need to be cleaned, it's printing bad. &gt; me: surely you can't expect us to put hours of work in a cheap retail printer? &gt; boss: it's easy. just *google it.* and so i did. i found a video for disassembling a similar, but not quite identical printer. after about half an hour of mangling ribbon cables, i had managed to disassemble the head, and i had the offending part in my hands. using a combination of a syringe, lukewarm water, and a general sense of confusion about the whole ordeal i cleaned the part, while making a very artistic ink pattern on the walls of the kitchen area and my shirt. there, it was done. or so i thought. re-assembling the printer proved to be much more difficult, since some of the ribbon cables i pulled (some unnecessarily) proved very difficult if not impossible to reconnect, and also very flimsy. after trimming some plastic parts with some pliers and hiding the plastic shards to gain access at the connectors, i had a sense of relief. the printer was in one part. and then i pressed the power button. the printer screamed at me like an abomination from hell, and had a very cryptic error message on it's screen, prompting me power-cycle it, which didn't help. after pulling all the ribbon cables and reconnecting them with the same result, i was at a loss. &gt; boss: well you'll have to re-assemble it again! &gt; me: i just did that! &gt; boss: no matter! shortly after that, my boss left the shop, so i promptly made a cross-gesture in the air with my thumb to declare it dead, and put it back on the shelve where i found it. i'm glad i don't have to break the news to the customer. (then again, it was probably time for a new one anyways.) tl;dr: was told to fix a printer. i am not a printer tech. the printer is now dead.i work in i.t, and volunteer once a week at a seniors home, teaching basic computer skills but mostly troubleshoot their problems. there's a woman that has been coming down for almost a year. she knows, what i call, the "seniors basics". google search, youtube and email. one day she comes to me and tells me "i accidentally deleted bejeweled". i laugh slightly and tell her, "oh don't worry, you probably just deleted the shortcut i left on your desktop". she goes, "no no, i deleted it from the add/remove programs list". now at this point there was both fury and joy in my eyes. i scream out "who the hell taught you how to delete programs! it sure as hell wasn't me!! i am both mad, and impressed, doreen!". she is 87 yrs old. she always has dinner ready for me when i get there. if your helpdesk job is mundane, volunteer with seniors, and teach them. it'll change your life.okay...some back story here. i am a fabricator. specifically, i build custom semi trucks for work and custom motorcycles for fun. i have a galaxy s5 that has only a reddit app and a smart tv that does everything i need it to. i had a home computer. i had a laptop. i had a tablet. all these are gone now thanks to me being what all it people refer to as *user*. i don't know what a server, lpn, office, or any of the other jargon you use is. i know this... i'm that guy. i know this because of my neighbors. i live in a nice neighborhood of homes with my wife and son. my neighbor across the street is an upper level it tech at one of the big 3, his son is a tech at nazi cable company, next door resides a couple who are also some tier something level something it techs at another foreign car company. all of them work from home most of the time remotely or the office occasionally. remember when i said i had all that "equipment"? they took it all away from me because i killed all of it in one way or another. dont know how... i just did. i dont have any idea what i'm doing. i can rebulid an engine in a day, weld anything in any direction and double click everything. i called my neighbors constantly trying to explain what went wrong. i called them to look at this or that. set up my printer. fix my printer. burn movies for me. show me how to make my tv play said movies. borrow cables, power supplys, thingys that go on your keychain that hold lots of pics, the occasional xbox 360 game (which both only have a ps4 and pc games), and everything else computer related. i do repay the favors though. i mow their lawn, fix gutters, repair their cars, caulk windows, and anything else they need done that doesnt require a computer. until finding this subreddit i had no idea the suffering the went through on a daily basis. i thought i had it bad when i got burned, broke a finger or two, or cut myself (this happens daily). then on top of it dealing with a neighbor like me that is basically making them work overtime. i figured they just sat at home in their pj's all day talking on the phone while playing video games not knowing the difference between a chainsaw and a circular saw. i have a new found respect for them and your profession. i wrote all of this on my smart phone because its the only device my neighbors said i can't break. thanks for the internet by the way. it works great. keep it up. tl; dr &lt;---- i have no idea what this means.my boss is not tech-savvy. he knows how to send an email, i explained how a usb-drive works and if he remembers to plug in his printer, he can print something out. dad-level technology. he asks me to do research and submit the results in tabular form. i do, sending it to him as a pdf since pdf will print from pretty much any printer. printout works fine, we discuss the results and he requests that i send the data to him "in word". no big deal, sending him the word file. next morning, i wake up to this. "dear misskensington, that's not exactly what i meant - i meant not in tabular form, but in words, like, you know, how i always do my lists!" i am still facepalming. he meant "word" in the most literal sense ever. not tabular form, a friggin list in, well, words. a word file. literally. i don't even. tl; dr: til what a word file really is. edit: holy cow. you guys are the shit. also my boss is apparently a humpty-dumpty-gangsta lol.my tech-illiterate girlfriend is taking a photography class and she has to submit these photos online for class. she calls me on skype and says, "i can't submit these photos because it says they're over the 50mb limit." of course this puzzles me as no 800x600 sized photo should be over 50mb. so i ask her what the dimensions are of her photo. she says, "800 width by 600 height". then her macbook pro starts dogging really bad. she can't open up any other programs and her computer is just slow as all hell. i'm trying to figure out on my end why this file is 65.6 mb when it's just a picture of two boots. so she uploads the photo to google drive and sends it to me and i see nothing wrong with the photo, but as soon as i open it my ram starts climbing. 10g... 12g... 14g..., pretty soon it's maxed out and the program i'm using to open the photo crashes. so i open the properties of the photo and the dimensions of the photo are 57600x34940. so she opens the photo in photoshop again and she says "it's 800 by 600!" then i hear "it's supposed to be in inches right?" 800 inches is 66.66 feet.the other day i had a gram come in with a gps it went like this. *gram walks in* &gt;gram: my cable won't work in my gps. i look at the cable, look at the port. &gt;me: this is the wrong cable. &gt;gram: no, i've been using this cable since i bought it, it came with it. *thinks to self, ok still not the right cable.* i look at the port on the gps, look at the usb end. two different sizes. i walk to my desk grab a cable and show her. &gt;me: the cable you have isn't the proper size. if you look here at my cable (usb micro)it fits right in. if you look at your cable (usb mini) it doesn't fit. you supplied a usb mini, but the cable needs to be usb micro. she looks at me as if i'm full of crap. i show her my cable slide in and out where as hers won't fit. &gt;me: you can go to *major retail store* and buy a proper cable. still don't know why she didn't look and see the obvious size difference.ltl, ftp yadda yadda. this is a short story from a friend of mine who was a cable tech. i asked him if i could share it and he said "go for it". here it goes. so $client called $helpdesktech, or $ht. here's how it went: $ht: thank you for calling &lt;cable company&gt;. how can i help? $client: my son unplugged the coax (good sign she knows what coax is) because the tv wasn't working and he got an electric shock. i think the electricity may have gotten into the tv. can you send someone over? $ht: oh no, terribly sorry. i'll send $friend to come check it out tomorrow. is that ok? $client: no, can it be the day after? i won't be home. $ht: no problem. have a nice day madam.. etc. etc. *so 2 days later $friend goes over to the client location to check it out. he greets $client.* $client: so glad you're here. i turned the mains power off just in case. $friend: so you've been without electricity for 2 days? $client: yeah, had to throw away everything in the freezer too. doesn't matter, as long as my son is safe from the electricity in the tv. $friend: sorry to hear that. i'll go check it out. can you show me where the box is please? $client: right here. so $friend checks it out and sees a stray wire from the coax shielding poking out. he does some tests to be sure, traces the wire etc. and turns the power back on. son goes over to touch it again and pokes his finger with the same wire. $friend redoes the terminator and leaves. woman yells at her son for wasting so much food "the african kids could have eaten". **tldr: son can't tell the difference between electricity and a stray wire and mother destroys hundreds worth of food to save him from a splinter** edit: grammarmy husband and i have a computer support business that serves very small businesses and home users. ‎91 year old widow customer: “is there pornography on my computer?” me: “no, there is no pornography on your computer” widow: “but how do you get it on your computer?” me: “some people get it by accident, by clicking on infected links, and other people download it on purpose.” widow: “but where would you find it? i wouldn’t know where to go.” me: “anybody can find it, just type a suggestive word into a search engine.” widow: “what’s a search engine?” me: “you use google” widow: “but what word would i type?” me: “oh anything, like ‘boobs’ maybe?” widow: “i was thinking of typing penises, i haven’t seen one in 45 years” choking on laughter, i quickly change the subject…. after about 5 minutes…. widow: “does your husband also go out on calls?” me: “yes, we both do.” widow: “is he a nice looking man?” me: “oh yes, he is a very attractive man.” widow: “do you let him go out on calls to single women?” me: “well, i’m not letting him come here – i hear you are a wild woman who hasn’t seen a penis in 45 years!” i think we made each other’s day! another monday at work; checking the ticket cue, picking out the good ones because i'm not in a trouble-mood today. found this rather unique request by $electrician &gt;$electrician: hi, we have to replace our old mobile workstation - it is still running windows nt and now, that it is 18 years+ old we'd like to get a new one. requested hardware needs to be no bigger than *given the outlines of a 1999 desktop pc* so it can fit on the old trolley and has to have a small screen set on top of it. we'd also like to have a bigger cable drum so we'll be able to use in our extrusion blow molder wich doesn't have any free socket outlets below 10kv voltage. picking up the phone with a big grin i think i came up with a suitable solution for this request &gt;$minkehr: hi, $electrician. thank you for your hardware request. i recieved and evaluated the given information and think you might be happy to use a laptop instead. i swear you can still hear the echoes of his huge facepalm in the phone line for the weeks to come. &gt;$electrician: damn.... a laptop would indeed solve some problems we had with this mobile computing trolley over the years. gotta get that laptop ready for them. he's a really nice guy and all, but i wonder why they didn't even bother to find a better solution for this ^^ __________________ tldr; if you're tired of dragging 50 kilos of hardware around for your daily work consider using a laptop.so at my current job i am discovering that one employee is going to be something of a reoccurring thorn. she claims to have come from another company where she used to work in the it department and loves to question my every action. here are a few short stories from the past couple of weeks. ticket: he avellion, my printer hasn't been working this morning can you come take a look? i walk over to the office to find her there with the person who has a problem. me: so a printer isn't working? her: i already looked at it for you. you need to order a new one for her. me: interesting i spend a minute or two checking all the connections to make sure nothing is loose her: i already checked that! i crouch down under her desk and see the breaker on the isobar under the desk has been tripped. i flip it off and back on and then the printer starts up fine. i smile and go back to my office. a few days later and another printer is making really horrible noises and not printing. she is waiting there again. her: when are you going to replace these printers? me: when they need to be replaced. i open the tray to see some paper caught in the rollers. clear the jam, a little wd40 and the printer works fine her: this wouldn't be a problem in my old office! they listened to me and replaced all the old equipment. me: i think these old girls still have some life in them. about an hour ago i get a ticket from her saying that the company programs have stopped working. me: what seems to be the problem? her: these crappy dells you buy can't run our systems! me: alright can i see your mouse for a moment? i sit down and immediately notice something is wrong. me: is this windows 8? her: yeah. 7 is out of date and i decided to update my computer since you wont do it. me: i see. you do know that our tools are developed internally and they only work on win7 yes? her: win 7 is out of date! you need to update the office! i know i used to do your job at my old office. i ended up taking her computer and am currently letting it do a slow format while i drink my afternoon coffee. she has been in a private meeting with the gm who was rather upset about the situation when i told him what happened after i walked past his office with a pc tower under my arm. edit for formatting update: for all the people saying i need to lock down her computer, ect. don't worry, i have [plans]( update of the update: alright, sorry it took so long but i got stuck on the phone with a certain cellphone provider for 4 hours. you know, because that's how long it takes to transfer the number from an old cell phone to a new one. the excess of crappy hold music also left me in something of a fey mood. so after i finished placing our image onto the troublemaker pc i locked her out of booting from anything other than the hard drive from the bios and then password locked the bios to keep her out of it. i also changed her access level on the company web filter. (normally neither i nor the office managers care if people are on facebook, ebay, amazon, twitter, ect so long as they get their work done but technically it policy says they shouldn't be able to unless they are managers) i'm currently working on a script that will run on start up that will pop up a message with a copy pasted text of the company ip policy concerning modification of equipment without the consent of it. think of it like the fbi notice at the beginning of home movies. for those surprised to find out she isn't fired. the gm decided to give her a second chance but if she screws up again he is going to boot her out. i don't want one bad apple to give a bad impression of the office. everyone else here is great and easy to work with. worked for a hosting company back in the day. tier 1 techs took front line calls,tier 2 helped tier 1 with front line calls on occasion but mostly handled escalations and more technical cases beyond tier 1 capabilities, and tier 3 were like baby admins with root access, helping tiers 1&amp;2. i was a tier 1 tech, getting assistance from a few tier 2 and 3 friends to start learning some more advanced stuff so i could apply for a tier 2 position. while talking to a tier 3 tech about something new to me (i think we were talking about raid but i don't remember) some doofus tier 2 guy keeps interjecting with stuff trying to "help" me learn. i looked to tier 3 (t3) who discreetly shook his head "no" t3: *whispers* "just ignore him." giddypanda: "is he wrong?" t3: "he is literally the last person you should ever ask for help from." giddypanda: "really? he's a tier 2 though, so he should know more than i do..." t3: "he only got that position through stupidmanager. he's completely unqualified. stupidmanager actually wanted to promote him straight to tier 3 but the admins wouldn't allow him anywhere near a server and give him root access." giddypanda: "that bad, huh?" t3: "yeah." giddypanda: "what did he do to get on their bad side?" t3: "oh, lots of stupid things. like, one time a server was running slow, **so he told them to 'kill apache because it was hogging resources.**' he was totally serious. so he's permabanned from being promoted anywhere. he's stuck where he is forever." (edit for the web hosting layman: telling a sysadmin to "kill apache" for taking up lots of resources is like telling a mechanic to remove a car's engine because it's hogging gas. without the engine, it won't go. and people pay lots of money for it to go fast.)back in the days of big iron a modest sized computer was the size of 2 refrigerators, the expansion cabinet was another 2 refrigerators and each disk in the farm was the size of a small washing machine. they were large and there were a lot of parts, lots and lots of parts. boards and cables and more cables and all sorts of bits and pieces. here is a [pic]( for your viewing pleasure. the it department, and back then the term it had not been coined, it was the computer department, bought one of these modest sized monsters. now this was a major purchase and had to approved by several people, including the vice president of engineering, better known as “the mad dutchman”. now dutch was the type of guy who added value to the organization by cutting costs, as opposed to generating new revenue. he was a bean counter extraordinaire. this purchase was no exception. when purchasing one of these monsters the manufacturer would send you a quote listing out all the components and the price of each component. dutch carefully perused many pages of the quote and started crossing out items he considered non-critical, such as, the console terminal and keyboard, hey we can reuse one in house, right? and he crossed out cables to connect the cpu cabinet to the peripherals cabinet, cables to connect the peripherals cabinet to the disk drives, cables to connect everything else together. i mean, they’re just cables, we can have our hardware techs make our own cables right? of course we can, we’re engineers, we can do anything. and wow, look, i saved $4000 on a $300,000 order. i am a financial genius! so without having the computer department do one final check on the items being ordered, and really, why would you have technical people review technical decisions made by a guy who isn’t technical, the order goes out. and the manufacturer ships the equipment exactly as specified on the hacked up quote. and the equipment arrives and is placed in the computer room. and field service comes on site to do the installation. but then field service starts asking questions, like where are the data cables for the disk drives? where are the bus cables from the cpu to the peripherals? on and on, all these pesky little missing cables. proprietary-only-made-by-the-manufacturer cables. someone investigates and discovers dutch’s dastardly deed. ok, so everything will be delayed for another month or two while a new purchase order gets generated and approved to order the cables. or so they think. you see, these cables are not normally sold separately, they are sold as part of a package, a package that includes a $300,000 computer. there are no ordering numbers for these cables. there is no way to tell manufacturing, hey, just send us a few parts. no one can figure out how to sell us these parts and just these parts. (and no, doing a mirror of the quote with all the delivered parts crossed out isn't going to work). so the computer sat in the computer room, unpowered, for 6 months while this snafu was unsnarled. if we look at this in terms of engineering man hours lost: 6 months is 26 weeks, one week is 40 hours, there were about 25 engineers who were going to use the machine, and figure that back then one engineering man hour was worth about $50. so about $1,300,000 lost man hours. plus a $300,000 paperweight. maybe i should have called this "cables? we don't need no stinking cables." bg: user is an *almost* elderly woman. she had her pc upgraded recently. company uses xnview on a daily basis. it's being installed while making an image for new pc's sooo it's everywhere. **ring ring** &gt;$me: hello, it. &gt;$user: i can't seem to find xnview on my pc. &gt;$me: i am sure it is there. &gt;$user: it's not on my desktop. how do i find it than? &gt;$me: you need to search for it in the start menu. juxt press the start button and type "xn". &gt;$user: ok. start.... and.... oops! i shuted down the pc. i'm gonna call you back. click it has been 3 hours ago. i guess her new pc is just really slow.monday morning. i walk into the office in a better mood then i had left it. the horrors of the missing switch now firmly in the back of my mind. an it colleague runs up to me. he’s wearing a green shirt, it doesn’t work with the red pants. &gt;colorblind: airz! level three wants you stat. &gt;me: stat? is this a hospital now? &gt;colorblind: if so, does that make me a nurse? &gt;me: oh are you saying im a doctor? …. wait i don’t have time for this. as i rush to level three i dream of being a doctor, a less stressful life. i open the stair doors to level three and look straight down the hall. at the end of the hall… a half height rack filled with switches. it was home. standing next to the rack, someone was trying every key on their chain to get into the comms room. the lock i had installed on the door was holding firm. as i thought about how good of a maintenance man i could be i walked down the hall towards the obvious culprit. &gt;me: you! he turned around. i smiled. time for someone to be fired. as i was dragging youngsec towards hr for stealing a rack i thought about the chess games i had watched all weekend. chess seems so dull. why did i watch it? probably a lack of coffee. &gt;me: this is a termination interview. i announced as i sat down in head of hr’s office. &gt;youngsec: but why? &gt;me: you stole a rack of switches. &gt;youngsec: but the vp… as if summoned like the devil, the vp showed up. &gt;vp: sorry, this is all a misunderstanding. &gt;me: no. youngsec stole the rack. stealing someone elses sandwich out of the fridge is grounds for termination. so stealing a rack…. as his manager, i’m letting him go. &gt;vp: actually if you recall, he isn’t on your payroll. you can't fire him. i had forgotten that the vp kept this pawn off my books. &gt;vp: you can stay. &gt;me: he stole…. the vp cut me off. &gt;vp: no. actually what happened was; on friday my mouse ran out of batteries. i went searching for some and found my way to the third floor comms room. whilst inside i accidentally kicked the rack. it stopped flashing. &gt;me: so you… &gt;vp: so i found youngsec. i knew he was good with these things. he took a look at it and told me he could fix the damage. i was so pleased i went to grab him a drink, but when i got back the rack was gone. youngsec finally found his voice. the pawn finally spoke. &gt;youngsec: yes. sorry. i took the rack home to fix it. &gt;me: why? its a switch. &gt;vp: doesn’t matter. what matters is he tried to fix it. &gt;me: i don’t care what he tried to do. he would have taken level three offline for two days! &gt;youngsec: this place is open. on the weekends? &gt;me: no s*** sherlock. it looked like the pawn was going to escape my trap. i gave chase. &gt;me: i can’t have him as a security now. who knows what else he’ll just “take home” to “fix”. &gt;vp: mmmm, maybe just give him no keys. &gt;me: a security guard. with no keys? that's a pointless occupation. i was so close to getting this pawn off the board. i could feel it. &gt;vp: that is a good point. the head of hr, who had sat quietly through the entire conversation decided to throw in her two cents. &gt;headhr: you could always flick him over to it. he does seem interested in it. &gt;youngsec: and i did fix that rack. &gt;me: no. &gt;vp: yes. i looked over at the vp’s pawn. he’d just hit the end of the board, and become a queen. f*** as the first battle ended i walked out the door and looked back. the vp was smiling. youngsec looked happy. head of hr seemed delighted. everybody wins? [next]( [older](i work as the sole it guy at a resort. i just got a call from someone in our restaurant. &gt;user: we are having trouble with $software. when we try to post a check it tells use there is not enough disk space. &gt;me: can you read the exact error message to me, word for word? &gt;user: no. it just says "unable to post file, not enough disk space. call $vendor". &gt;me: is that what it said, word for word? &gt;user: yes. .... ok, i guess i will call $vendor and give them that error message.extremely short one here. was helping a client reconnect their wireless printer to their network, as they'd replaced their router with a combo modem (new ip subnet, etc). connected, and this 3-page document prints out as part of the printer queue (shared family computer). title of the document is the title of this tfts. turns out the husband (who had contracted me) had no idea. things got real silent after he said "honey? did you print this?". i quietly sat there until he wrote my check, and then nope'd out of there. tl;dr: the next pages spilling out of that printer are the divorce proceedings.quick e-mail that just came in: &gt;hello, could we have laptops with 4-6gb ram and new win7 64bits build on them, ideally for noon today. ;) sorry for the last-minute request. it is currently 10:30am. *-blinks-* **edit: my team leader kindly told him to fuck off and use a vm instead.... hours later way past noon.**i work at a university it call center that provides 24/7 general computer assistance to students, faculty and staff. we also handle account access for these individuals. we are required to have all access requests documented and kept for at least 180 days. to get access, especially for new hires, a supervisor must sign-off on the form listing required access and then it is turned in either physically or electronically. with how many forms we get, it takes on average 24-48 hours from submission to completion, so we tell people to always submit them as soon as possible. this is a call i got just a few minutes ago. &gt; mrfyr: it support, this is fyr. &gt; pebkac: i need to know why my new employee doesn't have access to anything yet?! she started nearly two weeks ago and still can't get in to anything!! &gt; mrfyr: well ma'am, what is the employee's name and have you submitted an access request? &gt; pebkac: what? what is that, what do you mean "access request"? *note: this woman has worked here for years and should know what it is* &gt; mrfyr: well if you haven't submitted an access request, that would explain why she doesn't have access. we can't give her access to anything if nobody actually requests that access. once you get that request in, it takes about 24-48 hours, and then the employee will have whatever access you asked for on the form. &gt; pebkac: what!? this is ridiculous! she's already gone ten days without anything! i need this done now! &gt; mrfyr: well, sounds like you really need to get that form in! have a nice day! &gt; *click* i'm so done with this woman, this isn't the first time she's done something like this. edit: koalauser called with some rather strange logic today. &gt;i've been getting a fan error for the past couple of days, but my temporary fix no longer works and my computer doesn't turn on anymore. i ask the user what he has done to his computer to fix the issue, assuming that he has been using compressed air to blow out his laptop or something likewise. &gt;well since heat is a good thing for computers, i decided to use my wifes old hair dryer to help the fan error. i used that aluminum duct work tape and attached the hair dryer to the laptop so it wouldnt burn my fingers, but it would blow the nice hot air into the computer and provide good dust removal! while attempting to not be a condescending jerk to this guy, i calmly explain that he needs to remove the hair dryer and tape and this should not be done in the future, as heat can greatly reduce the life of electronics. then explain to him that i will assign a ticket to his deskside group to come pick up the laptop, so they can assess the laptop. next time dude, just call tech support. you probably ruined that computer. thanks bud. this even got me baffled so worth the share i think: call from a user: &gt;user: "hi, matvalicious. for some reason i am unable to drag-and-drop e-mails into my archives anymore. &gt;matvalicous: "that's pretty odd, let me take over your computer for a sec. i suspected a faulty mouse or something, but to my surprise i wasn't even able to do it remotely. &gt;matvalicous: "ok, what's going on here? let me do another test and try to drag an icon across your desktop." to my surprise, we were unable to drag any icon, anywhere. &gt;matvalicous: "well, user, i'm flabbergasted. let me google that real quick... ok, try the following: click and hold any icon on your desktop, and while doing so press escape." &gt;user: "hey, it works again! thanks, matvalicious!" dear diary, til click, hold and escape is a shortcut to disable the drag function... **edit: the system was a windows 7 x64 enterprise. two of my colleagues tested it and it" worked" with only one of them. worked on me as well. also, his escape wasn't stuck. google "drag not working windows 7" and you will find multiple people with this issue on microsoft forums and the suggested fix.**howdy tfts, first time poster. i work in software development. while not specifically it, it does land me in doing it related things because "i know computers." this, sadly, isn't one of those times. this story starts a few years ago. i was in charge of an app for a certain client. this app was installed on scanner devices to allow our client to keep track of their stock. basically every box, bag, drum, barrel and basket in their warehouses had a sticker with a bar code on it. you scan it into our app and it fetches the relevant data from the database (where/when it was produced, how much of it is there, is it reserved etc.) and allows a few basic operations from the app, mostly marking stuff in the database. it's around june and our client puts in a request to redevelop our app so they can do their end-of-year inventory with it. this involved allowing the peons (regular worker folk) to directly mess with the data concerning quantity of stock - something we strictly control and is otherwise almost entirely automated. good times. fast forward to those awful few days between christmas break and new year's. the app has long since been updated and the peons were finishing up their jobs. i was investigating a bug with the way we visualize this particular data, and i run across something strange. the bad kind of strange. a few hours of juggling e-mails while digging through the database and logs, the following sequence of events becomes clear: &gt; peon (p) scans the identification sticker of a box and it decodes it as box #9001. &gt; p is then prompted to enter how many packets of nails are in box #9001. &gt; p scans the sticker again and to his dismay, nothing happens. &gt; p calls over senior peon (sp) for help and explains the scanner isn't working. &gt; sp tells p to manually enter the box code if the scanning device can't read it. &gt; p enters 9001 into the "packets of nails" field and clicks ok. &gt; p sees a warning popup the developer **specifically put in to prevent this scenario**, begging the user to double-check their input before proceeding. &gt; p is fresh out of #$%&amp;s to give and clicks "accept". &gt; system now thinks box #9001 has 9001 packets of nails instead of the (actually accurate) 200. &gt; p continues on his merry way, repeating the process for the next 45 minutes, royally screwing up 12 months' worth of records. &gt; unwitting developer stumbles onto this mess completely by accident and now has to spend 2 days cleaning it up. tl;dr there's a reason access to data is limited. edit: to the people pointing out this should have been a two-step process, i agree completely! unfortunately management deemed that notion "too disruptive to the workflow".### a little background first: i am a manager at a security company, we basically install security cameras in households or small businesses and, if they so desire (and are willing to pay), keep a remote database of their video footage for them. all our software is home made and we need technicians to maintain the code, networks, hardware, etc. two months ago we hired an *$intern* at the company, he had a lot of trouble finding his way around the code and maintaining it so we tried him out in customer service instead. thing is when you are in customer service you become, for a lack of a better term, the face of the company you work at (other than your relatives, no one knows you work at *x company* if you do only background work). ### the first contact: one day, *$intern* meets his *$uncle* on the phone while he was shopping for a security system. *$uncle* decides it would be a great idea to tell *$intern*'s *$aunt* about the fact that her nephew (*$intern*) is working at a "tech support" company (which we are not). the next day, *$aunt* shows up at our front desk. thing is, internship at the company isn't a small deal for us, since we're a small business, interns don't do exclusively a single job. we try to make them do a bit of everything until they find what they're good at and/or enjoy doing and take a full time job. *$intern* was mostly busy learning how to maintain the software at the time, he wasn't doing customer support all day. a = *$aunt* m = *$me* &gt; a: hi i'd like to see my nephew, i believe he can help me fix my tablet. &gt; m: $intern is busy working, he's not doing customer service at the moment. &gt; a: well i'd like to see him anyways he's certainly not chained in the basement is he? &gt; m: i'll go get your nephew, just for this time, but please be quick, he's very busy at the moment. *$aunt* proceeds to explain the multiple problems she has with her tablet to *$intern* while i go back to work. ### feed a man a fish ... : *$aunt* came back 2 or 3 days later, but now for a computer problem. i have no idea why but because we "were good with computers", she thought she was entitled to free tech support. since her nephew wasn't there i think one of *$intern* decided to step in and help her out of misery. big mistake. this reinforced her beliefs that we would always help her out, nephew or not. i wasn't too concerned at the time, i thought this was most likely be a one time thing. she comes, we help her, we never see her again. except it wasn't the case, she came back maybe one or two weeks later with a problem with her printer if i recall correctly. since it was around the last days of *$intern*'s internship (a bit redundant eh?) he decided to help her out one last time out of generosity. honorable thing, but huge mistake here again. he plugs the printer, finds the issue in minutes, says goodbye and goes back to his job. a few days time later, the internship ends and since *$intern* is still in trade school, he's not going to be taking a full time job any time soon. ### isn't it my personal tech support? : a few weeks later, *$aunt* comes back for more tech support. while i try to politely decline, (since, you know, her nephew doesn't work here anymore), she asks to see *$goodguy*, the employee that helped her with her computer problems when *$intern* wasn't there. while i agree this might be my fault for agreeing to this (but believe me i didn't think this would become what it became), i tried to convince *$goodguy* that he shouldn't feed the troll and let her be, he insisted to help her. i try not to worry too much and let it pass once again. *$aunt* comes back the next day to complain about *$goodguy*'s help: a = *$aunt* g = *$goodguy* &gt; a: *$goodguy* helped me with my tablet yesterday, he didn't fix the problem, it's still happening, it wouldn't have happened if my nephew fixed it. &gt; g: i'll try to find the issue and fix it, but i can't guarantee anything. &gt; a: you see, this is the thing, you don't *want* to help me, you just want to get rid of me. &gt; g: not at all, i willingly left my break to come and help you. &gt; a: no you did not, you left your boring-ass job that's what you did. you could see *$goodguy* was really starting to get pissed, but didn't do anything, because you know, he's a *$goodguy*. after a few minutes, finds the issue, fixes it, gives back the tablet to *$aunt* and she goes away angrily. later that day *$aunt* comes back with her husband, *$uncle* (our *actual* customer): a = *$aunt* u = *$uncle* m = *$me* &gt; u: my wife told me you didn't treat her accordingly &gt; m: sir, have my most sincere apologies, but we can only supply tech support for things related to our product, anything else isn't in our contract nor valuable of our time to deal with. &gt; a: you see this is the problem right here, *$intern* actually enjoys his job enough to take the time and help me, while your employees, just do it to get rid of me. &gt; m: that's exactly it ma'am, no one here enjoys helping someone they don't know and waste the company's time absolutely for free. &gt; a: but my nephew enjoyed helping me, why isn't he here? &gt; m: your nephew doesn't work here anymore ma'am, he .. &gt; a: why did you fire him?!? &gt; m: we did no.. &gt; a: why did you fire my nephew?? he is a hard worker, he is the best in the domain and he is willing to do everything to fix my problems, which your employees are obviously not competent at. you just fired what would've been your best employee. &gt; u: *following his wife's tantrum* if you fire my nephew, you lose me as a customer, no nephew, no business. &gt; a: if you do not call him immediately to hire him back, you'll lose us as customers. &gt; m: ma'am this is not possible to hire him back.. &gt; u: well that's too bad, you just lost some very loyal customers. they both left and never came back. i never got the chance to explain why their nephew wasn't fired, but actually *hired*, since he signed a contract with us that we would grant him a job as soon as he finishes studying as long as he maintains a good average with his grades. oh well, can't say i'm too sad about "losing" them both. edit: typos.sorry for any formatting errors. i am a long time lurker, and had to create an account to share this with you. second day of work, and was receiving an error message. for this story, it is important to note our i.t. guys are in the same office, and their "pod" is about 10 feet away from my desk. me: "hey paul ( i.t. guru) i'm receiving this error message. i tried to restart my computer, and got the same message. i tried googling it, but still don't understand what its asking me. how do i enter a ticket for your queue?" paul: "if you've done both of those things, you don't enter a ticket into the queue. i will work on it right now. by the way, i think i like you." off to a good relationship, i think!!i was enjoying my morning, it was a quiet one, i was going over backups and running quick random file restores. everything was going great until... &gt;help ticket: &gt;&gt; my computer ate my keybadge and i can't leave to go to lunch until i get it back or replaced. this was a rather confusing help ticket, since we don't have keybadges and her computer shouldn't have been able to eat something that doesn't exist. i decide to go see what she has lost in her computer, i head up to her office. &gt; me: heya lady, what exactly did you computer do, your help ticket didn't make a lot of sense to me. what do you mean it ate your keybadge? &gt; lady: what do you mean, thats what happened, i showed my computer the keybadge, the computer took it and now it won't give it back. &gt; me: i'm not aware of any keybadges, what are you talking about? how did your computer eat it? she looks at me like i'm an idiot, and to be honest, i felt a little dumb for not knowing what she was talking about. then she pointed at my id badge. &gt; lady: there, you're wearing a keybadge, that's what the computer took.... i look at where my id badge is hanging off a csi lanyard and look back up at her, even more confused. &gt; me: this is an id badge, it's got nothing to do with keys. how did you give it to your computer? how did your computer eat your id badge? she scoffs at me, and tosses up her arms, then mutters something about me being dense. the she points under her desk at something, i lean over and see her computer. &gt; lady: just like every morning i come in and turn on my computer, i eject the badge reader and i put in my keybadge so i can log in to the computer without setting off any alarms. i ask her to show me the keybadge reader, she reaches down and pushes the eject button on the dvd-rom drive. the tray slides out a little bit, then hangs and goes back into the computer. &gt; me: oh ok, i see what happened, let me get to the computer. i reach down and eject the dvd-rom drive and grab it as it opens, it whirs and tries to close but i don't let it. i lean over and see a flat laminated card in the drive. i slide in a letter opener and the card pops down then the tray comes completely out of the drive. she claps and does a little happy hop, then holds out her hand for her 'keybadge'. i close then reopen the drive a few times and it seems to be ok, i'll have to send someone around to test it before she actually needs it. i get up and i start to let her know it's not a keybadge, but i decide i don't want to try that fight and go a different route. &gt; me: you don't have to put it in the computer every morning anymore, just lay it on top of the computer or hang it on the side of the monitor, ok? &gt; lady: wow, really? when did it change? &gt; me: it's always worked like that, i just think someone forgot to inform you, we haven't had to put them in the computer for years. i shake my head, then head to my office and close the ticket. a few minutes later i get another one from her about removing the 'keybadge' reader, i close it out with... &gt;&gt; 'keybadge' readers have been converted to audio cd players, but you have to get approval from your manager to listen to music at your desk. about an hour later her manager comes around asking where his 'keybadge' is and if his reader plays audio cds too. so this story happened a few years ago but i recently remembered it and felt like sharing. i was working for an in-store tech support service at the time. for the most part we were supposed to try a quick troubleshoot at the counter and then check in the unit for further repairs. however that being said, our prices weren't that great (not that i could change that) so it wasn't easy for everyone to put up the money for repairs. depending on how nice a person was we might sometimes give them some more time and maybe some service at the counter if it was simple enough fix. one day a nice older lady came in with a 4-year old laptop (vista) with a couple minor issues. i don't really remember the extent of it but one the final issues was a bit harder and we ended up getting about 3 of us working together to get it fixed. when it finally worked she starting getting sad and asked me how much she owed me and i declined saying it was no charge (heck we probably gained more from learning how to fix the issue for future times it occurs). she was very thankful and got all our names so she could let our manager know. overall, it was a great experience. now for the good part! the next day i'm working again and i see her walking in again but this time with a big bag full of something. i get worried that maybe the issue had come back or she was bringing in more stuff for us to fix. nope! turns out she was bringing us bbq pulled pork (thank god for carolina bbq) and peach cobbler! she told us to have at it and she'd be back in a few days for the dishes. we all thanked her and dove in during our lunch breaks. man it was good. the best part was a manager from another part of the store came back and saw we had this and tried to say we were not supposed to accept that. another co-worker said it was fine and not to worry. she responded back "but what if it was poisoned?" at which point my manager turns and says, "well we're not dead yet are we?" we had a laugh while she went off in a huff. goddamn was that some good food.as i wait for an email from the big boss, i wondered if all jobs are this worrying. probably. thirty seconds after i had put down the phone… &gt;new message &gt;**** airz, head of security and it has alerted me to the theft of a rack. i have told him to do nothing. **** -the boss i took a sip of my coffee. it tasted calmer. it tasted like instant. i hate instant. a knock sounded on the door. i looked up and it was one of the night shift it members. &gt;nightit: hey, so remember level three was having connection issues about an hour or two ago? &gt;me: oh yes. &gt;nightit: they’ve still got them. the words shook me down to the core. i had almost forgotten about the users, what was i becoming? &gt;me: right, yes. they’re missing a switch in comms room on level three. can you go find an older switch and patch them up till we can get some new gear in? &gt;nightit: sorry, they are missing a… &gt;me: switch, look don’t worry about it. not important. the nightit looked at me a little suspiciously. &gt;nightit: okay… but… could i get that in writing? i almost chuckled, and forwarded him the email the boss sent to me. nightit went off to fix the switching, whilst i found the box of locks that the vp had forced me to order. they hadn’t been installed yet, mostly because the install order kept getting “lost” before it found its way to maintenance. i needed a drill. maintenance had a drill. i walked down to maintenance, and found it was deserted and the door to the tools was locked. would security have a key? security did not have a key. only maintenance people had keys and all maintenance people go home early. especially on friday. as i walked back to the it department disheartened i dream of an easier job. brain surgeon perhaps. when i arrived at the it department, i wondered if the small drill we kept around it would get through the door. i dismissed it immediately. we didn’t have the drill bits. lost in thought i practically walked into the sales manager, who was standing in it. &gt;me: sorry. i was in another world. &gt;sales: airz! there you are, the big boss sent me down here. &gt;me: its late on friday, why aren’t you at home? &gt;sales: the big boss sent me down here. he said you’d be amenable to giving up a box of keyboards. &gt;me: sorry what? &gt;sales: i need another box of keyboards. &gt;me: its been a fortnight! how?! &gt;sales: the big boss said you’d need the key to the maintenance tool room. so i’ll trade you, one box of keyboards for the maintenance tool room key. oh and one added extra. i looked down at my hands. no coffee. not even instant coffee was this fast. &gt;me: whats the extra? the sales manager looked down at my desk where a box of locks was sitting. &gt;sales: don’t install the lock on the second floor break room. do all the others, just not the second floor. &gt;me: what? i looked down at the box. then it hit me. &gt;me: oh no… no no. i just need to catch a rat. &gt;sales: i’m not sure we have any rat traps. &gt;me: hahaha don’t worry. you’ve got yourself a deal on one condition. you owe me. &gt;sales: i owe you? for keyboards? &gt;me: it’s been a terrible financial strain. only a small favor. &gt;sales: whats the favor? &gt;me: nothing too big. so deal? the sales manager looked hesitant. &gt;me: can’t do many sales without a keyboard. &gt;sales: fine. deal. the sales manager handed me the key to the storeroom. i installed a lock on the door after nightit had fixed the switching situation inside. i went down to the office and picked up my coffee. allies in hand it felt better. coffee is a good ally. i took a sip. tasted like the start of something….something….big? [next]( [older]( this happened about a month ago, this womens laptop kept "wigging out" in her words. sometimes it wouldn't boot up, sometimes she would be working and things would start typing randomly. it couldn't be explained! i thought okay maybe her keyboard on her laptop is getting a key stuck. replaced the keyboard, same issue. sometimes it would be fine, other times you couldn't get the thing to bootup without beeping constantly. on one foggy morning though, i stopped by her office while her backpack was opened. and behold a wireless keyboard in her backpack. turns out she would use it from time to time along with her wireless mouse. oyi i bet she felt dumb!i work the night shift as a support specialist for a fairly large healthcare system in my state. nights are usually slow and we don't get a lot of calls except to change passwords or unlock user accounts. tonight that changed. me-"hi this manimality in it. can i get your name, please?" user gives me his name me- "sir, it doesn't look like you're in our system. have you called in with an issue before?" user-"no i don't think i have and my issue might be a little weird" me-"that's fine. we'll do what we can to help you" user-"well, this girl and i were having sex a bit ago and the condom came off. like...in her. " me-"...sir this is the it department. we handle computer related issues for the hospitals and their clinics. you should really try calling the emergency department" user-"well i tried to google it and can't find any help on my computer" me-"this is still a medical issue and you should really call the ed to get some help" user-"ok can you give me that number?" and so ended my conversation with this guy. i've been working here for a little over a month now and this is really my first brush with "holy shit did that just happen?" hope you guys enjoyed it as much as my coworker and i did! **now, a short disclaimer. this information went through two technical people before coming to me, so i may have gotten some bad information.** at my previous job, i was responsible for managing a large number of laptops out in the field. basically they would come in, i would re-image them, and send them back out as needed. sadly, the guy i replaced was bad at managing his images. so we had four laptop models, and all the images were in terrible condition. half the laptops would come back because for some reason something didn't work right. so i set about re-doing the images, and got two of the four models re-imaged. the field supervisors thought i was the greatest thing ever, and told me their emergencies had been cut in half in the short time i had been working there. they were sleeping better, there was less downtime, and i had gotten everything so efficient i was able to re-image any number of computers that came in and get them back out the same day. well, something important to note was that they had a multi-install key for microsoft office. they refused to give me the key. and one of our images that i hadn't gotten to fixing *didn't have the right key*. well, we had to send out this laptop, and had no extras to send in its place. originally it was going out in a month, but the next day it got bumped up to "the end of the week" and later that day to "in two hours". i needed the key, the head of it wouldn't get back to me, so i used a tool (pcaudit) to pull the registry information and obtain the corporate key. one threat assessment later i was let go. it's a shame too, i really *really* liked that job.this happened around 2001. the company i worked for was a vendor for large corporations. i worked on a team that provided server administration for one particular customer. it was the policy of the customer (and probably every other) than when file servers ran out of space, we were to delete all audio/video media file types. we usually had few angry phone calls come our way, when we cleared space. one particular incident got so heated and just down right nasty, that the customer's senior vp of it gave us his mobile number afterwards and told us to escalate these calls directly to him. as it turned out, i received the very next irate phone call of someone looking for his missing mp3 collection. the guy on the phone was beyond deranged, he was barely coherent his rage was so great. i popped up the vp's phone, put the user on hold and called him up, informed him of the situation. he had me to conference him in to the phone call. which i did. the second i got back on the line with the end user, he flew into another rage that was even worse than before. the vp sat silent, when suddenly the raging end user stopped and stated an instant message popped up on his screen and it was more important than me. then i heard the customer's hold music come on. the vp stated: "he got an im from me, hang on just a second canopyflyer, sorry for wasting your time." i just replied that i was here for as long as he needed me. at that moment i really needed a large bag of popcorn. screw that, i wanted the biggest bag of popcorn in the history of humankind. the end user came back on. the vp then proceeded with one of the best, even toned, dress downs i have ever heard. the end user was sobbing 30 seconds into it. i received an apology and then the call ended. about two weeks later i traveled to the customer's headquarters, along with 2 of my coworkers. this was a normal trip, we usually visited once a quarter during normal times, or much more than that during roll outs and projects. the vp took us out to dinner. while there he handed me a name plate, the type that you put on an office door. it had the user's name and (former) title on it. the vp smiled and told me: "it's yours." tl;dr: we're sorry, the number you have dialed has gotten you fired. this isn't strictly a tech support story, but i figured it would be enjoyed here. first. a small bit of backstory. i am a regular member at my local hackerspace, where we keep a rather large supply of pc parts (most of them fairly dated). about 3 months before the story, i picked up an old wd1200 to use on my pi until i could get my 1tb drive back from western digital (amazing customer support, by the way). due to various reasons (yay ap tests!), i didn't even look at it for a few months. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- i was working on setting up raspbmc on my pi, so i could use it to store movies and tv shows from my dvd collection. once i had the software up and running, i realized i needed something to use as storage. that's when i remembered i had the drive tucked deep into the narnia that is my desk drawer. i plugged it into my home pc to figure out what filesystem it was using so i could re-format it. that's when i saw the files. the drive was nearly full. out of idle curiosity, i dug around a little bit in some of the folders. the previous owner left a massive amount of personal info on the drive. there was insurance info, tax data, addresses, even bank account info. i figured that since this drive was left at my workshop, it must belong to a member/previous member. so i began searching our forums and wiki for the names i found on the drive. i found nothing. i couldn't find any info on the internet about this person. after a few days, i started looking again on the drive for more info. this time around, i found some chat logs (and based on the date, i assumed they were irc logs). with nothing more than a few nicks and channel names, i set off to search the internet again. i tried every irc network i could think of. i trawled the internet and searched every irc network that had those channels. i found nothing. finally after a week, i was ready to give up and just wipe the drive. i decided to give it one more try. finally i found him. he'd thankfully (for me) been using the same irc nick for almost 15 years (most of the logs were dated late 90's early 00's). here's a chat log (i've changed the names and whatnot, obviously). 1:29 -!-

about it &gt; 10 minutes ago in my office: &gt; *phone rings* &gt; me: hello? &gt; guy: yeah my computer is frozen &gt; me: how frozen? are we talking disney levels of frozen? &gt; guy: well it hasn't started singing at me yet &gt; me: there's still time then, i'll be right down **tl;dr: crtl+r &gt; cmd &gt; "taskkill /im let_it_go.exe"** **edit: i know it's win+r and not crtl+r, i just like seeing all you ocd techs twitch and squirm**i'm sure this happens to all tech support technicians but there is nothing i find more frustrating than being blamed for anything that has a plug going wrong in the 12 months after i work on a site.. prime example: last month we deployed avg cloud care (don't judge me.. not my call) to a small business of about 7 machines and a file server. a week or so after: cust: ever since you 'played' on our pcs our printer hasn't worked. me: sorry to hear that sir, are we talking about the hp laserjet in the corner? cust: no the brother printer. me (puzzled, i don't remember selling them a brother printer..): ok and when you say its not working.. what's actually happening? cust: my customers are sending faxes and nothings coming out. me: ahh so this is your fax machine not a printer. cust: same thing. me (a little sarcastically): yes, yes but is the fax machine connected to your pc or even the network? [a short conversation establishes that no it isn't] cust: so you're saying its all just a mighty coincidence! convenient that. me: well could i get you to go and have a look at the fax machine and read out what it says on the display.. [you can see where this is going.... in this case it was a paper jam] the single most annoying thing is that you hang up knowing that despite all reason and logic, they are still blaming you for it happening and will still be bitching about our services to anyone who will listen.good morning (or afternoon, or evening) my fellow it brethren. this is my first tale here so i'll keep it short and sweet. i am fairly new to my it career and most of it has been at generic msp (managed service provider, monthly cost for it support for companies that don't want internal it) company ($genm). one of our newer clients at the time was a group of dental offices. mainly running an evergreen project to upgrade workstations and deal with a few networking issues as they came in. until this call i received one afternoon: &gt;me: $genm, this is noremac speaking, how may i help you today? &gt;user: hi this is $user, from $dentaloffice, our x-ray machine is not working &gt;me: what seems to be the issue? is the workstation not receiving the images? &gt;user: no it's not taking pictures. &gt;me: have you tried calling the vendor? &gt;user: no we haven't. we figured since you're our new it service that you would be able to fix it. &gt;me: unfortunately, this piece of machinery is out of our area of service, so you'll need to contact your vendor for support. overall it was a pleasant conversation, but i don't think the owner would be very happy if some random it people started fooling around with a very expensive, integral machine in their operation. tl;dr: user drives airplane to local mechanic. edit: added a description for msp.night shift in it is a rough job. after realizing my earlier mistake was a lack of communication between night time it and regular it i decided to speak with the night it manager. after sending him an email and finding that same email in *my* inbox i realized i *was* the night it manager. huh. i scheduled myself for a night shift. ***** monday 7pm arriving at work as the sun set was odd, we’ve no real overlap between normal it and night it i didn’t really know what to do. i sat at my desk. a few hours later nightowl and eveninglady rolled into work. seeing the office light on, they both entered my office &gt;nightowl: another long day, huh? &gt;me: actually i’ve scheduled myself for a night shift. the two regular night staff looked sideways to each other. &gt;eveninglady: a night shift? won’t your wife want you home? &gt;me: alas, so far unmarried. see, this will be good. you’ll get to know more about me and i’ll learn more about you! eveninglady mouth moved as if she wanted to say something but nightowl put his hand on her shoulder consolingly. &gt;nightowl: glad to have the help. &gt;eveninglady: although we don’t really need ... nightowl’s hand moved from eveninglady’s shoulder and swiveled her out the door. guiding her away from my office and leaving me alone. after a few moments of silence where i checked my emails (blank) and the queue (blank). i realized i had no idea what to do. i walked out into the department where eveninglady and nightowl were whispering conspiratorially. they stopped when they noticed my arrival. &gt;me: so what is it you do... during the night? &gt;nightowl: we er ... first check the backups! nightowl and i went over to a computer, the backups were running fine. it took about twenty seconds to check. &gt;me: so... i guess we rebuild from a backup now? check they’re backing up properly. eveninglady had an expression between exasperation and unhappiness. &gt;me: no point in having backups if you dunno if they’re useable, right? &gt;eveninglady: just... stop worrying. it’s working. you don’t need to baby us, go home. sleep. &gt;me: you **do** check the backups?! right? my concern stemmed on my junior self, who having created a backup system at a previous job was unable to reconstruct any data from it. i’d lost a lot of data the day that failed. &gt;nightowl: of course we do! eveninglady and i usually recover from backup every friday. she just likes the schedule. nightowl was giving eveninglady significant looks. she sat silently. &gt;me: should we try recover one now? &gt;nightowl: i mean... this *is* usually a friday job. it was too late to convince me of that though, i’d already started copying the backup files over to a testing environment. around an hour later, the recovery had crashed. the error message was infuriating “error: crash. reason: error.” &gt;nightowl: huh, thats never happened before. &gt;me: i might have to schedule myself on for some more nights.... eveninglady looked livid.i swear to $deity, this story is true. **problem description:** paper jam now no power to printer **root cause:** christmas lights were plugged into a loose outlet, and the plug kept falling out. user unplugged printer, plugged the christmas lights into the printer outlet, and plugged the printer into the loose outlet. **solution:** moved printer plug to bottom outlet where christmas lights were plugged in. put call in to maintenance to replace outlet. (edit: formatting)i might have to post this on /r/talesfromretail as well as here since i was working as a computer tech in a retail store at the time of the incident. i had a customer in probably his mid 50's bring in a computer that was having problems booting up. the machine was about 5 years old and had obviously not had extreme care given. as soon as i looked at the computer and saw all of the symptoms for myself i knew is was a hard drive failing. i called the customer to give him the diagnosis and some options for repair as well as prices. he then asked me if i could recover any of his music because it was apparently the only thing he used his computer for. i asked if he had ever made a backup, he said no (of course). i then told him that our data recovery service was additional to the general laptop repair. he just couldn't fathom that i would charge him more just to recover his precious music. this was when i knew he was going to be trouble. i tried to explain what went on with a data recovery and how long it took and why it took so many man hours. i also explained to him that if we weren't able to recover the data that there would be no charge. he wasn't buying it. i told him that if he wanted the new drive put in and a new system installed that i could do that while he was deciding about the data recovery. he balked at the price again. ugh. essentially he tried to tell me that i was trying to rob him and that he could get it done any number of places for cheaper. i (as politely as i could) told him he was welcome to call around and check and i would wait for him to call back. about an hour later he calls back and in a very defeated tone he said "go ahead and do it." he also authorized the data recovery. i replaced the drive and started the data recovery. i worked myself to death trying to recover that data. all of his documents, movies, music, etc were recovered. i was so proud of myself. it took much longer than i expected so i decided to knock off some of the labor price from the data recovery as a gesture of good will. i worked for a small business and we really needed repeat customers, so i was authorized to do so. this is where the story gets stupid. the man comes in to pick up his computer with all his recovered data. he, understandably, wanted to look the computer over before he paid for it. so he's looking through all his music and seems fairly pleased. then he says "why doesn't my toolbar look the same". i explained to him that that was one thing that seemed too corrupted to retrieve was some of his user account data, so i had to create a new account and his dock wouldn't look the same. he flipped shit. started yelling at me and stuff. he was screaming in the store "this is a f*****g ripoff!" or "you're a bunch of m*****f***** scam artists!" then the jumps toward the counter waving his hands at me and grabs all of his stuff and runs to the door. the computer with the new drive, the old drive and all the recovered data. all i could say was "sir, if you'll stop yelling in the showroom we'll figure this out". he kept yelling. finally i warned him twice that if he stepped one foot out the door that i would have to report the theft and that we have cameras recording in our store at all times and that i would have multiple ways to prove he didn't pay. he then starts shouting "well then sue me!" "you'll have to f******g sue me! you bunch of liars!" and then walks out the door and gets in his car to drive away. i told one of my co-workers to call the police and stepped outside to take a photo of his license plate. what this gentleman didn't understand was that when he dropped the computer off we required multiple kinds of contact info. so we had his name, phone number, email address and street address. i had the serial number for the machine, the drive and now i had his license plate number. the police came and took a statement from my co-worker and i, then called the owner of the store and asked what he wanted to do. the pd was really helpful, they told us that they were allowed to press charges on behalf of us for theft of goods and services. i'm not sure what happened to the guy, but i understand that the police went to his million dollar home (yes, this guy lived in a very nice country club neighborhood) and took him in in front of all of his neighbors. we did get all of our money for the repair, but i'm not sure if any other damages were paid. that was in the top 5 most stressful days of my life. most people ask us to do things for them, but some people like the diy route and would rather just borrow the tools. one such guy came in and borrowed a phillips screwdriver. i gave him the #2 size and asked if it would work, he said yes. then he came back and asked to borrow some solder and use a soldering station. but what kind of solder does he need? imagine that, he doesn't know! he leaves to find out. he is unable to figure it out and asks for "regular." i wasn't in the mood to explain how that works so i just gave him whatever reel was closest. he then returns later and says it must have been wrong because it does't stick. he wants to know if we have other kinds. i say that different kinds are for different purposes, assuming that this time he would go off and research and come back with an idea. he came back with a laptop and asked "what kind of solder do i need for this screw?" and pointed to a screw on the bottom. it turns out that he wanted to replace the hard drive in his laptop. rather than ask for help, he decided to diy it and ask for the screwdriver. but the #2 phillips was too large. rather than ask for a smaller screwdriver, he decided to ask for solder. his plan was to apply the solder to the screw and jam the screwdriver into it while it was still hot, then let it cool. then he would remove the screw, because in this magical world the solder would "stick" and turning the solder would turn the screw! voila. of course, this wasn't working for him, so we got the appropriate screwdriver size and removed the screw the old fashioned way instead. the moral of this story is that phillips head screwdrivers and soldering irons are not often interchangeable tools. people who think they are should not be lent either.i used to have a few computer stores but sold them when the book money started to dwarf the store income. i took off a few years, enjoyed life, but the guy who bought my stores asked me to come back and help him open up a bunch of them all around the state. wife and i talked it over, finally decided to do it. first, i had to get the original ones back into shape, since they'd pretty much been run into the ground. that's where i've been lately, btw. anyway, last night this batshit crazy woman came in (i'd had a few run-ins with her before) claiming that i was obligated to give her the "windows anytime upgrade" license key. huh? i showed her that "windows anytime upgrade" wasn't specifically a *version* of windows, but a program through which someone could upgrade their version of windows from home to professional or ultimate. she didn't believe me and kept repeating that she'd spent an hour on the phone with microsoft and that they'd told her she'd have to talk to the people who'd sold her the system. i kept telling her that there wasn't an "anytime upgrade" version of windows so finally she navigated to the properties screen, pointed triumphantly at the windows edition and the copyright notice underneath and said accusingly, "you didn't even sell me a current version! this one is from 2009 and i bought the computer in 2012!" "ma'am, that's the copyright notice. there is no specific 2009 version of windows 7. it's constantly updating." "are you going to give me the windows anytime key or not?!?!?!!" it was at this time that i finally lost it. my employees were shaking with laughter, tears streaming down their faces, trying to hold it in and failing. "ma'am, i can't give you a key to something that doesn't exist!" she glared at me, took out antiseptic wipes, cleaned everything i'd touched, grabbed her computer, and left. i can't wait to see her again. apparently she'd been causing the employees hell for over a year and the ones that were left (that i didn't fire, actually -- it was a massacre) hated her and have really enjoyed seeing me interact with her. good times. edit: oh, and btw, i like getting random snapchats from people so if you're bored, holla at "warlizard". edit 2: at the store, busting ass, but holy sweet mother of god the snaps i'm getting are awesome! i've had gorgeous girls, crazy guys, pics all around the world, and one guy sent me a boob shot..... not at all what i expected, but thanks for the fun during a really annoying day. keep 'em up. i snap like a fiend, usually nothing important, but hey, you guys made my day.i absolutely lost my sh!t on a call with a vendor yesterday. since they were brought on a year ago, &lt;-!contractor!-&gt; has never been able to do anything right. since *april*, we've been trying to get a change order in place with them so we can remove many of the devices that we're decommissioning from monitoring, but they have been unable to provide us with a list of the devices that they are actually monitoring. when they provide us with a spreadsheet, it's missing devices they are supposedly keeping an eye on. when asked, they can't give a straight answer as to why they're not on the list, but they claim that they are monitoring them and alerting on them. a little over a month ago, i decided to test them on that. i took down a switch that they claimed to me monitoring but wasn't on their list. i never got an alert. i did it with another device not on the list but supposedly monitored, and received the same result. when i informed them of what i'm seeing and what i've done, they started trying to run me around in circles. they kept telling me that they would have a meeting about it "next week" when some "key people" were back off vacation, so i informed them that i would not be letting my boss pay the bill until we had this sorted out, after all, they aren't providing the services that we're paying for and billing us for things we've asked to remove. the entire time we're trying to get this list straightened out, they're charging us full price because we never signed the change order. i haven't signed it because it's never correct. we're not talking about pennies either, this bill is over $20k per month. after that email, they were miraculously able to get that meeting together that afternoon (last thursday). yesterday was when they were going to give me the answers to these questions i had. it just so happens that at 8:00am yesterday, one of our datacenters experienced an outage. bgp went down for right at 10 minutes, and while my network management software caught it, theirs didn't. during the meeting, they were making all kinds of stuff up about what was being monitored and what wasn't. i brought up the fact that a datacenter went down just an hour and 30 minutes earlier and i never got an alert on that, which i should have immediately. after giving them the ip and hostname, i sat there and listened as the excuses started rolling in... they said their software didn't show any missed polling data and i must be mistaken that it went down. &gt;*"how do you know it went down?"* &gt;"my nms server said it did". i had them make me presenter and i shared my screen to show them. &gt;*"did you verify that it really went down?"* &gt;"here's my still open command prompt window open with the failed pings." &gt;*"how do you know it wasn't just your computer?"* &gt;"a ping to another device in that datacenter but on a different circuit worked fine." &gt;*"did you verify on the device itself that it really went down? i don't see anything in the logs."* i show them the bgp summary where bgp has only been up for an hour and a half... then they told me that the subnet their server is on must have some sort of other route in it to get to that device that my nms server and laptop don't have. my nms server and their server are on the same subnet. in fact, they're both vms on the same physical server. but i showed them the backup nms server at a different location just to prove that it had no connection too. they kept telling me that it must be something with all my different servers, because they're polling that device every 60 seconds and they have no missed polls. another technical resource from their side decides to add his two cents. &gt;*"well, we didn't receive an snmp trap that it went down, and according to the configuration you're showing us, it's configured to send those traps, so it must not have really went down."* a couple other guys on their team immediately come to his defense to explain to me that he's right, if there's no trap, then there's no problem. i had a simple question. &gt;"how is a device going to send a trap when there's no network connection between it and you? bgp was down. there was no route." i check a different log file and sure enough, it shows the trap being fired. they didn't get it because there was nowhere for it to go. what i didn't tell them is that i called a buddy of mine that works for our mpls provider and had him kill the connection for me. all these things they are coming up with are just them reaching at straws because they can't explain why their stuff doesn't work. that's when the manager that's running the show decides to open up his cake hole... &gt;*"well, that device isn't on the list of devices you said you wanted to monitor going forward."* &gt;"you mean the list we sent you yesterday that brought you down from 500+ devices to 50? the list that you replied back that you wanted to have a meeting about with senior management about sometime next week before you sent us the change order because it cuts the bill by 90%?" &gt;*"oh, i'm sorry. that's my fault. i sent that list to the overseas team and told them to only alert on the devices that were on it. that's why you didn't get an alert, because we're not going to be monitoring it once we get the change order complete."* &gt;"dude, your team has been telling me for 10 minutes that your server had no idea the device went down, and now you're going to make up some excuse about telling the overseas team not to alert on it?" &gt;*"i'm not making up excuses, that has to be what happened."* &gt;"or, your software is garbage and you team don't know how to use it." at this point, my server guy pipes in. he lost some drives in the san last week, on two separate occasions, and they never alerted him on that. the excuses on that start pouring in. the longer we're on this call, the more they are trying on my patience. what made me snap was when we told them that we only wanted up/down monitoring on that list of 50 devices and would be removing all application level stuff. prior to sending them that list, we had an internal call where the engineers were asking for them to be fired, but management wouldn't allow it. plus, somehow or another, they managed to sneak in a requirement that we give them 90 days notice before ending the contract, and my previous boss (who hired them to begin with and left for another company a few months back) had signed a new contract with them just a couple weeks before leaving, where he said we'd be keeping them until the end of august. i'm pretty sure he got a kickback from these idiots, it's the only thing that can explain all this. the manager decides that he's going to try to sell me on keeping the other monitoring over just up/down. &gt;*"kc, are you sure that you only want up/down monitoring? you'd be losing..."* &gt;"yeah, i'm just going to stop you right there. i won't be losing anything. if it were up to the engineering staff, your ass would have hit the skids months ago. i want to replace you with a small shell script. fortunately for you, management won't allow that." i then tore into their ass for a good 4 or 5 minutes, gradually getting more and angry to the point that i was verging on unprofessional. i have tried to hold these people's hand through this. i even took a week out of my schedule to fly down to their offices and walk them through everything. it did nothing. in all my years of working in this field, i have never run across a vendor that is more inept at their job than this. and to think that we pay these people over a quarter million dollars a year to service this account. today they had the audacity to have the salesman call me to try to change my mind about dropping their services down to nearly nothing. not the managed services director, not the technical lead, no one to tell me that they'll fix the problem. they sent a salesman to try to get me to spend more money with them. sorry this is so long and rant-y. i'm just at the end of my rope with the yahoos, and if i could, i'd plaster their name all over this post so you could use my experience as a warning to not use them, but unfortunately i can't. what i can promise you is that once this contract is over, i will be posting an update with that information. edit: guys, stop pming me. i will not tell you who the company is. very quick one here that has just happened... --- vp - important guy who understands technical information and generally leads the region. (can be a good guy too) mb - my boss --- email from vp. &gt;&gt;all, as you may not be aware, security is currently running an anti- phishing campaign to better educate users on the threat of external emails. &gt;&gt;i am glad to say, that out of the 700 staff in my direct, only 5 have opened any items from the security team. &gt;&gt;those members and i have all been booked into training session to better educate the importance of identifying these malicous emails. &gt;&gt;thank you, and well done again! in a reply chain to my boss (mb) &gt;&gt;me: does this imply that vp opened the phishing email?! &gt;&gt;mb: i can confirm that he was one of the 5, yes... apparently, vp had a long day and the email looked like one that he had received earlier in the week. after opening it, he immediately realised his error and phoned security. this did not, however, save him from a scolding from his boss and the security team! can't really fault him for this, but i do like the attempt to cover it up! ---- bonus. here is the email. &gt;&gt;warning! &gt;&gt;your mailbox has exceeded the storage limit which is 5gb as set by your administrator, you are currently running on 7.8gb,to re-validate your mailbox click here &lt;--url edited out--&gt; to increase your mailbox size or you lose your account within 24 hours. &gt;&gt;system admin ---- tl;dr - boss fails to follow basic security, gets caught and has to go back to school. i love security audits, they prove some people are incompetant, or that they are severly overworked! **edit** - formatting. **update** sorry guys, i just need to clear something up here. i know it's 24 hours later nearly, however when the vp mentioned opening the email, that itself was not the failure. the failure was logged through the users opening that link to increase their mailbox size, as each link was specifically generated for each users email. i know it's not very clear, but that is manglement!many moons ago, i was working on the family printer. like most of these all-in-ones at the time, they would seemingly quit for no reason, only to work (again, for no reason) when someone started looking at the problem. in this tale, i had one of the few times it just would not work. i had dusted the inside with canned air, unpluged and repluged everything, and even replaced the cartridges. it still sat there, error light blinking. after much frustration, i was withdrawing my hand from the depths of the foul device, when i cut my hand on the cartridge assembly. frustrated after an hour of work on this pos, i slammed the printer shut, and yelled: "there! a blood sacrifice! happy?" and a test page started to print. tl;dr: blood for the print god!i used to work tech support for my college before they had the resources to actually hire people who knew what they were doing. at the time they were limited to what students they could recruit who they felt were trainable. apparently i was one such student, though i felt like a fish out of water being an education major working with computer science and it majors. anywho... i am a somewhat fast learner and apparently i have logic, so i was able to figure out a fair number of issues on my own that were simple. one later evening, i was the poor wretch who pulled the short straw to close that night. i get a call from one of the faculty. we'll call him "prof" &gt;me: hello, client services, this is zsign, how can i help you? &gt;prof: yeah, hi, listen, do you know where i can buy a bigger mouse pad? cue alarm bells... &gt;me: uh, sorry, a bigger what now? &gt;prof: mouse pad. i need to move the cursor over more, but the mouse is at the very edge. &gt;me: *facepalm* you don't really need one sir. &gt;prof: really? &gt;me: yes, try this for me. oh, are you trying to move the mouse left or right? &gt;prof: to the right. &gt;me: ok, fine, just go with me on this. pick the mouse phisically up, then move it to the left, then put it down on the mousepad again. now try moving it to the right again. &gt;prof: ahhh! thanks! that was easy! &gt;me: have a good night sir... this is a man with a ph.d. here is a tale from a previous job i had in outsourced it. i worked for a small company, and handled all of the incoming commercial client calls. on this day, i was out at another small business installing their new server. i had everything packed and ready to head out the door, and the phone rings. it was one of our biggest clients. they were having all sorts of strange issues. after listening to the complaints, it took me 5 minutes to determine there was something on the network fighting with the dhcp server. i told my boss, the owner, what was going on, and that i need him to help them figure out what it is. i told him it is likely a wireless router in one of these two geeks offices. they were the types to get new toys and want to play. then i head off to the server install i have scheduled. i don't get any updates on the situation, so i check in with him the next morning to see how things are going. apparently it was much more serious then i thought. after taking a look, he decided to hire an outside consultant who has done some shady work for us from time to time. the consultant concludes they are being hacked from china, and he changed their internal ip structure/subnet to thwart their hacking atttepts. of course this brought their network to a screeching halt. dozens of servers, printers, etc on static ip addresses abandoned and alone. i hobble my way out there...oh yeah, im doing all this on crutches with a broken foot btw...and start to work on changing the static addresses. after doing this for awhile, i notice im still having weird issues...what is this address i keep getting assigned? let's go to the gateway. netgear...hmm...they have a sonic wall. i hobble my way up the stairs to the first of the two nerds that i asked my boss to check with yesterday. he is sittting at his desk. i hobble around him without saying a word amd unplug the damn router behind him. "don't plug this in". i go back downstairs. problem solved. it was a full week before the last of the residual issues were fixed from the ip structure change. to this day the client thinks china attacked them. that was the day i updated my resume and vowed to get a new boss.here's one on the lighter side of tfts... so i was dealing with an employee for one of my client offices having trouble connecting to their terminal server from home. he stated it wasn't the normal error he's seen before, and i taught him very patiently how to take a screenshot, paste to blank email, then send it to myself so i could resolve the issue for him, we went through the process multiple times and i thought he had it down pat. the next day while i'm out at their office, he comes up and hands me his 'screenshot' of the error. turns out he couldn't figure out the darned screenshot key at home and decided to draw this fine error out for me, i mean look at the detail in the x on the left. anyway, i wish all employees gave at least half this mans efforts when they come across an error or problem, really helped me resolve his issue quickly with little hassle. ["screenshot" here =)](long time reader, first time poster. so this story happened to me yesterday, and i thought you all would love this. i work at a university’s technology help desk. we have computers that we check-out to students. so this one student, let’s call him macbook bro, comes up to the desk and checks out a mac laptop. he comes back a few minutes later. &gt; macbook bro: this charger doesn’t work. &gt; me: okay, i’ll swap it out. our chargers get abused a lot, so i thought nothing of it when he said it didn’t work. about 15 minutes later, he comes back again, this time with the computer. &gt; macbook bro: hey, this computer doesn’t charge and it won’t turn on. &gt; me: huh, okay. let’s swap the computer out. &gt; macbook bro: yeah, i opened the mac to make sure the battery was connected and everything. i had not had enough time to check the charger, so i figured it was just the mac that wasn’t working and that the original charger was fine. at the time, i didn’t hear that he said he opened our mac to make sure the battery was connected. (i realize i should have said something at this point.) so, i checked out another mac to him. about 40 minutes later, he comes back to return the equipment. &gt; macbook bro: so, listen. i spilled water on my personal laptop and i wanted to use one of yours to test my components to see if they still work. so, i took apart two of your macs. but, when i put this one back together, the keyboard stopped working. so… he told me all of this, and i was at a loss for words. i really didn’t know what to say. i was more surprised that someone would do this to equipment that they don’t own. &gt; me: you’re not supposed to do this. you’re not allowed to open up the check-out equipment. &gt; macbook bro: oh. i didn’t know that. wtf. why would you think it’s okay to open up a laptop that you don’t own and then mess it up? even if he didn’t tell me, i would have caught on to what happened since our checkout system keeps track of who the last person was to get the equipment. hope he enjoys paying for 2 macs. edit 1... tech looked at the second mac that had the messed up keyboard. looks like the ribbon cable was bent. he fixed it and now the keyboard works. but, wifi is not working correctly. not sure if its hardware or software so im going to just reformat it and see if that fixes it. still waiting to see whats up with the first laptop. edit 2... the second laptop the client took apart is working fine now. reformat fixed wifi issues. the first one on the other hand is fried. waiting to see what the cost is to fix it.**backstory:** i work as a sysadmin for a userbase of 100-200 onsite and offsite users. at any one time we may have roughly half of that in our multi-storey building. any desk may have either a desktop or laptop, depending on the users job description, and if they may work offsite. today, our power went out, which is unusual. all the laptops were fine, but obviously all the desktops lost power. each floor has a local ups to support the networking switches (and in turn, the poe wifi aps), as does the server room. the practical implication of this is only those with desktops were really affected - although, it was a little dimmer than usual with only the emergency lighting. when the power failed, we started moving through the floors, checking our users were okay - zabbix already told us the rest: wifi still running for those who rely on it, esxi hosts and routers are online, internet accessible. no stress. **conversation with $user:** myself: "everything okay over here?" $user: "no! it's all down! i can't do anything!" myself: "what do you mean? everything should be running fine, you have a laptop." $user: "no one is on skype! look! $receptionist isn't online!" myself: "that's because $receptionist has a desktop, which isn't running because of the power outage. look, $anotheruser is online." $user: "oh. true." **tl;dr:** todo: put receptionist's skype availability into zabbix.in my younger days, during the golden age of it (mid-late 90's), i was called in as the citrix consultant to a major ad agency in midtown manhattan. seems their citrix server had gone belly-up, as a result no one across the enterprise was able to login to hyperion. i get the call from my boss, please go assist- he just got off the phone with their cfo and was really concerned. cfo had already contacted compaq (was a proliant server) and microsoft. two consultants respectively had been there all morning and couldn't bring the server back online. i was to build a citrix server asap if the original server couldn't be salvaged. i walk into a server room with 2 older gentlemen, cfo, and sysadmin staring at a black screen displaying "os loader loader not found" or whatever was the windows nt 3.5/ winframe message back then" i ask them, is there a floppy in there? the consultants of course chuckle "we are way beyond that kid." i asked if i can take a look. "let this punk kid through" said the ms consultant. pretty unprofessional i thought. in any event, i make my way to the server, reboot it and notice only one hot plug drive is flashing with drive activity. (raid 1). i shut down the server, partially slide out the drive without activity and power on. boom...a few minutes later we have a booting server. i turn to the compaq guy and tell him to get a replacement drive. turn to the ms guy and tell him, something to the effect an nt bootable floppy would have probably got the server booted. i made these clowns look bad in front of the cfo and sysadmin, got more business for my it company and was given the rest of the afternoon off. so a couple years ago a local business was turned to me to acquire a server on the advice of a local consultant. when i asked the office manager why they didn't go with the consultant for the work he said that he felt like the price was inflated and he declined. fair enough, i suppose. so i asked him what the consultant recommended and was handed the sheet. apparently this office was using local accounts on winxp for authentication, no backups and no network filer, they used simple file sharing to share files in the office. ugh. so the consultant recommended a server for ad, running sbs 2008 with 20 cals so they had room to grow and it had volume shadow copy so if something got deleted it could be recovered easily. the owner was also recommended to buy tapes for backup, but he nixed this idea saying he didn't want to have to deal with tapes....wat? whatever, he wants to take it in the pooper once his drives fail, that's on him. then he hands me a sheet of paper with his requirements. i found this odd since he is not technically capable of using his computer much less dictating hardware requirements. but lets see what he has... 2 quad core xeons 32gb ram 3tb sata drive with no raid ummm, wat? so i first ask him if he'd rather use raid in case of drive failures, nope. ok then what about the machine, are you planning on running virtual machines? hosting your own email internally? running a busy sql server? nope, nope, and nope. huh. ok, so i tell him that for his purposes a single quad core xeon would be more than enough with 8gb of ram. nope, he is adament that it has to be that exact specs. i ask him if he got those specs from the consultant? nope, but i know that's what we need. your money, guy. so i go out and spec the server with the sbs 2008 license and cals, print it out with an invoice for $bucketso'money. understandably he flips his shit. manager: so why is this so expensive? **pavix:** there's an itemization on there, indicating the price of everything. i wouldn't be able to cut the price in half, but i'd be able to reduce the cost by $metric-shitton if we went with a single xeon solution with 8gb of ram which is more than enough for what you're using it for **manager:** no, it has to be the exact specs i stated **pavix:** if you don't mind me asking, who gave you those specs? it seems like someone at least a little familiar with it work since the specifically referenced xeons, sata etc. **manager:** look, i don't know what you're getting at. we've already hired a consultant, just do your damn job! i would like to point out that this is typically where i'd nope! right out but i wanted the money so whatever. i got the manager to approve the budget, ordered the kit and left. i get a call a week and a half later saying the order is there and asking if i could drop by to get it setup. sure. so i get there, toss in my earphones and start building the server. get it racked, plug in monitor, mouse and keyboard and begin the sbs install. as i'm about to grab another refill of water and hit the can, the manager comes in with some kid that's about 17 or 18. **manager:** hey pavix, this is jeremy **pavix:** hey jeremy, what's up? **jeremy:** nothin' i'm just coming to help. **pavix:** help with what? **manager:** well, jeremy has got software he needs to install on the server once the server is up. **pavix:** what software? if it's licensed and was installed from the old server i can do the migration for you once i find the media. **manager:** this is something only jeremy can do. just let him know once you're done. hmmm...dafuq? whatever, i don't have time for this crap. so i go around getting the names of all the employees, get ad setup, create accounts with default passwords for everyone and go around joining their computer to the domain. there's a few squabblers of how the "new system is slower" and "why did we have to change if the old system worked" worked, huh? if by worked you mean no way to remotely manage accounts easily, no way to easily apply security permissions, no easy way to reset a password if you forgot yours....oh, well of course you will have to use a password to get in. so after everyone is logged into their domain accounts and the computers are on the domain i set about setting up shared network folders when jeremy comes into the closet. **jeremy:** are you almost done? **pavix:** umm, in a bit. what did you need? **jeremy:** well, i wanted to get this software setup. **pavix:** what software? **jeremy:** bf3 dedicated server **pavix:** umm, what? are you the one that gave the manager the server specs? **jeremy:** yea, i went on a forum and asked this group what server stuff they had so i could get it too and host my own server i walk into the manager's office and explain what was just told to me. he told me that it wasn't my responsiblity and to finish the install. so i go back, get shares setup to match what was preexisting, setup ou's, added the users with correct levels, had users reboot and test. copied all the files over after configuring vss. i goto the manager and explain that it's done, but that i won't be offering any support to this network in the future if he's going to let his kid host a bf3 server on the domain controller. after about 15 minutes of yelling, saying i'm unprofessional and how he knows more about it than me and that a bf3 server won't affect the server or it's security he begrudgingly cut me a check for my hours. his number is now on my verizon block list because fuck that. [edit] wow! front page, thank you so much :) **update** yesterday since this was a somewhat popular post i decided to reach out to the consultant who referred the customer to me and ask if he ever heard from them again. of course he has, where else was the customer going to go, geeksquad? anyway, i know this post is getting long in the tooth and if this should be a new posting feel free to let me know mods. first thing's first, it was mw3 not bf3 he was hosting off this new server. my apologies for the confusion, i've never setup a server for either so i wasn't aware of the restrictions origin/ea has for servers. so after i left jeremy tried downloading his shiny new server software, if what i'm being told is correct it's run through steam?, but anyone that has logged into a windows server with an administrative account knows that ie runs in "hardened mode" to protect novice admins from doing something stupid. but jeremy wouldn't be thwarted by some geek engineers from ms, oh no! he went back to the forums asking how to get the software on his machine, and the internet being incredibly helpful, suggested he download firefox on another machine, put the installer on a flash drive and plug it into the server. so there was jeremy with an unrestricted browser downloading whatever he wanted. oh boy! and i know what you're going to ask..."but what about his firewall? wouldn't that block him?" i'm glad you asked. when the network was setup, the contractor was quite adament about using private 192.168 ip ranges, but the ladies didn't want to have to deal with pesky vpn to rdp into their machines, and couldn't be bothered to change ports that corrispond to each of the workstations. nope, instead every machine in the office has public routable ip addresses. this of course includes their network printer and the server. oh joy. and they don't restrict inbound or outbound traffic in any way. after a week network shares were unavailable, jeremy stopped all services that the helpful gamer forum didn't recognize....they're gamers so they should know all things it, right?....which included volume shadow copy service so backups weren't being done. oh and the ladies, or jeremy, found some way to enable c$ shares on all workstations so after jeremy started to get the "scary" fbi virus warnings on his machine the entire office got it as well. this is a real estate office so hippa doesn't apply but i'm sure there are some legalities. so my friend got called in to quote a price to fix it. he said he wouldn't "fix" it except to nuke and pave all workstations, all servers and that he wouldn't hand over administrative credentials until a paid it staffer contacted him. they politely declined. i'm guessing the manager tried my phone, was told there are "call restrictions in place" and moved on. either way, i have securely noped my way out of this. hello r/tfts long time reader first time posting, i don't speak native english so please bear with me. first of all i'm a developer(light your pitchforks and sharpen your torches) and my job is all about developing new business oriented software for the company i work for. here's the deal, when my team deploys a new piece of software. we like to do one week or so of help desk to get to know how the users feel about the software and what could be improved. we did this the last week and it was my first time doing it. i get a call from a middle management guy and as soon i pick up the phone he starts shouting: ($amm = angry middle manager, $me = me) &gt; $amm: this new software is a piece of crap! it broke my computer, fix it now! &gt; $me(trying to be polite): are you sure? we have been getting some feedback saying the software works great and is a really nice tool to have. &gt; $amm(still shouting): of course i'm sure! do you think i'm stupid or what?! i'm reporting you to the cto for this, you incompetent!(this were his exact words) &gt; $me: no sir i don't think you are stupid, i'm saying that we have no errors or malfunctions reported until now from the people that received the software. i will go to your office to see if we can figure out what's the problem. &gt; $amm: get here now! i can't waste time because of other people ignorance, i have real work to do! i hung up the phone, head out to his office and knock on the door, he tells me to come in. when i entered the room it felt like going to war, i was really nervous. &gt; $amm: it's about time you guys do something, fix my computer now! so i get to his computer and the first thing that hits me is that the computer is turned off. so i pressed the power button and nothing happens. &gt; $me: this is weird, it seems your computer doesn't want to turn on. maybe... &gt; $amm(interrupts me): of course it doesn't, you guys broke it! &gt; $me: that's is really unlikely sir. let me check something. it was time to convert all the knowledge i gather from r/tfts into real life so i went to check if everything is plugged in. lo and behold, the power cord is missing. &gt; $me: sir, it seems your computer doesn't have a power cord, do you know anything about that? &gt; $amm: i removed it yesterday because i tripped on it when i was leaving the office. &gt; $me: the computer doesn't work without a power cord... &gt; $amm(shouting for some reason): yeah?! what about the battery?! &gt; $me: it's a desktop, it doesn't have a battery. &gt; $amm: you should tell people about that! i wasted most of my day on this! &gt; $me(in the most soul crushing way to say it): no... i turned my back to him and went back to my office suffering from a mild ptsd, later that day i got a call from the cto. the amm actually reported me to the cto when i was heading to his office, i told him what happened, we laugh about it and he says he is going to call $amm to give him a "word". never heard of $amm again. edit: in the title it should be "time" instead of "ticket". one word. edit2: chord -&gt; cord edit3: oh god the errors. bare with me -&gt; bear with mefor refference, my flair is"how should i know if it's plugged in? im not an engineer!!!". story: it started when someone said that their keyboard wasnt workin, so i checked it out. when i arrived, their keyboard was already disconnected and waiting for me to take it, so i brought it to my area where i plugged it in and smashed my face on it a few times (not realy), i noticed that it was working, so i brought it back and asked if it was plugged in before i took it. the answer i was met with was "how should i know if it's plugged in? im not an engineer!!!". **edit: holy upvote batman! 1124 upvotes in 1 day!!** update: user claims keyboard is still broken after showing that it worksi sit down at my desk and search for coffee. it isn’t around. i’m sad. a new radio sits on my desk, a reward for becoming head of security. not a reward i wanted. i get a call. its an it intern, he’s helping our head of sales with her computer and apparently it’s causing trouble. &gt;intern: hey, this lady is asking for you. she says she needs the boss. &gt;me: okay put her on the phone. &gt;sales: hey airz, heard about the new promotion. congratulations. she said this entire line with such distain i could hear venom dripping off every word. &gt;sales: i need you to get up here and fix this machine. the tech you sent up can’t handle it. &gt;me: i’m sure he can. put him back on. &gt;intern: yep im back. &gt;me: whats wrong with the machine? &gt;intern: nothing major, just a hard disk error. it probably needs replacing. &gt;me: okay pack it up and bring it down. as i wonder how far i can stretch a budget for hdd that currently sits at zero i hear through the phone an argument erupt. &gt;sales: you can’t take it, give me the phone i want to talk to your boss. we need this machine. &gt;intern: it needs replacing im afraid…. you know what? okay, here. i hear the phone crackle as it passes between the two. &gt;sales: you need to get up here now, and sort this issue out. he keeps trying to take the desktop away. &gt;me: yes unfortunately i think it’ll need replacing. it’ll be back soon though don’t worry. &gt;sales: no. &gt;me: no? &gt;sales: no. &gt;me: okay. no. it’ll stay as it is. &gt;sales: no. you get up here and fix it. i look out over the department. i see other techs doing work. i feel bad for the intern who’s at sales dealing with this lady. i give in. &gt;me: fine. ill be up in a sec. i get up to the floor. i can see intern looking glad to see me, i send him back downstairs with a smile and an order for coffee. i sit at the computer. the hdd is corrupted. &gt;me: this computer will have to come with me i’m afraid. &gt;sales: no, it stays. &gt;me: i can’t fix it here. &gt;sales: you’ll stay here till its fixed. &gt;me: no? &gt;sales: im going to call the vp. &gt;me: okay. we waited around till the vp arrived, he gave me a big smile. i knew he worshiped the feet of sales however. its where the money comes from. &gt;vp: it does seem like you’ll have to fix it here. i must insist. i sigh, and look around for any coffee. there wasn’t any. im getting out my screwdrivers and staring intently at the back of the vp’s head. it didn’t explode. i was sad. it was at this point that my radio crackles to life. &gt;radio: all security please report to main desk immediately. i smile flashes across my features. &gt;me: oh dear. im afraid i have to go… security head and all. turns out security had been given a box of chocolates. i took one. it was nice. perks of the job i guess. [next]( old stories [one]( [two]( [three]( [four]( [five]( [six]( [seven]( [eight](i used to work helpdesk for a 200 plus organisation in west london. the company was spread across three sites and this was in the days before teamviewer etc, so i actually lost weight during the two years i worked there. anyway one day we get a ticket from someone at the site half a mile up the road saying "my mouse has got reversed". i immediately thought someone had got into the control panel and reversed the left/right mouse clicks for a joke. i tried to talk him through fixing it on the phone but it was clearly beyond his skillset so i put my coat on and stepped out into a wet teddington. when i got there i looked at the laptop and saw that the mouse buttons had not been reversed. i pointed this out and the guy said. "oh no, it's not the clicks, it's the mouse itself. it's on the wrong side." "it used to be here" he indicated the left side of his laptop.."and now it's here" he indicated the right. someone had used his machine and put the mouse on the right hand side and he had raised a ticket to have it come out and pick the mouse up and put it back where it was before. i did it wordlessly and walked away. not even a "thank you". `#define time_lurked short` `#define post_num first` i work in a very seasonal industry, and so the office ends up being closed 7-8 months out of the year. and opening the office after months of inactivity can sometimes be an adventure. server and computer software and hardware to update. what have you. the fun comes when we start trying to print out reports when the printer starts beeping plaintively. responding to the cry, i went to check the printer out. not saying it's out of paper. not saying it's out of toner. a jam? and then i open the paper drawer to horror. during the months the office had been closed, termites decided that the paper would satisfy their appetite as well as wood would, and had turned the ream that had been left in the printer into their nest. &gt; **me:** "boss? printer's bugged. help me clean it out?" &gt; **boss:** "wait, what? oh, @#*($\^%!!" edit: after cleaning, the printer worked just fine, and never gives any problems. (normal alerts for being out of toner or paper are not problems.) __tl;dr: termites like paper, raid isn't just for hard drives.__i work as senior tech staff at a telco, and a few days ago, got a call from a dispatch manager asking me to call a field tech who couldn't activate several cable boxes while out on the road. rather unusual; unless there's a problem with the tool itself, this is usually resolved by frontline staff. &gt; bytewave: "this is bytewave, from tsss. a dispatch manager asked us to get in touch regarding stb activation issues out in the field?" &gt; roadtech: "oh, thank god. yeah, i need a full test auth profile on a cable box, and i'm in the middle of nowhere, and my tool isn't working. i tried calling both dispatch and tech frontline - twice - but they couldn't figure why and neither can i. i'm going through the wireless provisioning software as usual. tried three different boxes. put in the mac addresses as usual, this one is 000143ab12d6. they all gave me a mismatch error, no specific error code. can you tell me why it's not working? the ticket software doesn't say there's any provisioning issues right now..." the system he's trying to use is pretty simple. generally not something we use much, as devices are usually pre-provisioned. since he gave me the mac address of his cable box, i could have activated it for him in ten seconds on my end but i wanted to figure out why he was getting errors first, though. ran a quick check and there were no obvious reasons why it shouldn't be possible for him to activate this box remotely. the system that allows field techs to do that on the road uses our mobile network, to ensure that even if there's no physical access to the cable network, a tech out there with nothing but his phone can put a valid profile on any modem or set-top box stored in their truck, remotely. it's handy and simple. you plug the device in your truck's wireless system, put in your employee id in a portal, your truck's id, the device's mac address or serial number and boom, you have whatever profile you select from a basic cable package to a unlimited test profile. there's very little that can go wrong besides the box being unauthorized on the network (clearly not the case after three different tries) or putting in the wrong data. &gt; bytewave: "okay, i can confirm there's no issue with the tool you're using, just ran a quick test. clearly you have wireless coverage, otherwise you wouldn't have even gotten to the screen where the system lets you input device data. and i'm going to assume you didn't mistype macs and serials three times in a row, and that you know your employee number." &gt; roadtech: "yes, obviously. which is why nobody can figure out what's wrong out here." &gt; bytewave: "that leaves us with the truck number being the only option left. you sure you typed it right?" &gt; roadtech: "yes, of course. i double checked. and you know we use license plate numbers for this, right? pretty hard to get it wrong. but in case you need it, this truck has bc plates, 896 ren." ... every and each of our trucks out there is remotely traceable with tools escalation staff has, unless somebody physically remove their gps. so i ran a quick loc on the plate, just to make sure it's comms were working fine. they were. it's in downtown vancouver, everything looks green. except... there's no reason to try and provision equipment over wireless if you're literally standing 25 meters away from a key headend and tech depot... &gt; bytewave: "uhh, please confirm your location?" &gt; roadtech: "65km out north of fernie, east kootenay, the..." ... oh ffs! &gt; bytewave: "you're typing in the wrong license plate. that's why the system is rejecting your requests. no modem or cable box in the truck will be provisioned unless you know what plate number it's *supposed* to have. the truck which *ought* to have this plate is in downtown vancouver according to gps data. i'm provisioning the mac you gave me right now. as soon as you're done with your job, drive to the nearest depot and call dispatch. and you probably shouldn't speed, because right now, i'm betting the insurance papers in the glove compartment do not match the plates on your truck." &gt; roadtech: "... whaa...?! uh, thanks!! but how the hell did this happen??" &gt; bytewave: "you'll have to sort that out on your end. do let me know if you find out?" tl:dr: road tech out there couldn't remotely activate cable boxes because the system that allows them to do so ties each box to a truck's license plate, and the plates physically present on his truck were supposed to be on a different company truck altogether, hundreds of kilometers from there. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!](after the unexpected success of my last story i thought i'd share another one from a couple of years ago. it's a bit unusual for this sub but i think it still fits. i was out on the town with some friends one night and we were about to head home. we all got in the car, the driver turned the key, and... nothing. not even the normal dash lights, the thing was completely dead. praying it wasn't the battery, we got out and popped the hood. now, i know quite a bit about computers. i know almost nothing about cars. normally in this situation i'd be happy to step back and let someone else figure it out. however, it quickly became clear that everyone else in the group was equally clueless. *alright, self* i thought, *let's put our heads together and see if we can think this through. it has to be an electrical problem, right? so the logical place to start is the fuse box.* i found the fuse box and rows of neatly arranged and cryptically labeled fuses greeted me. my years of reseating ram, jiggling cables, and blowing on n64 cartridges told me the proper course of action was to pull each one out and put it back in. what have i got to lose? either it works and i'm a hero magician, or it doesn't and we're no more stuck than before. five minutes later we get back in, it turns over like nothing happened, and i get high fives all around.so years ago i had a user decide it would be a good idea to play games at work, specifically world of warcraft. when he played at work it created a few security violations that made the network send me lots of e-mails. during my employment there, several 'take home' computers became a thing for certain members of management. the guy wasn't too un-tech savvy himself, and i'm pretty sure he used a home computer to do it, but i don't know exactly how he installed wow as he wouldn't tell me saying 'well you don't deserve your job if you cant figure it out!' he kept yelling, and sending me pretty nasty e-mails. after talking to higher management about what happened, and forwarding them the e-mails, they literally said &gt;"well he doesn't deserve his job if he isn't going to work, do us the favor of telling him hes fired." &gt;"r--really?" &gt;"yeah." my next e-mail to the guy was "hey, i'm being told to fire you." he replied "you cant do that. i'm *above* you." i replied "not anymore, i'll be down to your office shortly to take all the electronic equipment." to make a long story short he was escorted out, he broke his laptop at home as he didn't have it at work, and he kept telling me i was the one who was 'actually fired, not him.' all while security was forcing him out. i was later told that i was to inform everyone in the next meeting that they would be fired for intentionally violating policy's surrounding computer security, and that i would be the one to send the e-mail/making the phone call. i didn't enjoy firing anyone else, which was only one other person. i got a (very small) raise out of it because i was super polite to him (not sarcastically so) the entire time. undoubtedly my most satisfying day at work ever. (it felt like justice was served.)as stated in an earlier post i work for a company that issues blackberrys to employees who have no business being issued a blackberry. here is another fine example why. *ring ring, ring ring.* **me -** this is the robot, i know more than you. what did you break? **luser -** my blackberry isn't loading the screen when i push the power button anymore. **me -** does it do anything or does not even power on anymore? **luser -** it powers on but then it just shows a red screen forever. **me -** when did this start happening? **luser -** after i pulled the battery out. **me -** why did you pull out the battery? **luser -** it started to erase everything and i didn't want it to. **me -** hang on let me start piecing this together to make sure i understand. were you trying to enter your password to unlock the device? **luser -** yes. **me -** did you get a message that you were entering the incorrect password and were now on your last attempt? **luser -** yes but i was entering the correct... **me -** shhh shh shh. did you try to enter the password on the last attempt after being warned that your data would be erased on the last failed attempt? **luser -** yes. **me -** did the device start to wipe your data? **luser -** yes. **me -** did you then proceed to remove the battery despite the message on the screen that said "warning do not power off device or remove the battery during security wipe!" **luser -** yes, i didn't want it to wipe my data. did that mess it up? congratulations on your new [device!](------------------------------------------------------------ i wrote this while on an hour long call this morning. it's not art, but i amused myself. the guys at work thought it was worth sharing. so i share. enjoy. edit: holy crap, wow. thanks, all! ------------------------------------------------------------ look. you're in a hole. i do not know if you fell or jumped in the hole. i'm not here to judge. (and i honestly don't care) i do know these things. i did not dig the hole. you do not want to be in the hole. i responded to your plea for help. i have a ladder. if you do not like this ladder, i cannot help that. it's not my ladder personally, so no offense taken. if you want, i can try and find another ladder. but it will take time, if you don't want this particular ladder. it makes little difference to me. i'm not the one in the hole. i'd like to help you out of the hole. however, it is ultimately on you. but i'll help you however i can, as best i can, until you are out of the hole. all i ask, really, is that you just stop fucking digging.four weeks ago the hr manager asked me if i could do a favour for her. they had got all of the 600 or so staff records scanned by an external company who had given them back a folder with named .pdf files, all of these files are in different folders, about 7 or so per folder. moving all of them by hand is going to take a very long time so could i write a program to do it automatically? each file is named with the users name, they have staff folders in the hr network share named the same as the staff name. the mission: move all the pdf files into their corresponding folder. i request access to the folder to work on it from group it. two weeks later i follow it up after getting no response. a couple of days later i email the team leader over there to ask what is happening, no response. eventually i get a garbled response from group asking for authorisation, i point them to the hr manager's email further up the chain. nothing happens. by this point the hr manager is getting a bit annoyed at waiting, so i write the code to move the files, test it and try and find a time when i can go to her desk and run it to move the files. finding a time that she is free takes another two days. eventually we manage to find a time to do it and i go across, run the application and successfully move about half the files. hr managers immediate response was " what can you do about the rest of the files? why can't you move the rest?" i had to explain that the program is only going to get the files that are named exactly, it will also not overwrite any file with the same name because these files are very important and i'm not taking any risks. the rest of the files will have to me moved manually and i don't have the time to do that. all the rest of the files did not move because they either had a same named file in the staffs folder already, the staff had left or the file had been named incorrectly by hr. i have now spent : 3 hours chasing group to follow process try and get access officially at least 3-4 hours in meetings with different people to try and get the actual requirements and full file paths 2 hours coding and debugging 1 hour explaining why the program does what it does and why after all that i get in to have to explain to my boss why there is now a complaint about me only doing half a job. this was me going well outside my job description,doing you a favour and saving you hours of manual copypasta hell. no thanks, just complaints. was reading [this pair of shorts]( and was reminded of a story that happened years ago, when i was attending a global game jam event in my town. for the uninitated, you show up on friday evening, make a team of several people, they give you a topic and you got 48 hours to make a game, then present it to everyone. so, sunday evening rolled around and all the teams were getting their stuff ready. the guys who were up first all huddled around the projector and were taking their sweet times setting up. apparently nobody thought to bring an hdmi cable. not just these guys, almost nobody in the entire building - participants and organizers alike - brought an hdmi cable. as if by miracle, one of the guys on my team, let's call him frank, was there to save the day. he groaned, huffed and sighed, then produced a spare cable he had packed along with his laptop. it's a good thing computers don't get stds because that cable got passed around an obscene amount that night. that was not the end of it though. most of the guys doing their presentations had various problems - their game would crash or refuse to load, the resolution would be fucked up, the sound stops for no reason etc. frank had the brilliant idea of pre-recording our game instead of doing it live, and our own presentation went off without a hitch. throughout the whole thing he kept repeating the mantra in the tl;dr **tl;dr: do not anger the demo gods, their fury is swift and just**awhile back manning the phones as tech senior staff at my telco, i got a panicked escalation call from a field tech who had to retreat as per protocol as he had been threatened with violence for trying to gain access to a courtyard to disconnect service to a non-paying customer. of course we can remotely kill any cable boxes, modems and cellphones, but we still gotta send a guy out to disconnect your analog cable access physically as it can almost never be done remotely except in huge towers with special panels. we err on the safe side when it comes to threats to employees, you don't exactly need to point a gun in our techs' faces for them to go away and leave your analog alone, a strong 'no', a closed fist and a death stare will get them to retreat and return with 6 cops later. but in this case the tech was slightly shaken, the non-paying customer had been unusually aggressive. normally recoveries handle these situations but it was outside their office hours, and as the only senior 24/7 department, tsss inherits a few 'you're in charge of this random mess now' calls like this now and then. only thing surprising was that the house's mta and dhct were still online despite a clear disconnect order, something i was able to rectify in seconds with the kill list. (in retrospect the explanation why will seem quite obvious below) &gt; bytewave: "okay, don't worry we're handling it. you seem pretty shook up - i recommend once we're done you give a quick call to the emergency employee hotline, just in case, get everything written down and sent to the health &amp; safety board as a precaution. they will confidentially hear all about how you feel and recommend options if you wish. as for this address, don't worry i'm on it. i can't disconnect analog remotely but they're not going to be browsing reddit after treating you like that. **whole place is now on the kill list.**" the 'kill list' is simply the top tool we had to deny service to customers who we determine should never be in business with us ever again. it scraps provisioning of every digital device in a file of course (faster than we could through the standard process) but most importantly it scans everything we know about the account, the customer and the potential, all the way down to who has been listed as authorized to the account, what email addresses they used, mother maiden names, birthdates, security questions, competition profiles and more - then adds all the data deemed relevant to a special list that makes it quite likely any new attempt to register a new account with us under a false name will get picked up by an algorithm which determines who you truly are and fast-forwards a full profile to recoveries and then black marks to credit rating agencies if warranted. its the best tool we have to keep disconnected customers from lying and getting a clean slate, and when our recoveries department is closed, senior tech support often has to make these calls. the original name was intended to mean 'you're dead to us now.' the tech felt reassured and happier and i thought the matter closed. everyone working the field or tech support knew what the kill list was and what it meant. he knew techs would go back there flanked by 6 cops in a few days to disconnect the analog line by force if necessary and that this customer would never again have an account with us. all ought to be well, matter closed. except for one thing. though i had no way to guess or know that, this house turned out to be under some kind of surveillance by authorities of some kind. perhaps it was city police, csec, csis, a clandestine us op on foreign soil, i don't know. the single point of contact for them with the telco is a department known as internal security in my tales, whose primary tasks are to make anything happen if you have a warrant while largely ignoring a flood of copyright-infringement claims that almost inevitably reference the dmca even though we're in canada. is is also a fellow union department and we quietly share infos about most things except truly sensitive details. but unlike techs, is had no idea what the 'kill list' was; there are too many tools for everyone to track of - and nobody has access to them all. one day i got to work and there was an alert from internal it that the kill list had been renamed to 'emergency blacklisting tool' and that there were no operational impacts, but that employees were to use the new terminology from now on. it had a whole new skin and logo within the hour. i shrugged it off, typical bureaucratic nonsense, they shuffle names around sometimes even if its rare for high-level tools. month later, downstairs an is friend of mine tells me about what happened once it was a fully closed matter. &gt; is: "so, yeah, back then we got a priority call from the authorities with paperwork in order - won't say which exactly - and they said we were then technically failing to comply with a live warrant and to fix service to that location at all costs by yesterday." ... &gt; is: "so i went to have a look at all the tickets about that place, and since they weren't all that clear, i listened to a call between you and some field guy? i decided to recite verbatim what you said. but the guy panicked a tad, even after i added some context about how it's certainly something more mundane than it sounds and how we don't have any squads of hired guns that go around murdering terrible customers. had to let him listen to the recording. then he put me on hold for half an hour." i might have been sweating had i heard that in a timely fashion but it was a month after the tool was renamed and nothing had been said to me, so i knew it was a big misunderstanding. i explained what the 'kill list / ebt' is to him and he laughed his ass off. &gt; is: "no, i swear to you, they took it that seriously. i tried my best to downplay it, but cya is strong when you have a badge too. i was told once he finally came back on the line 'this is no longer a matter which will be handled at our level, i have to send this vertical. someone with a really good suit will get a call from someone else here later tonight.' i argued it was already well past business hours but it still happened anyway. the next day at dawn's light we got the same email you did from systems renaming the kill list to ebt, a month ago." i was chuckling pretty hard, it meant an higher-up in law enforcement woke up one of our vice-presidents in the middle of the night to discuss whether or not our telco was operating a 'kill list' and what it meant - and that said upper manager then spent part of the night ensuring we immediately rename a tool to deal with the confusion. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!]( tl:dr - a poorly-named tool meant to ensure we can internally shut down end-user modems and dhcts really quickly in a bind scared law enforcement into waking up key upper management. to make sure our telco wasn't running a shady program on the d/l to 'take out' our worst customers or anything of the sort..i supported remote sites, including drilling rigs. one of them called and stated "the network goes out every day at exactly the same time! it comes back after about an hour." the rigs get all their connectivity from a self-aiming satellite dish on a trailer. all their it stuff is contained on that trailer for portability and ease of use by technophobic roughnecks. this seems odd, but he called at 2:30 so i troubleshoot a few things and watch his connection. at 2:45 exactly, it went offline. no warning, nothing. just gone. the phone is voip, so i lose him too. an hour later he calls back, and everything tests perfectly. he assures me that they do not lose power, all his boxes have the right flashy lights. i ask him to call back tomorrow, i want to see it again and prepare tests. he does, and all tests show it offline and at his end. a cell call from the drilling manager verifies that the site is dead, and it is "always down". so i load up the company pickup with tools and spare parts and start the long trek out to the drilling site. i time it to arrive at 2pm and give me time to test, check, and try to find the culprit while still observe the outage if nothing turns up. it is all good, everything is in perfect condition. then, promptly at 2:45pm, as he does every day, the drilling manager pulls up and parks his pickup right in front of the satellite dish.over the holiday, i was visiting some family out of state, which includes my 17-month-old niece that i rarely get to see. being a baby in the year 2014, she has many toys that light up, talk, sing, and move and/or dance. one of these toys is a stuffed animal with buttons in the hands, feet, belly, etc. when turned on, it says "let's sing and play!" when turned off, "bye bye!" one afternoon, we're sitting around watching tv, when i start hearing... "let's sing and play!" (short pause) "bye bye!" "let's sing and play!" (short pause) "bye bye!" ...in a continuous loop. i look over, and there's my niece, turning on her toy, pressing a different foot and getting no sound, then turning it off and back on again. i was so proud i almost cried. *edited for punctuation*phone support at a large busniess*: a user was having problems with her laptop shutting down randomly. i assumed it may be a defective battery as we had seen a few of those from a past batch of laptops. i asked her if it was plugged in. "is what plugged in?" she said. "is the *power* plugged in," i replied. after a long pause she responded, "how do i determine if it is plugged in?"as the aircraft touched down with an audible thump, i couldn’t help but feel the jolt of my life changing. uncertainty had crept into my mind even as i tried to force it down. i had accepted a job to help a company deploy a new computer/database system. i remembered the words of my boss as i left my home country “who cares that you don’t speak the language, confidence talks. you’ve got this.” . internally i questioned my ability to lead a team i’d never met in the deployment of software i had never even heard of before. i decided to just shake if off, as the famous song goes. *(whilst simultaneously questioning the validity of advice from a pop song)* luckily my home company had supplied its own interpreter for the trip, my boss seemed to suspicious of the entire deal so this was his attempt at getting another man in play. the interpreter waited for me as i exited the terminal, she was a tall professional looking woman who subsequently drove me to the office we’d be working at. i tried pleasantries, but eventually i had to get down to business. &gt;me: so, what are we working on? just the roll out of this database? &gt;int: i am sorry, mr. airz. i do not know. remember i work for you, this is my first day as well. i slumped in my chair as we arrived at a soviet inspired cement office block. a man with a gleaming smile ran to the door and opened it. his cheeriness seemed to contrast nicely with his surroundings in what i can only assume was a slum. &gt;gleam: mr. airz, you’ve arrived. &gt;me: you speak…. gleam gave me a big smile. he opened his arms wide for a bow. &gt;gleam: but of course. although the others are a little rusty. gleam waved me inside eager to give me a tour of the “facility”. in all honestly it was just one massive cement slab of a building, every floor was the same. gleam eventually started to explain what i had flown all this way for. &gt;gleam: we’re doing a national roll out. all at once. swiftly like a hawk. you’re here to make sure it all runs **smoothly**. as he said the word smoothly he gestured his hands outward as if feeling the word. &gt;me: and what exactly are you rolling out… &gt;gleam: it’s the pride of this office. we built it from scratch. i’m assured… well … they tell me it works *perfectly*. would you like a demonstration? gleam introduced me to the entire team that had been working on the project. i asked them to show me the database which a young worker joyfully did, after translation. he produced a web form which you would fill our with various details, then showed off the backend retrieving data seemingly correctly. &gt;me: so it’s just getting roll out to the areas that need new terminals, a quick lesson with how to use the forms for query and logging new data and… easy money, i thought. as i smiled at the team assembled. as soon as they saw the smile they seemed to all noticeably relax, some even sat back down and stopped paying attention. &gt;gleam: that’s all it is… so how long? &gt;me: how… er… long? the question seemed to come out of nowhere. &gt;gleam: two weeks? &gt;me: well, how many people are we teaching? how many users do we roll out too? whats the server situation? &gt;gleam: i’m afraid those questions are bit too technical for me. i leave the details to you. gleam walked away seemingly unconcerned with the fate of “the pride of his office”. the team assembled was a mash of various people, none of whom seemed to be currently doing actual work. i looked around for direction, it took me about a minute to realise… i was here to direct **them**. i decided i’d get a better acquainted with the system they’d developed. i walked over to the same young worker as before, and got him to show me the program some more… the interpreter had to translate “everything”. i wondered what gleam meant by a bit rough with my language, when he clearly meant to say they’d none. after getting a general overview i decided to delve a little more closely. &gt;me: show me the feature *you* worked specifically worked on. &gt;younggun(through int): my feature. age, birthdate. updates automatically. younggun through a translator seemed to be talking very excitedly and avidly about his feature, however int didn’t seem to bother translating. &gt;int: he’s saying how he’s even included days in the calculation. something about on your birthday it will update. i thought the phase “something about” was an odd one for a translator to use. surely you’d know. i decided to just leave it and look at the code more carefully. it seemed to take the date of birth and calculate the age. &gt;me: can i see your test data, so i can pick a name for a demonstration? after a few moments of interpreting younggun finally seemed to understand. i was fairly sure the code looked solid. it wasn’t until younggun pressed a freshly printed sheet into my hands that i started getting worried. i must have frowned because younggun started pointing at various names on the single sheet of paper. &gt;int: he says, this is the test data. which one do you want to check? &gt;me: this paper has five names on it. the interpreter looked at me oddly, but dutifully translated the message. &gt;int: he doesn’t seem to understand. he wants you to pick a name to test the code. &gt;me: ask him if this is all the names in the test data. &gt;int: he says, yes. thats the test data. my internal unhappiness was bubbling up slowly like a freight train gathering speed, and much like a freight train i could do nothing to stop it. younggun seemed to be frantically tapping at his keyboard, providing proof that all five names did infact work. seemingly declaring to the entire office his success. &gt;me: when this rolls out how many customers will be on it? younggun said a number. that number was not 5. in fact it was a multiple quite a lot larger then five. &gt;me: okay, tell everyone we’re retesting all the code with at least that many customers. there was a general murmur, nothing you could pinpoint on a single individual just a bunch of voices whispering. &gt;int: they’re saying if it works for five, six and seven data points it will work for a million. &gt;me: will it? after the interpreter translated that phrase everyone seemed to stop whispering. i ordered new test data be made up, orders of magnitude larger then the current… 5. &gt;int: they’re complaining it’ll take days or weeks to input that much data. &gt;me: it’s made up, randomised data. should take minutes. blank stares were thrown around the room. &gt;me: google it! apparently those words do not need translation, as soon as i’d uttered the words they all seemed to turn to there terminals and start typing. i decided to let them get on with it and made it to the break room for a coffee. ***** whilst trying to wrestle the coffee machine into making something that didn’t resemble black treacle, i was accosted by a man inexplicably holding a plate. &gt;plate: new man! &gt;me: ….er… plate smiled at my incomprehension and watched as i attempted to beat the coffee maker into submission. &gt;plate: new guy, you must come to a party this weekend. &gt;me: i errr… have other plans. personally i loved the phrase “other plans”. it could literally mean anything, in this case it meant anything *but* socialising. &gt;plate: this is okay. we party friday. friday is a good day, no? what do you say to that? no? yes? &gt;me: the coffee machine, do you know how to get it to work? &gt;plate: coffee? no. friday? yes. &gt;me: sorry, who are you? he seemed very persistent. &gt;plate: you, me, we’re the same. you, unmarried. i, unmarried. we go like brothers into the night, would be…. legendary. i wasn’t sure if…. or…. he didn’t seem… but…? in my confused state i decided to go back to the computers, without answering. ***** a few hours later the team had managed to assemble some data, younggun hit the enter key to test the data. the computer froze, then hung, then crashed. we checked the server. it had hung. it had crashed. a few minutes later gleam managed to arrive as if summoned by some force. he wore and upbeat smile as if completely misreading the situation, however all the workers seemed to be smiling now with him. &gt;me: i’m afraid you aren’t ready for roll out yet. you’ve got to do a whole bunch of testing and bug fixing. &gt;gleam: you’ve two weeks. a few of the programmers started to subtly whisper at gleam. to be honest it wasn’t exactly subtle, but they seemed to want to all avoid eye contact with me. gleam was still smiling even after i’d told him two weeks wasn’t enough. &gt;gleam: go back to your hotel, you’ve had a long flight over here and a long day. go on… i couldn’t be bothered to fight it. i walked away. the whispering between the programers and gleam only seemed to get louder as i left. my interpreter jogged to catch up with me. &gt;int: they’re saying you broke the code. one of them said you’d given them a virus. &gt;me: wha.. but i… my head had filled with rage. i’d almost completely turned around when the interpreter grabbed my arm firmly and walked me out the door to the car. &gt;int: no. dont. you won’t win like that. &gt;me: but they’re liar’s. they know nothing about database scaling. &gt;int: just get in the car. ***** ***** thanks for all the emails while i was **away/doing taxes/selling my car/3d printing**. they really helped me get back to writing. as senior tech staff at my telco, part of my job description is having to review frontline technical performance whenever management asks me to. that usually means sitting down for an entire day listening to the recorded calls of a tech with sub-par performance, and then taking an hour to write a synopsis of their strengths and weaknesses. my analysis is then used to prepare a training plan to help get them up to speed. in extreme cases, if a union employee fails to improve after training they're re-assigned to what we call an 'envelope position'. formally, it's called 'mandatory reassignment' under our work contract. a low-skill union job where they keep their pay but might be required to do nothing but sort mail all day long because they can no longer do what they were hired for. it means you're a lost cause and your boss hates you but you get to keep a job because we have a strong union - not an enviable situation to say the least. the work contract clause about this was meant to give an out to well-intentioned older employees who have trouble adapting to major technological changes. but management sees the whole thing as a dustbin to get rid of employees they no longer want. any employee forced into an 'envelope position' no longer falls under their budget and they can easily blame it on the work contract - almost as good as being able to fire them. &gt; frontline manager: "i'd like you to review a frontline union tech's calls and send me a report. name's maximilian. emailed you a time range and general metrics; it demonstrates that he's *well* below average performance. we tried already to give him additional training and things have not improved. takes less than three calls per hour even though we expect six. doesn't seem like bad faith on his part, so we think it's just incompetence. we're considering mandatory reassignment at this point, and the union has been notified that unless we witness improvements after whatever measures you recommend, we're going there." i knew who he was talking about off-hand, maximilian is an uncommon name these days. pretty damn decent tech as far as i knew, so it seemed odd he got to the point where they considered mandatory reassignment. either way, writing up a report about any employee's performance falls under my job description - and a day listening to someone else's calls is nothing to scoff at. &gt; bytewave: "sure thing. i can take friday off to listen to his calls. expect a report by end of business week." the performance data that the manager sent me was minimal but i had full recordings at least. so come friday, i listened to max' calls for an entire day. he was outstanding. he was able to solve difficult problems without unnecessary escalations. i listened to a call where he swiftly dealt with a major mobile intercarrier issue that could have had some techs in my own department, tsss, reeling. there's no way this guy only takes three calls an hour on average, so i started digging. according to all recordings and tickets, max was a top-notch employee. of all the times i've been asked to do a full review of a frontline tech's performance, this one was downright ridiculous and entirely unjustified. so i wrote him a glowing review and even threw in that given enough seniority, i believed he might be someday tsss material too. formally added that the metrics mailed to me did not match the quality of calls i listened to at all and that i was recommending no additional training measures. come monday i was hastily summoned to a meeting with my manager and maximilian's manager. and a union steward was called in too - usually that means they are going to accuse you of something serious and want to follow protocol in case there's a grievance. max' manager looked like he was about to hand me a letter of reprimand. my boss looked like he was annoyed to have to attend a useless impromptu meeting. &gt; frontline manager: "please first tell us on record what relationships if any you have with frontline tech employee maximilian adler." ... by then i could tell something went seriously wrong, but when i don't know what, i just go through the motions until i figure it out. &gt; bytewave: "formal professional relationship only. as tsss, i help him on recorded lines whenever he needs our team's assistance. i sometimes have mild banter with him in formal break rooms and at office parties. outside these settings, no contact whatsoever. now, unless i'm told what the hell this is about, i might walk out with the stew for union advisory and we'll resume in an hour with max in attendance." the manager seemed taken aback and confused. but he kept going.. &gt; frontline manager: "i guess you're allowed, but the statistics don't lie! this guy has a hard time taking three calls an hour, under half of average! your whole review glosses over that and we paid you for a full day for this!" &gt; bytewave: "as i'm well aware. i've listened to all calls in the time range you asked me to and looked at your metrics. i said they don't match - in writing. cc'd to my boss here and everybody involved in his training plan. i stand by that." &gt; frontline manager, accusatory tone: "exactly, you sent that to everybody without explaining the discrepancy!!" &gt; bytewave: "as i was supposed to. i didn't file your team's payslips either. that would be entirely outside the mandate and.." &gt; union steward: ".. outside his job description. i read his report, it's complete and exceptionally professional. anything more would be grounds for a grievance over a union employee being ordered to do managerial work without union authorization. tsss is only allowed to review technical expertise, not metrics." the stew was right, but truth to be told i still had no knowledge of what went wrong - didn't have the data to figure it out yet. just knew the calls i listened to for an entire day did not match at all that of a sub-par employee. this much i was certain of, so i kept a calm face as usual, but i was more than mildly annoyed to be put on the spot like this for no valid reason whatsoever. the frontline manager started to sweat. the steward had noticed too, so i decided to press the advantage. &gt; bytewave: "given the tone this far, unless this 'meeting' is over, perhaps it would be proper for the union to order we continue this under a full disciplinary board." while that might seem like a bad thing, whenever a manager is overreaching, this is one of our strongest tools. according to our work contract, whenever either party demands it, it simply means two managers, two union stewards and all parties concerned (and respective lawyers if parties believe it's warranted) have to get in a room and fully discuss differences with recordings admissible in arbitration. it's a step up over filing a grievance. [previously featured in a tale about listening to the wrong music]( if a manager is in the wrong, it gets them in hot water really quickly to have it put on formal record, as their powerful legal department reviews full recordings of each instance. the frontline manager's sweating intensified. the union stew was just about to call it as i hinted. then my boss who had been sitting there quietly finally spoke up. &gt; my manager: "this meeting is more than over. from now on, i want all requests to my team for frontline personnel performance reviews to be dispatched exclusively through me. i will be reviewing them directly. floor director will be notified in writing by noon. thank you for your time." no manager below middle-management is as powerful on support floors than the ones in charge of either senior staff teams, even though officially sub-direction managers are all equal. could have ended there. but i'm never happy unless i know what really happened. &gt; bytewave: "it's not quite over, not after this. i want the whole file you have on this employee, full detailed metrics included, cc'd to the union too. we'll get to the bottom of this and figure out who screwed up and why, cause it sure wasn't me and we don't take proceedings like this lightly." the steward nodded. i expected it to be this specific frontline manager's fault and thought that by reviewing records i'd be able to prove it and get him in hot water for being an ass without due cause. he objected just as my boss agreed, and soon after i was at my desk reviewing everything. the whole analysis took an entire minute. with just a glance at the full data i could tell the person barely taking 3 calls per hour wasn't max. &gt; bytewave: "**boss!** there's a contractor with the same employee number as max!" internal employee numbers and contractor employee numbers are tracked separately, in the same database. it turns out max, a union internal employee, was blamed for the terrible performance of a contractor with the same damn number. it wasn't supposed to be possible but obviously was - max' manager was looking at the wrong performance metrics all along. soon after, every contractor's employee number was incremented to ensure it doesn't happen again. [all of bytewave's tales on tfts!]( tl;dr - good frontline tech was blamed for poor metrics because he shared an employee number with a terribad contractor and i almost got into trouble for giving him an all-clear performance review. strong union and a good boss ensured i didn't get in hot water and could figure out what was going on. college tale again. i was working hard to wire in a new network segment (10 cables at around an 80 metre run per cable) against a deadline, when my pager went off (it was the 90s). report to the it suite, email down. first port of call was the server room, but the mail server was churning away happily sending and receiving messages, so i thought that it would be an easy fix - a config issue on outlook. i get down to the it suite to find a student waiting at the desk for me. i follow her to her pc and she explains that she's trying to send an email to her friend, and it won't go. i check the address, it's internal so it shouldn't be stopped by any of the outbound rules. the name resolves, so there's a connection to the mail server. then i check her mailbox. it's just over the limit. we delete around a hundred or so emails, empty deleted items, and try again. still not sending. i check again, and she's an it student, which means she's on a different server that we were having issues with. it's also her last day as the exams are over and she'll be going off to university next year. she's telling me this as i attempt to manually edit her user profile so that the correct settings are propagated. after a quick edit of the mail profile and purge of the old data, we send a test message, and it's successful. she re-types the message and sends it as i watch. it successfully sends. not bad - 40 minutes to get the message sent, but now i'm 40 minutes behind schedule on a more important job. on the way out, she sees the friend that she was emailing. &gt;girl 1: i just sent you an email! &gt;girl 2: what did it say? &gt;girl 1: *proceeds to repeat entire message she just emailed to girl 2, thereby making my 40 minute fix irrelevant* my coffee looked expectantly at me. it was the first cup of the day, the it break room door having been dehinged near moments ago. i looked down at the black swirling vortex, its warm colour mimicking my happiness at the thought of a doorless break room. i took a sip. tasted like triumph. a knock at the door woke me from my whirlwind romance. it was the sales manager. who had just been made temporary building manager. she was smiling. &gt;sales: how are you today? feeling well? just here to do a quick measure of this office. she produced a tape measure clutched in her hand. &gt;sales: also the vp would like to see you. i stared at her for a full minute. i got up and put down my mug. my hand felt cold without it. as i made my way towards the door i hear the sales manager clear her throat. &gt;me: i won’t get in your way. i better pop up to see the vp now. i just wanted to get out of the room. away from the strangeness that is the sales manager being odd. nothing good can come of odd. &gt;sales: actually i was hoping you could help me measure this before you leave. &gt;me: measure, this? &gt;sales: just this room, i went to find the building plans for the dimensions but they aren’t where i expected. &gt;me: why are we measuring this room again? &gt;sales: oh just building maintenance stuff. i wouldn’t worry about it. &gt;me: feels like i should worry….. we quickly went around the room. it’s rectangular so it was very fast. &gt;sales: thanks for the help, actually one more thing. how big is your desk? &gt;me: no idea. &gt;sales: a man should always know the size of his desk. she proceeded to sweep the measuring tape around and bang it down on the desk. as the measuring tape reeled back from its holster it caught the lip of my mug. coffee was spilt. it felt like the first blood of a war. i made my way to the vp’s office, only on half a coffee… but thats all i’d need. or so i thought. [next]( old stories [one]( [two]( [three]( [four]( [five]( [six]( [seven]( [eight]( [nine]( [ten - vp saga one]( [eleven - vp saga two]( [twelve - vp saga three]( [thirteen - vp saga four]( [fourteen - vp saga five]( thanks to anyone who managed to get this far. a small bit of background, i work as the is manager for a small company with about six branches and under 100 employees. about a week ago we had an issue where one of our scsi hdd's burned out in our mail server. it was raid 5 so i replaced it and let it rebuild, but i began to closely monitor the server in case anything odd began to happen. i say this because i normally don't monitor our mail logs all that closely otherwise unless people are having problems. our company employs a team of third shift workers to pull product for trucks that depart in the morning. most of these employees have been with the company for over ten years and are mostly all over the age of fifty. they're all good guys, just not the most tech savvy which is fine. they're also unmonitored all night, for the most part. we also don't run any content filtering software, so all websites are open for browsing. our ceo's thoughts are that if we hire someone we expect them to be adult enough to know when it's appropriate to browse websites for personal use and when not to, and what sites are appropriate to begin with...which is okay for people who legitimately aren't going to download the worst viruses imaginable on accident but i digress. one employee in particular, we'll call him stew, doesn't like *not* being savvy and every morning he'll wander over to my desk with a plethora of questions that i'm more than happy to answer for him. they're usually things about which phone he should look at buying or how to do something with the computer he had never done before so it's nice to just shoot the shit before getting on with my day. well, a few days ago stew walks over to my desk and begins asking me some questions about craigslist. his issue was that when he, "clicks on an email address on craigslist to email someone it opens a bunch of options that i have no idea what to do with." i think on it for a second, and then figure it's probably because the computers in the warehouse have no default email client, they all use web based email because so many people share the computers out there. so i tell him that if he just copies and pastes the email address that will work, *or* **he can just type it by hand**. which is what i believe he did because... ...the next morning i walk into work and begin searching through email logs. we have a queue of bad emails that couldn't be delivered for one reason or another and more often than not it's because someone sent an email to the wrong address by mistyping a letter or some such thing. so was the trouble with poor stew. you see, as i found out that morning stew was using craigslist at work to solicit sex from people creating fwb posts. there was a message from stew stuck in the bad message queue to "whoever@cragslist.org" instead of craigslist.org and it had been rejected. both the subject and message were there in all of their glory describing, in detail, what this 55 year old man wanted to do to this supposedly 22 year old busty blonde college girl. i lost it and absolutely could not stop laughing. i legitimately felt bad more than anything else. i wasn't going to tell his boss or call him out on it because he needs his job but it was obviously not appropriate so before he left that morning i met him in the warehouse. i pulled him off to the side and let him know that, regarding his question yesterday, i'd appreciate it he not use his work email for craigslist if that's what he planned on doing as sometimes it results in increased spam for the company. it's only been a day now and i haven't seen another email go out but i just absolutely had to tell someone because i really don't have a team at work and i don't think anyone else could appreciate it as much as you guys.it's been awhile but i finally have something that's tfts worthy! a little background: i work as a tier 1.5 (not quite tier 2 permissions but i do more than the usual tier 1) support guru at $localgovernmentagency. $localgovernmentagency is quite large for our area (about 6k users supported) so we get a good cross-section of the general population calling in. now onto the story! we recently moved from office 2007 to an office 365 environment. during the transition, everyone was instructed **many** times over to move their .pst files/folders over to their new mailbox because we were going to delete everyone's stuff at $deathdate. how-to's, wikis, presentations, training sessions and anything else you could think of was done to communicate this. i was part of the communications committee that created all these different avenues for the project, so i had a sense of pride behind our creation. of course, there's a large number of people that ignored everything we sent out (which you would have had to be under a rock to not notice). fast forward to today, we send out another round of notifications telling everyone the day of pst rapture is upon us in a couple of weeks. the calls i've been dealing with today (so far about 200) have been exactly like this: &gt;me: thanks for calling support, how can i help you? &gt;$user: i don't understand this .pst email thingy that i just got. can you help me? &gt;me: have you read the links in the email? it'll show you how to prepare, complete with pictures and video. &gt;$user: no i haven't. can you just show me? **do it for you** &gt;me: please try viewing those links first and call back if you need further assistance. &gt;$user: but i can't read it! &gt;me: have you even tried reading the info in the links? *i already know the answer but at least i can tell my boss i tried* &gt;$user: i can't read it! how some of these users continue to breathe and walk at the same time boggles my mind sometimes. edit: spelling edit #2: holy upvotes... thanks everybody!i'm in college right now and i like to hang out with my friends at the catholic student center that's across the street from campus. the center has fun activities, that usually include food, and it has lots of room to spread out and do homework. it also has a pretty fast wireless internet connection. this school year the wireless connection has been very unreliable. we've had a local it specialist come out many times and had our router sent off for repairs once. my friend thinks the dhcp lease time is too long. though recently the connection has been pretty reliable. so last week i was doing homework on a large table with my girlfriend and her wireless connection kept going in and out, while my computer was staying constantly connected. she was getting frustrated so i thought "hey i'll just bridge connections with my laptop like i used to do with my old xbox 360 that didn't have a wireless card". then i looked around a little bit, found and ethernet cable, and connected our laptops together. she was really happy that her internet was working again. a few days later my girlfriend mentioned to the franciscan monk who runs the center that we were in a relationship, we were keeping it on the down low for a couple weeks. he said "you know i suspected something when i saw yall sharing internet!" following it with "now that's an appropriate pda!". i am a semi retired, semi burnt out old tech who retired to a small rural town to spend my declining years supporting small businesses and rural clients. i had a customer who had lost their internet connection. they where a long way out of town, like over 100km of rutted dirt track out of town, so i started out fairly early in the morning to get there by 9:00am. their internet was down, and this far away from anyone they relied in a satellite connection. no sync. i checked the connections to the modem, and even climbed on the roof to see if the dish had moved due to the recent strong winds. no visible problems but when i tested the modem it was faulty. a satellite modem was not an item i kept in my spares kit, so i called the service provider and waited for the tech to organize a replacement. now i don't know how you are treated as a field tech where you are from, but in country oz (australia) every visitor is offered at least a coffee or tea. this place pulled out all the stops. coffee, fresh baked cookies, and two different types of home made cake where laid out while i was finishing up the call. i gave the client the news that it would take a couple of days for the replacement modem to arrive, and that i would have to come back then to install and configure it. the farmer thanked me for my effort, and paid for the service call. i apologized that i couldn't fix the issue in one call, and that i would have to come out again before they would have internet access. he smiled and said that i was welcome any time, and suggested i try to be there for lunch next time. tl/dr happy clients that pay promptly, baked goods, and an invitation to lunch, i love the life of a country tech! so i recently finished a year-long contract with a very large company with an internal it helpdesk. i was on the helpdesk and took 1st level calls (basic issues, computer won't turn on, internet connectivity is bad, etc.) while i was there, it was basically 6 months in infrastructure/networking (which is why i went for it) and 6 months manning the phones. so, whilst i was in infrastructure, we were rolling out a massive (roughly 2000 clients) vdi system, using citrix. this was a really cool project, and was a lot of fun. so anyway, to the meat of the story. we're rolling it out, starting with a group of people in the retail department to trial the new vdi environment. this went well, and we went live with it. everyone who didn't need a dedicated desktop went over to vdi, and things were great. the network was handling it pretty well at a local level. (the hardware for this was freaking unbelievable, btw) a lot of effort went into this, and for the most part, it went swimmingly well. i'm sure a lot of you here could sympathise with how much of a pain a massive rollout can be. at this company, we had our main office, then we had remote sites. a lot of these sites were on 3g uplinks back to our pdc, which was patchy at best. 3 offices were on microwave uplink, which was almost as fast as being local. one of these sites, let's call it $officek, was on such a connection, and was also our tdc. i got a call from one of the floor managers at $officek. she had asked for the vdi to be set up at $officek, which just so happened to be a 5 hour drive each way away. &gt; me: "it, this is abra5umente, how can i help you today?" &gt; floor manager: "yes, could i please speak to the helpdesk manager?" &gt; me: "i'm sorry, he's in a meeting in the moment. is there anything i can help you with?" &gt; fm: "i don't think you'd understand what i am talking about, i want to get the bti set up at $officek." it took me a few seconds to understand exactly what it was she was talking about, when i clicked. &gt; me: "oh, vdi? well you're in luck, i was on the team which set that up! your office happens to be on the microwave uplink, so i can't see any reason why we can't do that for you guys. i'll have a chat with my manager and get the all-clear from him, and give you a call back after 12 if that's okay?" &gt; fm: "yeah, well i guess that will have to do." she hangs up. she was known for being... *rude.* my manager gets back, i run the idea by him, he says it's a good idea as it will allow us to test the network with it. i call fm back. &gt; me: "hi fm, it's abra5umente from it here, just ringing to follow up on the vdi install?" &gt; fm: "it's called bti, by the way. and yes, what did you need to follow up for?" i let this one pass. &gt; me: "just wanted to book in a date for me and a few of the guys to come over and set up your new computers for you. is tomorrow okay? we actually have 3 guys available to come out." &gt; fm: "*...sigh* yes, i guess tomorrow would have to do, won't it?!" at this point i'm already regretting answering the phone earlier. &gt; me: "okay, great! myself and the others will leave here tomorrow at 7am, so we can be with you at around 11:30am." &gt; fm: "alright, do i need to do anything?" &gt; me: "nope, we'll transfer all of your local files across to the server during the day and have it all ready to be plugged in and go tomorrow. is there anything else i can help you with while i've got you on the phone here?" &gt; fm "no. see you." *click* my manager was listening to the call, and when it ended he looked up at me and gave me that "oh boy, you're gonna have a good time tomorrow" grin. i rounded up the other guys, we transferred data across, got everything ready, and went home at 5, in no way expecting the complete shitstorm which was to ensue the next day. 11:30 am the next morning. we arrive at $officek, unload, sign the log book, and go about setting up new computers. everything is actually going pretty smoothly, until fm gets out of her meeting. she bursts into her office, where i currently am setting up her new vdi desktop. now, i can't really explain what exactly happened here, as i honestly have no idea. she flips out into this psychotic rage, picks up the vdi desktop, and smashes it against the polished hardwood desk. dells are tough as nails, a bit of case damage but that's pretty much it. her desk, however, has a nice three inch gouge in it. she gives it another go, this time on the floor. computer busts into pieces, i see ram and fans flying in all directions. she storms out, screaming "i didn't ask for this!" over and over, gets her nametag aroung her neck caught on the door handle as she scans herself out, falls over, knocks herself unconscious, and kinda lies there for a while. meanwhile, i'm standing in this room with a broken computer, holding a keyboard in one hand and a mouse in the other, my mouth wide open, completely flabbergasted. one of my coworkers quietly walks in, asks what the hell happened, and kinda stands there with me. she eventually comes to, and has a coworker help her up. she sits up against the wall, the exec gets called in, she explains that i was "stealing" her computer, and that i don't even work for $company. police aren't called, but she was put on three months leave with pay. turns out her husband had just up and left out of nowhere, completely disappeared. she must have had some of psychotic episode from stress? anyway, finished up as best as we could in $officek, got in the car, and headed back to head office. by the time we got there, word had spread and we were met with cake and beers. i loved that job. **tl;dr: woman asks me to install a new computer for her, flips out when she sees me doing what she requested, accuses me of stealing her pc, falls over, goes away for 3 months. i get cake and beer.** **edit:** jesus, almost 800 upvotes! thanks for reading everyone, i've got more stories if you're interested in hearing them. most of them aren't as interesting as this, but they're still pretty cool. thanks for all the love :)the old boss quit, under the stress created by our hormonal female manager who always backed the customer, not the service desk tech. i interviewed for the position, but narrowly missed the grade. a new guy who had only been working there 8 months got the job and made my life a living misery. we were all told that desktops team were the only ones to go out to a users computer. us on the service desk were relegated to call-centre like status. despite being the only one with any meaningful experience on the service desk, i was constantly denied opportunities. it was a thursday. as a first aider i had attended the mandatory meeting which superceeded any team-related nonsense. off the back of that, i had a fire warden meeting in the same room. my boss had put me up for both roles. as i got back to my desk after 90 minutes, i delved into my work. first call to install a card reader. can't do it remotely as the machine has to be logged in as an admin, and logging off the user disconnects my session. it's a 3 minute fix, and the machine is 30 seconds walk away. desktop support are so busy that their lead time is 4 days. i sneak off "to the toilet" and fix it. director has a faulty monitor? sure, he's on my way home so i can replace it after i leave at 4. i get procurement to allocate me one, and schedule desktops to collect the faulty one. i take a few cables just to be sure. local councillor can't connect to the internet? he lives opposite the offices. ten minutes to determine if it's machine config or faulty internet and the isps problem. i'll do that as i'm waiting for the bus to see the director. communities team need software removing and re-installing? they're based 3 minutes from my house. i'll drop in before i get home. i got did all of that, then got chewed out by my boss on friday for doing the work that other people should have done. he said i was doing it for the glory, and refused to understand that these people deserved better than "a simple fix will take 4 days". worse, the manager backed him as she thought i was betraying the team. i never claimed overtime, flexi-time or any extra for that work, i just completed the work for the good of the customers and in the most efficient manner possible. i quit the following year.oh hey, look. a call from corporate and it's actually daylight outside. let's see what they're up to... fm: hello? george: hey flying_monkies, it's george. well, this isn't good. i explained in another post, george was one of the group of people affectionately known as the four horsemen of the apocalypse. if a case got to george, something had gone seriously wrong at a customer site and whoever george was talking to was about to have a verrrry long day. fm: hey george, you're calling to make me cry, aren't you? george: not my fault what some end-users do... speaking of end-users, i need you to go onsite. $customer went ahead and deleted root on the backup server. fm: you mean /home/root? george: no, i mean root. *sigh* background on the customer: this was during the dotcom days, someone came up with a brilliant business idea and their business plan called for a windows environment. one of the large unix providers didn't particularly like hearing they were being cut out of the order based on windows, so they gave a major discount to the customer for buying their unix machines. management had already hired a bunch of windows admins, but the discount was good enough that they decided windows == unix and purchased the servers. the backup servers we sold ran on unix, but didn't "host any of their business apps" (their words, not mine) so the windows admins took to testing things on the backup server... now, back to our story. fm: how bad is it? george: you're talking to me after i've spent three hours trying to scrape this out of the ditch, how bad do you think? yes, george knew the nickname we had for him and the three other horsemen, he reveled in it. fm: bare metal recovery it is. so, i drive the two hours to the colo site to meet the customer and he shows me to the server. it's sitting at an ok&gt; prompt, about where you would expect a dead server to be sitting. on the plus side, he's already got the os disks sitting on the server. i throw disk one in and start the reinstall. fm: so, what happened? customer: well, we logged into the server and saw a message that this /net file system was full, i didn't have anything in there that i'd needed, so i went ahead and did an rm -rf /net/* to clean it up when suddenly the server panicked. facepalming in front of a customer is never a good idea, especially when you get to explain something to them again that you've already had this conversation three times previously. fm: /net? customer: yeah, not sure why that would have affected the server. fm: remember the last couple of times i was here and asked you who'd exported 127.0.0.1:/ to /net then mounted it back to itself on the backup server? customer: yeah. fm: do you remember me telling you not to do that? customer: i remember, but i don't remember why it was bad. fm: well, when you did that, you'd exported the root file system via nfs then mounted it back to /net. as i'd said before, anything you did in /net was going to affect root. by doing that rm -rf, you deleted the root file system. customer: ? fm: you shift-selected everything under c:\ then hit the shift-delete key. customer: ohhhhh... fm: you want to find the person who did this and beat them, preferably with something heavy. customer: but we never did that. sure, the server just decided to randomly do it to itself again... fm: did you ever lock down the box as i recommended with individual user accounts and sudo requirements? export logs to a log server? (customer service is allowed to recommend, we don't setup. if they want us to setup something, that's a professional services engagement which costs money... no one wants to spend money to get something setup for them). customer: well, no. fm: ok, then you're not really going to be able to figure who did this. i'm going to need the disaster recovery report from the last backup so we can do the recovery when the os install/patching finishes. we had this great report that ran at the end of every backup of the local machine. all of the information you need to perform a bare metal recovery of the backup server in the event something goes horribly wrong... like when you delete the root file system... customer: that email report? yeah, we stopped the server from mailing those to us. fm: ... customer: we didn't like receiving the email every day. fm: so, you don't know what the last tape id used by the server for the self backup was? customer: well, it's in the library. looking at the 180 tapes in the library unit.... fm: well, you have 180 tapes there, which specific tape is it? customer: how would i know. fm: well, it's listed in the disaster report.... customer started to figure out exactly how sad of a day he was going to have at that point. he was able to find a copy of one of the reports, it was only six months old. fortunately the tape from that backup was still in the library, so we were able to use that. the customer then got to manually import the 100 or so tapes that were created after that report so they had the ability to restore files from other machines. only took a week or so to import them all.so this happened 2 months ago... i was playing with my laptop at home and my 1 year old little champ niece hit my laptop hard(actually she hit the dongle connected in the usb port) and bang i saw a [*pink transparent layer*]( on lower half of my screen. i was worried very much because the laptop has passed the accidental warranty period months ago and i was (am) just a jobless 22 year old. i immediately called the hp tech support and they asked me to come to the service center (thats the procedure in india) which is 200 kms away from my home(roughly a 4 1/2 hour travel on bus). also they said to me that it would cost around rs.8000(roughly $120) to change the display. and then i was really worried not only because i have to travel 200 kms but also rs. 8000 is far fetched at that point of time for me. so, i was worried for two days and then went to a local pc assembling shop. and i explained to the techie there that i can't really afford 8k at that time. he listened to me with cool head and asked me to power on the laptop. and then when the pink transparent part showed up on the screen he just placed his hands on the edge of the monitor like [*this*]( on the exact point where the top of the pink layer starts and pressed his thumbs hard. and bang my screen became normal. and he didn't charge me for anything which was so nice. i am not sure whether he saved me $120(which is more likely because the hp techies always try to charge money for simple problems) but he definitely saved me 9 hours of travel. thank you techie... edit: fixed lap to laptop after /u/msstark comment edit 2: typo. previously referred niece to \*he\* &gt;tl;dr local techie repairs my laptop with his magical thumbs i always regretted not thanking him on that day as he was very busy. but for him i thank you all techies...&lt;3so it's lunchtime on a monday. i'm sitting at my desk munching on home-made baked goods and browsing tfts when my phone rings. &gt;**$receptionist**: hi, $manager wants to know what her fax number is. i don't have it either. do you know? &gt;*$manager is not known for her resourcefulness.* &gt;**me**: uh... no. i can find out for you though. &gt;**$receptionist**: thanks, that would be great. so i log into the hosted faxing solution and wade around the quagmire that passes for a ui, but the number and the email to which it's mapped just won't appear. i scour excel spreadsheets harking back to the time we implemented the solution, but turn up nought. eventually i find the data i need in a report buried deep within the festering bowels of the hosted service's ui. &gt;**me**: ah, here we go. the number is 12345678. &gt;**$receptionist**: thanks. she'll want to know why it isn't on $intranet_page - can you help with putting it there? &gt;**me**: well... sure, but nobody has requested that... &gt;**$receptionist**: well, she'll want to know where she can find it. you know $manager. indeed i do. most questions from $manager always seem to open a can of worms. she will definitely want to know where she can find it, and why it isn't publicised, how come she doesn't know what it is, why is a duck, etc. suddenly, a light comes on in my brain. i check out my hunch, and yep... &gt;**me**: it's in her email signature, right there next to "fax:". the general formula of having customers undo your hard work isn't new, i know, but this one just broke my goddamn heart because it was so *stupid*. a laptop had a failed hdd. i failed to feign surprise. the customer hadn't backed up any of their thousands of photos from the last 8 years. i didn't even try to feign surprise. instead, i upgraded it to an ssd, reloaded windows 7, stuck all the usual free useful software on there, activated it (by slic, because the coa had worn beyond legibility) and, when he brought his camera's sd card in, did some data recovery to get back *some* of his photos. all good. he had a windows 7 retail pack in his hand when he came to collect it. now, if i'd been thinking, i might've asked him more about it, because it tells a story: it says the coa on the laptop wasn't windows 7, it says he bought a pack himself and upgraded it. it says he likes to tinker. still, i showed him the machine working, showed him how to do a few things, showed him the software i'd installed. it was obvious he no longer needed to use it. obvious! right? right. i got a call from his wife today, not 24 hours later, reporting that she'd "put windows 7 on" as per his instruction and now everything was gone. the recovered data, the programs, the shortcuts. i probed with a few questions and yes, sure enough, *he'd told her* to stick the windows cd in and install windows. quote: "*we'll need this on there.*" they'd done it from *within* windows, too: they'd put the cd in and followed the autorun installer, *while windows was booted up*, because they thought they "needed windows". me: **why** did he think that needed doing? her: he said it wasn't on there. the data was retrievable from the windows.old, of course. his dignity probably won't be.so i work as call support for about 20 small businesses. basically business that are large enough to have enough employees to have dedicated servers but not large enough to have on-site it staff. so i'm doing my weekly meet and greet for one of my larger clients a doctors office - saying hi to the staff, asking if there are any problems, checking the physical hardware, etc. one of the nurses asks me if i could look at a problem. she needs two pictures (before and after surgery) presented on the page vertically, not horizontally. not thinking anything of it, i walk around the back of the desk and am presented with two sets of boobs in all their high def, color corrected, silicone enhanced glory. giving myself a second to get acclimated to the software, i found the portrait/landscape option and swapped it. tl;dr saw boobs as part of work todayso at my office we're spoiled in that we only have three models of laptop to support. it's a case in which, the initial batch (model 1, the oldest) was bought four years ago for everybody. as people came on board afterwards, they were provided the next generation of laptop (model 2) as model 1 was no longer being made. model 3 came about the same way, model 2 no longer available but it was provided to new people. now, the office is looking at model 4, which is going to eventually be slated for a mass replacement of all the model 1s. generally speaking, the model 1's are pieces of crap. 2's and 3's are actually really nice. it will be good for everyone having the 1's out and having well-running equipment all around. anyways, we have a demo model of the 4 for testing in our office. cue, cluelessguy (cg). he'd been told to come in for a bios update to fix a known issue. usually this is about a five minute process. and of course, he comes in and spots the demo model and immediately starts asking for one. &gt;cg - just give me one of those, that will fix the problem. this thing runs like crap. i'm a bit puzzled, because he's got a model 3 (ivy bridge i5, 8gb ram) &gt;makesnosense - that's a little strange, you've got one of the newest ones here already. but i'm sorry, you're not due for replacement yet. those are coming for the people who have model 1's. &gt;cg - well you should give me one anyways. i can barely get any work done on that piece of crap. will this boss upgrade help? &gt;makesnosense - it will at least resolve your battery charging issue, but i can't promise the computer will run better. this shouldn't take long, but before we get started i see you have a few documents open. the process requires a reboot, so could you please save and close all of your documents? he gives me a look as if i had just told him we need to put wasabi in his eye. &gt;cg - are you serious? i have to close all my stuff? we go back and forth for a few minutes while i explain, and in a huff he starts saving/closing. and saving/closing. and five minutes pass, still saving/closing. so i start counting how many programs he had open. at 42, he says "it's nothing important anyways, can i just push the button?" i'm not real keen on that, but the problem is already obvious. i do a shutdown and windows yells that there are 27 programs open. force them all closed, do my thing, and i explain that if he actually closes things as he's done using them then his computer will run much better. i have no idea if he understands or not. some quick math - 42 programs closed that i counted, plus 27 more that were left when we shut it down, for 69 programs. the five minutes of save/close he may have been doing four windows per minute, for an additional 20 windows, total of 89 programs (or more). sorry dude, no computer is going to run well when you have that much stuff open. no way, no how. edit: yay formatting! edit 2: you all rock! thank you for all the feedback and upvotes! to answer a few questions: no, cg did not get a new machine. we are stuck for 3 years once an asset is tied to us. he had a mix of programs open, handful of our proprietary software, probsbly a dozen or so powerpoint presentations, maybe 20-30 excel spreadsheets, another 10 or so word documents, etc. we are a large enterprise environment, so we tend to run a bunch of crap in the background too. on an idle windows session we have 75-85 processes running to begin with. i don't think he didn't know how to close windows, rather, i think every time he needed something he just opened a new copy of it. he seemed to genuinely not know what he was doing was incorrect during a follow up conversation. and yes, i agree with the responses that he should be doing something that doesn't involve a computer anyways. he does too... and i edited my confusion of cue and queueu!had an elderly man (roughly 85 years old) come in and say his all-in-one isn't turning on all the way. i turn it on, device posts, then says "no bootable device found." at this point, i'm thinking, the hard drive is corrupted, failed, etc. proceed to open it up to pull the hard drive to check the condition and check the possibility to retrieving data. when i finally get the thing opened, i understood why it was not detecting a boot device. there literally was no hard drive in the all-in-one.... trying to explain what the hard drive does to an 85 year old man has proven to be difficult. (question: in what scenario would an 85 year old man somehow just randomly lose his all-in-one hard drive one day? the device was not easy to open)i work as an i.t. support specialist for a medical company in the south-central arizonan valley. it's a fairly easy-going job, and often times problems are rather simple. one of my tasks is to set new hires up with user accounts in active directory. easy enough. we had a new hire start working today, and i had passed along her account info to her supervisor as i usually do. not twenty minutes into my monday morning, i get a call on my personal cell phone (which i don't mind *too* much seeing as i made the choice to put it on my email signature) i just would have preferred that they opened a ticket instead. our conversation went a little bit like this: me: this is basilthebatlord. $nh (new hire): help! i can't log in, the username and password you gave me are wrong! me: is that so? let me take a look for you. *i remote into our active directory server and reset her password to what i emailed her supervisor just as a precaution* me: give it another try for me $nh: it's just returning to the log in screen *red flag number one* i try to remote into her computer, but apparently teamviewer wasn't running. no big deal, i'll just use windows rdp to get in. *windows remote desktop connection is not enabled on this pc* i was a little bit frustrated at this point, but i held my tongue and went out to her office, which was just up the road; again no big deal. once i arrive at her office, i have her log in for me. as she types her password she **uses the caps lock as the shift key** *red flag number two* she then proceeded to *click the cancel button without reading it thinking it would magically log her in* i almost slammed my head directly into her desk when that happened. i tell her to log in again, but this time to press the return key, and not click the cancel button. so, she does exactly what she was told and clicks the cancel button again $nh oops, force of habit lol *how can you have a habit if you can't log into a computer to use it* it took her a third try, but once she got in she was grateful. why aren't basic computer skills a job requirement at my company?office rumor mills are always fast, but sometimes they beat comprehension. i walked into the office after the meeting with hr and youngsec where he was moved to it. i needed a coffee. colorblindit and greypantssuitit came up to me as i reached for the beans. &gt;colorblind: so i hear we’re getting a new member. &gt;greyit: and you’re not happy about it. grey it was always blunt. she was the sledgehammer of the office, no finesse just on the point. she was sorta the best. &gt;me: yep. youngsec’s coming to work for us. &gt;colorblind: so how are we going to punish him? &gt;me: sorry? &gt;greyit: he did pull the network down for two hours. &gt;colorblind: lets get him to test the switch he fixed, by counting the flashes all day. &gt;me: haha could we tell him its wrong and to do a recount everyday for a year? &gt;greyit: i think for every hour he wasted for us, he should have to man an it help desk. &gt;me: ohhh… too harsh. exposing him to users, would be too mean. &gt;colorblind: how about we find the oldest computer we have, and get him to use that. &gt;me: that might slow him down, probably not slow enough though. &gt;greyit: we could get out an old punchcard system and get him to punch everything he wants to write into a pc on to cards. &gt;me: er… do you know how to punch those cards? i took a sip of my coffee. the camaraderie was a nice change. &gt;colorblind: no. sadly no. it was at this point that youngsec walked in. he looked happy. he didn’t realize he’d recently pulled down a proud it teams network. an it team who was now with him all day. it was like a lamb to the slaughter. -0-0-0- ps. i realize the no pranking tales rule. however this story is about comrade at arms in the it sector. we didn't play any of the pranks listed to anyone. :) [next]( [older]( it stopped again. a voice called out from the void, i ignored it. i chose to stare at my blank screen instead. blank is good. clean. crisp. &gt;destroyer: hello? airz. i said, it stopped again. i broke free from my dreams, shook off my delightful rest and gave the man in front of my the hardest stare i could make. &gt;me: what? the voice that emanated out from my mouth sounded cold, detached. &gt;destroyer: it just stopped, you know... i was just using it normally and it just, stopped. &gt;me: just. stopped. my mind imagined all the problems that could be described as “it just stopped”. there are lots. lots and lots. the destroyer held up a company phone. &gt;destroyer: they told me i couldn’t get anymore credit. they said i had to come see you. &gt;me: who, told you? my chair creaked as i grabbed the device from his hand. i examined it slowly, its data graph impressively told me he’d managed to download 10gb of data in a five hour window. &gt;destroyer: er... the.. i stared directly into his eyes, not as a display of dominance. i was trying to see why he thought i was dumb enough to buy his “using it normally” story. &gt;destroyer: are you ummm .... alright? you seem a little off. maybe i’ll come back later. &gt;me: me?... oh i’m fine. this phone though. i held up the phone between two fingers, gave the destroyer a look of disgust and dumped it in the paper bin. &gt;destroyer: my phone! why are you putting it in the bin? &gt;me: that is not your primary concern at the moment. sit down. destroyer looked at the phone in the bin regretfully. he cautiously took a seat. &gt;destroyer: i really think we should find a better bin for... my disdain for the destroyer had grown to such a point i think i was bearing my teeth. i couldn’t help it. &gt;me: you think bins are important? bins?! your waste of company resources, your flagrant dereliction of duties. you’ve used over 30gb of mobile data. &gt;destroyer: has something happened? no one ever made a fuss before. &gt;me: in a week! and all videos! i looked over to my blank screen, it was a shame to break the clean crisp white peace. revocation of support and devices for employee.... smacking away at the keyboard i typed a honest assessment of destroyer’s technical capabilities. so as to be fair the document included a blank list of technical skills he’d mastered. i even included a handy table outlining the number of hours destroyer had spent on various sites with mobile data. &gt;destroyer: seriously airz. i’m worried about you man. you look ... ? maybe go take a holiday, you’ll come back feeling much better. &gt;me: and done. i punched the final full stop into the document and promptly printed it off. fetching the paper from the out tray i quickly signed it and handed it too the destroyer. &gt;destroyer: and this is ... ? &gt;me: a contract i want you to sign. destroyer glanced at the piece of paper for a second. he seemed to glaze over vaguely. &gt;destroyer: what does it say? &gt;me: here is a pen. amazingly instead of reading, destroyer just signed his name at the bottom. right next to the line that said “i agree with the above written”. i wondered why fraudsters even existed, you didn’t need to fake signatures, people just sign things they’re given. &gt;destroyer: can i get my phone out of the bin now? &gt;me: no. you’re never getting a phone again. i yanked the contract out of his hands. i gave destroyer the first real true smile i’d had in months. &gt;destroyer: what?! but i just signed.... i wordlessly printed off another copy of the document and handed it over to destroyer. this time he decided to actually read the piece of paper. &gt;destroyer: potentially incompetent? malicious negligence?! what... this is **so** mean. &gt;me: you signed it. destroyer looked shiftily down at the paper. &gt;destroyer: i’m worried about you airz, normally you’re so nice. today you’re in a weird mood. i really think a holiday will do you good. &gt;me: a holiday? today’s the first day in ages i finally feel like i’m back. destroyer hurried to the door and called out to the office. &gt;destroyer: redcheer? redcheer? where’s redcheer, airz is acting all ... weird. i heard a voice call out from one of the desks in the it department. &gt;voice: redcheer? where have you been these past few months? she’s gone...this actually happened today. and it's my first post to tfts so be nice please. i went over to my uncle's house for a barbecue this evening, and i wanted to show my sister a video i found on youtube. no problem, i set up my uncle's wifi a few years ago and as far as i knew nothing had changed. when i looked for his network it wasn't there, and had been replaced by a generic named unsecured wifi channel instead. i immediately looked up and mentioned it to him. mind you - my uncle is about 70 years old now and has never been good with technology. he let his neighbor install ubuntu onto his decade+ old desktop because it was running slow and that's easier than replacing the shitty old windows xp machine apparently. i have no idea how he learned the os, but it runs worse than xp ever did on his computer. anyway, that's a headache story for a different day. i looked up and told him that his wireless network wasn't secured and that anyone nearby who wanted to could jump on it without a second thought. i was definitely concerned about it. instead of being worried and asking me to fix it, which would have maybe taken two minutes of my time, he simply looked up and said "oh, we don't use our wifi. it's not a problem." i could have gone into why he should still be concerned, but there were yummy burgers in front of me and i was on a time limit (i work overnight shifts at a 24 hour help desk), so i bit my tongue and let it go. i'm waiting to get a call from him saying something's wrong his computer because someone joined his network and played around with other devices on it. minor edit: tensing[previous]( my headache was growing. i could sense the imminent arrival of pda’s all with windows mobile 5.5. i tried to ignore it. defiant sat in my office with his arms crossed. &gt;me: so… want to do some tickets? &gt;defiant: no. i’m not even talking to you. urgh. i needed a fun distraction, not an angry teen. &gt;me: why don’t we take a look at the queue? &gt;defiant: …. i decided to take a look at the queue, regardless of defiant’s speechlessness. **new ticket** the computer is making funny noises. —legal secretary &gt;me: should we go up and take a look? or ask for clarification? &gt;defiant: we’re not talking. 'why is defiant angry?' i thought to myself. i couldn’t bring myself to care. &gt;me: lets go take a look at the legal secretaries computer, yeah? &gt;defiant: … i shrugged and got up from my chair. as i walked over to the door defiant finally spoke. &gt;defiant: i can’t believe you sold me! &gt;me: sold you? i didn’t sell you…. i … err… loaned you out. &gt;defiant: you bartered me like i was an item! i’m offended. &gt;me: really? ….offended? i was demonstrating how valuable you are by attempting to trade you for a “**big** favor”. defiant thought for a second. i saw a glimmer of a smile, but it was immediately extinguished. &gt;defiant: hr didn’t accept! my time isn’t worth a big favour. before i could retaliate however, we arrived at legal secretaries desk. her computer sounded like an aircraft, taking off. &gt;defiant: is your computer always this loud? &gt;legalsec: it only started making noises today. defiant put his hand on the desktop tower. he immediately pulled it back with a shock &gt;defiant: oh my! it’s burning up. defiant shut down the computer and turned to see an increasingly worried legal secretary. &gt;defiant: don’t worry, we’ll sort it out. &gt;legalsec: is it a simple fix? if not, i don’t want to waste your time. it’s probably not worth investigating... do you bill by the minute like lawyers? defiant stared blankly at legalsec. i realised it was my time to step in. &gt;me: don’t worry legalsec. it doesn’t bill your department for something going wrong. &gt;legalsec: oh thank goodness. my stationary budget is almost overdrawn. i can’t go another month without new pens. my mind boggled as i looked around the department. not a spare pen to be seen. &gt;me: we’ll get you a loaner laptop while this computer cools down. &gt;legalsec: thanks. defiant and i started walking back to it to fetch a loaner laptop. &gt;defiant: even if they did charge by the minute… hr thinks my time is worth what? less then the price of a poster? &gt;me: some posters are worth a lot! &gt;defiant: well … it would be good to know i’m appreciated occasionally. &gt;me: listen defiant, you’re a decent worker. i appreciate the effort you bring to it. i watched as a smile formed on defiant’s face. i waited for defiant to return some appreciation onto me, but it never came. then i remembered…. i work in it. [next](there i was... looking out my window at the warm sun waiting for 4pm to roll around and enjoy the nice breeze. *ring ring mfer* in this episode of why isp call centers have comedians as customers! starring: $me $cc (confused customer) $bb (big boss aka my boss) level 2 tech $l2 $me: hello? $l2: hey $me, i have this customer whose being irate and refusing to speak with billing because she owes $730.23 not including equipment fees and demands to speak to "the damn tech people who turned off my internet" she wants to speak to my supervisor, aka you. &gt;$me: well we aren't the damned tech people who turned her internet off but you can send her on through. &gt;$l2: thanks, she's mad. * thinking great, 30 minutes till time to go home and a furious lady* &gt;$me: hi, you've been transferred to $me, what can i do for you? &gt;$cc: yeah you can turn on my fucking internet. &gt;$me: first, i'm not being rude to you, so don't try to bully me. second, if you continue to swear at me this call will disconnect with a complaint followed up for harassing my techs and myself. third, we didn't turn off your services, billing did. &gt;$cc: *still yelling* why did they turn it off! &gt;$me: from what i can see due to a balance of 730.23 being owed. did you want to make a payment of $486 to turn services back on? &gt;$cc: no, i'm not paying anything. i stopped paying my bill because i wasn't happy with the service and i wasn't going to pay for something i wasn't happy with. &gt;$me: did you call in about not being happy with the services? &gt;$cc: no, i figured ya'll would see the services not being used and call and ask why. &gt;$me: just looking at the account here, i can see you used 335gb of data, someone has been. &gt;$cc: i want to speak to your supervisor, now!! &gt;$me: certainly * trying not to laugh* *places on hold and transfers over* &gt;$me: hey $bb customer wants to speak with you. &gt;$bb: come on $me, it's 3:55 and it's almost time to go. can't she just "get lost" in the transfer? ah i know no, go ahead and send her through. by the way what's it about? &gt;$me: oh her balance being owed, here she comes. bye! &gt;$bb: wai - click- 4pm came around and i see a message on lync from $bb. &gt;$bb: meet me in the conference room now! $me: *thinking outloud* oh great, a complaint meeting. i walk into the room and the level 1 who originally took the call is sitting there looking like he'd just seen a server fall from the empire state building. level 2 is sitting there just staring at level 1, so i sit down next to level 2 in case level 1 starts to cry. in walks $bb and his boss $hb... * oh shit oh shit, goes through my mind* &gt;$bb: evening gentleman, level 1 why do you look like you just walked through hell? anyway, i gathered you here today because we had a very interesting call that managed to make it the whole way up to me. she said she was "treated rudely" by everyone on her way up the chain. thankfully, $hb was in the room so i put it on speaker and kept it going. we gave her the choice, pay balance and get the services back, pay $155 and we will drop the balance and bar her from service or her last option, ignore it and let it go to collections. she paid the balance and her services are on. now, i listened to your calls, none of you where rude she was just angry. good job! now let's get out of here before she calls back.. thank you boss man for not being someone who just says yes to please the customer and throws his minions under the bus.long time reader, first time poster. a tale of the three kingdoms inside the weird world of traffic engineering: the tribe of "smashy-smashy" (civil engineers), the kingdom of "fuck that: it's less than 240v" (electricians) and the republic of "what do you mean we have to do computers now?" (electronic engineers). the worst failures across the system occur when these three groups of engineers have to deal with one system. these are their stories. (cue law and order *dun dun*). i am a proud citizen of the republic. the republic currently consists of 8 fully-fledged liam neesons who all have a very particular set of skills, and me: the roving trainee. in addition to our normal duties, we offer 3rd line support to anyone who puts money in the big jar marked "beer". this story involves my personal favourite liam neeson - a man who once wrote code in order to avoid finding a ruler to measure a line. at the time of this story, i am his padwan. he is my jedi master. our republic received a communication from yonder: &gt;traffictrainee: "hello, third line technical support. how best may i drop my daily duties and sort out your problems instead?" &gt;traffic networker: "we need this mag stud working. we need it now. the entire traffic network of the city will come to a screaming halt if we don't. the planet's rotation will be effected. cats and dogs, living together...!!" for those of you not in the know (can i be one of you? please?!?), magnetometer technology has just started to be implemented in ur roads, collecting ur traffic data. it's a simple system really - a magnetometer "stud" buried in the road which has a magnetic field. when a car passes over, the change in the magnetic field (electromagnetism 101) makes the magnetometer send data (over domestic wifi frequencies) to a wireless repeater which is mounted on a pole, tree or stationary pigeon above ground, which then sends its information to a wired access point which relays information to a local out-station to the in-station. back on the call, traffic networker has begun to hyperventilate. (i have a standing pact with another member of the republic to have a bullet shot into my brain should i ever care that much about traffic.) there have been a lot of these failures recently, so much so that the engineers who regularly deal with these are so over-worked dealing with the faults that we've started wondering whether there's something deeply wrong with the devices themselves. &gt;traffictrainee: "let me just talk to our resident ruler of all things magnetometery..." and lo, there he sat, my jedi master, no doubt trying to hack into our "secure network" in order to get a non-approved but genuinely really shitting useful piece of monitoring software working. i knelt down on one knee and basked in his aura. &gt;traffictrainee: "master, i implore you. i have a message from the yonder department of traffic network. a young traffic networker is seeking resolution of a fault." &gt;jedi master: "but i've got nandos in my calender tho" i nodded, accepting my master's dilemma. he was unmoved by the traffic networker's pleas, although i could still hear traffic networker's sobbing over the line. however, i am afflicted with something which needs to be beaten out of me during my jedi apprenticeship: empathy for users. it was my job to fulfil the obligations which my master was unable to, lest he be unable to enjoy his peri-peri chicken. so, i had to cart my butt to site. on getting there and opening the cabinet, i proved connection from the out-station to the in-station. that was the easy part. now i had to deal with the bullshit that was the out-station system. as i said before, communication between the magnetometers, wireless repeaters and access points is in the domestic wifi range. you know, the 2.4ghz, 14 channels dealy. so, it's really great that there's no such thing as channel congestion, where local domestic wifi devices can clog up a channel, right? and it's even better that we're not in an extremely built-up area, where we're likely to experience a high level of devices across all channels, yeah? yeah... the little lost stud was in an absolute sea of domestic wifi. it was drowning, amid the local high school's multi-channel wireless internet, and so every time it tried to squeak a vehicle detection to it's wireless repeater, the message was lost in the ocean. i tried to call out to it, desperately, to get it to change it's freaking channel to one less congested, but it couldn't hear me. it was jack and i was rose. *my heart will go on and on...* so, i had to pull out the big guns. and by big guns, i mean a wooden box which my jedi master constructed in his garage which consists of a big fuck off access point which i could place on top of the magnetometer stud to yell a hell of a lot louder. but still, it was deaf to me, trapped in some sort of sensory hell. nought for it but to pull it out. i called up my contact in the tribe. &gt;ugg: (politely) "ugg?" &gt;traffictrainee: "me traffictrainee. you ugg. you pull out shiny-shiny from road with suitable tools. i stand far away for fear of being hit in the face by pavement. you replace with new shiny-shiny i configu - uhh make more worky." &gt;ugg: (decisively) "...ugg." of course, it was going to take some time for ugg to arrive and pull out the stud, so i set up a new magnetometer stud far away from the north atlantic sea that was that stretch of road. i put it on a band which was far less congested (wifi analyser ftw!), set up the wireless repeaters and access points to accept the new stud when it's put in and left it in the cabinet for ugg to put into the road. home, reddit, food, reddit, sleep, reddit, back to the office. the next day. &gt;traffictrainee: "hello, third line technical support?" &gt;traffic networker: (sounds of gunshots in the background, children screaming, the end is nigh) "it's not working it's still not working" ...shit. now, at this point i'm still a trainee, so i'm having a minor crisis in my knowledge of the system. from my point of view it's quite simple, but there might be something i overlooked. my calender is quite sparse, so i opt to go out again rather than distract my master, who is busy borgifying small animals (designing a small camera with live-stream capability to put onto his rabbit). at site, i see the stud is gone from where i left it and, in its place, a stone tablet etched with drawings i recognise as being ugg's report of installation. i fear the worst - but as i lionel ritchie out into the system (*hello? is it a334f you're looking for?*) i can actually communicate with the new stud! it's a miracle! but it's still not detecting anything... i drive my van over it a couple of times, still nothing. i know the device needs to be trained, but at this point it's flat out ignoring me. i wonder whether the stud is faulty (a possibility, especially with all the recent failures pointing that way). either way, i'm a feeble electronics engineer who hasn't picked up a tool bigger than a hammer in her life, so i call up ugg. &gt;ugg: (happy) "ugg!" &gt;traffictrainee: "me traffictrainee. you ugg. you meet me at site, i buy you tea with 7 sugars. deal?" &gt;ugg: (decisively) "ugg." when i meet ugg, i stand well back as he pick-axes his way into the tarmac and brings up the poor magnetometer which never had a chance to live, speared on the pointy end. as ugg danced around his kill, i notice that the way it had been installed. &gt;traffictrainee: "uhm, ugg? when you put shiny-shiny in ground, where was arrow on top of shiny-shiny pointing?" ugg gave me a wide eyed stare and pointed to his god, the sun. i try not to facepalm and instead point to the wording written onto the new stud, and indeed on all studs. &gt;traffictrainee: "arrow is to point in direction of traffic, ugg. so, in this case, that way." ugg's eyes went even wide. i'm not really bothered, considering that i'd rather it be an issue with installation then my shitty set-up or the congested wifi. it's a simple fix. but ugg started pointing desperately at the back of his van. i raise an eyebrow and follow him. throwing open the back of the van, i blink. in the back of the van, carnage. a mess of half-destroyed studs and tarmac. boxes upon boxes of spent magnetometer casings. i realise what ugg is trying to communicate with me with a sinking feeling. &gt;traffictrainee: "ugg... how many of these studs have you installed recently?" ripping off his shirt and falling to his knees, ugg howled at his sun god for forsaking him. and that is how i spent the next week re-commissioning over one hundred new magnetometer studs, just because some genius didn't think that civil engineers might be perfectly nice guys, but completely unable to read english. edit: gold??!?! gold?!?! i don't even know what that is, but i love it.i'll say it - anytime i've retold this story, i don't think anyone has ever believed it - i have to be honest, i wouldn't either. however, me and at least two other people in the world know this to be absolutely true. i was doing a contract for a major national public sector organisation. obviously no names, but if you've ever been to london, you've been a customer. it was your standard high staff turnover, pay em till they get bored, throw them the bs tasks kind of role. anyway, one day, myself and another contractor were set the task of a machine hunt. basically the network was a hodge-podge of bolted on spokes using various standards, practically held together with poor soldering and bits of gaffa tape. however, there were a list of umpteen windows 9x machines which were apparently alive on the user subnets which needed reimaging to xp or replacing. our job was to do the pre-project hunt to determine who was using them and where they were. i say pre-project, it wasn't exactly "thought out"... it was some task that appeared from the ether which would most likely be re-filed into the ether. this is the same organisation who only a few months prior saw a £70,000 shipment from dell literally get delivered outside their offices, which nobody retrieved or was aware even being ordered and over the course of the next 24 hours were promptly retrieved by members of the public! yep, it got left there overnight and there were only docking stations left! good use of public money, eh? anyway, we hunted down an old compaq on our list. serial matched, ip matched, now to talk to the user. the user was a guy who wore a grey suit, impeccably turned out but who looked like he was about to wet himself with fear. he asked us several times who we were, what we wanted, what for, where was this information going, etc. after placating him as much as possible that it was just an upgrade programme and we were it support, he finally relinquished his name. it just so happened, another machine we were hunting for was right next to his desk; our decision to wait around for this user to return was overshadowed by his worried glances... after a few minutes of uncomfortable "i'm pretending to not acknowledge you" silence, we went away aiming to return later - ideally when he had disappeared. a few days later, the same contractor and i were out on a pub lunch. the guy happens to come in and immediately notices us. he's weird, really weird. he walks quickly to the back of the pub, hovers, glances at us and then makes for the door. of course now we're talking about him, like wtf!? he makes an about turn at the door and comes up to us; he nervously asks "are you definitely just it support?" we reply and say yep, and he just immediately leaves with an "ok thank you". of course we're weirded out, but whatever. we just put him down as a fruitloop. again another few days later, we're out on a smoke break, this guy appears again seemingly on a smoke break too. his eyes are wide as soon as he notices us, but as he's already lit his cigarette, he kinda has to come out now. we're wary of him, this guy is a fruitcake. he tries to make small talk; it seems to me he's probing, so i just come out and talk about what we do all day, pretending to moan about our menial duties. anyway, it turns out after a few more chance encounters he kinda settles down and starts talking - mainly about f1 racing, etc. he shows up again on a friday afternoon drink, this time with his wife in tow. it turns out that he has every right to have been nervous. this guy was initially hired as part of a major projects team in the organisation. he applied for a role, got accepted, gave in notice at his old job and duly showed up for work as prescribed. however, as it turns out, in between getting confirmed for his role and actually starting, the entire major projects department had gotten nuked. the manager who hired him had left the business, members of the team were scattered far and wide, yet he showed up, some receptionist showed him to his desk where he was to wait for someone and nobody showed up. he made enquiries, all he ever got told was that someone would come talk to him eventually - but nobody ever did. for the last 11 years, he had shown up for work. nobody ever hassles him, nobody ever asks him for anything, sometimes he just doesn't show up and nobody questions it, he gets paid every month, gets a statutory annual pay rise and that's it. he's been filling his time writing books for the past 8 years on this that and the other, and that is literally what he does every day. as the physical office he's in also has a high staff turnover, there's no time to make relationships or for anyone to even really acknowledge him. of course, he was slightly inebriated at that point. i just thought he was plain outright nuts permenantly resident in psychos-ville. i didn't believe a word of it. it's too hollywood to be true! that was until the monday morning, we had to check. sure enough, hr systems showed his dept had indeed been nuked mere days after he was recruited and his active manager on the hr system had indeed long since left the business. everything we did to verify his story checked out. we even performed a few random drop-ins and, sure enough, there he is with word opened and he's tapping out page 370 for a novel. he never seems to do anything. of course, he's back to being nervous again as he let his guard down while drunk and told someone. even his wife at the time seemed to corroborate his tale. i left the contract a couple of months later, but as far as i know, he's still there. i still even questioned the reality of such a situation. however... on my first day of that role, i duly asked where it was. i was told to go with a massive group of people to induction. i passed three checkpoints where security guards asked my name and, though i wasn't on their list, let me through with an "ok must be a mess up". one even said "who's your manager?" to which i replied "i have no idea, i've only just arrived." he too allowed me through. what i went into was an entire day's induction for permenant staff. a lot of sensitive stuff got said, a lot of activities went on - nothing catastrophically major, don't get me wrong - but there we have it. on leaving and switching my phone back on, i had several voicemails from my recruiter demanding to know my whereabouts. i told him i'd been in induction which surprised him. it took me another 30 minutes to track down which it department i was even supposed to be in, and even a day later got told i was still in the wrong place while i was arms-deep into laying some network cable! this place was so disorganised, i cannot think of anything to discredit his account - other than how absolutely jaw-dropping it is! lucky - fkkk!!!!!! tl/dr - someone shows up for a new job to find his department nuked to the ground; he ends up flying under the radar for 11 years with full salary and nothing to do but write novels.this is my first post here. it will be a short and sweet one. emp - employee. dir - director of the software development company and also a programmer. so my director walks in and starts hitting his keyboard. &gt;dir: what the f***! &gt;... &gt;dir: emp get over here and have a look at this. &gt;emp: whats up &gt;dir: i can't get my mac to work and i have been typing at it for the past couple of minutes &gt;** i noticed the issue ** &gt;emp: i know whats wrong here. &gt;dir: really, what? &gt;emp: look. &gt;dir: what? &gt;emp: look again. &gt;dir: oh... motherf***er. quickest support i ever done. it turned out that my director had forgotten to bring in his macbook but the keyboard was there and he was just typing away while looking at his windows desktop monitor. so now we have added it to the twiki of stupid shit people do and gave him a muppet soft toy. we use muppets to symbolize when some is a muppet. [muppet definition (as this is a commonly used brit term)]( edit: at request i have also attached an image of one of the muppets. [muppet image!]( so hope you enjoyed my first post here and i hope i can add more in the future.edit 1: i meant w-4, not w-2. i'm dumb. edit 2: a w-4 is a form you fill out when beginning employment, for those who aren't familiar with the tree-annihilating abomination that is the american tax system. --- between my junior and senior year of university, i declined an offer to go back to my previous internship for a few reasons, the main one being the culture (and my dad's insistence to get out while i can). of course, this left me without an internship for the summer, until my rich professor (rp) heard of my plight. he offered me $14 an hour at almost full time (state laws prevented a full 40 hours). this is the story of my first day. the company rp currently owns is a utility services firm; we contract out to telecoms and the like to do their projects. the project the company was on during my time was a shutdown of an extremely dated cellular network to repurpose the spectrum for lte. our job was to document each of the 20,000ish cell sites and determine whether shutting off power to the old equipment would cause other issues. usually it was another cellular technology or the tower lights, but i'm pretty sure i saw a microwave oven at one point. the business used a 3 step process: 1. analyze the images and report sent in from the field techs because they tended to be less than reliable 1. resize, rename, and zip (rrz) the files to meet the specifications of our client, and 1. upload the zipped files to the client's project management platform. on my first day, after being given the lay of the land, i was assigned to work on rrz. each site took 5-10 minutes for this process, and like any good techie, i got bored. i realized there was a way to break it down: * rotate any images in portrait orientation * resize the files * rename them with the site name and an incrementing number * add them to a zip archive i downloaded python and got to work. three and a half hours later, i'd automated the process, and even managed to squeeze a better compression ratio out of it. rp saw that the rrz backlog was almost empty and came up to me. &gt;rp: how are you doing that? you can't actually be processing everything. &gt;me: i wrote a script that does it automatically. just drag the files from the network share and it takes care of the rest. &gt;rp: show me. two minutes and several sites later, rp was a believer. he brought me into his office. &gt;rp: do you know what you've done? &gt;me: ? &gt;rp: you turned our three step process into a two step process. here's your w-4. &gt;me: just glad to help. &gt;rp: you saved us hundreds of man-hours. i think we can afford to pay you a bit more than your offer stated. an hour or two later, i went home with a $1/hour raise and a promise of something much more interesting than just processing sites... but that's a story for another time.
