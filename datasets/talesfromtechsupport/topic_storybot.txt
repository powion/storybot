today while at work my fellow tech support agent threatened me with a remote wipe on my computer. so i shouted (chatted) "do it" and forgot about it. five minutes later our dba comes into my office and starts wiping down my monitor and desktop with a tissue. he looks at me and says "remote wipe complete" and walks away. edit: oh, wow! thanks for the gold!i worked tech support in a 2nd line role for 2 years before i left to pursue my dream as a web developer. i love tech support, and am always willing to help someone out, but i also really enjoy writing code. as it is a small team, my new position entails various roles, but the 97% of the time is working on the company's website. for the first time since starting, i was asked by another member of staff to provide support to a woman who insisted our website was down. call forwarded to me, i did a quick check. the website was not down. &gt; $me: hello tk338 speaking, how can i help you? &gt; $user: hi, yes, i want to place an order on your website but i am unable too &gt; $me: okay, just talk me through what you are doing, i will be happy to help! &gt; $user: well i go to google, type $companyname and its not there &gt; $me: not a problem. in the same place you typed www.google.com if you can just type $companyswebsite it should come up for you. &gt; $user: oh wow! thank you! thank you so much. good bye... *click* after a few frantic searches, i turn to my manager: &gt; $me: boss, we have a problem, we are no longer listed on google...backdrop: i am the entirety of it at a resort. recently i walked in to my boss's office (she is part of accounting), and had this brief conversation. &gt;me: so i heard $employee is no longer with us &gt; &gt;boss: that is correct. &gt; &gt;me: and she's been gone a few weeks now? &gt; &gt;boss: also correct. &gt; &gt;me: so, do you want me to, i don't know, disable her network access? also you might want me to disable her email access, since she has that set up on her personal phone and all. &gt; &gt;boss: ... yes please she is supposedly going to review the termination procedure with hr. i am waiting with ~~baited~~ **bated** breath... edit: ty /u/redlotusaustin for the correctionlong time reader, first time poster. so this story happened to me yesterday, and i thought you all would love this. i work at a university’s technology help desk. we have computers that we check-out to students. so this one student, let’s call him macbook bro, comes up to the desk and checks out a mac laptop. he comes back a few minutes later. &gt; macbook bro: this charger doesn’t work. &gt; me: okay, i’ll swap it out. our chargers get abused a lot, so i thought nothing of it when he said it didn’t work. about 15 minutes later, he comes back again, this time with the computer. &gt; macbook bro: hey, this computer doesn’t charge and it won’t turn on. &gt; me: huh, okay. let’s swap the computer out. &gt; macbook bro: yeah, i opened the mac to make sure the battery was connected and everything. i had not had enough time to check the charger, so i figured it was just the mac that wasn’t working and that the original charger was fine. at the time, i didn’t hear that he said he opened our mac to make sure the battery was connected. (i realize i should have said something at this point.) so, i checked out another mac to him. about 40 minutes later, he comes back to return the equipment. &gt; macbook bro: so, listen. i spilled water on my personal laptop and i wanted to use one of yours to test my components to see if they still work. so, i took apart two of your macs. but, when i put this one back together, the keyboard stopped working. so… he told me all of this, and i was at a loss for words. i really didn’t know what to say. i was more surprised that someone would do this to equipment that they don’t own. &gt; me: you’re not supposed to do this. you’re not allowed to open up the check-out equipment. &gt; macbook bro: oh. i didn’t know that. wtf. why would you think it’s okay to open up a laptop that you don’t own and then mess it up? even if he didn’t tell me, i would have caught on to what happened since our checkout system keeps track of who the last person was to get the equipment. hope he enjoys paying for 2 macs. edit 1... tech looked at the second mac that had the messed up keyboard. looks like the ribbon cable was bent. he fixed it and now the keyboard works. but, wifi is not working correctly. not sure if its hardware or software so im going to just reformat it and see if that fixes it. still waiting to see whats up with the first laptop. edit 2... the second laptop the client took apart is working fine now. reformat fixed wifi issues. the first one on the other hand is fried. waiting to see what the cost is to fix it.user says a piece of software they call "contact management" doesn't work. i log in and make settings adjustments then open the software. contact management in big letters now on screen. **me:** "could you please log in here?" **them:** "log in as myself?" **me:** ". . .yes." *tries logging in and fails* i remind her the username is usually numbers. "i don't know what log in this is. is this the log in for contact management? i thought i was just logging into my computer." *see previous line about contact management in big letters across the screen* she has to text someone to get her username. . .her username for software that she now says she hasn't ever tried to use, but reported it didn't work. **me:** "ok well just call me back if you still have issues after you get your username." **them:** "what do you mean?" **me:** "call me back if it still doesn't work." **them:** "i don't know." **me:** "what?" **them:** "what do you want me to do?" **me:** "get your username. try logging in. call me if the software still doesn't work." **them:** "uhh. ok. bye." i'm sitting here stewing in my own juices. damn home phone (which i keep because the security system uses) started ringing at 5:45am. yes i was asleep goddamn it. i don't get to it quickly enough and the answering machine picks it up and hang up. then i hear my mobile phone start ringing downstairs... must be some kind of family emergency so i make it downstairs in time to hear the home phone start up again. i answer, still half asleep and half scared that something big has happened. &gt; [me] "hello?" &gt; [fof] "hi dallasitguy, this is $guyyoubarelyknow. do you have a second? i can't get my laptop on my home wireless and i really need to check to make sure my flight is on time." &gt; [me] "who the fuck is this again?" &gt; [fof] "this is $guyyoubarelyknow. i'm a friend of $otherguy. we met at $neighborhoodbar a couple of weeks ago. my internet's down and i remembered you're in it so i looked up your number and gave you a ring. can you help me real quick? &gt; [me] you ~@!$~@#$$#$%*^%*&amp;%$#^%@#$!@#$!@! !%!@$@! !#@$!$ !%$%#$^$#&amp;$%*&amp; @#$%@#$%@# @#$%@#$% @%@$#%#%@#%!! do you know how early it is you presumptuous sob? i barely even know you and you wake us up so i can help you with your ~#!#@$#@!~ internet connection? don't you ever ~!$!@!#%$! call me again you @!~!#@~^%!! &gt; [fof] "uhh... sorry... i didn't think you'd mind... i just... &gt; [me] "go f yourself!" click. so... i'm up now. edit: i called $otherguy to find out if he gave the guy my home &amp; mobile numbers. he did - last night about 8:00pm or so he claims. i made it clear to him that he's officially on my shit list as well. i'm tempted to do a conference call with both of them in the middle of the night every night for the next week, but i suppose that would keep me from sleeping as well and therefore be self defeating. hell is other people.about 3 weeks after starting a casual role at my current job at a it help desk, i got a call from one of our customers who immediately demanded 2 new phones as their ones weren't working. i was still in training while this happened. my job at the desk was to help troubleshoot and determine the problem/cause and if it is equipment fault then i send for replacements etc. the call went like this: me: (company name) it helpdesk, how can i help? customer: hi i want two new phones thanks. me: sorry which site is this for? customer: (site), i need two new phones. my phones aren't working so i need two new phones to arrive by tomorrow thanks. me: sorry i'm just going to need you to do some troubleshooting with me is that alright? customer: look, i need two new phones. my ones are not working and we usually just call you guys to get these replaced so i'd like two new phones here by tomorrow morning thanks. me: sorry sir, when you say not working what do you mean? customer: it's not bloody working. i can't hear anything. i need two new phones sent out to me. we get it through you guys so i'd like you to send me two new phones. me: so you can't hear the dial tone? customer: no because it's broken. both of them are broken and i need new ones. at this point my mentor tells me to transfer the customer over to her and i tell the customer i'm escalating to my mentor. my mentor picks up and i hear the customer start to rattle off about the broken phones. my mentor cuts in and says "hi (customer name), your site currently has no phone or internet connection because the isp is working on the lines near your site. your site called about 30 minutes ago to inform us that there is was an outage and we've followed up with the isp and will update you when we get updates from the isp." he was the one who called us regarding the outage. here's one on the lighter side of tfts... so i was dealing with an employee for one of my client offices having trouble connecting to their terminal server from home. he stated it wasn't the normal error he's seen before, and i taught him very patiently how to take a screenshot, paste to blank email, then send it to myself so i could resolve the issue for him, we went through the process multiple times and i thought he had it down pat. the next day while i'm out at their office, he comes up and hands me his 'screenshot' of the error. turns out he couldn't figure out the darned screenshot key at home and decided to draw this fine error out for me, i mean look at the detail in the x on the left. anyway, i wish all employees gave at least half this mans efforts when they come across an error or problem, really helped me resolve his issue quickly with little hassle. ["screenshot" here =)](this is a second hand story told to me 20 years ago by someone who was already a veteran sysadmin back then, so it could have happened in the 80s or early 90s. the scene is a factory making heavy machinery. they are modern and the factory floor had terminals connected to a mainframe for tracking parts and whatever else they needed it for. one day a sysadmin gets a call from the factory floor and after the usual pleasantries the user says: &gt; i can't log in when i stand up. the sysadmin thinks that it's one of those calls again and goes through the usual: &gt; is the power on? what do you see on the terminal? have you forgotten your password? the user interrupts: &gt; i know what i'm doing, when i sit down i can log in and everything works, but i can't log in when i stand up. the sysadmin tries to explain that there can be no possible connection between the chair and the terminal and sitting or standing should in no way affect the ability to log in. after a long back and forth on the phone, he finally gives up and walks to the factory floor to show the user that standing can't affect logging in. the sysadmin sits down at the terminal, gets the password from the user, logs in and everything is fine. turns to the user and says: &gt; see? it works, your password is fine. the user answers: &gt; yeah, told you, now log out, stand up and try again. the sysadmin obliges, logs out, stands up, types the password and: *invalid password*. ok, that's just bad luck. he tries again: *invalid password*. and again: *invalid password*. baffled by this, the sysadmin tries his own mainframe account standing: *invalid password*. he sits down and manages to log in just fine. this has now turned from crazy user to a really fascinating debugging problem. the word spreads about the terminal with the chair as an input device and other people start flocking around it. those are technical people in a relatively high tech factory, they are all interested in fun debugging. production grinds to a halt. everyone wants to try if they are affected, it turns out that most people can log in just fine, but there are certain people who can't log in standing and there are quite a few who can't log in regardless of standing or sitting. after a long debugging session they find it. turns out that some joker pulled out two keys from the keyboard and switched their places. both the user and the sysadmin had one of those letters in the password. they were both relatively good at typing and didn't look down at the keyboard when typing when sitting. but typing when standing is something they weren't used to and had to look down at the keyboard which made them press the wrong keys. some users couldn't type properly and never managed to log in. while others didn't have those letters in their passwords and the switched keys didn't bother them at all.my mom relies on me for tech support at a moment's notice. same story for the rest of you, i imagine. she calls me to fix even the simplest of things without doing much if any troubleshooting first. today's email, though, was different: &gt;really didn’t want to bug you on your weekend but i needed to figure out why i was getting the “check signal cable” message. i realized i could ask google “how to fix check cable signal cable” and learned it meant the monitor wasn’t getting the signal. then i remembered i had disconnected that cable, and not plugged it back in when i reconfigured how the wires were running across my desk. so glad i didn’t call you. &gt;pretty good, right?? &gt;love, &gt;mom *wipes away a tear* pretty good mom, pretty good.i work at a large tech company and was just taking some typical tier 1 calls when suddenly: *ring* me: hello, this is $me, how can i help you today? customer: what the hell did you guys do to my mozilla? me: what seems to be the issue? customer: every time i open mozilla it just goes to $companyhomepage. i want you to remote in now and fix it. i tried to explain to the man that mozilla is a company and that firefox is a web browser and that it was perfectly normal for him to be seeing web pages while opening this application. customer: well i never asked for firefox to be installed on here. where is my mozilla? i was in shock. i kept trying to explain the idea behind a web browser but he was not having it. i finally got into his computer and saw that indeed, firefox was working as advertised but this was unacceptable to him. finally, he demanded that i bring back mozilla. i navigated to the mozilla homepage and made it his homepage and he was delighted that i had fixed his "issue." he even called me a "miracle worker." i sometimes get frustrated with every day users and then i realize that it can always be worse. i just had an issue that i couldn't resolve locally. it was for a printer that wasn't printing. it worked fine from our test utility, but wouldn't work from the user's application. with issues like this we always escalate it to the company that hosts the application and they'll do some magic on their end (reset a bad address, update a config, etc) to get it working again. usually it's a 5 minute fix. so i emailed them the details of the issue, the exchange was something like this: &gt; me: hi, we're having issues with [application] not printing, it works from our test utility but not from [application] so i imagine it just needs an address resetting on your end. &gt; host: thanks for letting us know, could you please give the location so we can send an engineer? (i thought it was strange they'd send an engineer for an issue like this, they usually just reset it remotely). &gt; me: [location details]. are you going to send out an engineer? usually you guys would just reset it remotely from your end. &gt; them: i've logged this as [ticket reference] and the engineer will be arriving soon. i figure whatever. it's their application, they know what they're doing, if they think they need an engineer on site then they probably do. i leave the issue while i wait to hear back from them. 30 minutes later i get a call from my helpdesk: &gt; "hi haddock420, we've just logged a ticket for [aforementioned issue] from [application host]...." apparently i'm the engineer they were going to send out, to look into the issue that i just escalated to them. i don't think this is going to end well. tldr: thanks for reporting the issue, we'll send you out to fix it shortly.i left a job a few years ago. today, they called me back to solve a problem with their website that my replacement couldn't handle. i decided to skim through their tickets with their web host so i could see what had already been tried. in the process, i found this gem, written by my replacement: &gt;"we are installing new software and we need access to the main router i think it’s a asus router – do you know where i can find it - i have the password." let's forget for a moment that you don't need physical access to your router to install software. he is somehow under the impression that the support rep at his web host - who lives in another city and has never even been to his building - can tell him physically where in the office his router is.this happened a while back but it's still the best thing that ever happened to me at work. true story. so, i was hired by a big defense company (upgrade tanks, naval weapons, etc) with over 3500 employees. you can imagine this was a very big company. we were in building 34 and if you needed to go somewhere quick you took a bike or an electric car. i usually did 2nd line support, but they had a couple of people call in sick and asked me to do first line support. it was a friday and not much was happening, besides the usual emailproblems and tech guys turning off unix machines that needed a checkdisk command with admin rights. the phone rings. &gt; yes hello, this the secretary of the ceo. we need you to come over now! we have a big problem. &gt; me: what seems to be wrong? &gt; her: mr ceo is trying to open a file in word, but everytime he does this, scrambled text is showing up. i think we are being hacked! (this was a big issue, since a couple of weeks before this a group of activists broke into the company and climbed on top of our radar tower) &gt; me: i'll take a look from here and take over your screen. hang on. so i take over his screen this is what happens: file, open: jkahsfhjkhjhjjjjjjfjjjjjsakkkalalllallallalallal*uuu**jjjdkjkjaslklkssssssssssssss &gt; her: i don't know what this is. you see?!? this is so weird... now, i knew what was wrong at this moment, but i wanted to see in person. you don't just walk into the exec office every day. &gt; me: uhuh. i'll be there as soon as possible! so i grab this electric car, drive over and 5 minutes later i walk into the executive building. a very nice building, totally different from the rest of the offices. they even had their own dining room and bar. the security guy sees me coming and waves me through, he was informed of my coming and understood the importance. i get out of the elevator at the top floor and am greeted by the secretary, a manager and some other assistent, all a bit panicked. &gt; come over, have a look at this! the ceo says.. he shows me: file, open: jkahsfhjkhjhjjjjjjfjjjjjsakkkalalllallallalallal*uuu**jjjdkjkjaslklkssssssssssssss so i look at him. i look at every single person in that room. you could feel the suspense. i look back at the computer. i pick up the newspaper that was on top of the keyboard and ask: &gt; try again please? the looks on their face: priceless. (got a free lunch with the ceo) -edit- formattingcustomer calls in and leaves a message on our ticket system: &gt; "i need an urgent call back!" no details, just panic. this is a team leader / supervisor at our largest client, a call centre, so i figure the router's exploded or something. i pick up the phone. &gt; him: "yeah, i'm looking to move a phone from this end of the desk to the other. the cable doesn't reach that far." &gt; me: "...sorry, our engineers are all booked today. we'll be onsite tomorrow but not before then. have you tried swapping the cable for a longer one?" &gt; him: "oh! oh, yeah, that would work." what?! leaves me wondering if he's ever dialled 999 because he stubbed his toe. other urgent support requests this supervisor has called us about: - user's 2nd monitor turned off and won't turn back on. we've tried everything! (solution: plug the power cable back in.) - he can't access the shared folder on the server. (solution: connect his laptop to the network.) - user's computer crashes constantly. (solution: user was lying in hopes of getting issued a new pc.)a tale from the other side - my friend bought a netflix box for a tv, and when it wouldn't work, asked me to come set it up. i couldn't get there until after work, and when i did it was working. she said she called google to fix it (it was not a google product, nor does it use any google services) so i thought she googled the company number and had them fix it. i wanted to show her it wasn't google she called, so i checked the caller id. it was google. after a while on the phone a google tec support guy helped her set up an unrelated product for free. i guess google really is a helpful service. tl;dr girl wants a cable box set up, but is attacked by dragons while eating tacos. this was at a previous job: after years of people coming into my office to ask me if "the server" was down, which of course would be followed by a game of 20 questions. keep in mind, we had 400+ servers, and numourous little systems all over the place. i decided to have some fun with it. i found a decomissioned dell desktop, wrote "the server" on the side of it in sharpy, and put it up against the wall behind my chair. for the next several months (only with co-workers who i knew and knew that they knew my sense of humor), whenever someone would come in and ask "is the server down?", i would respond by looking at the desktop on the floor and reply with "looks good to me." one time, one of the users said, "but it doesn't have any cables connected to it. shouldn't there be cables?" "nope, it's wireless" "ok, good!" then walked out. turns out their issue was trying to connect to an external webpage with a broken linknormal day at it support, after dealing with school computers with broken power supply finally break time. suddenly i hear that someone is entering my sacred lair. &gt; woman: good evening sir, i coming here with my laptop... hell no. old lady, old laptop, my senses are telling me it's gonna be pain for next few hours. &gt; woman: sir, i don't have internet on my laptop! everything was alright before i took it to xyz it support for cleaning!!! its getting even worse. knowing xyz, rival it support in same small city, they screwed something pretty bad, as it happened many times before. &gt; me: let me look at it i turn laptop on. it booted super fast, like it was not old dell but new nasa machine. it was at raw state from another it support, chrome, some random antivirus. but that's none of my business, turning on chrome. uhh... &gt; me: ma'am, it looks like everything works well here, internet is working alright, you sure it's not problem with your connection? woman looked at me like i offended her ancestors &gt; woman: can't you see sir, they deleted internet from my computer!!! oh. i got it... someone in xyz deleted **internet** explorer from her laptop, changing it with chrome. poor woman didn't had clue what chrome is. &gt; me: oh yes. i see... guess what. i took back internet explorer icon on the desktop and made it chrome executable. &gt; me: done! you can check it ma'am she takes the laptop &gt; woman: hey, it's back! *doubleclick* and it looks much better now! you, sir, you are a magican! i charged her 20€ for this. i don't even feel bad. edit: my first /r/all, not sure i should be happy or ashamednot exactly tech-support, but i know we've all been down this road with someone we know. i'm sitting at home in my pjs waiting to get ready for work when the home phone rings. it's my grandma. me: hey gram! how are you? her: honey the tv isn't working! oh good...one of *these* calls me: ok, did you press the big red power button? her: yes but it's not working me: ok did you take the batteries out of the remote again? her: *clicking noises* no they're still in there me: ok, what are the letters on the bottom of the remote, there should be big white letters under all the buttons her: jvc i instantly knew the problem me: ok gram, what are the letters printer under the screen of the tv? her: lg me: ok so that remote doesn't go with your tv. throw it away. you haven't had a jvc tv in over 10 years her: what if i need the remote later? me: grams, throw it away. you don't need it. i promise **edit** my first gold! thanks everyone! my grandma is pushing 100yrs of age, so these calls don't bother me in the slightest. i mostly laugh at themltl, ftp, and all that. (i'm also new to posting to reddit.) as many others here i don't actually work in tech support, i just help with family and friends. this happened a few days ago. my family just moved in a new house and we don't yet have internet service. coincidentally, my brother accidentally deleted all the music on his phone. i will be $me and my brother will be $brother. &gt;**$brother**: hey, my music's gone. &gt;**$me**: let me take a look. *brother's music is gone, need to redownload. but, as i said before, we have no internet at home.* &gt;**$me**: ok. your music's gone, when we get internet i'll turn on wifi from my computer and you can download the music. &gt;**$brother**: ok *that evening* &gt;**$brother**: hey can you turn on your wifi thing so i can download my music &gt;**$me**: sorry, no can do. remember we still don't have internet. &gt;**$brother**: oh, you need internet for that? *facepalm*hi everyone. i work as 1st level tech support for a large mobile phone company. there's a lot of stupid things going on but this one was too dumb to not share with you. &gt;me: how can i help you? &gt;customer: i traveled abroad with my phone, i didn't use it and now its broken! &gt;me: can you specify what exactly is broken? do you get a signal? &gt;customer: no, i can't even turn it on. the battery died on my vacation, i didn't bring the charging cable, because i wasn't going to use it. &gt;me: did you plug it in when you got home? &gt;customer: yes, it's plugged in right now, it still doesn't work. did you change my contract while i was abroad? she thought we barred her contract because she was abroad. &gt;me: no, besides, that wouldn't break your phone. what happens when you try turning it on? &gt;customer: should i try that? &gt;me: yes, please. &gt;customer: oh it's doing something. did you fix it? &gt;me: you have to turn it on when it's off, otherwise it won't do anything. &gt;customer: oh i see. well thank you. will this happen everytime i go abroad? &gt;me: no, it has nothing to do with that. this went on for a while, at the end of the call, she was still convinced that we shut her phone down because she went abroad.today everyone on our network received an e-mail in foreign language with suspicious attachment (word document with macro, with encryption virus). it is called locky. i receive a request to look into suspicios e-mail from user. me: have you opened the e-mail? everyone has received a suspicious e-mail with encryption virus, so you should not open any e-mails from unknown senders. user: no, i haven't opened it yet. me: good. let's delete the e-mail using shift and delete, so it is not stored even in deleted items folder. user: wait a second. me: alright! just delete it and be careful with such e-mails in future. user: it had a document attached, but it is only gibberish. could you look at it? me: you opened the attachment? user: yes. me: well, turn off the computer, unplug internet cable and you are free for the rest of the day. tomorrow we will take your computer, it will have all its files encrypted and unusable. user: why did you do that? me: i told you it is a virus and not to open it. user: i'm writing a complaint. she then hang up. ------ edit: today, my boss listened to recording of the phone conversation and praised me for being so calm. computer was indeed disconnected and our engineers are working on it (there are few more computers that were infected from these e-mails). recording of the phone call will be used in investigation about the user, probably will result in firing her. as it turns out these e-mails have been sent to all 6700 work stations that our company support. our guys managed to block couple of thousand e-mails, and we have warned everyone about the virus, but probably going to have quite a few more of idiots opening the virus. edit 2: user faces charges for knowingly putting computer system at risk, which can result in fairly large fine, and almost certainly leads to firing. also it might even be considered a criminal offense.i recently left school and started in a big it company as an apprentice so i'm still learning a lot. every new it apprentice starts in the first level support to get a general overview of all the support cases that come in from our employees. we have a ticket system and also a hotline, so one day a lady calls since we see the name on the phone display my colleagues immediatly ignored the call so it goes over to me. i didn't think much about it and picked it up. **me:** "(name), it-servicedesk how can i help you ?" **lady:** "i opened up the excel file my colleague sent me via email but it doesn't seem to open up properly, can you build up a remote connection and take a look at it?" **me:** "sure give me a second." after i had remote access on her computer, i tried to open up the excel window since the program was clearly running. nothing happened but the program seemed to be responding, so i opened up taskmanager to see the process status. everything looked fine. then one thing my colleague said to me on the first day came to mind. "always think, that the customer you have on the phone, never touched a computer before." since every employee at our company has a second monitor i asked her: **me:** "can you check if the window opened up on your second monitor?" **lady:** "wait let me turn it on first" "yes it opened up but the window looks odd, can you see it?" **me:** "no, i can only see your main monitor, so you need to move the window to the other monitor." **lady:** "so can you see it now, normally it looks different." kinda confused i look at the window and it looked completely fine. **me:** "whats wrong with the window, you need to be a little more specific?" **lady:** "the size, the window should be way bigger." **me:** "ah thats what you meant, you can maximize the window size with the button you can see up here in the right corner." the lady hung up and left me behind confused how my company can hire people without the most basic computer skills. it's tough to be the it guy ..many many years ago i helped run a support line for these custom medical testing work stations our company assembled. these particular devices were used to test memory, and part of those tests required an auditory component. one day, i got a rather irate call from a client saying something like: &gt; the machine is producing no sound. this is unacceptable. i have the patient waiting here and we have wasted almost an hour already with your system. if you can't resolve these issues we will be forced to consider legal action / find a new vendor. so, i personally had worked on building these machines and knew most of their quirks. a completely working system sans the sound made absolutely no sense. i spent about 20 minutes running through some basic diagnostics asking the user about the speaker power cable, speaker audio cable, volume levels, etc. the user, was getting very annoyed at me for asking such basic questions. apparently i had insulted them. they were an important doctor after all! the issue was definitely with our system! why was i not believing him!?!?! frustrated myself, i asked for the third or fourth time... &gt; *me* are you sure the volume knob on the speaker is all the way up? &gt; *user* of course the volume is up! i know how to use a computer. with no obvious solutions, i grasp at a straw and say... &gt; *me* okay! well, what happens if you turn the volume all the way down? at this point, i can hear the background test audio for our application blast over the phone. i hear a bit of a kerfuffle from the other side of the line and the sound quickly goes dead again. &gt; *user* hey, hold on a minute. a few moments pass. &gt; *user* listen, something just came up here and i have to go. if we can't get this fixed in the next day i'll call you back. never heard from them again. my company just rolled out a new web-based system for people to use for time-sheets etc. part of the switch-over involved deleting the browser cache and old favorites links etc. if they didn't do this, the website wouldn't show correctly. one user i had was having issues clearing out the cache. been working with him for over 20 minutes, trying different ways to explain it &amp; just can't grip the terms somehow (...i click toooools?? where is tooooools??). *note: can't remote access his pc, otherwise i'd just do it for him* finally, i'm just about ready to give up and escalate it when i had an idea. &gt;me: ok user, one last thing. when you use the internet at home, do you ever have to delete anything you wouldn't want certain people to see, like your significant other or someone like that. &gt;user: oh yeah! hold on a sec *couple of clicks and a small muttering of sound* &gt;user: yep the site works! thanks! **tl/dr**: the internet is for....hello again, tfts! necessary background: i work at an isp that handles a lot of traffic from rural america. &gt;thank you for calling [isp], this is uwbw, how can i help you today? "yeah, uh, my modem is broken. i need a new one." hmm. 99% of these calls are actually issues with the outside line, not the modem itself. i'm already prepared to completely dismiss what the customer is going to be telling me for the next 2 minutes as it usually amounts to "my internet is broken because my modem is broken because internet because reasons." instead... "when i plug your modem in, my mouse starts moving on its own." wha-? "the mouse just sort of jitters all over my screen randomly, i can't control it. i turned the modem off, and it stopped." &gt;that's... interesting. have you tried turning it back on? the customer says that they have been too weirded out to power the modem back up, so i tell them to do it for me while we're on call. "hey, would you look at that! no problems anymore. i can control my mouse again!" &gt;that's great! i guess! "hey, and now that the box is back on, my internet works again too! i was going to ask you about that next." facedesk.although i work in a retail store, my actual job is tech support, so i felt like this would be the proper place for this story. i work for a cell phone provider as an in-store technician. a customer came in today because he couldn't get into his gmail account. this was his 3rd visit to a store for this issue. (i have reset hundreds, maybe even a thousand gmail passwords in the last 5 years doing this job.) i find out that he has 2 step verification enabled on his gmail account and that he wasn't getting the text message verification code from google. i suggest that we try to login to the account on a desktop computer instead. i swing my monitor and keyboard around for him and tell him to sign in. i guess he expected that i was just going to do it for him because he makes a big show about how hard it is to use a keyboard. he says, "this is all foreign to me, i'm used to typing on my phone." he goes on to ask me "how to make a 1?" you hit the button with a 1 on it... he was also using caps lock to capitalize letters. after several attempts, he finally gets the password entered correctly. next step is to enter his cell phone number to send the verification code. this is where it gets tricky. it turns out that whoever set up his gmail account for him, not only enabled the 2 step verification, but also typed his phone number wrong which is why he isn't getting the verification code. he asks me to "call google" and fix it for him. at this point i'm starting to get frustrated with him and i inform him that no, i can't "call google for him." a reasonable person wouldn't expect their cell phone service provider to call google for them because they are locked out of their personal email account. i explained multiple times that i was not going to call google, but did offer to physically dial the number for him so he could talk to them. apparently that wasn't enough because he left in a huff because i "just didn't want to help him." if he hadn't been so lazy in the first place and set up his gmail account himself, he probably wouldn't have been in this mess today. and i do not have sympathy for people who are not willing to do things themselves. a quick tale while i'm on my lunch break. so, i host a minecraft server that me and my friends play on. while i'm not the primary administrator of this server, i do step in when i'm needed. we recently encountered a problem, where the server was pegging a core on the host at 100% usage, and nobody could connect. long story short, i was able to use a java debugger to find the block type causing the issue, but we couldn't connect to remove it. we spent a few hours trying to fix the issue, including loading the world in an external editor (mcedit) to remove the block. nothing worked. then, one of our non-tech savvy users piped up. "umm, don't you guys have a backup?" cue every tech person in the chat room face-palming. between the five of us, nobody had thought to restore from a backup. i mean, this is exactly the reason we have backups, isn't it? yet, nobody thought to use them. so, we restored from a backup, and all was good. the next day, i get a message from one of the users. note that the user could not have known the block they were using was bugged. &gt;**user:** i promise i will try not to fuck up the server again. but i also want to thank you for your hard work last night. &gt;**me:** heh, not that i did anything useful. &gt;**me:** no worries. then, this happened. &gt;**user:** being in it is often a thankless job. just wanted to make sure you knew how much i appreciate that someone was in a position to help. &gt;**user:** and don't say you didn't do much. you put serious effort in and made alot of progress. much more than i did just throwing ideas around. this... this user gets it. and now the world is all blurry. (edit: me fail english? that's unpossible!)a client comes in, buddy of mine, older gentleman. says he can't remember his password. ok, no biggie, let's go through the password reset steps. first question, last 4 digits of your social. no problem, he puts that in. second question, ein number, got it. 3rd and last question, what is the color of your first car? he types in "black and white." "black and white?" i say....puzzled. then ask him, why wouldn't you just put down one color so it's easier to remember? he just shrugs and laughs. i said "ok, try just black" doesn't work. "try just white", nope. "just try random colors", i suggest "green." now it's his turn to look at me puzzled. "green???" he says, totally flabbergasted. i was like "yea, or blue, just try typical colors of cars." "car??? i thought it said cat!" he squints and presses his face up to the monitor. "shit, i need glasses." at this point i'm roaring, "why would it ask you the color of your first cat???" he laughs too, "i don't know! that's why i said black and white and then was confused when you said green!" ah good times, he finally got the color right but that point his account was locked out from trying too many times. we put in a ticket with the system and got it unlocked. i see him almost every day and i'm not going to let him live this one down. in my job, i support servers. the typical client that i talk to over the phone is an sa with several years of industry experience and multiple certifications. in short, i don't have the privilege of dealing with 'stupid users' very often. tfts being my favorite subreddit, i've always wanted the opportunity to have a story worth telling here, and recently, like manna from heaven, that opportunity presented itself. the call went something like this: me: thank you for calling *company*, how can i help? her: i just changed my isp and now my workstations won't connect to the internet. me: i'm sorry to hear that, ma'am! you've actually reached server support, but if you'll hold for a minute i'll get you down to our workstation guys... her: no. this is obviously a server problem. something is wrong with my domain controller and now my workstations can't connect to the internet. at this point i decided 'what the hell'. it was a slow day, might as well dig into this and once we prove it isn't the server maybe we can figure out what the problem is. i check out the server and everything looks fine. i then turn my attention to the workstations. me: ok ma'am, i want to walk you through checking a few basic things on your workstation. (*provided instructions on checking her ipv4 settings*). can you tell me what the settings are? her: the ip address is xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, etc. etc... the preferred dns server is 2.2.2.2 me: (*puzzled*) you said the dns is 2.2.2.2? that doesn't sound right to me... her: well, yeah. this is workstation 2. me: so... what is the preferred dns for workstation 1? her: 1.1.1.1. shouldn't you know this? me: ma'am... it doesn't really work that way. we need to reconfigure these. her: that can't be right - workstation #8 works just fine!!! it was very, very difficult for me not to laugh. we got her straightened out, but this was quite possibly the funniest call i've had in years.i'm the guy responsible for handling all the support calls in the morning. this morning i check the queue and see a ticket from a user saying the phone software has disappeared from his computer. at my work, we use a remote support program where we can direct the user to our help site, have them click our name and download a file, and it will let us remote in and fix their issues. i called the user and told him i would be happy to help. i said, "please open a web browser for me." he replies, "bruh, i'm gonna be completely honest with you. i don't mess with computers like that." so, i ended up having to send one of my techs out there, probably just to replace the desktop shortcut for the "missing" program. this happened about 10 minutes into my day, and i'm already fucking done. update- i called yesterday to try and talk to the night shift worker, but was told he would be working the day shift this morning. i'm going to call over there in a few minutes to make sure we fixed his issue, and see if he will let me remote in to check the logs. if he can't/won't do that, i'll just get the service tag from the machine and use it to look up the mac/ip address, and have one of the it engineering guys remote in (they don't need the user to let them in) and check for me.this just happened an hour ago and i couldn't resist sharing it with you all. ___ &gt;**user:** "hi, yeah, i'm having trouble signing into my email, do you know my password." &gt;**me:** "hi, who am i speaking with?" &gt;**user:** "oh, i'm **talldense&amp;amp;dumb** from *generic reality &amp;amp; co.*" &gt;**me:** "his, **talldense&amp;amp;dumb**, sorry, we don't keep your passwords listed. i can try to help out though. worst case, we can just reset the password." &gt;**td&amp;amp;d:** "okay this is what it says:" *reads out standard username/password field letter by letter, asterisks and all* &gt;**td&amp;amp;d:** ".... -star-star-star." &gt;**me:** "alright no problem, just enter in the password you use to log in." &gt;**td&amp;amp;d:** "well if i knew that, i wouldn't have a problem." &gt;**me:** "sorry, i mean the password you use to unlock the computer." &gt;**td&amp;amp;d:** "yeah, i know what you meant." &gt;**me:** "do you never lock your computer, or log out at all?" &gt;**td&amp;amp;d:** "no." *facepalm* &gt;**me:** "that's really insecure, i'd definitely recommend at least locking your computer when you leave the office, if not logging out completely." &gt;**td&amp;amp;d:** "what do you mean, you guys are supposed to handle the computer security." &gt;**me:** "well yeah, but that's like having 2 deadbolts and a combo lock on your front door, but always leaving it wide open." &gt;**td&amp;amp;d:** "oh, i got it now, forgot to capitalize. thanks!" &gt;**me:** "wai-" *click* &gt;"fuck." *headdesk.* **tl;dr: maybe you should turn off the neon sign above your computer reading "steal my data, it's free"** ___ checked his pc's up-time, the guy wasn't lying. edit: i work at an msp and this is one of our clients. i have no say on their group policy settings.. i could set them myself but that could also get me into trouble as that's not something i have the power to decide. i love my cousins (oi, not in that way) but they're often thick as mince. so it was with no shock to me when i get a text from one of them saying that he can't connect to the internet. oh, and someone's changed the name of his wifi to "stop stealing my wifi". having been to his house before - and connected to his wifi - i know for a fact he has a wireless router, and a password set up by his isp. i go through basic troubleshooting (turn it on and off, it it plugged in etc) and eventually say he should look at the label on his router and connect to the ssid written on it. he says it's not on the list and asks me to come round and have a look (i'm a 30 minute train journey from his house so 'come round' feels more like a day trip). anyway, i get there and sure enough, the ssid on his router isn't there. i try the 'stop stealing' ssid, tried the password written on the router and it didn't work. i ask him if he's changed the wifi password. he - of course - said he didn't have one. that he went into the admin controls and turned it off a week ago because he got a new phone and forgot what the password was. i go back to the router and show him the label with the ssid and the password. it's at this point i noticed that all the lights on the front are geblinkken on et eauf rapido. and then it clicks. he made his wifi public. someone nearby accidentally connected to his, and thinks it's *their* own wifi. yet they had enough computer knowledge (or google-fu, or luck) to get into the admin page and lock it down. so i look up the default admin credentials on my phone - turns out it's "admin" with no password - reset the router to factory settings, log in to the admin console, set up a secure admin password (of my choosing) and set up wpa and a password of his choosing. *and told him not to remove it*, and changed the ssid to "no, it's not your wifi". **tl;dr** it's not your wifi if you don't have physical access to the router.been lurking in the shadows, first time posting. i work at an it help desk for a large company serving as front line it support. i just had this call about an hour ago: &gt; **me:** thank you for calling $company it service desk, this is wiscomptons_finest. how can i help you? &gt; **customer:** hi, i'm having an issue with my account. sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. &gt; **me:** alright, let me take a look at your account. one moment please. from the caller id, i notice he's calling from one of our kiosks we have in public areas. these computers are for production floor employees (who typically don't have their own computers) to access their personal benefits and other information. generally speaking, they're not the most tech savvy of the callers that we get, so it's usually a good idea to remote onto the machine and see *what exactly* they're having an issue with. with his permission, i remote on and see that he is in fact logged into the system. there are no errors, and nothing seems out of the ordinary. &gt; **me:** so what exactly are you having trouble with? from what i can see, everything appears to be fine. &gt; **customer:** well, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. &gt; **me:** what exactly doesn't work? i see that you're signed in and i didn't see any issues with your account when i checked earlier. &gt; **customer:** i have to get back to work now. *uhh... okay.* &gt; **me:** okay, no problem. would you like to give us a call back later when you have some time? i'm still not sure what problem you were having. &gt; **customer:** i don't know, sometimes it doesn't work. i have to go back to work now. bye. i know it's friday, but it feels like a monday...i saw a story yesterday about letting users set ticket priority, and it hit home with me. we allow the same thing, so naturally every single ticket i get is marked critical. i just laugh about it now. anyway, about a week ago, one of my favorite users, "kurt," came over to my cube with a problem. "hey man," he said. "i've been going back and forth for a while trying to decide whether to mark this case 'minor' or 'moderate.' i don't want to cause you guys too much trouble. what do you think?" "kurt, bless your heart," i said. "i haven't looked at that field in five years." then i dropped everything i was doing and helped him set up his new phone. because he deserved it.back in december 2010, when gawker got hacked and their ~1.3 million passwords leaked, i was following the breach and downloaded the file with all the passwords, just to verify that mine wasn't part of the ones released. mine was safe, however, i found around 10 or 20 email addresses belonging to my university with cracked passwords and usernames. i decided that i'd shoot off a quick email to the users involved, hoping that they might at least pay attention to me if only because of the fact that the email would come from a university address. i typed up the below message and sent it out, not expecting to hear anything back but felt good that i might have prevented at least one or two people from having a major security issue. &gt; hey guys, &gt; &gt; i don't know any of you personally, but your name is on the list of compromised gawker passwords. if you haven't already heard the story, go read one of the articles here: or here: long story short, these guys got into gawker and took ~1.3 million usernames &amp; passwords. &gt; &gt; thought i'd pass this on from on [university] student to another. stay safe out there. i got a few scattered emails throughout the next week or so from people thanking me for the heads up, and i figured that was the end of it. fast forward a few weeks - i get an email from the campus post office telling me i have a package to pick up. i know i haven't ordered anything recently, so i have no idea why i'd have a package to pick up. i decided to trek over and see what it was - when i got there they handed me a small box with an amazon label on it. now even more confused, i open up the box to find a white beanie and a gift label with the following message: &gt; hey there! &gt; &gt; i looked your address up on the campus directory - i wanted to give you a little something as thanks for letting me know about the gawker password leak. here's a white hat for a white hat. happy holidays! **tl; dr: random guy gives me a white hat for telling him his password got leaked.**at the university i work for, we regularly get calls from parents trying to do everything for their children. even though we aren't really supposed to do a password reset for someone who isn't the account holder, our standard procedure in the case of a parent trying to reset their kid's password is to get the account holder on the line and ask their permission for the password reset before continuing. with freshman orientation coming up, we had several calls like this today, but this one was a little different. &gt; me: $university service desk, this is nathan, how can i help you? &gt; mother: i need to reset my son's password and get some information about his account. i won't be going with him to orientation, and want to write it all down for him. &gt; me: do you have your son there with you? we will need to get his permission to reset his password. &gt; mother: of course, let me go get him. &gt; mother (yelling): get down here! i need you to give the man on the phone permission to look at your account! &gt; son: hello? &gt; me: this is nathan from $university service desk, i just need your permission to reset your password. &gt; son: no, my password does not need to be reset. we will call you again if there are any issues. &gt; *phone slams down but line does not drop* &gt; *background yelling for the remainder of the time before i leave the line* i think i may have just been party to the moment a child became independent. this is a short story, from about 6-7 years ago in my days as isp support. i was speaking with this woman who was having issues connecting online, doesn't really know how to use a computer, but we were making slow, but steady progress. i go to give her a new dsl password since she forgot her old one. ok, so i have just provided you with a password. can you please repeat it to me to make sure you have it? her: sure, it's a as in alephant, b as in boy, c as in chris me: mam, it's actually a as in alpha, not e as in elephant her: that's what i said, alephant! me: mam it's actually a not e her: but elephant starts with a! me: yes mam, you have the right password. her: i thought so!! thanks! all went well after that. she connected, even though there was an alephant in the room. tl;dr: alephant, get it right. edit: seems like once i brew an ale, i found myself a proper name. question is, what kind of ale i should brew... maybe something heavy? hahabut after verifying via the rmm that was not the case (which the ticket was submitted through mind you), jumping remotely onto 5 random unoccupied systems from the site and browsing, i called the user who filed the ticket. it went like this: me: hi there, this is guidoz and i received a trouble ticket that i need some more info on. it was stated that the internet was down, but all our tests indicate it is working correctly. can you be more specific? user: my web browser won't display pages. i've tried rebooting and refreshing. *i pop on user's system via remote* me: the fact that i can get to you this way is a good sign. let's take a peek. * i instinctively open up google and it comes up instantly. i do a quick search and hit a random, but safe, link. me: it appears to be up to me! is there a specific website you're having trouble with? user: yeah, umm. facebook. *user types in facebook and it fails to load.* me: that is likely an issue with facebook. it even says it has an issue on the screen. (facebook displayed a "something went wrong" message.) user: no, facebook can't be down. there must be something wrong with our systems. me: &amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232; *i do a twitter search for #facebookdown tag and show her a few hundred tweets in the last 10 minutes.* it appears to me facebook. give it a bit, it should come back up. user: do you mean i found a problem you can't fix? ha! i stumped you! me: mmhmm. buh-bye. [more comments]( (x-post from /r/sysadmin). edit: i love you all.wife: while i'm at the store can you fix the vacuum cleaner? me: i don't know anything about vacuum cleaners. wife: just do what you do half the time at work; act like you know what's going on, google the correct answer, play on reddit for an hour, then go fix it. -------------- (she works in the mental health field) wife: every time i talk to you about the hours you work, how much you make, it always makes me question my career choice. i have to stop and remind myself that i *want* to help my clients and am not supposed to worry about money. you don't actually want to help your clients.this was a conversation not 20 minutes ago over our interoffice messaging system here at technophobes r us. ---------- *user is starting a conversation* *user has invited &lt;7 managers&gt;* user: cookie_eater108 keeps changing my password its not funny *manager 1 has left the conversation* me: i'm sorry, what's this about? user: cookie_eater108 you keep changing my password every few days and i can never login. very unprofetional. *manager 2 has left the conversation* me: i assure you i don't change passwords for fun. but i can help you with your login troubles. me: at the top right of your keyboard, there are 3 lights, num lock, caps lock and scroll lock, is the caps lock key light on? user: well it wasn't on just awhile ago user: stop turning my caps lock key on this is unbelievable *&lt;5 managers have left the conversation&gt; * short one which happened not 15 minutes ago. those of you that work on helpdesks and/or operations can most likely relate to this one. users have a tendency to call for issues with their accounts when they inevitably enter the wrong password one too many times. when their password expires and anything else they can come up with (they're pretty inventive). so here i am, sitting at my desk, when the phone rings. caller id is a lady from eastern europe, let's call her $lee. and she has trouble with her account. normally speaking, during the day this is a job for the helpdesk, but it's been a pretty slow day and i'm (strangely enough) in a good mood. &gt; $me: hello this is it, how may i help you today? &gt; $lee: i think my account is locked out. &gt; $me: ok, could you provide me your account? i'll take a look. &gt; $lee: it's $userlee "goes to look up user account, no issues found, except the password being past the required changing date. bingo!" &gt; $me: alright, i see here that your account is not locked, nor is it expired. however, i see here that your password needs to be changed. could you check this please? &gt; $lee: no, that's not right. that's not what the error message says. &gt; $me: could you please read me the error message? &gt; $lee: the password of your account has expired and must be chan... thank you "click" penny dropped.first day back today from christmas and new year break. it has taken my manager all of an hour to quit. i'm not actually sure what has happened but a user came up giving him grief for not sorting out her problem at about 9:30am (which she loggged yesterday, on a sunday evening) and no staff have been in at all since 24th december. i just saw him mutter to himself 'fuck this'. sorted out his things stood up, wished us all luck and has walked out. i'm in a little bit of disbelief. 1 user too far by the looks of things. edit: just thought i would add a follow up, nothing exciting unfortunately. just spoke to him on the phone and there was no other reason than he realised he couldn't put up with it anymore so he walked. he has had a few interviews recently anyway so he's positive something will come up soon. other than that he's done what i and a few others dream of, but can't actually do and just walked. i wish him well. so i'm currently contracting for a big company, i'm a sw engineering consultant so i move around a lot. all of a sudden the network share i use to access my linux home directory stops working. i went through my own troubleshooting steps * "df -k ~" - yup i didn't get moved to a different server, i've seen that in the past. * unmap all my network drives/remap * heck threw in a flushdns just for fun. * i even rebooted. * i even checked that i could map a coworkers home directory, and he also could not map mine. so i'm pretty sure it was not my issue. now i get to call it. i tell them what they have tried, naturally they don't trust me (and i don't really blame them from the stories i see here) so they have me go through the same basic troubleshooting steps, and finally gets "can you try rebooting your pc". now it's been a long day and i have multiple code windows open that i'm working on and don't feel like wasting 15 minutes shutting things down and getting everything back to the way it was when i was debugging my real work. so i ask him, "can you map my home directory from your machine?" he says he doesn't know if his machine has permissions to get to my group. so i ask him "can you map my coworkers home directory?". yes he can. now can you map my drive? no it didn't work. so i asked him, "have you tried rebooting your pc?" this sounds unbelievable because honestly, who is this stupid, but i swear to god, this really happened today and only you guys will understand. so i'm helping a customer reset their password, running through the usual rigmarole. here's exactly how it went... me: your password has to be at least 8 characters long with an uppercase and lowercase letter and a number in it. customer: so it has to be 8 characters? me: yes, or more. it just has to be at least 8 characters. customer: can it be 7 characters? me: *brain explodes* if it wasn't for their completely vacant stare, i would've assumed they were totally f*cking with me but no, just stupid. my job is to get the "product" the "company" makes connected to the internet. one day i had someone call in. &gt;user: my "product" won't connect to the internet. i want to use it to use "internet service". &gt;me: ok i can help you out with that. who is your isp? &gt;user: what is an isp? this isn't usually a bad sign as a lot of ppl that call don't know this information. &gt;me: you know the company you pay to get internet service? here are some examples "list of isp examples" &gt;user: no i don't have the money for those monthly fees. i just bought a router. that will give me free wifi. at this point i face palm so hard my coworkers were concerned i might have a concussion. it left a red mark on my forehead. after a few minutes of silence. &gt;me: sir...that is not how routers work. you need to first pay an isp to get internet service. a router by itself will not give you free wifi. &gt;user: you're lying to me. the person at the store said if i got this i can connect "product" online. i demand to speak to your supervisor. &gt;me: ok transferring you now...but he's just going to tell you the exact same thing... an hour later, at the end of my shift, my supervisor comes to my desk sporting a nice red mark on his forehead that matched mine. &gt;supervisor: i just spent 45 minutes trying to convince user that a router doesn't provide free wifi without paying for access to the internet. he still doesn't believe me. i gave up and just hung up on him. let's go get a drink...i really need it after that.... edit: concussion not concision. my head hurts leave me alone. currently waiting for this persons pc to reboot. she's having issues connecting to a remote server from home. shes on a vpn and its taking forever. servers pinging fine, vpn is set correctly. then she says "of course its set correctly, its been on all night." i suggest a reboot and thats when she dropped the "rebooting won't fix it! i never reboot my computer and it runs fine!" line to me. she finally reboots and of course its fine now. a few years back i used to work for a computer repairs company and i was the one receiving calls and assigning techs to jobs. one of the things i learned early on in the job was to ask customers exactly what the fuck "nothing works" means, generally by asking them to boot up their machine and talk me through what they're seeing. this was because "nothing works" most times means "this software i'm trying to use doesn't work the way i want it to". one morning i got this call: **guy**: my mac won't work. **me**: ok sir, what do you mean? **guy**: what do you think i mean? i turn it on and nothing happens! **me**: can you please go to your computer and turn it on? walk me through what you're seeing or what's happening exactly. *now i hear the guy walk through a few rooms and sit down on a chair* **guy**: it's loading. **me**: ok&amp;mdash; **guy**: there's the windows flag on the screen now. **me**: wait, what? **guy**: the windows loading screen thing. i'm not sure why you're having me do this. i already told you what's the problem. **me**: sir, i thought you said you had a mac. **guy**: yes. this is my wife's pc. **me**: i asked you to boot up *your* computer. **guy**: but mine's not a computer, it's a mac. *face meet desk.*hi everyone. i work tech support for my local internet provider, and although i get many calls a day regarding issues that are eye rollingly easy to fix, this one really takes the cake. let me start off by saying i am no expert, i was trained and have been working with the company for over a year now though, and in terms of fixing the internet over the phone i know my shit. i get a call today, a new customer who's just received his router and stuff in the post. the first thing he says indicates exactly the type of person he is and i know it's going to be an excruciating call. customer: hi, i got your gear today and it's not working already, i knew i shouldn't have signed up to you guys, it's absolutely atrocious. me: okay sir, i apologise for any inconvenience you've experienced, what's the name of the router you've received? - (it's worth noting that whilst i ask these questions i'm pulling up their account and line on the computer my side, he's right, the router hasn't signed up to us yet and the line is showing as inactive - we also send out a few different kinds of routers depending on what the customer wants, and usually asking them is quicker than bringing it all up this side) customer: *gives name* it's not working. me: i can see on this side the router hasn't come online as of yet- customer: exactly its absolutely ridiculous the service im on the verge of cancelling ive only just bought the damn thing. - (the engineers have noted that it all should be up and running, so i carry on despite him shouting now, thirty seconds into the call) me: right okay, and what lights can you currently see on the router. - there's a long pause where i almost think he's put the phone down, but no he's still there. customer: well, none. me: so not even the power light? customer: no, i can't see anything on there. me: are you near your router right now? customer: yes, it's still in the wrapping it's brand new. - here i actually pause for a good few seconds. he said its in the wrapping, so has he unboxed it at all so far? me: so the router is still in its original packaging? customer: yes. - so by this point after listening to countless insults (not included here because it's too long to type out) it got me a little irate, so i was a bit blunt with the customer. me: so how do you know it isn't working? customer: well, i just assumed, i've heard stories- me: so you assumed your internet wasn't working instead of trying it out yourself? customer: i was right though. - i want to slam my head on the desk at this point. me: how do you know you're right? customer: cos it's not on! me: sir that's because you haven't tried to even plug it in yet. that's like buying a car and never driving it because you just assume it won't work. customer: oh, well, i'll try it and plug it in. me: okay sir, once you have see if it works, if you have any more trouble give us a call back. i put the phone down, keeping his line up. i check his line five minutes later and magically he's online. it's amazing what happens when you actually plug in your shit before assuming it's all broken. i honestly thought this was a hoax call but the guy was being deadly serious. this happened a few years ago when i worked at a small web design firm. because we were so small, us designers would sometimes take to the phones and offer support for our clients. it could be anything from explaining why something wasn't working, to giving them support on a cms. a bit of back story to this call. we had a new client who we had just completed a total rebrand for. new website, logo, company colours, fliers. the works. it looked awesome, except for one thing. the client insisted on us keeping an animated gif of a little guy waving a flag. whatever. her money. i get a call one day after she received the 5000 fliers and 500 business cards that we had re-designed and had printed for her. i think you can figure where this is going: &gt; client: hi, i received the cards and fliers today. there is a problem with the printing. &gt;me: that's not good. can you let me know what it is and i can get onto the printing company to sort it out for you. &gt; client: sure. the wee man on the logo. he isn't animated like on the website. he's still. &gt;me: *silent* &gt; client: hello? i said the little man isn't moving like on the site. that's what i wanted, the same as on the site. &gt;me: erm.. ahh.. hrm.. okay.. you do realise that having the little man move isn't possible...? &gt; client: why not? &gt;me: because it is a printed picture. on paper. &gt; client: but it moves on the website, and it is just a picture there. &gt;me: um, i don't know what to say, that's not how it works. i'll pass you to my supervisor. she genuinely couldn't figure out why the gif wasn't moving on printed paper. i was completely lost for words! edit: words. also. front page! this is my first post to hit it. i guess i'm like internet famous now. i'll work on my thank you speech. edit 2: ow... my inbox.this happened at a web hosting company which also offers domain name registration service. incessant woman (is) calls in: "i'm dissatisfied with your web hosting" me: "oh? i'm sorry to hear that. was there something you were trying to get your website to do that i could help with?" (we offer many free scripts and often help customers with their setup and use). is: "no, i just want a refund. " me: "i'm afraid there's nothing to refund, our hosting services are provided free of charge" is: "i paid you $25" me: "that was for the domain name registration for 1 year. hosting is a different service. " is: "give me back my money!" me: "i can't give you back money for that service since we didn't take any money from you for that service" is: "can you refund the domain name purchase?" me: "no. domain name registrations are strictly non-refundable since once a name is registered, that registration can not be reversed. we make it very clear during the signup process that all fees for domain registrations are non-refundable" is: "i still want you to refund me for whatever part of my $25 the web hosting is worth" me (getting annoyed): "ok, done". is: "you refunded me?" me: "yes. since the hosting is valued at $0, i have just given you $0" * click *for a second i thought this lady was trolling me or something: me: ok, i’m just going to need you to unplug the power cord from the back of the actiontec router, wait 10 seconds, and then plug it back in *[customer instantly switches to rage mode]* customer: what?! do you understand what you are asking me to do?! do you understand how difficult that would be?! me: *[trying hard not to laugh]*…..to unplug the power? customer: yes, i’d have to move all this crap and i’d have to move this huge desk and everything to get to it! this is absolutely unacceptable! me: but you said the actiontec is sitting right there in front of you right? customer: yes! me: you just have to unplug right it from the back of the actiontec not from the wall socket.. customer: oh….sadly my first tale here is not my own, but was shared by a co-worker this morning. he received a call from our engineer claiming that windows was trying to delete his computer... he promptly walks into the office to find that no matter what the user clicked on, the "are you sure you want to delete x?" dialog appeared. without much thought he ran a quick virus scan, but nothing came up. he then suggested rebooting the machine to see if anything changed. as he went to reach for the power button, he noticed something... the user was using a laptop seated in a dock, the screen was open, and his was phone laying on the keyboard. the weight of the phone was just enough to press the edge down onto the delete key... he moved the phone off of the keyboard, and miraculously windows lost it's interest in digital genocide.this tidbit of idiocy doesn't come from my regular job in it, but from helping out a family member about 5min ago. sittin' around the house, as i do on a fine friday evening, trying to erase the day's memories via beer, i get these frantic messages from my cousin.... "the [education department of state] won't let me log in to see my final marks!" "as in, you can't log in, or the marks are not there?" "i can't log in!" "oh, is your password ok? are you entering everything well?" "well, it's asking me for my student id, but i just graduated and i can't use that anymore!" "have you logged onto this website before with this number?" "yes..." "so it will still be the same number" "but i just graduated! the school doesn't use the id anymore!" "have you actually tried logging on with it yet?" *long period of silence...* "oh, it works now, all good!" this is why i drink.good morning (or afternoon, or evening) my fellow it brethren. this is my first tale here so i'll keep it short and sweet. i am fairly new to my it career and most of it has been at generic msp (managed service provider, monthly cost for it support for companies that don't want internal it) company ($genm). one of our newer clients at the time was a group of dental offices. mainly running an evergreen project to upgrade workstations and deal with a few networking issues as they came in. until this call i received one afternoon: &gt;me: $genm, this is noremac speaking, how may i help you today? &gt;user: hi this is $user, from $dentaloffice, our x-ray machine is not working &gt;me: what seems to be the issue? is the workstation not receiving the images? &gt;user: no it's not taking pictures. &gt;me: have you tried calling the vendor? &gt;user: no we haven't. we figured since you're our new it service that you would be able to fix it. &gt;me: unfortunately, this piece of machinery is out of our area of service, so you'll need to contact your vendor for support. overall it was a pleasant conversation, but i don't think the owner would be very happy if some random it people started fooling around with a very expensive, integral machine in their operation. tl;dr: user drives airplane to local mechanic. edit: added a description for msp.i worked on a project running two different systems at different security classifications so the users had two machines and two monitors (one for each machine). we received a call from a user stating that they were not able to copy and paste files. the user was right clicking &gt; copy on the mouse on one system, unplugging the mouse from one machine, plugging it into the second machine and then trying to right click &gt; paste. so i'm in the office, busy with some back end admin work, when one of the graduates pop's his head into the office. &gt;graduate: hi, my phones not working. &gt;me: ok.. what exactly is the problem. &gt;graduate: it won't turn on since this morning, since i dropped it. &gt;me: wait, you dropped the phone and now it won't turn on? &gt;graduate: yeah, it's a bit of a mystery.... i kid you not, he actually said that. it was a personal device anyway, and i was trying to be nice, but damn. i just sent him in the direction of the apple store. but still.. *it's* *a* *mystery....*i'm not it for our company, but i help a lot of the people in our office on basic things (non-admin rights stuff). i share an office with our sales guy, who struggles to write an email on a good day. he has an iphone 4s that is tied to our company's byod program and secured with mobile iron. this means that the lock code has to be 6 digits and changed every 6 months. &gt; $sales (on monday): hey, so i had to change the pin on my phone on friday, then forgot it, and tried too many times and now its asking for this ithing password. &gt; &gt; $me: let me look. oh, you locked it and tripped the anti-theft lock. you just need to put in your icloud password and it will re-setup. &gt; &gt; $sales: i don't have an icloud though. i never made one. &gt;$me: you do, and this phone is a brick until you remember the password for it. i open up the icloud website and try to reset the password on there, but he can't remember the answers to the security questions and the "e-mail me" link didn't work. &gt;$sales:f%#&amp;! i don't know what to do. all my clients call me on my cell. &gt;$me: lets try calling apple, maybe they can help. we call apple on speaker so i can talk for him, and they patch us to account security and he somehow satisfies their needs. &gt;$apple: we will email you a reset link to the new address you gave us in 24 hours. thank you. we wait 24 hours, and he gets the link. clicks on it and it takes him to the page to create a new password. $sales think very hard about a good password and carefully types it in one by one. enters it again. studies the dots, and clicks ok. &gt;$pwresetform: you must choose a password that you have not used previously. /facepalm.so, i've just taken a call regarding poor wireless signal from a customer. &gt;me: so, what seems to be the problem with your wireless? &gt;user: well, it works when we're in the same room as the router, but as soon as we go outside, it drops. what are you going to do about it? your router is faulty. &gt;me: ok, as it's wireless there are a lot of factors that can cause issues with the signal. could you describe the room that your router is kept in please? &gt;user: well, we're in a converted bank. the computer stuff is kept in the vault. &gt;me: well, that's probably the issue, the walls are most likely reinforced, and are so thick that you can't get a signal through them. &gt;user: *after a minor bout of swearing at me* well, what are you going to do about it??? i want to cancel since you can't provide a service etc etc... she eventually hung up on me still not believing that 4 foot thick steel reinforced concrete walls may be the problem. tl;dr wireless won't work in a with a router in a bank vault also, edit:formattingi've been meaning to post this one for a while now. i work in the tech support department for a small software company. i got a call a few months back that went a little something like this: me: "good afternoon, (software) tech support. this is fiercebrosnan." customer: "hi, something is really messed up. i'm getting an error message and i can't get anything to load in (software)." me: "ok. what does the message say?" the message is something that i've never seen before, and it does not sound good. me: "ok. let me connect in with you, and i'll take a closer look." i connect to his pc, and i see the message sitting there. i start to poke around. me: "when did you start seeing this message? i've never seen this before." customer: "well it really wasn't working right, so i kind of freaked out and started deleting stuff." no, i am not exaggerating. that sentence definitely came out of his mouth. it actually took a few seconds for me to process what he said and start speaking again. me: "...you started deleting stuff?" customer: "yeah." i dive into the folder structure to look for the database files required to run any project in this program and assess the damage. nothing. no files at all. dear god. i immediately head to his recycle bin and see a whole hell of a lot of important files pop up. whew. me: "well it looks like the files you deleted are still all in the recycle bin. there's a lot of stuff in here, and i don't want to try and sort out exactly what needs to be restored and accidentally miss something, so i'm just going to restore everything. is that ok?" customer: "yeah, that's fine." i restore everything. the files are all back where they belong. i launch the program, and everything works the way it should. i probably fixed a few other things on his computer, as well, considering his troubleshooting steps appear to start with "kill it with fire!". tl;dr guy has a software problem and decides the solution is to "freak out and start deleting stuff". this one just happened. so i work as the it manager at a hotel and resort. our spa had called me to tell me one of their keyboards wasn't swiping credit cards (it's a keyboard model that has a built in credit card swipe). so i head down there, open up notepad, slide my card, and sure enough, nothing. so while i am looking at it, one of the employees at the desk asks me if i've ever seen the it crowd. "do you ever get the urge to answer the phone and say 'hello, it, have you tried turning it off and back on again?'" i smile, and tell her yes. then i say to her "ok, your keyboard is fixed." she looks surprised, as they had assumed the keyboard would need replacing. "what did you do?" i look at her, smiling at the irony of the situation. "i unplugged it and plugged it back in. aka, turned it off and back on again." she smiled and gave me a high five. i love easy fixes.this one is going to be short and sweet. about 17 years ago, i used to work for a small isp where our roles were everything. sales, support, retention, crm, administrative support.. it wasn't a bad gig working and we had a lot of fun. i remember taking a call for a new user who was signing up for internet. i can't remember if it was for adsl or dial-up. we go through the whole process of registering her, name, house address, billing through cc, plan setup. we then got to the creation of the account, which would also be her email account. the conversation went something like this: &gt; $ncoch: ok, we are almost done. now let's pick out your username and it will also create your email email account. what would you like it to be? &gt; $user: i don't know, what can it be? &gt; $ncoch: it can be anything, a combination of your name, or what ever you like. please remember, however, that it will be your email aswell! &gt;$user: oh, ok, i have the perfect one... can you make it **happyhooker**? &gt;$ncoch: *stares at the screen bewildered* now, at the time, i was 18 years old, and didn't know much of the world, so you can appreciate what was running through my mind. &gt;$user: hello?... are you there? &gt;$ncoch: yes, sorry... ok! so just to clarify your email account will be *and i proceeded to spell it out* h-a-p-p-y-h-o-o-k-e-r-@localisp.com? &gt;$user: yes! that's perfect. needless to say, to this day, out of the thousand email accounts i had created for that company's client base, it is the only one that i will forever remember. edit: typosso, some of you may have read my last story, [here.] ( well, here's another one. at this job, i was on the internal helpdesk for a rather large company with over 1,400 employees, over roughly 30 sites. one morning, i'm at work, it's about 10:30am, i'd just come back in from my morning smoke and coffee. i set my phone to *available*, and sit down. instantly, my phone rings, so i answer. &gt; me: "thanks for calling helpdesk, this abra5umente. how may i help you this morning?" &gt; customer: "hi abra5sumente, i hope i've called the right place. i've got a bit of an issue here..." &gt; me: "i'm sure i can help mate, what's the issue?" &gt; customer: "well, it's just this damn bike again." did he just say "bike?" again? he's called before about this? &gt; me: "your... bike, you said?" &gt; customer: "yeah, the damn chain's come off and i've gotten my pant leg stuck in it." so i'm more than slightly confused at this point. this has to be a joke, right? &gt; me: "you want me to help you fix your bike? you are aware this is an *it* helpdesk, not a *general* helpdesk, right?" &gt; customer: "oh, i thought you were here to help us with things." &gt; me: "yeah, we are here to help you when your internet stops working or your printer explodes." there's a moment of silence, when eventually he sighs and asks me, &gt; customer: "so... you're not going to help me?" &gt; me: *i'm sure the exasperation in my voice was more apparent than i had intended* "ugh. i can help you. are you in $town?" &gt; customer: *he sounds absolutely thrilled* "oh really? great! i am in $town, just around the corner from $building. i can't get up to walk to the office." &gt; me: "okay, don't go anywhere (lol) i'll be there in 5 minutes." &gt; customer: "oh god, you're a lifesaver, kid!" i go around to the car park where he is, and it turns out he was an executive on the board. needless to say i helped him up, put his chain back on his bike for him, and sent him on his merry way. he explained to the ceo about why he was late, and he mentioned that i helped him, even though his bike lacks a motherboard. the ceo personally came to shake my hand and gave me a voucher for a free lunch at the bar in town. i really did love that job.\**ring*\* \**ring*\* &gt;me: you've reached technology, this is tjmaster, how can i help you? &gt;t: i need help! i can't get to my email! &gt;me: alright, could you look to see if... &gt;t: ..i'm actually in a hurry, class is starting, could you just come take a look? &gt;me: it would actually be.. &gt;t: oh, gotta go, sorry, bye. ..really? might as well see if i can remote into their system. aanndd, it's offline. i suppose i was going to that building soon anyhow, stopping by really wouldn't be a hassle for me. &gt;me: i'm here to see what's wrong with your email. &gt;t: oh, great! it's right over here! monitor? ...off. printer? ...off. computer? ..off. red light on powerstrip? (not important, those lights never work.) &gt;me: it looks like there's no power to your desk? &gt;t: is that why i can't get to my email? ...these people are teaching our children!thursday afternoon: "ok, mr. teacher, i'm going to upgrade your computer. i'm going to move all of these files you have saved on your desktop up to your home drive on the server for safekeeping, ok?" "sure thing, mr. techguy!" friday morning, 5 minutes after school starts: "mr. techguy!!!!!!! where are all of my files?!?!?!" "good morning mr. teacher. i put them in your f: drive on the server. remember?" "oh. yeah. thanks!" 10 minutes later: "whoa, mr. techguy, what did you do to mr. teacher's computer?!?!?!" "good morning ms. teacher -- i upgraded it. what's up?" "all the kids are saying you lost all of mr. teacher's files!!!" thanks mr. teacher. i really appreciate all the kids telling everyone i'm incompetent because you don't listen. i do have to admit i'm pretty impressed with how quickly you managed to spread that nonsense, though.short, but i'm sure many of you have had the same or a similar experience. very brief background. i work for a company who does it support for businesses and schools, both on site and remote work. this stemmed from a user logging tickets on our fault logging system that started off reasonably pleasant, but quickly became pretty ridiculous. it then led to this phonecall to my boss. &gt;user: since *billerss* attended site and installed the new projector, my internet at home has not been working. i want someone to come to my house and resolve this issue, free of charge. &gt;my boss: obviously this is not related as the two are in no way linked at all- **user interupted** &gt;user: of course they are all linked they are all computers. how can you be serious. you need to resolve this issue. &gt;my boss: unfortunately that is not our issue and we have are not obligated to provide free home support. i can maybe help you through some possible fixes? &gt;user: but you're it..? all it is supported by our contract. it was at this point my boss proceeded to sit them down and discuss what is and isn't in their contract. safe to say that user hasn't called again. i am one-man it for a small company. i need a file from $hr_lady. "hey, $hr_lady, can you email me this file i need?" "it's actually on the x drive. do you have access to that?" "yeah, i have access to... everything." "really?" "well yeah, i'm the it guy." "not the hr drive! you can't have access to that!" "okay, uh, then i won't give myself access to that."i work service desk at a law firm. the most common calls i get are "how do i do [x] in [office application]." generally, i have the answers ingrained in me, but occasionally i'll get a new one and have to google it. today, i had an attorney call in: attny: "how do i change text direction in excel?" me: "one moment" *proceed to search google for "change text direction in excel"* attny: "are you googling it? i'll beat you." me: "i have the steps..." attny: (interrupting) "i do too, " *proceeds to read the steps from google.* "thanks." *click* [edit: formatting]i received a ticket that a user isn't able to access one of the online tools that we have. it runs on java, but because it hasn't been updated, it can't use a version higher than java 7u67. i've dealt with it many times before, i just remove whatever version is installed, install 7u67, and set security permissions. sometimes java updates due to some end users having local admin rights because they are developers or constantly traveling. this guy is a developer. i remotely connected and saw the site not displaying properly, i checked the java settings and they were correct, but the site still gave issues. i logged in with my admin account and opened up programs and features to find a long list of unapproved software on his computer. me: "ok besides java i have to remove a lot of these programs, you should not have skype, the android sdk, these root applications for phones, a bunch of these actually." user is hesitant but says ok, but as soon as i start removing java he begins flipping out, saying i ruined his java sdk environment. all i removed was the 7u80 run time environment. user: "i need these applications! you ruined my install! you abuse your power! i will report you for this!" me: "i didnt ruin anything, i removed the runtime environment, your sdk is not involved with it. the rte is used by the browser." after struggling to let me finish, he flips out again. he tells me he's going to report me for "breaking" his computer. i confirmed the site is working. user: "this is ridiculous, why are you forcing me to use an old version of java for this site? if i knew this i wouldnt have had you change anything. who are you to decide we use this?" me: "i didnt decide anything, these are the rules that are in place, the creator of the internal site did not add support for newer versions of java, this is what you have to use in order to use the site." he starts getting uppity again, claiming it's all my fault and then slams the phone down. i called my manager on his personal cell phone to tell him what happened. after telling him about me "abusing my power": boss: "abusing your power my ass, there are rules in place. he's running loads of unauthorized software. no one says that shit to my team. we'll talk in the morning about this, i'm going to find this user and rip his computer away from him to remove all unauthorized software and his admin rights. i'm going to speak with his manager too" (if anyone wants an update tomorrow, let me know) edit: i didnt tell my boss that skype was installed, that's a security violation here. i can smell justice already. - mini-update: my boss is in meetings but will talk to me about what happened, don't worry guys, i'll get you an update [update](short but made me smile that the guy was chill about it &gt; 10 minutes ago in my office: &gt; *phone rings* &gt; me: hello? &gt; guy: yeah my computer is frozen &gt; me: how frozen? are we talking disney levels of frozen? &gt; guy: well it hasn't started singing at me yet &gt; me: there's still time then, i'll be right down **tl;dr: crtl+r &gt; cmd &gt; "taskkill /im let_it_go.exe"** **edit: i know it's win+r and not crtl+r, i just like seeing all you ocd techs twitch and squirm**this story takes place when i a student tech/content updater/web designer/whatever they needed that day for $public_university, working in the financial aid office. my users were all office workers who, despite working on computers all day every day, managed to learn as little as they could about them. it was a day like any other day when i receive an e-mail from upstairs with the subject "i kkkkkkcakkkkkn'tkkkk kkktykkkkkpekkkkkk", and no body. *well, this is odd*. i head upstairs and find $office_workers desk. &gt; $me: so, what seems to be the trouble? &gt; $ow: i just bought this new ergonomic keyboard last week, but today whenever i put my mouse into word or outlook it just starts typing the letter k over and over. &gt; $me: huh...do you know where your old keyboard is, just so you can have something to work with while i investigate this one? *oh god, i know nothing about hardware. i hope there's nothing wrong with this keyboard* &gt; $ow: yeah, it's right down here. *points at the tower under her desk* so apparently instead of unhooking her old keyboard, $ow had just found an empty usb port, plugged in the new one, and moved the old keyboard to the nearest flat surface off of the desk. and there's nothing wrong with this, and everything was working fine, but that morning $ow had moved a book off of her desk and on top of the old (still plugged in) keyboard. i pick up the book. &gt; $me: ok, try putting your cursor in word now... *click into word* and no stream of k's. &gt; $ow: *look of embarassment* don't tell anybody about this... edit: formatting and spelling**user**: i'm locked out **me**: ok, what's your name? **user**: jane b. *sees multiple jane b's on the system* **me**: what's the b stand for? **user**: ... i don't know what you mean. it finally happened. i literally asked a user their name and they said "i don't know". so this started off as a reply to another story and turned into a full blown (if short) tale in its own right. it is kind of a brag but... oh well. if you don't like it, downvote it! a while back i was working a weekend shift when a lady called in with a vpn issue. specifically she needed vpn and the two factor authentification app installed (registered and tested). this takes about twenty minutes start to finish and goes faster when i just remote into the computer and do most of the setup myself. which is what i did. now the place i work uses a rdp app that causes the wallpaper to disappear as soon as i arrive in the pc. usually people kinda freak out when this happens. this lady's response was completely different. &gt; **her:** hey! my wallpaper has disappeared! &gt; **me:** don't worry, your wallpaper will return... &gt; **her:** no! i like the solid black! is there anyway i can keep it? &gt; **me:** seriously? you want to keep it? &gt; **her:** absolutely! it is `so` much easier to read! &gt; **me:** okay then! let me show you to do this. turns out she has a vision issue that made it hard for her to read the names of icons against the normal default wallpaper. something to do with contrast? anyway, when explained this to me, i introduced her to the high contrast themes that windows has available for this purpose. then i set her up to use vpn. ---- edit: more of my stories can be found [here](my fiancee just sent me this, she works as a csr at a cellphone repair shop. gut laugh ensued. **customer:** so yeah this is the 3rd time we have brought this phone in and it's still not charging. **csr:** sir, there's bread in your charging port.9:00 "bobcat, i got into work and my pc was off so i turned it on and the windows said it was updating and then it said files were damaged and i need to install wordperfect from the original media. call me back!" 10:00 "i can't do any work, it still won't let me use wordperfect, i really need your help, call me back!" 11:00 "it's still not working, i can't work, call." 11:15 "i restarted my pc and it works fine now. ignore the other messages." tl;dr all users should be forced to watch the it crowd. sorry if this rips off the story about waiting for the web developer but i couldn't resist posting it. someone came into the store. they asked me if i could go grab the the person in charge of building custom computers(common mistake). &gt;me: i'm the one in charge of custom pcs &gt;$cust: haha very funny. you aren't old enough to know about building computers. go find me the person in charge of custom pcs. &gt;me: i'm not joking i really am in charge of custom pcs &gt; $cust: no you're not. you're wasting my time and i would like to speak with the owner. i went and grabbed the owner(who is also my neighbor so we're on a complete first name basis) and the conversation went as followed. &gt; $owner: can i help you? &gt; $cust: this kid here is insisting he is in charge of custom pcs and won't get me the real one. he's wasting my time. &gt; $owner: he actually is in charge of custom pcs. &gt; $cust: no he's not, i already had this conversation with him. go get me the person that's really in charge of custom pcs. at this point the owner just asked the customer to leave &gt; $owner: ma'am if your going to waste our time here i'm going to ask that you leave. &gt;$cust: neither of you are worth my time anyways. i'll go find someone who knows what they're talking about. she then left and gave us a terrible review which we replied to and got removed. tl;dr there's software defined hardware, and customer defined employmenti work as a customer facing programmer. most of my communication with customers is through email. when the phone rings that usually means someone either didn't see my email or something fairly complicated is going on. the phone rang today. i recognized the number. i swore under my breath. &gt;me: "companyname$, this is wishful." &gt;customer: "hey wishful. this is customerman$. yeah, i'm still having that issue with the custom project you sent me. it still pops up that message when i tried to send an email." &gt;me: "i sent you an email on the 8th with an updated file. did you install that?" &gt;customer: "yeah... i saw that. i didn't read it. there were too many words and i get leery when i see that." &gt;me: "... okay. i'll take over." at least he was honest? my first story + my background: [followed the guide, literally]( &amp;nbsp; just had this call 10 min ago: &gt;**me:** it, this is boef &gt;**user:** hey. i’m missing my up and down thingy (scrollbar) in my outlook inbox, but i got it in my sent folder. how come? &gt;**me:**…… uhm… my guess is that you don’t have enough mails in your inbox to show the scrollbar… how many mails do you got in there? &gt;**user:** i have six mails….. &gt;**me:** …… &gt;**user:** thanks for your help, bye! user submitted the following ticket, &gt;"for *insert terrible software* to work properly, it needs to be using windows 8. within the last couple of days, mine has somehow become windows 9 which is resulting in operating problems. please de-install windows 9 and install windows 8." so ofcourse being a good tech my notes look as follows -remote to pc -pc running windows 7 -closing ticket edit: wow did not think this would get so many upvotes. thanks guys. lolthis happened yesterday: user called asking to "borrow" some zip ties. all i have is the 8" length, which she also already had, but she said she needed about 14". &gt;me: ok, just put two of them together. &gt;user: how do i do that? &gt;me: ...put the pointy end of one into the square end of the other. &gt;user: ok then how do i connect them? &gt;me: ... she could never figure it out and had to get someone to help her.hello! first time poster so play nice, just received this phonecall at the pc repair shop i work at. it went a little something like this: me: hello, *name of our company*. how can i help? customer: oh, hello. erm, i've just turned on my laptop and i don't know how to connect it to the broadbands. i get this call quite often, the gentleman sounded elderly so i gave him a little sympathy. me: okay, are you wanting to connect wired or wirelessly. customer: well, i tried using the yellow cable, but i can't find anywhere to plug it in. this is where my suspicion started, but i thought he might just be getting a bit confused. me: right, well let's just try wireless; what operating system are you running? customer: microsoft me: okay, so windows. do you know what version. (pause) customer: well when i press the button down the bottom left, it says windows95. *sound of face slamming against desk* further conversation discovered customer was using a 17 year old laptop with no ethernet port (only modem for dial-up) and no wireless capabilities to try to connect to his 'broadbands'ftp. ltl. be kind. posting from phone. today starts like any other. headache and eye twitch, check. coffee, (a likely source for my twitch) check. phone, **ring ring**! ...check &gt;me:mega medical help desk, this is davethewizard. &gt;tempuser: hello, this is tempuser, i can't see my icons to do my job. &gt;me: ok, what applications are you missing? &gt;tempuser: *unrelated app* &gt;me: hmmm... let me check a few things. so first and foremost i should note, i can already tell the user is new. our users are usually pretty good about giving an ip address first so we can remote in. some even insist that we remote in before telling us the issue. she did not. i search the user's name in our ticket system, and find a new user create task that is half finished. i also see she is a temp for one of our more turnover happy divisions. &gt;me: it looks like the *correct app* access is being created now. since we just made your computer login, it hasn't been finished yet. you've.... &gt;tempuser: *interrupting me* then why, when i log in as my supervisor does it show up, but not under my login? another note, the program she is asking about is presented by xenapp, her group membership has not been added yet. &gt; in my head:**!! battle stations, battle stations, set condition one throughout the ship!!** note 3 this is a major breech of aup at our org. &gt;me: who's login were you using? &gt;tempuser:i can't tell you that... &gt;me:excuse me? &gt;tempuser:... &gt;me: ...well that is a security violation, and as such, will be reported. do you have any questions? &gt;tempuser:...**click** &gt;me: (sigh) so i report the user and lock her account in keeping with our protocol. the thing that gets me is, aup is drilled into users from the word go, is the first thing they see on the computers, on a form they sign before getting their login, and is even in the handbook. users man....we have a 'special' user, you know the type. everything has to be 100% functioning in the manner that they are comfortable with, or else it's broke. if it takes more than a day, they cc everyone including your mom talking about how unhelpful you have been and requesting more assistance for their "major problem". which it never is. well, they were having a "major" issue where a secure website was making her click two options in ie in order to load, and this was disconcerting to her. i create a chrome shortcut that loads the website normally because this is how others go to that site. all fixed, right? i immediately get a message from her about how it is still doing the same thing. i go to their desk and realize they totally ignored my message about the chrome icon and are still trying to use ie. i show them where the shortcut is, which was difficult because they have 50+ shortcuts on their desk, but this is not acceptable because they "don't trust google". i don't like arguing, i just want to fix shit, so i go back to my desk, only change the desktop icon to ie, and wait. sure enough i get an email thanking me for fixing their problem. i used to work at a college as a unix admin/web developer. one winter i was bored and took a paper process teachers were using and put it on the web. this process used to take weeks t collate and now had the potential to be automated to a large extent and completed in days. it still required the teachers to log in and verify information. the teachers were not happy about this because they hate change and made up excuses why they couldn't complete it. then i started to get the calls about issues, my favorite was non-existent errors that went something like this ____ teacher: i tried to login but it said i am not authorized to log in me: what was the exact error message teacher: "you are not allowed to use this system" me: it does not say that, please tell me exactly what the error you are looking at says teacher: it does say that how could you possibly know what my screen says, this system is broken and i can't complete my work!! me: i know this because in addition to coding this system...i also coded all the error messages and that is not something i coded teacher: *silence* me: would you like to actually try loging in and let me know if there are any problems teacher: *hangs up* edit: want to thank everyone for the upvotes, far an away the most popular post i have made to reddit, so glad everyone enjoyed it. i will share some more of my tech support stories thank you all and have a great day a situation i'm sure is familiar to most of you, the old "fix it on your time, mine is too valuable." a call comes in saying their excel add-in for one of their trading programs isn't working. i remote into his machine, as per usual when someone asks me for help. &gt;$user: what are you doing on my machine!? &gt;me: umm. fixing your issue? &gt;$user: not now! i have too much to do! do it after 4! &gt;me: i would but i leave at 3, so let me know a time that works for you. a few minutes later i get an email saying i can take a look. i jump on, and see the program needs to be updated, no big deal. i take care of the update, and give him a call back to sign in to test it. no answer. i call back a few minutes later. no answer. i call $friend, who sits next to him. &gt;me: is $user there? &gt;$friend: nah, he ran to the gym. what's up? &gt;me: ... tell him to give me a call back when he gets back. **the gym.** i leave a sticky note on his screen to call me when he returns and go about my business. an hour later i receive a call from $user: &gt;$user: is this finished yet? this is taking way too long this is ridiculous! &gt; me: i have been waiting the last 45 minutes for you to get back from the gym. not that you're back lets go ahead and test that plug-in. it works. and it's only 9am.a few years ago i was working for a contracted support desk for $hugeorganization. i would get calls from all sorts of people, from office workers to janitors to software developers. of the whole year i worked there, one particular call stood out to me the most. $hugeorganization obviously had rules about not letting users share their passwords, and if we found out this was happening we were supposed to quietly lock out their account after the call was over. one day i get what appeared t be a standard call from a user. he needs help with his program that he's using. he hasn't rebooted the computer yet so i have him do that real quick for me. when he goes to log into the computer i hear a couple beeps over the phone, but we hear weird noises all the time so i disregard it. so i msra into his machine and do some basic troubleshooting with the program, and after a few things i have him open the program and log into it. when he goes to login he places his cursor in the username field, i hear the beep again and the field fills out immediately. password does the same thing. what the heck? &gt;me: what are you doing to login? &gt;user: oh, i got tired of typing in my information so i printed it out as a barcode and put it on my desk. i scan it with the barcode gun on my computer. &gt;me: wow! never would have though of that... this guy’s idea was so awesome i just didn’t have the heart to screw him over just because the rules say. and plus, it’s not like his password is actually *written down*, plus who can read barcode? tl:dr – genius warehouse worker never has to type his password again by printing it out as a barcode. my friend tried to host some minecraft servers on the various computers in his house and his network stopped working. he told me he had set static ips on his computers which is fine. i spent an hour investigating and couldn't find anything wrong. i eventually checked the ipv4 addresses of the computers and found out he had set them all to the same address. tl;dr 10 people in a group with the same name gets confusing.a friend helps me repair my car so i promise to build him a computer. i finished and delivered that computer to him 1 week ago. today he calls me up saying that its been running really slow. it takes so long for teamviewer to open that i give up and have him reboot the computer in safe mode. once connected this is what i see needless to say, i will be taking the computer back and reformatting the drive. i will also be removing his admin rights. i work as one-man it for a small company. a coworker walks over to my cubicle and drops a laptop on my desk. "hey, hutacars, this is my personal laptop and it doesn't work. i spoke with [your non-it boss] and he said i could give it to you to fix since i do company work on it." "well generally i don't support non-company hardware, unless it's something work-related that's not working, like your vpn. what's wrong with it?" "i dunno, it crashed." "so it just doesn't turn on at all?" *thinks hard* "no, it just comes up black." "so it's the computer itself that isn't working, not something related to work?" "yeah." "okay... since it's not a company machine, i unfortunately can't fix it." "but i use it for work!" sigh.my mother, despite being in her mid 60's, is awesome with computers. she's a public librarian, and is often at the wrong end of users' questions. i came home for a quick mother's day visit and she told me this gem: user: i can't copy this highlighted section! this mouse must be broken! mom: just press the control and c keys at the same time. yes, that'll copy it. now hit the control and v keys at the same time. user: v?? why not p? mom: v stands for velcro, so when you paste it, it'll stick. user: ooh ok! that makes sense! tl;dr- my mom is amazing. that's it, guys. i just got "the call". the one we all dread. the worst part, by far, is that i work in a place of higher education, and this call was from a professor. i work at a state university in video conferencing. being such a large state, and so removed from the rest of the country, we rely heavily on distance education. i get a call from the help desk, they have a customer who is experiencing problems in one of our rooms. they transfer him to me. the instructor tells me that the monitor says "no signal". after determining that he was talking about the *computer* monitor, and not the television used for his video conference, i figure it has to be a cable problem. people can't possibly forget to turn their computer on. that's just something that happens in movies and tv, right? well... &gt; me: "okay, so the first thing i have to ask, is the computer powered on?" &gt; &gt; instructor: "well, i would assume so! i've never had to power it on or off before." oh god. please. &gt; me: "okay, can we try pressing the power button on the computer?" his next line? &gt; instructor: "where is it? all i see is a little box that says 'intel'..." this man is teaching the next generation of great thinkers. *edit: holy crap, 1st on page! you all rock! not bad for my first reddit post...*so, i volunteer at the local senior center computer lab. today, a lady came in, asking for help with her new cell phone. she says that she can call people just fine, but when other people call her, it doesn't come through. first step is obviously to verify the problem-- i ask her what her cell phone number is, and then call it from my own cell phone. sure enough, her phone doesn't ring, vibrate, or in any way indicate that there's a problem. second step is to make sure that i have the right number, so i call my own cell phone from hers. a different number pops up, which i show her. "$lady: oh, that's my cell phone number!" "$me: then what number was i just calling?" "$lady: my home phone number. do i need to give people my cell phone number instead?" "$me: ...yes, your cell phone uses your cell phone number."me: this is x019 user: i moved my monitor and now nothing works me: alright. is your monitor on? user: no. me: is your computer on? user: no. me: ... is your power strip on? user: how do i tell? me: is the light on it on? user: no. me: is it plugged in? user: umm. where does it plug into? me: the wall is usually a good place for that. user: uh. okay i got it. i had just plugged it into an open spot (on itself). me: alright. well let's turn that computer on then. user: it says "start windows normally". me: alright, hit yes. user: yes? me: sorry. use your keyboard. hit enter. on your keyboard. user: it's working! me: sweet. let me know if you have any more problems. --end call-- tl;dr such power many work compute wow how does strip?work in broadband tech support and a lot of people think we're there to fix their pc. had an old boy on the phone telling me his pc wasn't working. generally i will listen to their problem and offer some advice but tell them there isn't much else i can do due to my support scope. anyway his pc wasn't turning on and he was taking me through the steps he's already taken to try sort it. unplugging, checking cables etc. he them told me that he tried taking the ram out and spraying the contacts with wd40... so that was new.back in the day, guiniveretoo was just a young whippersnapper doing web development at a small design shop. small means very small: by "web development" i mean "design, development, qa, and devops (whatever that means when there's just you)". my boss was the owner of the company. we were working with a local event organizer who needed a website and a way to sell tickets for their show. rather than using an external service like events-alight or similar, we went the \*fancy\* route with a multi-page form in-line in the website. one day, our client called boss. a website user had called client because he was stuck. client and boss discussed the problem; boss eventually gave up and said to have the user call us and guiniveretoo would help him out. client gave user our phone number, and boss tells us that a website user will be calling, and to be nice to him and help him out. user calls, and the secretary passes the call to me. this situation is unusual but not out of the question; client was not particularly tech savvy so it's quite possible that she'd been stumped by something, and if there really was a showstopping error in the website then i would need to fix it. &gt; **me**: hello, this is $me; how can i help you? &gt; **user**: hi yeah, i can't get the website to load right. i can't buy tickets. &gt; **me**: okay, can you load other websites? &gt; **user**: yes, my internet is fine, i just can't buy tickets. i start asking debugging questions: "what kind of device are you using?" "what browser and version? here's how you find out what version of ie you are using." etc. after a few minutes of this: &gt; **me**: okay, describe to me exactly what you're seeing when you load $client's site. *i expect a description of a loading icon, and maybe a time out error or popup from the browser* &gt; **user**: well, there's the regular website, and *{title of the ticket form page}* and then there's this green loading bar. and the green bar won't move! one time i left it there for 45 minutes and nothing happened! it clicks inside my head. i attempt to suppress a giggle, probably not successfully. &gt; **me**: oh! i know what the problem is! so, that's not a loading bar - it *is* a progress bar, but it just shows you how many pages there are left in this form. if you click the "next" button, you'll see that it says "2 of 7 pages" instead of "1 of 7" like it says right now. &gt; **user**: *dial tone*as stated in an earlier post i work for a company that issues blackberrys to employees who have no business being issued a blackberry. here is another fine example why. *ring ring, ring ring.* **me -** this is the robot, i know more than you. what did you break? **luser -** my blackberry isn't loading the screen when i push the power button anymore. **me -** does it do anything or does not even power on anymore? **luser -** it powers on but then it just shows a red screen forever. **me -** when did this start happening? **luser -** after i pulled the battery out. **me -** why did you pull out the battery? **luser -** it started to erase everything and i didn't want it to. **me -** hang on let me start piecing this together to make sure i understand. were you trying to enter your password to unlock the device? **luser -** yes. **me -** did you get a message that you were entering the incorrect password and were now on your last attempt? **luser -** yes but i was entering the correct... **me -** shhh shh shh. did you try to enter the password on the last attempt after being warned that your data would be erased on the last failed attempt? **luser -** yes. **me -** did the device start to wipe your data? **luser -** yes. **me -** did you then proceed to remove the battery despite the message on the screen that said "warning do not power off device or remove the battery during security wipe!" **luser -** yes, i didn't want it to wipe my data. did that mess it up? congratulations on your new [device!](a bit over month or so ago we set up a virtualized windows-server for a customer, where they connected over remote desktop services if they needed to interact with the server software running there. everything had ran smoothly ever since the initial setup, but today i received a call from the customer. the customer was really frustrated as they needed something done fast and the ms' own mac client just gave errors about trust issues to the server. not fluent with mac, i still decided to poke around with teamviewer, and soon discovered that my colleague who had set up that specific mac had installed microsoft remote desktop from the app store and left a note for the customer to use that instead of the remote desktop connection, which also was on that computer. turns out the customer had been on a 2 week vacation and had forgotten about it. i demonstrated how to use the correct software over teamviewer and was preparing for the usual closing complaints about lost work time, lost money, difficult it stuff and so forth. then it happened. like a unicorn with rainbow colored spots: &gt; client: "i'm so sorry for wasting your time. i now remember reading the note and using the correct software, but i just had forgotten all about it during my vacation" &gt; me: (long pause, not believing what i hear) &gt; client: "hello?" &gt; me: "uh... umm.. absolutely no problem" &gt; client: "oh, and just bill me for the time, thank you" &gt; me: "okay, thanks and bye" i remember my mother reading me about people apologizing when i was a kid, but honestly this must've been the first time i've actually heard it. i tip my hat to the customer. you were **awesome** today.today i discovered that in my companies upstairs department there is one individual who arrives early and turns all of the computers on and logs them in. she keeps everyone's passwords on a piece of paper in her draw. i found this out as the individual in question was away. turns out that nobody knows their own password... ugh. edit: i, thankfully, do not work in it so this whole shitstorm is not going to backfire on me. the biggest problem would be that we have one it person for the entire company and if you can't find him then.. tough. caller: yeah i've got a new iphone 6 and it's always really hot to the touch. also the battery won't hold a charge. i don't even use it much throughout the day but it's always dead by about 3:00. me: ok, can you go into the battery usage section and tell me what's using up most of your battery? caller: it says home &amp; lock screen has used 55% of my battery over the last 7 days. me: uh ok. that's really weird. do you have any unusual screen savers or anything like that? caller: no, it's brand new. i have only changed a couple of the settings on it. me: like what settings? caller: oh i enabled a security pin and made it so the screen is always on. me: the screen is always on? caller: yeah the screen kept automatically shutting off after 5 minutes so i went in and told it to never shut off. i like to set my phone up on my desk and use it like a clock. me: &lt;sigh&gt;....hello techies of all nations. just a short one that happened today that i just wanted to facepalm so hard at. so 'user a' walks briefly in to our office today and this is what goes down user a: "hey guys, so i left my laptop at home today and i can't seem to get my pc to start as i was going to use that instead" fairly normal question but unusual that the user has both a laptop and pc in our place. colleague: "so when was the last time you used your pc?" user a: "about a year ago" so in my mind i'm thinking it's a password sync issue and a easy fix. so i get up and walk to user a's desk and she points to the monitor and says: "so i try to switch the monitor on but nothing is turning on." well shit. all i can see on the table is a docking station that's linked up to the monitor. i proceeded to refrain from calling her an idiot and advised her she'll have to work from home or collect her laptop. this reddit, is my job. (and most likely yours) edit: formattingi'd like to blame this on oversight, but in the end, no matter which way i cut it, i still feel like a moron. i bet the tech support gentleman is having a good laugh at my expense. so i come home after a long-ass overnight shift at work and plop my tired ass onto the computer chair. weird, skype's not online. in fact, nothing was. it only felt right to do the usual 'turn-off, turn-on, plug, un-plug' ritual. still nothing. "shit, probably because i'm a month behind on paying the bill." so, naturally, i call up the company, pay the bill and have a chat with tech support. apparently not having an online light on your router at all doesn't exactly mean a disconnect - and i fancy myself knowing a little about computers, pft, please - apparently i needed to do a little troubleshooting. this confused me, as i already was pretty sure i did just that. the man over the phone asks if i have a router, as what i described sounded like an ethernet issue. then it hit me. it's been getting cold as shit lately, and i was looking for a socket for a personal heater earlier today before work. i unplugged what resembled a phone charger that was plugged in behind my desk - next to all my computer shit. i haven't a clue why it didn't click in my head at first. "sir, i'm incredibly sorry for wasting your time. i just realized i didn't even have it plugged in."i was working a help desk and these poor hvac guys were always having issues. one day this guy called in and i got him three times. found out he's on the roof of a building trying to troubleshoot. after looking into his ticket history the laptop was toast and needed to be replaced but the company didn't want to spring for it. so this was near the end of our 45 min conversation: &gt; me: ok we are going to try one last thing sir, are you near the edge of the building? &gt; him: ayup pretty close... &gt; me: oops &gt; him: wow, the laptop just slipped off the building. damned wind must've taken it out of my hands! &gt; me: i'll put in the order to desk side sir, you have a better day! thankfully the call wasn't on the review list or i'm sure we would've been in deep doo doo. but we both felt better! edit: thanks for all the upvotes and for the kind stranger who gilded it! didn't even realize it was this popular :-)&gt;me: sorry for your wait, sir. my name is -meatspace name here- how can i help you? &gt;caller: i think there's something wrong with my computer. &gt;me: can you describe what it's doing? &gt;caller: it works just fine for awhile and then the screen turns blue. &gt;me: is your monitor failing? &gt;caller: no, the computer's broke. &gt;me: okay, what happens after the screen turns blue? &gt;caller: some letters flash and it restarts. &gt;me: does it say "an error has occurred and windows has been shut down"? &gt;caller: yeah, do you know what that is? &gt;me: it's called a blue screen of death in laymans terms. there's not-- &gt;caller, yelling: damnit! &gt;me: sir? &gt;caller: my damn daughter and her fancy degree. she told me that's what the problem was because college smarts and i bet her she was wrong. something's wrong with the world when a kid knows more than her parents! &gt;me: *shocked silence* &gt;caller: can i charge you for this? &gt;me: for what? &gt;caller: for making me owe her 10 bucks. &gt;me: ....um, no. &gt;*caller proceeds to hang up, mumbling more about "kids these days."* tl;dr: dude bet his daughter that his computer wasn't bsoding because he thinks something's wrong with kids having college degrees and then asked if he could charge my company the 10 bucks he now owes her for her being right.this is a quick tale of tech support. a customer called in claiming that there were viruses on her computer. this is the phone conversation ending in my complete loss of faith in humanity. customer: i'm not sure what happened, my computer says there are 6000 viruses, i get lots of popups, it locks up all the time. me: alright ma'am. can you describe to me what you were working on before all of this started? customer: i was checking my email and there was a message from j.p. morgan chase bank. it said my bank account was put on hold. it told me to click on a link in order to reactivate my account. me: do you have a j.p. morgan chase bank account? customer: no. *ten seconds of dead air while i stare blankly into my computer screen, contemplating human existence* ------------------------------------------------------------ i wrote this while on an hour long call this morning. it's not art, but i amused myself. the guys at work thought it was worth sharing. so i share. enjoy. edit: holy crap, wow. thanks, all! ------------------------------------------------------------ look. you're in a hole. i do not know if you fell or jumped in the hole. i'm not here to judge. (and i honestly don't care) i do know these things. i did not dig the hole. you do not want to be in the hole. i responded to your plea for help. i have a ladder. if you do not like this ladder, i cannot help that. it's not my ladder personally, so no offense taken. if you want, i can try and find another ladder. but it will take time, if you don't want this particular ladder. it makes little difference to me. i'm not the one in the hole. i'd like to help you out of the hole. however, it is ultimately on you. but i'll help you however i can, as best i can, until you are out of the hole. all i ask, really, is that you just stop fucking digging.i receive at ticket saying the above, but had something i needed to do, so i called afterwards. please note, its around 4:30pm, on a friday afternoon, before easter weekend. i call the landline, which keeps ringing and finally forwards to her cellphone. i hear someone pick up, and there's loud music and the person yelling... &gt;user: hello? i can't hear you &gt;me: hi, this is burncycle from com-it calling about the ticket you submitted a few minutes ago. &gt;user: i really can't hear y...oh, i've left the building already. can i call you back? im on the plane and im about to go under *click* .....i'm sorry, you're about to go under? on a plane? should i call someone? maybe 911?just had a user try plugging the power cable into a usb slot and call me down because it wouldn't fit. literally a circle connector into a square port. goodbye tfts. it's been a pleasure. i'm going living a solitary life.customer: you guys were the last ones to touch my computer and now it's not working. me: ok, let me check our tickets to see what was done. ok, the last visit we made to your office was 18 months ago. customer: that seems correct. you guys were here, and then it stopped working. me: so this computer has been sitting unused for a year and half? customer: no, i use it every day. ???? me: but you said we were the last people to touch it. customer: your guy was the last one to touch it who knew what he was doing. i don't know what i'm doing, so i really don't count that.first call of the day. it's short but good for a chuckle. &gt;person: can you fix my email? mine is pink and the other person's is yellow. mine needs to look like hers. my manager and i took a few turns asking questions to try to narrow it down until we just decided to have them send us a picture. turns out they were using different applications. file this one under pebkac.first post in the sub! here goes nothing... i’m a specialized sysadmin at a medical school. at the time of this story, we’ve recently switched to a new website for online learning. the old one is in the last stages of its use for the current semester. but despite our best efforts, professors seem to ignore every memo/announcement/email/broadcast informing them of the move. i get this call: &gt; **$prof:** i can’t see any of my courses for next semester on the site. &gt; **$me:** are you looking on the new website, at [new site]? &gt; **$prof:** yes. i’m on there grading students right now. (i groan inwardly, knowing that students aren’t on the new site yet.) &gt; **$me:** that’s the old one. please go to [new site]. &gt; **$prof:** i just told you, i’m already there! &gt; **$me:** what does your browser show in the address bar? &gt; **$prof:** [old site]! &gt; **$me:** then you’re on the old site. you have to go to [new site] for future semesters. &gt; **$prof:** why wasn’t i told?! &gt; **$me:** it’s been communicated many times through announcements on [old site]. &gt; **$prof:** oh, i don’t read those. &gt; **$me:** there have also been emails to all faculty about it from several different departments. &gt; **$prof:** you can’t just assume that i pay attention to all my emails! you should have called! she didn't understand why we couldn't possibly call every single professor and inform them of the change. this happened several times over the next few weeks. to reiterate: i work at a *medical school*. these are the people training our future doctors. do they just ignore their patients' charts, too? edit: formatting so, my dad gets a new laptop, no problem, right? he boots it up, usual complaints of windows 8 etc etc dad: hey $mrcoolguy, why is the internet so slow and why does it look different? me: it's because you're using internet explorer. i'll just install chrome. dad: no, don't do that! as soon as you installed chrome on my old one, i noticed how slow internet explorer was! me: yeah, that's because chrome is faster dad: no, chrome just downloads a trojan virus to slow down internet explorer, i'm not installing that! in the end i just installed chrome and used the internet explorer icon for it.the company that i work at requires documentation for issues as i'm sure the companies/businesses you all work for do as well. when documenting a ticket what do we call these folks? usually either customers, users, or clients depending on where we work, what we do, and who we help right? well i work in a place where the people i help are my co-workers, some higher, some lower but all co-workers none the same. here was a call from a while back... *ring ring...ring ring...* **me -** robot here, don't give me a reason to open the flask on a tuesday morning, what's broken? **luser -** hi. how are you? good? great! so i am trying to access my co-workers mailbox through outlook and it says "folder cannot be expanded" when i try to open it and i need to help them because they are out on pto. **me -** alright. what is the users email address so i can check their permissions on the exchange server? **luser -** what!? **me -** the user you are calling about. the one you need access to their mailbox while they are on pto. **luser -** they aren't a user... **me -** they don't work for *x-company*? **luser -** they do...they just aren't a user. **me -** do they not use our computer systems or network? **luser -** they do but they aren't a user. we drug test when we hire, they don't use. **fuck it all. les the binge drinking commence.**user: i don't have any of my network drives. me: ok, let's start with a reboot. user: (5 seconds later) ok, done, now what? me: you rebooted your machine that fast? user: yeah, it's one of the newer ones, so it's pretty fast. me: sir, computers do not reboot that fast, please start with a reboot so that we can see if that fixes the issue. user: i told you i already did that. me: ok, hang on a second. [at this point i just sent a shutdown over the network] user: what's going on, my computer just turned off. me: the first step of the process is to start with a reboot, and since there seemed to be a problem with the one you just did, i just forced another one just to be sure. user: if that was actually gonna fix it, i would have rebooted it, but i already know that won't do anything. i have had this problem before and there is something you have to do to the server to fix it, there is nothing wrong with my machine. (mind you, we have about 80 servers) me: ok, when the pc comes back up please login. user: (after about minute) fine, whatever, now what? me: are your network drives back now? user: yeah they're there, see i told you, all you had to do was fix the server. thanks, bye. - quick hang up twats, fucking twats everywhere.context: i work for a manufacturer, booking in engineer visits. we recently released a product recall and a dedicated phone line to help those customers. unfortunately, that line is currently at maximum saturation, and we have overspill customers calling customer service. late in the afternoon, during a rather busy spell, i get this call: &gt; me: good afternoon, chargeable repairs, how can i help? &gt; customer: hello, i've pressed the wrong option on the phone because i can't get through to ongoing repairs. &gt; me: okay i'm sorry you can't get through, but we don't deal with ongoing calls in this department, we deal with paid for repairs, so i will have to try and transfer you. &gt; customer: that's ridiculous, how come the other line is so busy? &gt; me: because people who can't get through to the recall line are pressing the wrong option to get through to someone. &gt; customer: why are they doing that? they shouldn't be doing that! &gt; me: isn't that what you've just done? &gt; customer: ... *hangs up* i get many calls where they say they've pressed the wrong option, but never had someone who thinks its okay for them but not for anyone else. so i work at a public library as tech support. i'm currently setting up databases and stuff for them because they are mainly paper based, but i digress. this old guy called the front desk for tech support at around 9am, i had just got in, and said that his mouse wasn't working. so i went all the way up to the third floor and the guy was on the floor using the mouse on the carpet. he didn't understand that you just need to lift the mouse and place it at the centre of the mouse mat to have room to manoeuvre, so he just kept going off the desk until he was on the floor. i didn't laugh because he was clearly very new to computers, but it was pretty hilarious. i had to sit down with him for a few minutes to explain how it worked and to help him send an email. i found the whole thing pretty heart-warming, as cheesy as that sounds.a few years ago i was working tech support in it. my client, a large tugboat and barge company in my state had called in reporting that their head office had just lost power. i told them to let me know when their power is restored so i can check all their servers are online and accessible. a few hours later one of the staff called me and it went like this: me: hi welcome to it company this is t35345 how can i help client: hi this is sarah from tugboatco i was told by management to give you guys a call when our office power was restored? me: no worries, so your office has power now? client: ummm i'm not sure. me: you're not sure if your office has power? client: no i'm not actually sure sorry. me: are there lights on? can you see people working on their computer again? client: hmm i don't know. me: i don't understand, you can or can't see lights on? client: i'm not sure, i'll have to have my manager call you, i'm not too good with the technical stuff me: ok no prob. a few mins later the manager of the tugboatco called and explained that they now have power and he was confused that sarah couldn't tell if they had power as they have a large open plan office with not that many windows, it would have been very dark in there when they didn't have power. tl:dr: sometimes people can't even see if a light is on in front of them. him: "alright, since the monitor is giving you troubles, let's try turning it off and turning it back on again." user: "i already did that." him: "alright, let's just do it again, just to be sure." user: "i can't find the button."a few years ago i took over a sysadmin job at a highschool because my predecessor was sick and there was no estimate on when he'll come back. (he came back a year later and was fine) the system was in a catastrophic state and i had to re-install most of the servers over the summer and upgrade the 15 year old software that was running the school. this included deleting the old active directory domain and users and basically remodeling the whole school. a few weeks after school started again a senior came to me and said in a kind of angry voice: &gt; "excuse me, when will my domain admin account work again? i can't log on to the new servers!" i thought i misheard him or he meant his local machine or something but he was serious. the old admin had absolutley no technical skills and just learned how to use some systems but he gave selected students **domain admin accounts** so they can manage the system (also the file servers with the teachers files on them) for him and also once a year log onto every computer and install windows updates by hand (yes, once a year) when i told the headmistress about the whole thing she was furious and when the original sysadmin came back he wasn't put in it anymore and i still manage that schoolthis even got me baffled so worth the share i think: call from a user: &gt;user: "hi, matvalicious. for some reason i am unable to drag-and-drop e-mails into my archives anymore. &gt;matvalicous: "that's pretty odd, let me take over your computer for a sec. i suspected a faulty mouse or something, but to my surprise i wasn't even able to do it remotely. &gt;matvalicous: "ok, what's going on here? let me do another test and try to drag an icon across your desktop." to my surprise, we were unable to drag any icon, anywhere. &gt;matvalicous: "well, user, i'm flabbergasted. let me google that real quick... ok, try the following: click and hold any icon on your desktop, and while doing so press escape." &gt;user: "hey, it works again! thanks, matvalicious!" dear diary, til click, hold and escape is a shortcut to disable the drag function... **edit: the system was a windows 7 x64 enterprise. two of my colleagues tested it and it" worked" with only one of them. worked on me as well. also, his escape wasn't stuck. google "drag not working windows 7" and you will find multiple people with this issue on microsoft forums and the suggested fix.**i work in it security and am rolling out pci-dss compliance at a customers location. we're in the ad/gpo phase where we bring on complex password requirements, screen lock timeouts, etc. i get a call to help a user out who was missed on the list of users at a location to get the new requirements. so of course i call to help him out: &gt;me: hi user, it appears you were missed on the rollout of the new security requirements; i've added you to the security groups. we need to change your password, i'm going to remote in and be there if you need me. sounds good? &gt; user: yep come on in! i remote in. &gt; me: great. now i'm going to need you to log out and log back in so you can choose a new password. user logs out. &gt; me: okay now enter you current password and you should be prompted to change it. &gt; user: actually i don't need to enter a password. i found a way to bypass the password by just clicking the circle with the arrow on it next to the password field. &gt; me: oh really, can you show me how you do this? &gt; user: sure! user clicks the login button with no password and gets the password change prompt. i then realize the user has no password on his account. &gt; user: see, isn't that neat!? good thing you guys are bringing in better security! &gt; me: that's what we are here for sir! now lets get you that new password... i just went into a meeting and happened to be sitting next to the help desk guy who had the privelage of taking the ticket. "user reports that she had a squirel in her office and now she is unable to connect to the network. she would like a tech to take a look at her pc to make sure everything is ok with the wires on the back of her pc." made my friday so much betteri work for the it department at a university. we have a few student workers who man the phones and create tickets to assign to my team. this morning one of the student workers tells me of a user who's very upset, has a very high pitched squealing computer, and a message on screen that says "failed to boot". &gt;me: "what is the exact error message? 'failed to boot' is not something i've ever seen before and i don't think that's what the screen is actually saying". &gt;sw: "i don't know i already hung up. can you please go look? she's in the next building over. i didn't know what to do and she was very angry". /facedesk so i walk over and have the user power on the computer. immediately i hear a repeated beeping, not a whining or screaming. sounds like keyboard input in a pre-boot menu. i look at the keyboard and the user's stapler is laying on the f12 key. it's a dell machine. the message she was seeing on screen was the "select boot device" menu. tl;dr stapler on boot menu key = irate luser. i spent at least half an hour trouble shooting a customer's email address over the phone. it was so perplexing. there was no reason that it shouldn't be working. this guy was in his 20's, so i mistakenly gave him the benefit of the doubt and began looking into more complicated issues. everything checked out, so i finally got him to spell letter for letter what he was entering as his username only to find out that he was spelling "at" instead of using @. how does one function in today's society having never used an email address?someone has built and shipped to a user a computer with the hostname set to the local administrator password. ping [local admin password] pinging [local admin password].domain.co.uk [10.248.123.35] with 32 bytes of data: reply from 10.248.123.35: bytes=32 time=&lt;1ms ttl=125 i'm laughing so hard i'm crying. thats the reason i'm crying right? ...right? ^please... ^send ^help edit : i should point out that computer hostnames are like nat1234 - the asset number. the local admin password looks a lot more like de858585::arkedttt123*, this is not an easily missed typo... *its nothing like that, of course. but you get the picture.so i work tech support for a popular camera company. i answered this call. me: thank you for calling in to.... customer: you guys sent me the wrong fucking camera! me: sorry to hear about this sir, which camera did you receive? customer: i ordered the _____, which is the most expensive one! this piece of shit did not come with a touch screen!! me: sir, the model you ordered may be our most expensive camera, but this particular model does not come with a built in touch screen. customer: well what the fuck kind of logic is that!!??? me: sorry sir, i can understand how this can be frustrating for.. customer: fuck this shit!!! i want a supervisor!! i will get an upgrade!! i don't care if i have to get all the way to the fucking ceo!! me: unfortunately, there are no supervisors avalible at this time. customer: well i hope you lose your job and that your entire company goes under. sometimes, i can't fucking believe how entitled and ignorant people are... one day at my first job, i was called into the bosses office. with a stern face he said "we have to have a talk". when i enquired what was going on, he said it was about the software i wrote "hacking into the company". and that i was to be fired for breaking the law. he handed me an envelope with what i assume was my dismisal notice. i asked what the hell he was talking about. he said, "there is no point hiding it, you have been caught and i have the evidence right here. [pointing to his laptop]". he then asked if i had anything to say before he called the police. i asked to see the evidence on the laptop, he turned it around and showed an error message on the screen. it read "this program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down". edit: a few requested that i finish the story [ so here it is ]( ) this is a story from awhile ago and i only just found this subreddit so i apologize if this doesn't quite fit. i was working tech support for a rather large isp. female customer calls in, doesn't know their password. ok, i can reset it for you but you need to answer the security question first. "oh, my husband set that up. i'm not sure i know it." "i'm sure you can get it ma'am. where did you go on your honeymoon?" answers in 2 seconds "florida." "uh, that's not what i have here..." "what? i know that's where we went. i was there." "i'm sorry ma'am, that's not the answer that was put in." "wait wait wait! does it say hawaii?" "yes ma'am, that's what i have here." "that's where he went with his first wife!! imma need to call you back! daryl!!" *click* i sat there for a moment and then laughed my ass off. i worked tech support at my university library as an undergrad. everyone was old and/or didn't know how to use a computer. one time i was on a call, trying to help a user install adobe reader or something (we had just upgraded everyone from xp to win7). &gt; **me**: alright, this should be easy. please open your web browser and- &gt; **superuser**: wait, open what? &gt; **me**: your web browser. &gt; **su**: what's that? *honestly, questions like this didn't surprise me anymore* &gt; **me**: it's what you use to visit websites? &gt; **su**: i don't think i have that. &gt; **me**: uhh, ok, do you see the internet explorer icon on your desktop? &gt; **su**: no. *this was a very recently replaced computer; they all had ie on the taskbar* &gt; **me**: do you see an icon that looks like a blue e with a ring around it? &gt; **su**: uhhhh, no. &gt; **me**: ...i'll be right there. i walked up a couple floors to their office, introduced myself, asked to see their computer. they had 4 or 5 instances of internet explorer already running. yep.hey tfts, remember my last story about the girl who brought me her monitor instead of the pc? today i had a similar situation. last week i sold a new imac to one of our customers because he didn't want to deal with viruses anymore (bullshit i know). and since he already had a macbook he didn't want me to install it at his home. today he called in furious anger: me: hello this is.... customer: how dare you ripping me off like that? me: good day sir, you don't mind telling me the problem before you scream like a maniac. customer: you know exactly what you did, you ripped me off!!! i have all the right to scream!! (since he didn't bother to tell me his name i looked up his phone number in our customerdatabase and saw that i sold him an imac a week ago) me: if i have to guess there's something wrong with your imac? customer: damn right there's something wrong with my imac. you didn't give me the whole thing!! me: how didn't i send the whole thing? customer: you just gave me the freaking monitor!!! me: have you tried to plug it in and turn it on before? customer goes away from the phone, i hear the typical apple boot sound, and the customer hangs up the phone... tl;dr: customer thought i was ripping him off by just sending the monitor, he ordered an imaci was told you guys might enjoy this: i went to the surgeon's the other day for a follow-up and to get my stitches out (yay!). he logged into the computer and pulled up the pictures he took of the inside of my wrist. as they came up, he made a joke about how the pictures won't mean anything to me because, "it's not your fault you didn't go to medical school." to which i gave him the requisite chuckle. then, when he couldn't get the program to re-size the pictures properly on the screen and i had to show him how to use the computer, i said to him, "don't worry, this is what i went to school for, i wouldn't expect it to make sense to you." he didn't think it was all that funny. true story.so preface. this was not an angry cry or frustration cry. i literally cried my eyes out after leaving this job. customer was in his 70's and i'm in my young 20's so i get a ticket for a customer who's internet stopped working on a friday with a note attached saying his wife passed away this morning and he wanted someone to come onsite monday to setup a new router/modem and printer. i was not looking forward to this as it was going to be awkward but a jobs a job. so i get there and it was kind of awkward, got everything setup and working and he asked if i'd like to go get dinner somewhere. (couldn't say no) well we went to dinner and ended up staying and talking for an hour or so about life and he told me about his wife and football and everything under the sun. when i left he gave me the greatest thank you i've ever gotten and started crying. he said it was great to talk to someone and he felt a little bit better. on the drive home i started crying and told everyone in my family how much i love them.context: i work at a wireless phone service, and i'm the highest level of tech support. *customer calls in pretty heated* me: "hi, sorry for the long wait, how can i assist you today?" customer: "are you a supervisor? i specifically need to talk to a supervisor in billing support!" me: "no ma'am, i'm in tech support, are you having a technical issue or a billing issue?" customer: "why aren't you a supervisor?!" me: "umm, i guess because i didn't apply?!" at the time my supervisor was listening to the team's calls, and happened to be listening to mine. he almost fell out of his chair laughing. i kinda got in trouble for saying that, but i couldn't resist upon such a ridiculous question. just a short one here. at my school had to fix an issue with a teachers personal laptop. turns out she was on leave. call her up and ask for a screen shot. she says she will mail it to me. find a pdf file in my mail. thinking nothing of it i open it to find out that the teacher scanned her monitor and sent the pdf. i think there is a face shaped dent in my desk from where my face hit it. edit: the obligatory holy shit this blew upi work in it for a hospital. i was asked to put a license for office 2010 pro on a user's pc. all the paperwork was filled out, so i went and installed it. as i was leaving, one of her co-workers said "hey it guy, install it for me too, please." i said "sorry ma'am, but i need the paperwork filled out and it has to be paid for. then i'll come do it." she said "oh... don't we own that company?" i replied "what company? you mean microsoft?" she said "yeah, we don't need to pay for it if we own the company." i just stared at her thinking that she had to be kidding. she just stared back waiting for an answer. "... no ma'am. i don't think we own microsoft." first time lurker, long poster. i work for a cable company as a remote tech doing virus clean ups and other garbage work. i get this customer about 5 time a day. very simple stuff, but enough to drive me insane. me: you already know cc:clueless customer. at some point during any call you are going to need to restart the computer, all tech support knows this. &gt; me: thank for calling (insert name here) my name is ssnikki, how can i help you? &gt; cc: my computer won't connect to the internet/has a virus/is being mean to me! fix it! &gt; me: okay could you please restart your computer for me really quickly? sometimes that helps. &gt; cc: you want me to shut it down an turn it back on? &gt; me: yes please. &gt; cc: all the way off? &gt; me: yes please. &gt; cc: how should i do that? &gt; me: click start, and click restart. &gt; cc: where's start? by this point i am ready to throw my headset out the window. thank you all for letting me vent. i'm sure i will have more humorous stories soon.last month i received a call from one of my frequent fliers. &gt; me: internal it helpdesk, this is simality, how may i help you? &gt; her: hi, i can't get to $webbasedapplication &gt; me: what happens when you try? &gt; her: it won't come up! &gt; me: hmmm...that's not good. let's make sure its not an internet issue. &gt; her: it's not. &gt; me: humor me. could you try going to $othersite? &gt; her: *(pause)* it won't load either. &gt; me: okay, well in that case, let's let windows run its troubleshooter on the internet connection. &gt; her: the connection is fine; the internet is working. &gt; me: how can you be so sure? &gt; her: i keep getting a time warner page when i try and go places. &gt; me: that's odd....what does it say? &gt; her: "easy ways to pay your bill." ltl, ftp, you know the drill. while i do not work in tech support but build and run networks, i couldn't resist telling you this tale of my stupid colleague that happened just 10 minutes ago. $dc is "dumb colleague", $ic is "informative colleague", $everyone is everyone else in the room i sit in. $ic just got off the phone and this ensued: &gt; **$ic**: guys, don't reboot your computers! &gt; **$everyone**: why not? &gt; **$ic**: the recent update for $softwarepackage is highly buggy. if you reboot after its installation, you won't be able to log on to your pc any more. &gt; **$everyone**: oh, ok, that's shit. better not reboot. &gt; *5 minutes pass* &gt; **$dc**: hm, i can't log on to my computer. &gt; **$ic**: what? did you reboot it? i just told you not to. &gt; **$dc**: yeah. but i wanted to try it. &gt; **$everyone**: why the hell would you want to try that? &gt; **$dc**: well, what else was i supposed to do?? &gt; **$everyone**: how about "not reboot your computer"? which now lead to him having to reinstall his machine. he's just sitting there doing nothing now.accounting clerks are my favorite people... &gt;me:tarpit technical support, mastadonbob here.. &gt;her: this is largemarge in accounting, i tried to run a trial balance and my computer is locked up. &gt;me: easy fix, marge. there's a known bug in the outrageouslypriced accounting software package. if you click the trial balance button twice, your computer will lock up (100% resource usage). simply reboot your computer and you should be good to go. &gt;her: will you stay on the line while i do this? &gt;me: sure. she reboots her machine reboot #1 &gt;her: okay, here we go i distinctly hear click. click. &gt;her: nope, same issue. &gt;me: did i just hear two clicks? did you click the button twice? &gt;her: no! (whining) can't you just come over here and fix it? we're on the same floor and they have a great coffee machine over in accounting so i agree. reboot #2 &gt;me: okay, here i am, did you reboot your computer again? &gt;her: yes i did. now watch! click....click... &gt;me: you just clicked it twice! &gt;her: (defensively) i wasn't sure if i clicked it! reboot #3. &gt;me: okay, click the button one time now. she clicks....smiles...5 seconds elapse. she clicks again. lockup. &gt;me (incredulous): didn't i just tell you to click the button one time? &gt;her: my husband is in the hospital! *starts crying* i'm not sure what sort of response i was expecting but that was certainly not it! reboot #4 and everything worked. minding my own business on helpdesk, and the phone rings. answer the phone, customer immediately demands to know status of ticket. ask customer for ticket number, customer asks why i dont have it already. explain they're calling us from a phone number not listed on any systems we utilize, most likely their personal cell (which is a big no no.) customer grumbles about stupid cell phone rule, and locates ticket number. i pull up ticket, and see it's assigned to another group on east coast. explain to customer they will need to be connected to other group for status update, as only notes on ticket from staff handling it are unclear as to status. customer refuses to be connected to them. customer hangs up. customer calls back. same routine. customer hangs up again. customer calls back, again. for the sake of my sanity, i tell customer i will contact staff handling their ticket for them, and that i will call them back in 2-3 hours. (i've got a lunch to take, and my own crap to deal with before this moron's disaster to clean up.) customer and i then proceed to have this conversation, verbatim: &gt;user: "okay, well, i'm on the east coast, so do you mean 2-3 east coast hours?" &gt;me: "i mean 2-3 hours. hours are hours." &gt;"right, but i'm on the east coast and you said you're in central time, so you are you talking about central hours or eastern hours?" &gt;"sir it doesn't matter if you're on the east coast or the west coast or in asia, an hour is an hour." &gt;"but i'm on the east coast. it's an hour sooner here." &gt;"sir i mean 2-3 hours, or 120-180 minutes from now." &gt;"that doesn't answer my question!" &gt;"how about this, sir. it's 11:55 am your time right now, right? i'll call you before the clock on your desk says 3:00 pm." &gt;"oh, okay, so 3 east coast hours." *tl;dr: 60 minutes is only an hour if you're not on the east coast.* *phone support at a large busniess*: a user was having problems with her laptop shutting down randomly. i assumed it may be a defective battery as we had seen a few of those from a past batch of laptops. i asked her if it was plugged in. "is what plugged in?" she said. "is the *power* plugged in," i replied. after a long pause she responded, "how do i determine if it is plugged in?"frontline library computer tech here. about a month ago, a woman in her mid 40s came into my computer lab. lady=lady, me=me simple enough? &gt;me: hello, do you need any help? &gt;lady: yes, i need to make a new website. (me knowing almost nothing about making a website.) &gt;me: alright, do you know how you made your previous one? (maybe i can suss out how she made her old website and direct her to the appropriate resources) &gt;lady: no. (damn) &gt;me: ok, do you know what language you used? &gt;lady: i think it was yahoo? (well now we're getting somewhere) &gt;me: so you're looking to make a new email address then? &gt;lady: yeah, i forgot the password to my old one last year. &gt;me: maybe we can recover the password. do you remember the address? &gt;lady: i don't think so, oh wait... it might be $emailaddress &gt;me: do you remember the password? &gt;lady: no... but it could be $password. (both worked on the first try) &gt;me: enjoy your old email and write down the address and and password so you don't forget and that's the story of how if helped a woman make a new website by recovering her old email. hello, tfts. insert long time lurker first time poster here. i work for a company that contracts me as a work from home employee for a major isp. i had thought over my time at this job, i had seen it all. i should have known better. i will be me, customer will be cx. &gt;me: "thank you for calling (isp) wireless gateway support, my name is (me), how can i help you?" &gt;cx: "yes, i'm just calling in to complain that my internet service hasn't been working in several days, and i want this fixed now." &gt;me: "alright ma'am, i'll be glad to help with that. (insert qa points here including getting information for the account) okay, i'm showing that your service has been disconnected due to non-payment, with a past due amount of $xxx.xx(more than $800). would you like to be transferred to billing to get this fixed?" it was at this point i believe i heard a bomb go off on the phone as the customer starts screaming. &gt;cx: "past due amount?! i ain't never got no bill from you guys!" i see that she gets emailed bills, so i'm inclined to ask, &gt;me: "well, ma'am, are you not receiving the bills to your email?" &gt;cx: "yes but i am not paying it until you send me a paper bill! that's the law!!" it turns out the customer had not paid her bill in *four months* because she thought she didn't have to pay emailed bills. welcome to tech support. tl;dr customer decides that money is a fake concept and wants to pay her bill in yelling. edit: holy sh-! i went to bed expecting this to not be a big thing and it freaking blew up! thanks guys! also, some of you have seemed to nail down a possible employer, i'd ask that we keep that anonymous please. thanks!work for a mid-sized law firm with ~20 lawyers, most of which are average with technology at best. i had to install google earth for an insurance lawyer so that he could view the intersections of a car accident. after showing him the basics of it, he continues on his way and i don't hear from him. later on, as i'm walking past his office, i notice he still has earth open (hours later), but this time he is starring at a blank piece of land. he is also on the phone with a worried look on his face. he waves me inside and asks me why his house isn't on google earth? is it gone? i'm on the phone with my wife right now who is on her way home to make sure there hasn't been an explosion and our home is gone, he says. his house was built in the last year in a very rural area of our city. after explaining that the images he is seeing are not in real time and are, in fact, likely a year or more old he calms down and continues on.my brain is still recovering from this call i got about 30 minutes ago. i do contract it. a customer called to have a new user set up for e-mail on their phone. i configure the account and e-mail the credentials to their boss with some brief setup instructions. about 30 minutes later i get a call from the customer, explaining that the new employee is attempting to get e-mail working. they've already looked at what's on the screen, and everything appears correct to them. they're using the correct e-mail protocol. so now we move on to the password, and the customer passes the phone to the new employee. "oh hi, yeah i've tried to do this damn thing about 10 times and it just won't work. is there any way we can change my password to something shorter? when he showed it to me i was like 'wow, that's a long password!'" i usually set a 9-12 character random alphanumeric mixed case password, so i'm used to getting complaints, but it's just temporary. they can pick what they want after initial setup, and i never have to know how terrible of a password they chose. so after having them retype the password (very slowly) 3 times, and verifying it works from webmail, i start reading off letter-for-letter what the password should be, making sure letters are capitalized where necessary. we get to the end... "that's it? what about the rest?" "that's the whole password, what do you mean?" "well i've got more here, there's a space, then a bracket thing, and then a lowercase c, a, s...." at this point i realize what's happening. after the password i wrote (case sensitive) so they'd know that it matters. for some bizarre reason, this guy has no idea what this means, and has been typing (case sensitive) at the end of his password the whole time. after correcting that *minor* error, i'm happy to say his e-mail is now working on his phone.ffs. people are complete idiots. as a web designer, this is what i get 80% of the time - so you can do this for $100 right? anyways, today i had a potential call me and ask about web job he had and this is how it went. client: i am looking to build a website for my small company, i already have the logo and content i just need the website done. &lt;...here i gather the details...&gt; (after gathering details) me: this sounds like a plan, so as far as budget goes.. client: yes, so we were thinking $250 would be good? me: so you want me to spend about two weeks on a project, and get paid $250? client: well it is easy right so what is the problem? me: the problem is you are paying me $3.12/hr for estimated time. client: but web design is easy. me: then do it yourself. *click* ffs. tl;dr - web design is easy, therefore you should be paid $3/hr. **edit:** after this, i have reformatted my website, to include in the contact form *budget requirements*. before this i never did as to let them send details and negotiate. from now on though, i will see how this works out...of course the field is not a required field but lets see how it works out. **edit 2:** i paid myself $1.50 to get myself a drink after finishing the above task as it only took 30 minutes. i got ripped off $0.06 but hey, prices fluctuate.bg: user is an *almost* elderly woman. she had her pc upgraded recently. company uses xnview on a daily basis. it's being installed while making an image for new pc's sooo it's everywhere. **ring ring** &gt;$me: hello, it. &gt;$user: i can't seem to find xnview on my pc. &gt;$me: i am sure it is there. &gt;$user: it's not on my desktop. how do i find it than? &gt;$me: you need to search for it in the start menu. juxt press the start button and type "xn". &gt;$user: ok. start.... and.... oops! i shuted down the pc. i'm gonna call you back. click it has been 3 hours ago. i guess her new pc is just really slow.this phone call actually took ~27 minutes to determine what she was trying to do and what she was looking at. this is the abbreviated version. one magical day, i was the lucky recipient to answer this helpdesk call while working on this particular campus. *i set my beloved coffee down to answer the phone* &gt; client: hello. i need some help, the email server is down. &gt; me: one second, let me check on that. *monitoring never said anything about it being down....* *clickyclicky* &gt; me: well, it looks okay from here, and i just ran some tests against it. what exactly seems to be the problem? &gt; client: well i can't open my email program. outlook, i think it's called. &gt; me: oh, okay. do you get an error message when you click on it? &gt; client: well, it's not even there, the icon is gone. &gt; me: alright, no problem. let's get it back on your desktop from your start menu. &gt; client: is that the button in the corner? it looks like that is gone too! *cover me, i'm going in* &gt; me: okay, let me try to remote in. what's your asset tag number? &gt; client: [xxxxx] &gt; me: i can't get in, can you make sure your network is connected? there should be an icon that shows the 'x' in the tray by the clock. &gt; client: my screen is black, i can't see it. ...her screen isn't on. wait, is the computer on? &gt; me: can i have you check to see if your tower is turned on? do you see a green light? &gt; client: no, its not how it normally looks. i think it's supposed to be green or blue. the round turn on button isn't working. &gt; me: i know you guys have tight desks over there, can you make sure it's plugged in to the wall? &gt; client: hold on a second, let me get a flashlight, it's really dark under my desk. *muffled noises* &gt; client: ugh, it's so dark in here when the power is out.i get a call from a user asking me to reset her password. no problem. i just need to confirm it's in fact her, so call up the security question. "where did you meet [man's name]?" "ann arbor, michigan." "that's not the answer we have on file, ma'am." "that is where i met him." "your hint is `somewhere hot', ma'am." "oh, yeah, i forgot i changed it. after i divorced him, i made the answer *hell*, didn't i?" "yes, you did, ma'am. i'll reset your password now."my mum, who manages a client management system, was once having a problem with her laptop, which didn't want to log on to the domain. even though she's not *too* tech savvy, she had the brains to take it to their in-office tech support guys to diagnose the problem. part of fixing this problem involved disconnecting the laptop from the network. so instead of hitting the physical wifi switch on the side of the machine, the tech guy *carried the laptop outside of the office and down the road until it lost wifi reception.* ***he carried the laptop outside of the office and down the road until it lost wifi reception.***background: i work as an internal helpdesk technician in the corporate offices of a us-based chain of big-box stores. another day, another round of users. this morning starts with a fairly generic ticket to fix some printer settings after a store mucked it up. fixed the printer, but now i need the store to restart it. commence calling the store in 3... 2... 1... &gt; *ring... ring... ring...* now, where the stores are concerned, policy states that it comes first. if someone from it is calling, you pick up the phone because either something is broken or they're giving you updates on something else that was broken; either way, it still affects your bottom line. four minutes of ringing go by... no one has yet picked up the phone. what is a lowly tech supposed to do? whelp, let's see what they're up to. while the phone is still ringing, i've pulled up their security cameras and logged in. we're now at six minutes of ringing. &gt; *ring... ring... ring...* there's a man standing next to the obviously ringing phone on one of the manager computers. judging by his shirt, he's definitely a manager. as i'm watching on the cameras, he turns and looks at the ringing phone (which has caller id, so he can see it's me that's calling) and goes back to his computer. this cannot stand. so i remote into his computer. he's writing an email - it's a very non-important email. one click later and his mouse and keyboard stop taking input. a sly grin slowly stretches across my face as he quickly spirals into despair that he can't type his email. he doesn't take frustration well - grabbing the mouse and slamming it onto the counter, hitting the keyboard... it was actually like watching a toddler. &gt; *open notepad* &gt; "please pick up the phone." &gt; *ring... ring...* hello? tl;dr: i don't know who you are. i don't know what you want. if you are looking for peace and quiet, i can tell you i don't have any. but what i do have are a very particular set of skills, skills i have acquired over a very long career. skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. if you pick up the phone now, that'll be the end of it. i will not look for you, i will not pursue you. but if you don't, i will look for you, i will find you, and i will call you. again. --- previous tales on tfts: [it's a christmas miracle!]( [those guys are worthless. absolutely worthless.](i'm new to this sub so i'm sure there are dumber customers than this, but so far i haven't heard anyone worse. this happened a long time ago so hopefully i can recreate the conversation appropriately. &gt; **customer:** my tv signal isn't working, it just went out. &gt; **me:** oh, i'm sorry to hear that sir. i'll get that working for you as soon as possible. so you said you were watching tv and it just stopped working? &gt; **customer:** well it was working earlier. i just turned on the tv right now and there's no picture. no sound either. &gt; **me:** okay. so on the screen are you getting any message like "no input" or "source not found"? &gt; **customer:** nope. i still see the channel numbers and guide but every channel is blank. &gt; **me:** hmm, okay. i'm looking through your account right now and i see you had an installation scheduled for today. did you make sure the tv and everything were working before the installer left? &gt; **customer:** oh, the guy's still here. he's out back installing my service. &gt; **me:** (very, very, very, very long pause) the installer is still outside? so he hasn't hooked up anything inside your home yet? &gt; **customer:** nah, he's trying to run a line right now. &gt; **me:** (another long pause) so you had a different cable service already and we're installing a different one? &gt; **customer:** that's right. &gt; **me:** (sigh, on mute of course) i apologize for the confusion and inconvenience sir but your other cable service will be down until we finish then installation. i assure you you're tv service will be working when we're finished installing it. (exact phrasing) &gt; **customer:** oh, okay. sounds good. thanks for your time.at the shop. it was 22:00, and i was hungry for mcdonalds, (mmm big mac) and sleep. i got a text from the boss. "close up, mate. - boss" so, i do the usual routine. lock the door, turn off the light when... a knock. a loud knock. i turn around, expecting the police to be there. instead a man looking in his fifties was waving at me. i open the door. &gt; "sir, we are closed. please come back tomorrow" &gt; "i, err.. need something now." &gt; "sir, this is closed now. please leave." &gt; "do you have netflix?" &gt; "yes, sir, i do. i can help you purchase it tomorrow, we open at 5:30." &gt; "i don't care! do you have it on dvd?" &gt; "uhhh, no. it is online..." &gt; "ohhh, kk. bye then." i close the shop. turn off the lights, head toward the employee room. the phone rings. &gt; "this is an automated recording to announce a change in your clock system." i hang up. i know that the server provider is doing this, i know about the change allready. walking out the door, and locking it, i find the man staring at me, muttering "netfliiix" to himself over and over. weird.i work as the sole it guy at a resort. i just got a call from someone in our restaurant. &gt;user: we are having trouble with $software. when we try to post a check it tells use there is not enough disk space. &gt;me: can you read the exact error message to me, word for word? &gt;user: no. it just says "unable to post file, not enough disk space. call $vendor". &gt;me: is that what it said, word for word? &gt;user: yes. .... ok, i guess i will call $vendor and give them that error message.few years back my team was migrating about 250 users to a new build. in preparation we'd asked each users to label all their computer equipement so the movers would know which offices to move stuff to. the night before the move, i did a walkthrought and found this note attached to one of the screens. &gt;it, please don't forget to setup google at the new office. i can't do my job without it. i added a small message in reply &gt;i will personally see to it that "google" is there. afterward i got a email from the user thanking me for looking out. **me:** good morning sir, just a quick call about the phone you've sent in for repair. the problem is that it's using too much data? **customer:** yes, i got a huge bill so they told me to send it for repair. theres no way i used as much as i was charged for! **me:** riiiiiight, you see, this isn't really the sort of thing that *can* be caused by your phone going faulty... did you check your phones data usage in the settings? it's showing that youtube has been used lots on the phone, almost 9gb over the last month. do you use that app much? **customer:** no! i've never even been on that app! **me:** sir, is there anybody *apart* from you who uses the phone? children, maybe? **customer:** no, my kids are good! they don't run me bill up like this! can't you see what's caused this? **me:** ok... the phone can give me quite a detailed overview of how it's been used. it's shown youtube has used 9gb in the foreground. that means it's been used when the screen has been on and you've been looking at that app... **customer:** that's out of the question, i never use youtube! **me:** annnnnd if i go into the youtube app, i can view the search history, and *somebody* has been searching for peppa pig, horrid henry, and a whole load of other kids shows. now, are you *sure* that your kids haven't been using the phone?another quick story from my time working at my university's main computer lab. an old lady came up to my desk and told me her "monitor was low on ink". i walked over and her monitors brightness was turned all the way down. i turned the brightness up and she said "oh, you young men are so smart." then she gave me some candy. she was nice.university department has there data on a usb disk plugged into a desktop. shared to the employees... (yes... i know what you are thinking). i have been warning for years about this. they get a new director... the usb disk is starting to fail (disconnects and requires it to be unplugged here and there). i told her it is time to pay for a network share (our university charges for services which is why no one uses them). she agrees... i take the failing usb disk which was around 150 gig of junk. i put it on a temporary server. i create an official network share for them and give them both links. me: "please move your important data from the temp directory to the official one. leave what you don't care about.. this temp server is get wiped in about a month). usb disk gets wiped and destroyed. forward a year. they want something from the temp directory they have not even touched in a year. me: i am sorry that server is long gong as of about about a month ago (which means it has been up for 9-10 months). since i took there usb disk i must have their data and they are pissed at me even though i warned them about it several times. my fault. of course. edit: the usb disk was destroyed because it was failing and we destroy stuff that we no longer need. it is protocol. we have a big hard drive eater and we use it. great discussiona request came in on friday last week that 2 computer room's equipment needed swapping urgently. they are swapped at great speed with our amazing team pulling a massive effort and the important room is ready to go at the end of the day. we are told the non important room will have new occupants friday this week so we are inaging them today. this is where the person who is in the important room decides, without warning, that they must now use both rooms this week. even though it was agreed the non important room is out of action until friday. they went strait to our line manager and put in a complaint that the room was out of action. all i can say here is that i'm really glad we have a fully traceable helpdesk system. i spent 5 minutes with my line manager showing them the requests and agreements. all i am left with at the end of this is annoyance at the person who complained. they knew what was going on and how long it would take so could only have been trying to make us look bad. i just don't understand.several years ago, i was helping a client set up and install new workstations as the old ones were obsolete and in dire need of an upgrade. it was my very first job and i was expected to answer basic support questions when i met with the user and swapped out their old pc for a brand spanking new one. i was in the middle of hooking up the monitor when another user approached me regarding an odd e-mail he and his coworkers had received only minutes ago. this is pretty much what it looked like: &gt;important!! &gt;please do not shut down your computer today as it will not boot back up again if you do. &gt;/ it it so happened to be april 1 and neither i or my coworkers had heard anything about this. since there was very little information in the email, everyone naturally thought it was a joke, but then people around us started to yell how their computers actually would not boot! oops! turns out the antivirus software had received an update over the night which caused it to flag some system files as malicious and then removed them. it was fixed later the same day, but i can't help but feel that more workstations could have been saved if they had only been more informative or bothered to write "this is not a joke" somewhere in the initial email.i am just a humble mostly-tech-illiterate end-user (operations manager at a bank). i read your tales from time to time; it helps me feel better about myself - "at least i'm not that bad". anyway, reading your posts has helped me communicate better with my it department. i used to be super-intimidated communicating with it folks. sometimes i would just live with issues rather than try and resolve them. i actually went 2 or 3 months with a wonky mouse because i figured it was easier than dealing with the help desk. after a month or two of reading this subreddit, i started to become more comfortable submitting help desk tickets. first, i never call, i always submit a ticket. second, i always try re-booting first. third, i don't try to diagnose the problem myself, i just state clearly what the issue is, never just saying "it just doesn't work". if there is an error message, i screen-shot it or repeat it verbatim. lastly, and perhaps most importantly, i never pretend to know more than i do. if i don't understand something, i say so. you guys (most of you) have made it clear that you don't expect us to know your job, just like we don't expect you to know ours. you just expect us to be reasonable, clear, and polite. which is exactly what we expect from you. anyway, sorry if this post doesn't belong here. it's just that i had another pleasant experience with my help desk and felt like saying "thank you!" to all of you. have a nice day!so i'm not the best story-teller but this happened last week. i support all our organization's human resources and payroll applications and for some reason the cafeteria credit card machines fall under 'payroll' so naturally i have to troubleshoot four touch screen network machines that ring up tuna-salad sandwiches from time to time. last week we get a call from the 'supervisor of employee food services' and she is frantic. she tell us that the "entire system is down and no one can use the checkout machines." we ask her to reboot the machines and she told us that she "already tried that and everyone he is trying to eat and if you don't hurry everyone is going to starve." okay. so we call the network guys and they assure is that the application is live on the network and is responding. we go down to check the hardware and everything works except right when you press the 'checkout' button. we try using a mouse, we try different ethernet cables, we check the permissions for the machines. nothing. at&amp;t services our network so we ask them to come down and take a look. they are outside the building, on the roof, under the building making sure that everything is wired correctly. we can't figure it out. we have multiple meetings with different it managers trying to troubleshoot this system. one meeting in particular is pushing three hours to come up with a solution for the rest of week (card readers and pen and paper) when the phone rings. its the supervisor from the cafeteria, "hey sorry for the trouble. we figured it out." *long silence* "we forgot to pay the application license bill this month."some days. email from a user: "the copier in [room] isn't working. there's an error light on it." well, heck, that's on the way to the coffee pot, might as well check it out. walk to the printer. there's an error message on the screen: [process] failed, please press button for restart. the error message is next to a big red button. i pressed the button. the copier restarted. the waiting crowd was astounded. **tl;dr: only 4.5 hours until i can drink.** edit: i spel gud. so this tale starts with an irate customer and ends with confusion which i guess could be said of most tech issues. so to go back, a pissed off client of ours calls and explains he is having trouble with an area of our website that he is accessing via his imac. ok. we go through all the usual fixes and still the client is unable to access it. he gets more pissed off. we have a test machine in the office and we try to recreate the issue but cannot. which irriates him even more so we ask him to send us a screenshot so we can see it and verify 1) this guy is actually following our instructions 2) he is actually having the issue as he describes. at this point both the client and us are pissed at the situation and the client reluctantly agrees to send us a screenshot. me: "sir since we can't recreate the issue on our end, i'm going to ask you to send us a screenshot of the screen which you're having problems with. can you do that for us?" client" "*sigh* yes, fine. i'll send you a screenshot" me: "do you need me to walk you through the process?" client: "hardly...." so we wait for the screenshot and it doesn't show up. a couple of days later i receive a piece of mail which i open and after a minute of confusion break into laughter the client's "screenshot" that he sent consisted of a hand-drawn representation of what he was seeing on his screen. he even doodled in the desktop icons(i typed this before remembering i had the screenshot- sorry about the confusion) and wrote me a message outlining the situation. he had used a ruler to draw the borders of the screen.....needless to say i had to call him back to walk him through the process but goddamn it i've never laughed so hard in my life. not to mention the fact that he had to pay for a stamp to mail it to us... *edit** adding screenshot *edit2* holy smoke front page? that's pretty cool. *edit3* gold!? thank you!we have a location with a terrible infrastructure. all the desktops are xp on terrible wifi adapters to get them to the network. i got a call from a user that "your guy must not have set the printer up right." teamviewer wasn't working so we figured out how to make sure he was connected to the internet. a bit of struggle later and i'm actually in. i looked at the printer and it had a bunch of items stuck in queue. i found the ip address and went to the web interface. bam - giant error warning: put ltr in drawer 1. i told the user: "looks like it's out of paper." user: "it printed fine this morning!!" me: "which is why it's now out of paper..." user: "it's all the way upstairs!!" me: "you see this error on the screen right? put letter in drawer 1? i really think we need to start there before trying any more troubleshooting" user: "ugh - fine! i guess i'll call you back when that doesn't work" me: &lt;stays connected to the remote system to smugly watch the queue clear out a moment later&gt; this happens more frequently then i'd like to admit: &gt;me: "that you for calling tech support, can i have the phone number for your account please?" &gt;cx(customer): my what? &gt;me: your phone number please &gt;cx: my phone number? (obvious confusion in voice) you mean for my account? &gt;me: yes, please &gt;cx: is it on my bill? &gt;me: it should be yes &gt;cx: ok, -talking to self while reading bill- phone number, phone number, is it -16 digit account number- &gt;me: -sighing to self and bringing account up- .....awesome thx... how do these people who call in not know what a "phone number" is, i can understand if you don't remember your own number because who ever calls themself, but seriously these people give the impression of not even know what a phone is let alone how the buttons on the front of it work. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ alternative ending: &gt;me: can you have your number please &gt;cx: -gives 7 digit number- &gt;me : and the area code aswell please? &gt;cx: -gives mailing code- &gt;me: no the area code for your phone number, &gt;cx: isn't it -mailing code- &gt;me: no, like -gives most common 3 digit phone area codes- &gt;cx: oh! it's -you get the idea if you've read this far- tl:dr forks will not help you relate with your customers better, no matter how many times you stab your brain with it. edit:spelling isn't important it's a phone conversation it all sounds monotone anyway (aka: i fixed stuff )my grandmother called me at work to day to tell me: &gt;"my don't touch has a 9 on it" [this is the screen shot i got her to send me]( i intentionally created "don't touch" for all the standard ipad apps that she found confusing (stock market, newsstand, itunes, etc....) turns out she dragged one of her slot machine games in there and it's been accumulating notifications for a few days. not really much of a tech support problem but it was pretty funny when she called me and said "my don't touch has a 9 on it" i'm proud of her. she didn't touch it! sorry for any formatting errors. i am a long time lurker, and had to create an account to share this with you. second day of work, and was receiving an error message. for this story, it is important to note our i.t. guys are in the same office, and their "pod" is about 10 feet away from my desk. me: "hey paul ( i.t. guru) i'm receiving this error message. i tried to restart my computer, and got the same message. i tried googling it, but still don't understand what its asking me. how do i enter a ticket for your queue?" paul: "if you've done both of those things, you don't enter a ticket into the queue. i will work on it right now. by the way, i think i like you." off to a good relationship, i think!!so this mother &amp; high school daughter just came in my shop. daughter had been working on a 24 page document for the past few weeks, it's due in 2 days. she had it saved in four parts, different files, but now 3 of the files are empty. word reports 0 words in the file. the only file that has anything is the first one which is 8 pages. to me it looked like a blank file had been saved overwriting the orig file. no, she says, just no. it's b/c her brother was playing a game on it. i said, "show me how you opened the file". she goes to a search box, types in microsoft word, opens it, clicks file/save as and selects her 8 page document. i said "wait, you're about to..." - "i know what i'm doing, ok!!", replace all contents, yes i'm sure, then she says "see!!! this stupid computer is erasing my work" i went back through it with her. "see that blank document you have open? well, you are overwriting your files with it when you are using save as." "well how do i open my fiiiiillleeessss then?!?!?!?!", "click open", i respond. see that part where it says replace all contents? that's what it means. she left crying.just a bit of fluff for a chuckle: i get in the earliest, i get an hour or so before most staff are in, even the helpdesk, so the occasional call filters through. so i get one this morning, before i even normally get in, and it's from a remote depot user: **depot user:** "oh houston, the whole erp system is down, how long do you think before it's back up?" **me:** "i don't think it's down (i've receive no alerts) how many people are reporting that there is a drama?" **depot user:** "everyone is down, no one can log in" **me :** "shit, right, how many users are there at the moment" **depot user:** "well it's just me at the moment...." *sigh* **technically** all users are down, 1 of 1 is still 100%. ha ha turned out to be a password change she had ignored all week.first post, so please be gentle! i work for a large pc manufacturer, doing technical support on contracts for business customers, and the occasional end user, and all of the systems that i support are business class. last week i spoke to a customer out of pa who spoke exactly like rocky balboa. he starts by telling me that his monitor on his laptop won't change brightness. after more coaxing more info from him, it sounds like he recently reinstalled windows. sounds like a driver issue with the hotkeys. i start to direct him to download the drivers, and ask which version of windows he's running. windows 7 home basic. now none of our business class pcs come with that. in fact, we offer professional on every one. remember, he's got the *rocky voice*... &gt; **theopholus**: sir, where did you get this copy of home basic? did your company require it for some reason? or maybe school? how did this happen? &gt; **rocky**: yeah, well uh, i got it and installed it myself. &gt; **theopholus**: why didn't you just use the version that came with the system, windows 7 professional? &gt; **rocky**: 'cause i use it at home. it's hard to argue with that logic. at least it was just a driver, and we got it installed and working. for refference, my flair is"how should i know if it's plugged in? im not an engineer!!!". story: it started when someone said that their keyboard wasnt workin, so i checked it out. when i arrived, their keyboard was already disconnected and waiting for me to take it, so i brought it to my area where i plugged it in and smashed my face on it a few times (not realy), i noticed that it was working, so i brought it back and asked if it was plugged in before i took it. the answer i was met with was "how should i know if it's plugged in? im not an engineer!!!". **edit: holy upvote batman! 1124 upvotes in 1 day!!** update: user claims keyboard is still broken after showing that it workshad an elderly man (roughly 85 years old) come in and say his all-in-one isn't turning on all the way. i turn it on, device posts, then says "no bootable device found." at this point, i'm thinking, the hard drive is corrupted, failed, etc. proceed to open it up to pull the hard drive to check the condition and check the possibility to retrieving data. when i finally get the thing opened, i understood why it was not detecting a boot device. there literally was no hard drive in the all-in-one.... trying to explain what the hard drive does to an 85 year old man has proven to be difficult. (question: in what scenario would an 85 year old man somehow just randomly lose his all-in-one hard drive one day? the device was not easy to open)fateful short tale from this morning: user calls up blowing up that she can't search for files on the server. &gt; "see i go into the folder where i save them and they are all there, but when i search only one shows up." this person has invoices going back about two years in this folder. &gt; user procedes to type in "invoice" &gt; 1 file appears "invoice sheat yyymmdd.docx" i check back to the folder location - every single document had been spelt invioce sheet yyyymmdd apart from the one file where invoice was spelt correctly and sheet was spelt wrong. back to the vnc session and i type in "invioce" and hundreds of documents appear in the search window &gt; "...... um ....... i'm really really sorry for wasting your time.... thanks *click*" wednesday's hey.i was working graveyards, about a decade ago, doing wireless networking support for a major pc manufacturer. i get this call at about 2am. it's a woman, fairly young (early 20s maybe), and she can't get on the internet. she is getting connected to her router wired and wirelessly, but no internet. i walk her through some standard steps, but the router is still acting kind of funky, plus i think she had comcast (we had a lot of trouble with them). finally, in the troubleshooting steps, we get to the point where doing a manual reset on her router is the next best step before just replacing it. so i told her to pick it up, turn it around, find that small, recessed button on the back left, and use a pen to press and hold that for 10 seconds. after a brief silence, she asks, "where is this hole again?" "on the back of your &lt;brand&gt; router, where you plug the cables in, it's on the far left." "hmm, i don't see it back here..." i'd done this many, many times before, and i knew the mistakes customers usually made, so i said, "move your left thumb, you have it over the hole." "oh!...i'll be right back." the phone click-clacks as it hits the desk, and the pattering of feet walking off in the distance can be heard. about 30 seconds later, the footsteps are back and getting closer. then she picks the phone up again. she says, "ok whew, i'm ready now. i just had to put a robe on, i didn't know you had cameras on these things. sorry for the free show."working as tech support for a large company with many remote workers. one of the reps called with problems with his broadband. we had sent him a new preconfigured router which he should have been able to plug in and go. he called after not being able to get a connection, we go through all the usual diagnostics and reach the point where i need to ring the broadband supplier. (uk telco, begins with v, can't spell phone) we join our hero on the second call after all diagnostics have been done by the first call and all that was needed was a appointment for bt to come out and check the line. cs = customer service rep &gt; devish : so can we organise bt to come out then please? &gt; cs: i just need to check a few details please, what is the username and password you are using to access the router. &gt; dervish: currently it's set to admin and admin, that's not the problem, we can access that page, the adsl light is on solid so it has a synced, the problem is happening when we give the users credentials, which we know to be correct &gt;cs: ok, i just need to check a few more things, what address are you going to to access the router? &gt; dervish: currently connecting to it on 192.168.0.1 &gt; cs : i'm just going to ping the router to check it's online. at this point the call has been going on for 20 minutes, i figure it's best just to let him get on with it. &gt; cs: ok, i've pinged the router at 192.168.0.1 and it's responded to the pings so we know the router is online. ??? &gt;dervish: sorry, did you just say you pinged the 192 address? from your computer? &gt;cs: yes, and it responded so we know the router is online, it must be some other problem. &gt;dervish: so you pinged 192.168.0.1 from your computer and got a response. are you sure that that is the customers router? &gt;cs: oh yes, there was a bit of a lag but the router is definitely there. at this point there were a few incredulous questions to determine if i really was hearing him correctly, yes i really was, he did think that pinging 192 from his computer would somehow find the customers modem. i then decided that i couldn't cope with any more diagnostics and arranged the bt visit and got off the phone quick. one of the many stories from my time as a level 1 and 2 tech support for the education department. here is one with me and a female primary school teacher **teacher**: [*almost in tears, hyperventilating*] help me please! **me**: what can i do for you? **teacher**: well one of my kids was being naughty so i threatened to put him in the naughty corner. he then threatened that he would hack my computer, and he bloody has! **me**: what do you mean by hacking? **teacher**: he's broken the computer and given it all viruses! he's refusing to tell me what he did. [after managing to get a word in, i remoted into the computer, turns out the kid had inverted the colours and changed the language] ...smart kid. today at the helpdesk i was helping get an old professor set up on his new computer after a complete data transfer. he opened it up, logged on, and immediately brought up finder and started frantically searching for a file. i noticed he was holding his breath. then, he located a particular video, and let it out with a long sigh, pressing "play" and entering full screen. it was an old woman wired up to a host of machines, breathing heavily, looking right at the camera. the professor turned to me and said "this is the only file i wanted. it's my last conversation with my wife before she passed away from cancer." after he left i had to take a few minutes to compose myself. gosh. edit: wow! i didn't expect this response at all. i'm glad you all like happy stories :) i think that everyone who works tech support agrees that it's what keeps us going :) if anyone wants to read something from the complete opposite end of the spectrum, i also just wrote this up: [linky.]( /shamelessselfpromotioni do tech support for my father's business. he has a single windows server which hosts his databases, file and print shares. there was a big electrical storm the previous night and he shut it down during the storm to make sure it was safe. the next day he turned it back on again. he called me at work to explain that he couldn't access his server after it was turned back on. so he held the power button down for 5 seconds until it powered off, turned it on again, waited and still couldn't access the server. he did this 5 times before calling me. i was audibly annoyed by this point, and explained that his server isn't like a dvd player. you can't just yank the power from it for the fun of it. i opened team viewer and could see their server in my list. i connected to it, and despite the abuse it has been through, it seemed to be working. he said he still couldn't access the file shares despite this, so i connected to his laptop. sure enough, he couldn't. i looked at his wireless adapter, and he was tethered to his mobile phone... wasn't even connected to the right wifi network. to make things worse, there's two other computers in the room and they were working just fine. he killed the power to the business server 5 times, because he was connected to the wrong network. argh!you don't know you don't have a computer? yesterday..i sold a monitor, keyboard + mouse, and speakers to a guy. figured he would go home and hook it up to his computer no problem..i get a call this morning, 7:30 a.m., guy is telling me he can't hook up the mouse or keyboard to anything. i tell him keep looking, usb is a universal application and there will be a port. he insists there is nothing, so i end up going to his house to see what the problem is. i look at the stuff i sold him, look for the computer to hook it up to, and soon realize what the problem is........the guy doesn't have a computer. anyways, explained it to him in the most respectful manner possible, and ended up selling him a dirt cheap desktop. gave him a really good deal because honestly..i felt a little bad. yesterday i got a work order from corporate, telling me to call a store and tell them they are doing their invoices wrong. the problem? apparently someone in the store didn't know how to post invoices and was deleting them instead. then called us to complain because their invoices were disappearing.the case had been sent up to corporate to investigate since l2 didn't see any obvious problems either. so i call the store, and let them know what corporate had found. the person on the other line was the one that handles the invoices, and she swore she didn't delete anything. i remote into the server, and there's an invoice waiting there to be posted. i ask the user to post it, so i can see what the issue may be. she hit the d key. the key that, on this page, is the shortcut for delete. she thought it was short for display(it clearly says on the page (d) delete). i had to work hard to keep myself from laughing while i was wrapping up the call. but i did have a good laugh when i hung up. first time at this subreddit, i will definitely have to share what happened today. all begins with the most ambiguous email title for an issue: "subject: fix server asap please fix server " so i called this user, i asked him to be more specific in what was happening, he told me that his applications were not working properly in his iis server, there was a poor performance making everything partial down, and then as he wasn’t the developer he transfer me to this guy… the star of this story. the first time i was talking with this guy he didn’t even say hi, or good morning…the first words i heard from him was: &gt;user: listen dude, let’s make this quickly, just sent someone to put more ram in this server, with the time our applications got bigger and heavier, we require more memory, because we need everything that’s running right now, if you provide more ram this will disappear, its simple logic, you get it? &gt;deycko: sounds fair, but first i have to take a look and make that decision by my own. &gt;user: dude, i just gave you the reason, if you install the ram everything is going to be ok. you say you got it. &gt;deycko: according to system, the last time that server was shuttled down was 1 year ago, so probably we will have to restart the server and see how it goes after that… your applications are not accessible and are currently down so there is no risk or impact in here. &gt;user: oh no no no, dude, no… what’s wrong with you? that’s your solution? if restarting is your solution, i will better call my son, and after that your damn manager. you cannot be serious, i refuse to do such thing, you have no right to say there is no impact, you don’t know nothing. at this point i was getting upset, but i’m not the kind of guy that shows his anger that easy, actually i become more nicely, probably in a sarcastic mode, but nicely. &gt;deycko: all right sir, i will show you why a restart it’s needed, i will connect to your server remotely and…(interrumption) &gt;user: no, you cannot access to my server, that’s my server, it has a password that i only know and there is no way i can give you that password. &gt;deycko: no problem sir, if you are using the corporate intranet i don’t need your credentials. &gt;user: but… just after i was logging into that server i noticed something weird in the task bar, there was a process running that was consuming almost 70% of the memory, and that process was, prepare yourselves: **gta vice city** …so this douche bag, wanted more ram to play videogames in one of the servers of the company, he was about to beat the game (as i also played it in the past) and it was frozen when he was trying to save his progress apparently, so that was maybe the reason he was not ok with performing a restart of the server. i was shocked, this dude was so rude at me because he was playing a game and got freeze. deycko: dude, are you playing gta vice city? **user goes offline** ---------------------------------------- **edit**: of course i sent an email to his "damn" manager, i told him that his applications were down because his employee was using the server to play videogames and also he was being rude about it. i don't have any response yet. i will keep you guys posted. **edit 2**: i got answer from his manager: "you can be sure we will take this very serious, this is totally against our company values, and we are going to take the necessary actions. thanks for your quick response in our issue." i work in i.t, and volunteer once a week at a seniors home, teaching basic computer skills but mostly troubleshoot their problems. there's a woman that has been coming down for almost a year. she knows, what i call, the "seniors basics". google search, youtube and email. one day she comes to me and tells me "i accidentally deleted bejeweled". i laugh slightly and tell her, "oh don't worry, you probably just deleted the shortcut i left on your desktop". she goes, "no no, i deleted it from the add/remove programs list". now at this point there was both fury and joy in my eyes. i scream out "who the hell taught you how to delete programs! it sure as hell wasn't me!! i am both mad, and impressed, doreen!". she is 87 yrs old. she always has dinner ready for me when i get there. if your helpdesk job is mundane, volunteer with seniors, and teach them. it'll change your life.the other day i had a gram come in with a gps it went like this. *gram walks in* &gt;gram: my cable won't work in my gps. i look at the cable, look at the port. &gt;me: this is the wrong cable. &gt;gram: no, i've been using this cable since i bought it, it came with it. *thinks to self, ok still not the right cable.* i look at the port on the gps, look at the usb end. two different sizes. i walk to my desk grab a cable and show her. &gt;me: the cable you have isn't the proper size. if you look here at my cable (usb micro)it fits right in. if you look at your cable (usb mini) it doesn't fit. you supplied a usb mini, but the cable needs to be usb micro. she looks at me as if i'm full of crap. i show her my cable slide in and out where as hers won't fit. &gt;me: you can go to *major retail store* and buy a proper cable. still don't know why she didn't look and see the obvious size difference.after recovery from my stroke i was in desperate need of work. so desperate i took an overnight shift at an webhost for tech support. most nights it was pretty calm and people that called on my shift were usually just looking for more help with their website than just trouble shooting, but night staff had the time and it helped break up the monotony of the shift. occasionally i would get gems like this. &amp;nbsp; i get a call and the guy is frantic on the phone. after finally getting him to confirm his username and password i ask which website of his is down. i type the url into my web browser and surprise i get his website no issues. next i vpn to my home computer and pull it up there no issue again this is where we get into basic pc troubleshooting (reminder this guy is losing $1k/hr because his website is "down") &amp;nbsp; it is at this point that we get into basic pc troubleshooting and the following transpired. me: okay are you using a mac or pc cus: pc me: can you click on the start menu and type in cmd cus: i cannot the screen is black me: *deep breath* is there a light on the front of your monitor and or your tower cus: no me: *deeper breath* is the cable plugged into the back of the device, and can you trace that cable back to make sure it is plugged into the wall. if you have a power strip can you see if it is in the on position cus: *rustling* i think it is, but cannot quite tell me: what do you mean you cannot tell? cus: i can't tell it is dark me: dark?!? can you turn on a light cus: i could get a flashlight, but there is no power me: *head desk* i assure you sir your website is up you can check it again when you have power back &amp;nbsp; tl:dr; someone making "~$1k/hr" from his website was unable to tell the difference between him being out of power and his website being down... &amp;nbsp; edit: formatting second edit: rip inbox thanks for all the replies stories very entertaining!i work in several small offices with a consulting firm. there are no shortages of stories, but here's a quick one that happened recently. following a recent sale, mr. sales sent an e-mail to a couple customers with some remaining stock. attached is a .zip file said to contain photos from the items that must be sold. our short story starts, already in progress: &gt;sales: are you in the office today? &gt;it: yes (i'm two doors down from him) &gt;sales: could you come over here for a minute? &gt;it: sure... i walk over... &gt;sales: hr says i just sent the network drive to the buyers from the sale! &gt;it: let's take a look... &gt;sales: maybe i'll just forward it to you instead... i go back to my desk and wait. as a small business, hr is included in the customer service e-mail address, along with accounting, marketing, and a couple dedicated customer service people. eventually, as he comes and goes a couple of times, the e-mail comes in. it's a normal .zip file with several photos. we walk downstairs to try to see what hr was concerned about. &gt;hr: see? the entire network drive can be accessed straight from this e-mail! she had the .zip file open and was clicking on the network drive directly from the explorer sidebar. we've been on windows 7 for three years now! almost gave sales a heart attack, but at least we got a mildly interesting story out of it!first time posting yey. on mobile so forgive formatting. i just had a user call wondering why he couldn't back up his outlook file to his external hard drive. the file was 4.11gb and he had 107gb free. i'm still fairly new to it so i am stumped. i ask him to read the error to me exactly. "the file is too large for destination file system." file system? wait a minute... i am reminded of a joke from /r/programmerhumor... "yo mama is so fat she can't save files larger than 4gb!" i then direct the user on how to check which file system his drive is using. sure enough... it's fat32 and not ntfs! so he can't do anything but reduce the file size or save it somewhere else, and i let him know. :) thanks reddit! :di work as a level-1 helpdesk support person for a very large company, mostly taking internal-employee calls, and today, this happened. &gt;me: thanks for calling $company, krozard speaking. (insert script/opening stuff here), how can i help you today? &gt;user (u): yeah i can't get into my $program, as soon as i launch it, i get a message that says something about a file that's hiding or something &gt;me: can you please read me the error message exactly as it appears? &gt;u: well...i wouldn't really call it an error message, because it's still on my screen &gt;me: (trying to figure out the logic behind that) well...can you read me what the message on your screen says? &gt;u: &lt;exasperated tone&gt; i _told_ you, it says the file is hiding or something &gt;me: can you please send me a screenshot of the error mess- &gt;u: it's not an error, because it's still on my screen! &gt;me: can you send me a screenshot of the message on your screen? &gt;u: sure! &lt;proceeds to send a screenshot flawlessly, without the need for instructions of any kind&gt; it was a very easy fix that simply involved re-logging into the network.. oh, and on the screenshot, it said "error: file not found, please check your network path." it's calls like these i wish i could be sarcastic as hell...the error message said error in it, but it's not an error because it was...on her screen.../facedeskquick e-mail that just came in: &gt;hello, could we have laptops with 4-6gb ram and new win7 64bits build on them, ideally for noon today. ;) sorry for the last-minute request. it is currently 10:30am. *-blinks-* **edit: my team leader kindly told him to fuck off and use a vm instead.... hours later way past noon.**i did it support for two years before moving onto a software engineer role and i can say the level of incompetence was astounding but this was by far the best story i have. one day me and my fellow it team were chilling in our office, waiting for the day to be over, when our manager gets a phone call. our boss fuming over how someone stole his hdd, generally we never get a call from the boss so we all take this very seriously. me and my manager along with another tech leave to check out the situation. upon entering the office we find our boss using his computer, i'm a bit hesitant so i let my manager do the talking. he asks what computer had the hdd stolen, as it obviously couldn't be the one he's using but our boss was adamant it was. he asks us to come look at the computer and points to a hole on the tower, an empty bay where a cd-rom should be, and starts fuming about how his hdd is completely gone. i get red in the face and the other tech is pointing at the obviously working computer. our manager explains what he's missing and how his computer does in fact have a hdd, the boss is completely dumbfounded by this revelation. he calmly sits back down, and this is where he tries to save face, states it was a test to see how responsive we were and how we could leave the office now. that's when i knew it support that directly dealt with customers wasn't for me.i don't work in it, but i'm the only tech savvy person in the department. i came out of a long appointment and one of the admin staff came running up to me saying that her monitor has gone weird. it turned 90 degrees, and she tried to turn the monitor to compensate, but still had to crick her neck at 45 degrees for about an hour waiting for me to come out. i pressed the shortcut to get the screen to rotate back to normal. she looks gobsmacked. but at least i saved her neck. knowing her, she could have been like that all day!a quick story that happened today, this is my second day of my first it job. serving a local high-school, 600+ users, 200+ computers, you get the idea. i was minding my own business, patching in the new office space, when a my work phone called. **user** &gt; "i can't teach like this, nothings working, the screen is black. i need you here now!" **xnikxx** &gt;"sir, what room are you located in?" **user** &gt; "room 34, i need you here now!" **xnikxx** &gt; "and are you talking about the smartboard or the monitor for your pc?" at this point the user hung up, i begrudgingly made my way to the room. by the time (a couple of minutes max) i'd got there, this user had called 4-5 times, each time telling me to hurry up. i walked into the room, saw the board was working just fine, and observed the monitor (which was being mirrored by the smartboard, mind you) had not jug lead connected. at this point the user was already agitated and i didn't really want to make him seem incompetent in front of his class. **xnikxx** &gt; "when did you first notice the issue with the monitor?" **user**&gt; "it started just before i called you, the cable at the back was irritating me, i kept bumping it so i took it out. " i had to explain to a teacher, that it was a power cable, the issue started the moment he unplugged it and somehow he didn't put two and two together. **edit** tried to fix the formatting the best i can, sorry about that. so back when i was a teenager i worked in technology retail. one day minutes before closing time a middle aged man came in saying that he was having volume problems. i ask him what problem he has and says let me show you. he pulls out his laptop and starts it. of course it takes 5 minutes to boot up so as it is doing that i ask him what problem he is having. he tells me that the volume on youtube isn't working. i ask him if he is able to hear audio from other things on his computer. music, other websites etc. he says everything else is working. so i tell him that if all sources of audio are working except for youtube then the first thing i would assume is that youtube is simply muted. the man is insulted as if i am calling him a monkey. i was merely thinking aloud, but that was all i could immediately think of. the manager walked by and the man started saying that i was being arrogant and insulting to him. he says that this is why he never comes here...despite being here now. so his computer is on, i pick a youtube video of cher's believe as that is my go to sample video. no volume. i tell him, yeah the volume is off. he then points at how the x to represent mute is not there. i tell him yeah it isn't muted, you just have the volume all the way down. he appears visibly embarrassed which was fine i just wanted to go home. he then proceeds to pack up quickly and leave without saying thank you. this was a little while back now working one of my first jobs in it, it was a laptop repair place that mainly did toshiba warranty repairs. now let me just give you some background info, this place was fairly dodgy, they would claim all sorts of parts from toshiba even if it wasn't a warranty job. screens were a great one as at that time they could cost upwards of $1000-$2000 just for the screen replacement. they would also charge customers ridiculous labour hours as they claimed they had to test the laptops thoroughly before giving it back when in reality we never did any testing other than checking if the problem was fixed then moved on to the next one. this one model of toshiba (forget which one exactly) would always come in with the same issue, the screen connectors would come loose and cause the screen to display incorrectly, showing different colours, lines across the screen, etc. a few months into the job a customer comes in with this exact issue, by then i'd done enough of them to spot the problem right away. the customer stated (in a nice way) that he was in a rush as he needed to get to work and needed the laptop. as he was polite about it i thought, hell ill fix it right here and now. i knew what the problem was. so i quickly pulled the screen apart, cleaned the monitor cable connections, plugged it all back in and put it back together. fired it up and sure enough, screen was displaying correctly. only took me a few minutes. the customer stood there in awe as if to say "how the hell did you just do that?" he was happy to pay the bill and was on his way, thanking me for fixing it so quickly. a couple of days later the manager approaches me for a chat, he goes on to tell me that i should never fix anything on the spot as we could have kept it for a day or two and charged the customer a lot more for it. i defended myself by saying that customer probably left there and would have been so happy he would have told his friends about it and given us more business through word of mouth / referrals. but he wouldn't have any of it, that's not how this company operated, they would rather rip people off. he then gave me 2 options, either i play their dodgy game or leave. i got fired friday that week.my boss just got a new laptop, and insists on complaining about everything about it.....it's different and therefore must be bad, don't ya know! he calls me into the office to complain that the mouse is "jittery". i use the mouse and it seems to be working perfectly. i take the mouse to my computer, where it once again is working perfectly. so i wipe it down with a wet wipe and make it look as good as new. i put it in a random baggie, walk back into his office and act like i'm installing a brand new mouse. a few minutes later.... me: "how is it working for you now?" him: "much better, thank you...." ------------------------------------------ edit: by popular reqest, a link to [xereeto's placebo troubleshooting panel]( hi, may be not exactly support story, but related. about 6 or 7 years ago, i was searching for a new job. i was somewhat experienced(or so i thought at the time), caring for a small ad forest and unix/linux based web-hosting for 2 years prior. it was december, relatively dry time of the year for job hunting, so one of the positions left on the local market to choose from, was in helpdesk support for some it outsourcing company. they claimed that they are very big, successful and popular company, but i've never heard about them neither before, nor after that. during the interview there was an hr lady in the room and head of it(hoit). hr asked questions first, pretty generic ones like:"why do want to work here?", nothing interesting. so finally it was time for technical part of the interview, hoit asked some easy technical questions at first, but then: &gt; **hoit**: please, name 3 network protocols from microsoft, without which windows xp based network cannot function. &gt; **me**: *wtf is he talking about.. i can name a few protocols developed by ms, but none of them are critical for network to work, at least without any conditions mentioned to be necessary.* &gt; **me**: well... i guess netbios, ldap, even though it's not from ms and.. i don't know, nothing else related comes to mind, and even those aren't really critical for the network. &gt; **hoit**: sorry, but this is an incorrect answer. &gt; **me**: ok, can you give me a correct one? &gt; **hoit**: sure, the answer is: dhcp, dns and icmp &gt; **me**: what?! first of all none of those are developed or belong to ms, and second, none are required for windows network to function, with only slight exception of dns needed for ad to function properly. your answer for your own question is completely wrong. &gt; **hoit**: well... you are correct, but i wanted to hear from you the answer i gave. &gt; **me**: how am i supposed to correctly guess which incorrect answer to the question you are thinking of? &gt; **hoit**: yeah, well.. that will be all for today, we will send you an e-mail with our decision regarding you. about a week later i received an e-mail explaining that my application was declined, reason: underqualified. **tl;dr**: you are correct, but i am right. (credit: /u/alacorn75 )my coworker just tried to send an email but it would not send. i had her check her email box size: **7,846,546kb!** yes. you read that right over **7 gigabytes** of email, most of that in her deleted items folder. her response: "i thought when i deleted an email it was deleted." i used the throwing paper in the trash can under her desk metaphor. she empty her deleted items folder. 5 minutes later email she was trying to send was sent on its way. somewhere, an it person is wondering about all the space that just opened up on a server. edit: it may have been 78gb. i only got to see the ridiculous amount for a brief moment. edit 2:my email box size: 6,923 kb edit 3: not in it. just "tech" person in office.so this happen literally this morning. i was sitting at my desk, happily minding other peoples businesses when i had an alert. the worst kind of alert. "server "name"" is offine, joyous occasion! i immediately called the company to just alert them that their network shares etc will be down whilst i figure out what went wrong when i was made aware that they had "switched the server off and on". my immediate question was how?! because i know full well there was no engineer on site today. the person nonchalantly replied "oh i turned it off at the wall" my shock must have been apparent and i stammered "why did you do that?" he replied "how else was i supposed to? there is no screen?" me "please don't do that again, please just ask us" i hung up the phone and i sit here waiting and praying that the server comes back online because i don't want to have to fit in an already full day with a site visit to repair god knows what may have gone wrong with the server after an improper shutdown **edit: the server has just come back online thankfully** i'm on the senior helpdesk team for a hospital system in my area. we have a secure messaging system that has both desktop and mobile phone interfaces, that nurses will page doctors with. this system is entirely independent of our ad domain, but uses our exchange email addresses to create user accounts. a call was forwarded to me for assistance with a user who couldn't log in. me=thepaintsaint; nurse=technologically inept nurse; nm=nurse's manager &gt;me: "information systems, this is thepaintsaint." &gt;nm: "hello, this is nm, i need to get one of my nurses logged into the secure message system. we've called a few times and placed several tickets, yet she's still unable to get logged in." &gt;me: "sure, let me pull up the console... who are we talking about?" &gt;nm: "nurse, she's gone through the setup via email invite, and she logged on once; but she can no longer remember her username to log in." &gt;me: "ok, let me bring her account up... uh... i haven't seen this before... let me make sure it's right." the username is a user-defined field when setting up the account. most people use the first part of their username - i.e., if my email address is thepaintsaint@domain.org, i'd use thepaintsaint as my username. but this user was special. &gt;me: "yeah, this is odd, but i guess it works. her username is 'domain.org'." &gt;nm: "you mean like our website?!?" &gt;me: "yeah, nurse's username is our website address... never seen someone do that, but since the system is entirely different than the rest of our network, it could be 'happyanimals' or 'domain.org' or anything really that they want to put in there. have her try that, and give us a call if you need further help." tl;dr: user uses our domain name as her username, it works.a teacher at my school sent email to the it department asking where her students could get copies of ms powerpoint from. she said her students would need it during the year when doing project presentations for her class. we emailed back telling her that powerpoint was available in office 365, which all of the students can get for free. it is a part of our site licensing program. they just needed to log into their student accounts to get the details. at the end of the day we get another email from the instructor asking which building office 365 was in. she couldn't find it when she walked around looking for it. **tldr:** manager won't let us make fake signs leading to the fire escape. i am a semi retired, semi burnt out old tech working through my declining years in a small rural town. in a small town you take on just about anything and i was called to one of the local pubs to work on a video game. it was a cabinet that used s dell pc with a custom program. i was called in because there was a connectivity problem, the game needed to connect to a server to update the games performance. i replaced the faulty wi-fi card. it was a simple repair and i would not normally mention it on this forum, but i had to re-enter the wi-fi settings. this pc had no keyboard or mouse, so you used one of the "shotguns" to shoot at the screen to select the keys on the on screen keyboard. did i mention it was a hunting game? so with a huge grin i quickly shot in the settings and the job was done. tldr; a dream come true, i got to program a pc with a "shotgun"!
