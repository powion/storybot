so my story starts on what was a normal day taking calls on the front line for a large cable company the job pays well and for the most part the people i deal with are fairly nice to talk to quite often well get calls from seniors especially in the morning who have premise equipment issues such as snow on screen or no signal on their tv sets connected to our digital equipment now my heart does go out to some of these folk because up until recently past few years we would supply straight analog cable to many homes coax direct from wall to tv with scrolling guide however most cities we service nowadays require our digital equipment to receive channels and this has caused a lot of frustration with older people who dont know how to operate said equipment ie always having your tv set on video or hdmi to get picture so often times we get customers who are repeat offenders with long ticket histories of these types of issues so anyway i get a call from an older gentleman whos quite bitter and mean right off the bat doesnt like that i asked for his address telephone number to verify the account hates that he has to speak with a machine before reaching an agent etc i have some experience handling these types of customers however this call was going to be a little different i spent over minutes with this guy well call him mr smith trying to get his tv set connected to the digital box properly so he could receive a picture no luck he was getting clearly frustrated by the whole ordeal and started blaming me for not being able to do my job properly how i was useless etc whatever like i said ive dealt with this before so i tried my best not to take it personally but eventually i had to ask him if we could book a service tech to the home a courtesy call to get his tv working correctly unfortunately our booking calendar was showing an appointment days out thats when he dropped this on me dont bother sending a goddamn technician because ill be dead by then im and tv is the only thing i have left are you really going to make me wait for a tech i instantly felt bad i mean ive heard every complaint in the book as to why people dont want to wait for a tech but this one kind of got to me im in my mids so honestly i cant even imagine how it must feel to utter those words so i spoke with my supervisor who said theyd see if we could get someone out earlierbut we couldnt promise anything so i let mr smith know and he was predictably not very happy with my answer at that point it almost sounded like he started to cry and went into how he has no family left and no friends that come visit this was after i asked if there was anyone in his building that might be able to help man i felt terrible so i took it upon myself to ask mr smith if i could pay a visit he lived in a small city over from where i was not very far to drive he was a little shocked i was willing to do this but sounded thankful i was willing to come out and help him personally so i head over get to the residence and meet him within seconds i had the cable running again simple input change and even brought him a simplified remote for his set top box to avoid this problem in the future thats when he started crying he goes into how he hasnt actually spoken or really interacted with anyone for years he gave me a hug and told me how thankful he was that i came out and helped him and told me how sorry he was for being so mean earlier on i said it was no problem and i was happy to help and that was it i left weeks later my supervisor comes to my desk and asks me if i could come speak with her for a bit about an account for mr smith turns out he sent the cable company a letter outlining how thankful he was for helping him with his issue and how it really made an old man happy again for once in a very long time the letter was framed and put on our front entrance to retail i guess the moral of this story is no matter how nasty someone is to you over the phone sometimes theyre not always a terrible person and just going through a lot i still think about mr smith occasionally when i get those nasty customers and it makes me feel a little better anyway thanks for reading just thought id share how this one call changed my outlook on life 
i witnessed this astounding it meltdown around in a large academic organization an employee decided to send a broad solicitation about her need for a local apartment she happened to discover and use an allemployeesorgedu type of email address that included everyone and by everyone i mean every employee in a employee academic institution everyone from the ceo on down received this ladys apartment inquiry of course this kicked off the usual round of why am i getting this and take me offa list and omg everyone stop replying responses each replyalled to allemployeesorgedu so new messages email started to bog down as a halfmillion messages apparated into mailboxes it fail not necessarily making an allemployeesorgedu email address thats quite reasonable but granting unrestricted access to it rather than configuring the mail server to check the sender and generate one not the ceo not authorized reply that wasnt the real problem that incident mightve simmered down after people stopped responding in a k organization lots of people go on vacay and some of them lets say remembered to set their email to autorespond about their absence and the autoresponders responded to the same recipients including allemployeesorgedu so every i dont care about your apartment message didnt just generate copies of itself it also generated new messages even the avalanche of apartment messages became drowned out by the volume of ill be gone til november autoreplies that also wasnt the real problem which again might have died down all by itself the real problem was that the mail servers were quite diligent the autoresponders didnt just send one im away message they sent an im away message in response to every incoming message including the im away messages of the other autoresponders the autoresponse avalanche converted the entire mail system into an agentsmithlike replication factory of away messages as autoresponders incessantly informed not just every employee but also each other about employee status the email systems melted down everything went offline a kwide enterprise suddenly had no email for about hours thats not the end of the story the it staff busied themselves with mucking out the mailboxes from these millions of messages and deactivating the autoresponders they brought the email system back online and their first order of business was to send out an email explaining the cause of the problem etc and they addressed the notification email to allemployeesorgedu it fail before they sent their email message they had disabled most of the autoresponders but they missed at least one more specifically they missed at least two

bosss wife reached over moving the mouse the screen flared to life boss stared boss wife gasped a soft moan followed by the neigh of a horse emanated from the laptop she frantically closed the video windowrevealing a second window underneath it a bing search for best places to buy weed near me she closed that one toorevealing buzzfeeds signs youre over your job as she slammed the laptop shut boss shook his head red and shaking with anger howhow was thati mean i thoughtwho was using this computer he roared bosss wife shook her head jack was using it about a halfhour ago as as if on cue jack appeared in the doorway with the leftovers from lunch in a carryout bag in his hand bosss back was to him that kind of thing should be blocked he yelled at me pointing to the laptop i nodded i agree jack said he needed to use the unrestricted computer for some important projects thats why he asked you to retrieve the key to my desk last week right i pointed to the door with my chin and boss saw jack jack blinked at boss he looked at me he looked at the computer then back to me i could see it dawned on him what was going on yyou did something to my computer didnt you he demanded of course i had i had copied a hidden batch file onto jacks desktop from a usb drive when i fixed his computer the other day a file that would send me his browsing history without remoting into his desktop or alerting him then all it would need would be a remote command which id set off from my own computer the file would then delete itself after launching three web pages as soon as the mouse movedthree of the most incriminating web pages jack had ever visited on the computer all it needed was a remote command which id set off from my own computer granted it wasnt entirely untraceable but the only person whod know what to look for was in this room looking with as angry a face i could muster at the awful end user who had become the bane of my existence bosss wife chimed in she was at least slightly more computersavvy than her husband no clickity didnt do anything he just exited theyou know the screensaver whatever was there must have been what you wereumworking on when you rushed out of the office for lunch she glared at jack and then addressed boss he must have forgotten to close out the evidence of his blatant misuse of company property i shook my head solemnly and i trusted you with this unrestricted computer too jack i even gave you your own email address for the company because i thought youd be an asset clearlyclearly i was wrong i tried my best to sound hurt bosss wife nonchalantly picked up the laptop and handed it to me jack i am rather upset that youd do something like this i hired you as a favor to your mother and you can be certain shell hear about this now go home jack stood there shaking he probably had an idea of what i had done but hed have no way to prove it buthei he pointed at me wordlessly get out boss yelled jack burst into tears and ran from the room now as i write this its been four weeks since jack was terminated i patched the security hole from spotify and the interns are listening to music again i didnt give the spare desk key back to the office manager as for jacki saw him the other day when he stopped by with his mother he came and knocked on my door umclickity i looked up and narrowed my eyes what i justi wanted to say im sorry

for him almost actually not even almost i shook my head and went back to typing jack continued standing there and after a few long moments i looked at him you can go now and then he was gone edit clarity on my evil plan edit wow gildings on one post you guys are the best edit wow this story has gotten a total of gildings one on part one on part here and one in rlounge i am overwhelmed with happiness that you all enjoyed my story this much 
part part part part the email was pretty selfexplanatory due to recent reports of alleged security problems by an intern i have had to temporarily block access to spotify i apologize for the inconvenience it got around relatively quickly that jack was the one responsible two of the interns quit they stopped playing music out loud none of them talked to jack he wasnt in the intern room for very long anyway about a week after his hire bosss wife decided to let jack just use her office while she wasnt there presumably because he complained about how the interns were all being so very mean to him day i got an email from jack im having issues accessing buzzfeed i didnt even move from my chair emailing back a simple reply due to management concerns buzzfeed is not allowed per our firewall settings his email was immediate please i just want to check some things while im on lunch i replied back a simple no and went about my day and that was the last i ever heard from jack im kidding of course it wasnt day someone had opened my desk see i have a laptop in my desk the laptop is set up to bypass the firewall if we need it like if we need to find a business by looking them up on facebook or read a news article on a usuallyblocked news site its common knowledge i have it someone had unlocked my desk and taken the laptop i stormed down to the officer managers desk she and i have the only two keys to my desk i told her that my desk had been opened and that a company laptop was missing oh she said confused boss came down here and needed the key to your desk boss i was taken aback ialright maybe boss needed the laptop for something i told myself but that didnt stop me from going straight to boss wifes office there sitting at the polished hardwood desk sat jack with my laptop and my desk key next to it i approached jack i need you to give me that back jack shook his head i got approval from boss the computer in here was acting funny so i asked if i could use your spare laptop and he said yes i was completely stunned so you asked boss to get you the key to my desk i picked the desk key up and put it in my pocketthen take my laptop and use it for i looked over the screen two windows docked side by side facebook and cheezburger this he shifted the laptop so i couldnt see the screen and cleared his throat like i was intruding on his private data thanks you can go now you can go now you can go now nope nope nope nope shit doesnt work like this man i felt like i wanted to just slap the child sitting in front of me but i steadied my hand and took a breath the only laptop with unrestricted internet access was in the hand of a spoiled intern the only laptop with unrestricted access i smiled at jack alright no problem have a good day i walked out of the office i had a plan jack was fucking going down edit wow thanks to whoever gave me gold

a call comes in a user reports her keyboard is going erratic it is possessed i take a stroll down to the office bearing a new replacement keyboard i get there and i begin to make sure that it is indeed a faulty keyboard and not just some gunk sticking the key down i open up notepad and immediately i am barraged by nnnnnnn everything seems fine otherwise this keyboard is the same model as the replacement i brought over so relatively new no sticky keys either very well a faulty keyboard it is until until i move the tower and notice a second wireless keyboard sitting on the side of it laying flat on the floor with a stack of papers and a tissue box sitting atop i pull it out and notice the n barrage has stopped on the screen i press the n key once again and an n is added to the word file exorcism was performed demons were banished am now priest 
part part part part i had been working as a small offices sysadmin for a little over two months when jack was hired jack was a paid intern whose mother was friends with my bosss wife jack grew up in the wealthiest county in the state where my boss lives and has had everything he ever wanted a sense of entitlement that hung around him like the smell of fivedayold socks was the first thing i noticed upon being introduced to him as he went around the office jack this is clickity our ermuhtechguy my boss introduces me in that way that old bosses who dont use computers often do jack extends his hand oh cool nice to meet ya i shake welcome aboard jack is very eager to get started doingwhatever will i get a business email as if this is the most interesting thing ever adorable i think eventually yes for the moment though we have a shared email for interns on staff ill get you the credentials shortly most of the interns use the shared email for a while until getting their own just standard procedure you run the firewall right yes so you can block and unblock sites yes jacks eager smile is contagious cool nice to meet you he waves and the boss and jack leave to go be introduced elsewhere now dear reader you might be wondering why i would call jack the worst end user ever given his politeness and general smiling demeanor who has some understanding of what a sysadmin is and what a sysadmin does thats above average when it comes to end users well were only getting started here with jack the first thing jack did was complain the moment he was out of earshot he apparently explained to the boss that it really would be professional to have his own email given his experience and the fact that he was really more than just an intern see jack knew his shit and that was that if he complained to mother she would complain to bosswife who would complain to boss and boss figuring an email is a small thing to ask for had a request to set up a personalized email account for jack on my desk within the hour this was not to be a good start of a relationship with ones it guy day i got an it ticket for the room where the interns work its a large open office with a bunch of computers and printers where the interns print stuff all day long because its such mindnumbing work they tend to play music off of pandora or spotify in there the ticket says from internemailcompanyemail hey were having issues with spotify not super important but please help if youre free thanks aw those guys are always nice to me maybe its because i leave reddit unblocked on our firewall so they can reddit at lunch an hour or so later i have a few free minutes and i head down i check out spotify and find the issue and fix it jack is there and watches closely we can use spotify here he asks yep i reply pandora works too another intern adds everything checks out and i leave the happyagaintheycanplaymusic interns and jack a couple hours later i got a note on my desk see boss knew i allowed people to play music and such at the office he believed was that spotify is a huge security risk leaving holes in our firewall through which everything from viruses to malware to cyberterrorists could come through boss was unhappy that i would allow such a threat to exist in our system and ordered me to close it up i called boss when i asked who told him these incorrect things about spotify oh jack did of course i explained that spotify was not a threat and that jack was simply mistaken jack however was on the other end of the line in bosss office on speakerphone and interjected dude its alright if you didnt know about the security issue but dont try and make me look bad for your mistake im stunned as boss hangs up the phone after demanding i fix it edit clarity
this is a second hand story told to me years ago by someone who was already a veteran sysadmin back then so it could have happened in the s or early s the scene is a factory making heavy machinery they are modern and the factory floor had terminals connected to a mainframe for tracking parts and whatever else they needed it for one day a sysadmin gets a call from the factory floor and after the usual pleasantries the user says gt i cant log in when i stand up the sysadmin thinks that its one of those calls again and goes through the usual gt is the power on what do you see on the terminal have you forgotten your password the user interrupts gt i know what im doing when i sit down i can log in and everything works but i cant log in when i stand up the sysadmin tries to explain that there can be no possible connection between the chair and the terminal and sitting or standing should in no way affect the ability to log in after a long back and forth on the phone he finally gives up and walks to the factory floor to show the user that standing cant affect logging in the sysadmin sits down at the terminal gets the password from the user logs in and everything is fine turns to the user and says gt see it works your password is fine the user answers gt yeah told you now log out stand up and try again the sysadmin obliges logs out stands up types the password and invalid password ok thats just bad luck he tries again invalid password and again invalid password baffled by this the sysadmin tries his own mainframe account standing invalid password he sits down and manages to log in just fine this has now turned from crazy user to a really fascinating debugging problem the word spreads about the terminal with the chair as an input device and other people start flocking around it those are technical people in a relatively high tech factory they are all interested in fun debugging production grinds to a halt everyone wants to try if they are affected it turns out that most people can log in just fine but there are certain people who cant log in standing and there are quite a few who cant log in regardless of standing or sitting after a long debugging session they find it turns out that some joker pulled out two keys from the keyboard and switched their places both the user and the sysadmin had one of those letters in the password they were both relatively good at typing and didnt look down at the keyboard when typing when sitting but typing when standing is something they werent used to and had to look down at the keyboard which made them press the wrong keys some users couldnt type properly and never managed to log in while others didnt have those letters in their passwords and the switched keys didnt bother them at all
edit this post has received a tremendous amount of attention which is awesome and while i certainly appreciate all of the gold please consider instead making a small or large donation to a local battered womans shelter they could use your support and money way more than i do if you make such a donation and pm me proof with your important bits blurred out i will match those donations up to the first raised after reading tale by ujayykidd it brought back memories of a client of my own that was paranoid and rightly so as an aside ujayykidd we are totally making pars a thing around here as a bit of backstory i spent five years doing it consulting in a rural town about an hour from portland or i worked for a small company with a few other consultants and a couple of bench techs my job was primarily servernetwork engineeringcentric but having done my time as a frontline tech id periodically involve myself in the more interestingcomplex cases wed see from our walkin customers one day we had a woman come in she caught my eye because she was in her late thirties or early forties and actually quite attractive she had short platinum blonde hair and bright red lips and was dressed and styled like she was transplanted right out of a s era magazine ad one of our bench techs greets her and starts talking to her right out the gate i can tell she is panicked and by the sound of it tinfoil hat levels of crazy shit there goes any desire i had to flirt with her and maybe see if i could buy her a drink i listen in on the conversation anyways because its at least a change of pace from the monotony of my daytoday after a few minutes of her going on about how her husband is spying on her through all manner of devices my bench tech looks back at me with a canyoupleasecomehelpmeandmakehergoaway look on his face i oblige as i appreciated that the frontline guys respected me enough to ask for my help on these things i walked up front introduced myself as the supervisor and told her that since her issue was so unique and serious itd probably be best if our more senior staff handled it now that i was seeing her up close i could tell that under her classy outfit and marilyn monroeesque makeup was a deeply distraught woman her eyes looked baggy and tired like she had been up too late crying obviously at this point im just playing along this isnt my first rodeo and generally what happens is the client claims some individual or three letter agency is monitoring their computer we tell them our hourly rate for forensics an hour and suddenly the meninblacksuits watching them arent that big of a deal anymore now to be fair we actually did specialize in computer forensics and data recovery working extensively with the local police department and a handful of legal firms on a number of cases where they needed expert help we even had a guy on staff fulltime who wore that hat most days the local police were pretty smalltime and farmed out at least some of their computer crime related work to us on contract in the cases where people did want to pay we would do our due diligence and prepare a professional report of our findings accordingly we would meet with attorneys and testify in court as necessary generally it was fairly benign stuff like gathering chat logs and browser history for a divorce proceeding where one spouse accused the other of cheating or something similar and wanted evidence to back that up back to the client at hand she insists her husband is monitoring her every move tracking her vehicle monitoring her computer and recording her in her own home heres where it gets interesting she claims that she knows all of this because he has told her about it in fact he has gone so far as to threaten her life if she tries to tamper with any of it she says she has tried to apply for a protective order against him but ostensibly without some sort of evidence of his behavior nobody would take her seriously i give her the crazy litmus test and i tell her that in order to gather evidence discreetly we would need two of our senior consultants to investigate an hour four hour minimum she pulls out her wallet fuck shes serious we agree to start with her vehicle to check for signs of the gps tracker she says she is parked several blocks away so her husband wont know she came to a computer store we were in a downtown area surrounded by retail stores so i grab my toolbag and holler at one of my colleagues who has been tuned in himself from his back office desk to join me so the lady myself my colleague and both of our now intensely curious bench techs all of us in matching company polos follow this lady down the street to her car what a motley crew we must have been we get to her minivan begin our process of looking for this gps device now gps trackers at least the commercially available ones require two things generally dedicated v power and an unobstructed at least by metal view of the sky they basically use gps to grab the coordinates and then a gsmcdma cellular signal to relay the positional data to a web interface or something so there really arent that many places they can really be mounted that are both effective and discreet we spend some time looking around the undercarriage rocker panels and even bits of the interior battery doesnt have any additional leads running off of it fuse box isnt tapped anywhere for power nothing just as im starting to lose faith that this may not be quite as exciting as i had perhaps hoped i find the fucking thing it was tiny not much bigger than a flash drive and mounted behind the front grille it looked pretty much exactly like the reason it didnt need auxiliary power is that it wasnt an active device this device did not provide realtime tracking rather it used some internal memory and a couple aaa batteries to log gps data for days at a time at some point when the van was not in use the guy would grab the gps device upload the data to his laptop maybe swap batteries then remount it to the car fucking hell this lady was very much indeed paranoid and rightfully so now that weve established that she isnt batshit insane but that she actually is being tracked by her husband the tone amongst our team became drastically more serious obviously something sinister is going on and we arent sure what but by the sound of things this lady really is fearful of her life she has entrusted us to gather evidence and help her get a protective order against him which is something i think all of us took quite seriously we show her the tracker and she breaks down into tears because its the first evidence she has physically seen we take photos of it and carefully install it back where it belongs i sort of assumed that a gps tracker on your fucking car would be proof enough for a judge to issue at least a temporary protective order but she seemed insistent that she would need more evidence to make it stick our next moves have to be conducted very deliberately she claims that her home is bugged and so is her computer we will need to go onsite to investigate accordingly but it will have to be at a time when both her husband isnt home and when we will be able to quickly create a report for her leaving her enough time to get a protective order before the days end we couldnt chance him coming home later reviewing whatever it was he was recording and finding out that she had taken action to have him investigated it wasnt going to be for at least a week before there was a time that was just right we made arrangements with her back at the office and i offered to walk her back to her car she accepted and on the way she confided in me many of the personal details of her life and her obviously abusive relationship with her husband in the interest of protecting her privacy ill simply say that it sounded like she finally figured out how manipulative he was and when she said she wanted out he wasnt about to let that happen i asked her again if she really was afraid for her life and the sincerity of her yes was both scary and heartbreaking for me i asked her if she had thought about getting a gun and she said she had but that he would notice the large sum of money needed to purchase one missing from their joint account as the gravity of the situation weighed on me i offered to let her borrow one of mine she was awestruck but i assured her that it was completely okay at the time i had several handguns and rifles and i couldnt think of a more appropriate situation for someone to have one my car was parked close by and we walked over to it i tried to gather some idea of her familiarity with guns as the thought of giving one to more or less a complete stranger especially one that might not know what to do with it was unsettling to me it sounded like she had at least a basic understanding of their function had gone shooting before etc in my mind the pros of her having at least some means to protect herself outweighed the cons so i moved forward in the trunk i had a ruger which is a very small caliber handgun that i kept in my get home bagemergency survival kit it was fitted with the factory installed crimson trace laser grips which i had dialed in to about meters we went over the basics of how to use it safely i showed her how the laser worked and told her that for her situation all she had to know was that the bullet would go more or less where the red dot of the laser was she was crying and frankly at this point i pretty much was too i gave her my cell phone number and told her to call me if she needed someone to talk to we hugged for a while before parting ways it wasnt a romantic hug or anything it was that kind of hug thats exchanged when someone needs to be held like when your best mate tells you his mom passed away or something she needed the comfort of knowing that she wasnt alone that at least one person took her seriously and id like to think that i gave her some hope that things would be okay the next week was tense as we prepared for our investigation my coworkers and i spent considerable time discussing and researching ways to triage her computer to look for evidence as well as how to approach the search of the house when the day finally came we arrived onsite at the specified time armed with our forensics tools flashlights laptopsanything we might need i set to work immediately on her computers a home desktop and a personal laptop while two of my colleagues began their search of the house i removed the drives from her pcs and using a usb writeblocker which physically prevented me from writingmodifying any information on her drives i made a clone of both drives for the sake of speed both drives were cloned to ssds once cloned i put the pcs back they way they were and began mounting the cloned volumes and investigating the drives were mounted into a quarantine vm with no wlan access scanning the drives with a number of antimalware programs didnt turn anything up looking through the file system however paying special attention to hidden files and protected system files turned up some things that didnt look quite right filenames and directories that looked obfuscated i made the call to boot up both pcs off of the cloned ssds and look that them live to see if maybe i could catch an obfuscated process running or something nothing with nothing else open i ran a netstat an out of cmd there were a handful of tcp connections active one by one i started performing dns lookups on the ips everything was normal active connections for background processes like skype then i found it an active connection to a clearly obfuscated domain name it looked like a license key with a com at the end of it something like wegffqrdcom it was hiding in plain sight and it was registered to spectorsoft corporation guess what they sell yup surveillance software the pc was running something called spector which was capable of monitoring all of the users activities browsing history keylogging even sending remote screen captures to a mobile phone or email based on target keywords it was the full nine yards for monitoring i screen capped everything for my logs shut the system down and swapped the forensic ssds for the original disks to put everything back the way it was not too long after our other two guys found some evidence of their own two separate and frankly rather rudimentary cmos cameras hidden in the master bedroom one in the closet in a shoebox one in the smoke detector in the ceiling both if i recall correctly were simply wired to v batteries and recorded to sd cards all things considered they were pretty low tech the contents of the memory cards would have had to be moved off at least once a day and the battery probably changed at least as often we didnt touch anything lots of photographs were taken we went back to the office and compiled all of the evidence into a document for her and i passed the disk images onto our forensics guy for further evaluation i met with the client later that day to present her the report so she could furnish it to the court the gratitude she had for us was absolutely immeasurable we didnt charge her for our services getting to play a role in stopping her sick fuck of a husband from engaging in whatever it is he was doing was payment enough id like to tell you that i know how this story ends id like to say that the guy was put away in jail forever and my supreme it prowess and whiteknightery wooed her into my arms and we lived happily ever after but frankly i dont really know what happened what i can tell you that about a week after we gave her our report i met her for coffee at a place across the street she looked visibly better her puffy tired eyes were gone replaced instead by ones that seemed to glisten with warmth her skin was radiant and beautiful she was smiling for the first time id seen an immense weight had been lifted off of her and it showed she told me that she was temporarily living with her mom and dad that a restraining order was in place on her estranged husband and that she was finally filing for divorce she told me that for the first time in a very long time she felt safe and that she felt happy in the parking lot she gave me back the little handgun profusely thanking me again for the work we did she hugged me both of us tearyeyed and we parted ways for me it proved to be one of the most emotionally rewarding experiences of my career edit thank you to everyone whos gilded this post its definitely put a smile on my face

lucrative opportunity to exploit people less strong willed than them ill let you determine the field they are not my primary station but i help out there when the ticket queue gets overloaded we can call them slimeco most of the folks there that i deal with while slimy in general are quite pleasant towards me im the cheerful guy with the laptop who doesnt make promises and just does what needs to be done unlike the three other burntout techs stationed there who make hard deadlines they never meet but there is one woman here who is beyond help ever see that episode of kitchen nightmares or whatever it was that had the husband and wife pair that the wife was just completely convinced she could do no wrong and that everyone was out to get her thats this woman not literally but a bitforbit duplicate she is a problem for everyone and my pleasant demeanor doesnt mean shit to her because im just trying to ruin her life i avoid her like the plague because i have more important things to deal with than her fifteen tickets about the same goddamn bullshit that has been resolved over and over again well just call her theharpy from here on out this past saturday the fourth im up at my friends cottage for the long weekend when i get a call from a number i dont recognize i answer because at am it could be important something could be wrong at home or with my family or what have you

starbucks is about miles away and i go back to bed about ten feet away i check my phone in the morning missed calls voicemails two hundred and thirtynine emails alternating between personal attacks fired off like text messages and submitted tickets funny how her laptop was stable long enough to submit around fifty tickets and another ish emails i blocked her number after that i got into work today and my boss had a similar situation she kept calling his phone long into the night gtboss youre nicer than i was i just told her to enjoy her holiday weekend and hung up i wonder if starbucks is still hiring an update slimeco brought in the lawyers and the excrement hit the fan my boss spoke with upper management yesterday and today when i came into that office as i normally do on wednesday i was immediately escorted to the board room by two security guards the president cfo chairman of the board slimecos lawyer our it firms lawyer and my boss were all at the table i found out my boss had threatened to file a proper criminal suit as a result of ths behavior on my behalf it was explained to my boss and i that th while an obvious problem is a highearner for the company and they would not fire her however it was discovered through an internal investigation that she had in fact gotten the numbers of all of the techs out of the cfos blackberry we dont know how she got into the blackberry but what we do know is that the cfo left his blackberry unattended which is a serious security compromise and also a violation of the contract between the company and my it firm some very strong words were exchanged between slimecos officials and my boss the lawyers agreed that it was in fact a serious breach of contract leaving any data available to unauthorized users and it was made clear that the contract in place would be terminated at the end of the meeting it was later explained to me that given the nature of the breach wed basically have an all hands on deck situation where every available tech would report to slimeco and start pulling servers switches and any other leased equipment estimated time of dismantlement was about two and a half hours there was also the phrase wood chipper for hard drives thrown in there i dont know if this was literal or a figure of speech for the next two hours i was not allowed to leave the room my boss his lawyer and slimeco renegotiated the contract on the spot a price hike increased security improvements and a couple other things that went right over my head the lawyer then pointed out that i was still well within my rights to and asked if i would be seeking legal action i asked what my options were before he even got it out of his mouth slimeco started talking about a settlement to keep me from going any further without going into too many specifics there a check was cut and immediately cashed because they aint gonna play me for no fool theharpy was put on an actual probation my boss gave me the rest of the week off billed to slimeco so i can have an actual vacation and im no longer going to do any service at slimeco not the outcome i expected at all
this story is pretty much almost years old but i want to vent it out its been causing me grief and i just need it to share it to finally feel calm as you may remember i live in mexico and things are not exactly pretty thankfully i know how to watch my back and dont make enemies but sometimes destiny catches up with you i had finished my training and got a certificate that allowed me to work on a computer store and repair computers arrived early everything normal until pm guy comes in wants his hdd wiped clean and a brand new copy of windows i didnt ask many questions just took it to the back and started working on it gave the case a nice cleaning and removed the dust boot it up then manure hit the fan i hear from the front how the front glass breaks and people started yelling my boss and the man to get the fck down as well lots of insults to the client before i could react someone comes to where i was pointing an ak rifle variant at me i jump to the floor eating that dirt and holding my hands on the back of my neck avoiding any eye contact gtt what did you do to that computer gtme nothing i didnt get to touch it i was just cleaning it gtt lies cabron gtme check it yourself everything is intact i could feel the barrel pointed agaitns me i heard someone else come in and take the pc away it felt like hours until they decided to retreat back and run away once i recovered from the shock i stand up and head to the front my boss was on the phone crying histerical i didnt even hear the police syrens then i noticed the client was missing i was not allowed to see the security footage but the client was taken away he was identified as a cartel member body discovered hours later if it wasnt because i needed the money i would have quit inmediatly thakfully me avoiding eye contact probably saved my life edit i see many people doubt it its fine with me but im going to clarify a few things gteveryone speaks in spanish i simply translated it into spanglish for style gti live in a dangerous city hence why i watch my back gti never learned what was in that hdd im better not knowing 
this happened a while back but its still the best thing that ever happened to me at work true story so i was hired by a big defense company upgrade tanks naval weapons etc with over employees you can imagine this was a very big company we were in building and if you needed to go somewhere quick you took a bike or an electric car i usually did nd line support but they had a couple of people call in sick and asked me to do first line support it was a friday and not much was happening besides the usual emailproblems and tech guys turning off unix machines that needed a checkdisk command with admin rights the phone rings gt yes hello this the secretary of the ceo we need you to come over now we have a big problem gt me what seems to be wrong gt her mr ceo is trying to open a file in word but everytime he does this scrambled text is showing up i think we are being hacked this was a big issue since a couple of weeks before this a group of activists broke into the company and climbed on top of our radar tower gt me ill take a look from here and take over your screen hang on so i take over his screen this is what happens file open jkahsfhjkhjhjjjjjjfjjjjjsakkkalalllallallalallaluuujjjdkjkjaslklkssssssssssssss gt her i dont know what this is you see this is so weird now i knew what was wrong at this moment but i wanted to see in person you dont just walk into the exec office every day gt me uhuh ill be there as soon as possible so i grab this electric car drive over and minutes later i walk into the executive building a very nice building totally different from the rest of the offices they even had their own dining room and bar the security guy sees me coming and waves me through he was informed of my coming and understood the importance i get out of the elevator at the top floor and am greeted by the secretary a manager and some other assistent all a bit panicked gt come over have a look at this the ceo says he shows me file open jkahsfhjkhjhjjjjjjfjjjjjsakkkalalllallallalallaluuujjjdkjkjaslklkssssssssssssss so i look at him i look at every single person in that room you could feel the suspense i look back at the computer i pick up the newspaper that was on top of the keyboard and ask gt try again please the looks on their face priceless got a free lunch with the ceo edit formatting
in case you didnt see the edit on the other post it was suggested i post a standalone update my boss spoke with upper management yesterday and when i came into that office today as i normally do on wednesday i was immediately escorted to the board room by two security guards the president cfo chairman of the board slimecos lawyer our it firms lawyer and my boss were all at the table i found out my boss had threatened to file a proper criminal suit as a result of ths behavior on my behalf it was explained to my boss and i that th while an obvious problem is a highearner for the company and they would not fire her however it was discovered through an internal investigation that she had in fact gotten the numbers of all of the techs out of the cfos blackberry we dont know how she got into the blackberry but what we do know is that the cfo left his blackberry unattended which is a serious security compromise and also a violation of the contract between the company and my it firm some very strong words were exchanged between slimecos officials and my boss the lawyers agreed that it was in fact a serious breach of contract leaving any data available to unauthorized users and it was made clear that the contract in place would be terminated at the end of the meeting it was later explained to me that given the nature of the breach wed basically have an all hands on deck situation where every available tech would report to slimeco and start pulling servers switches and any other leased equipment estimated time of dismantlement was about two and a half hours there was also the phrase wood chipper for hard drives thrown in there i dont know if this was literal or a figure of speech for the next two hours i was not allowed to leave the room my boss his lawyer and slimeco renegotiated the contract on the spot a price hike increased security improvements and a couple other things that went right over my head the lawyer then pointed out that i was still well within my rights to and asked if i would be seeking legal action i asked what my options were before he even got it out of his mouth slimeco started talking about a settlement to keep me from going any further without going into too many specifics there a check was cut and immediately cashed because they aint gonna play me for no fool theharpy was put on an actual probation my boss gave me the rest of the week off billed to slimeco so i can have an actual vacation and im no longer going to do any service at slimeco not the outcome i expected at all
a tale from the other side my friend bought a netflix box for a tv and when it wouldnt work asked me to come set it up i couldnt get there until after work and when i did it was working she said she called google to fix it it was not a google product nor does it use any google services so i thought she googled the company number and had them fix it i wanted to show her it wasnt google she called so i checked the caller id it was google after a while on the phone a google tec support guy helped her set up an unrelated product for free i guess google really is a helpful service tldr girl wants a cable box set up but is attacked by dragons while eating tacos 
you dont do any work on friday in it if it goes wrong youll be there all weekend fixing it so in the spirit of being careful friday afternoon drinks were a tradition pm friday was beer oclock and as the resident onlypersonnotexcitedbycrownlager responsibility for arranging the drinks fell to me no big deal right except that this was the day that i finally got an unlimited account with the local liquor store that would be billed to the company automatically i wasnt going to waste it i did not waste it our small person company got riproaringly drunk like arrested for being outside in this state drunk there was jack daniels cans stacked to the ceiling chips had fallen liberally to the floor someone couldnt find a bin and filed a chicken wing in the file cabinet under c for chicken it was one of those drinking sessions where everyone is just a total mess around pm after five solid hours of ausspec partying we broke off and headed into the night i wandered down to a nearby bar and watched some bands play for an hour downed another jug of beer and smiled to myself that the week had ended fate it seems is not without a sense of irony my phone buzzed in my pocket i ran outside tripping up the stairs as i went managed to steady myself against a signpost and answered it was the ceo the primary and secondary route servers were down i stood frozen in time for an instant the same way a deer looks at the headlights of an oncoming car and then asked him to repeat himself gt ceo yes both the route servers are down the entire state is offline get in there now fix it do whatever it takes i cannot stress enough that these two servers were the most important thing our company had they in and of themselves were the primary thing around which our business existed and all other things were secondary to them my state was by far the biggest with some of the biggest isps and content providers in the country attached and this was the first full network outage wed ever had and it was my problem and id consumed enough alcohol that my blood could have been used as a fire accelerant i yelled something and ran off in the direction of work it was only when i bumped into the glass front doors before they opened that i started to realise how drunk i was when the elevator arrived at my floor and i bumped into both sides of the hallway before making it to the door i knew i was in trouble that hallway was only feet long but it didnt matter my wallet hit the card reader id made it habits a funny thing you get so used to the noises clicks beeps and responses that you realise somethings wrong in an instant there was no response from the card reader an error surely interference something new in my wallet i dug the card out throwing my wallet on the ground and badged it on its own nothing not an access denied six beeps or a card format unrecognised five beeps nothing the lights were on but noone was home a few feet away the keypad for the alarm was lit up like a headlight convention all the lights were on the screen totally blacked out no beeps for keypresses just nothing the blood drained from my face the route servers were inside suffering some unknown fate our customers probably getting more furious by the minute and i could not open the door again no sod it i wasnt taking any more of this security systems crap i was getting into this datacentre security system be damned you all know what id tried before and i knew as well so i didnt bother trying again my tools once again were behind the locked door and then the light went on over my head gt chhopsky i cant go through the door i cant go around the door i cant go under it but can i go over it this is the logic of a drunk engineer try all the dimensions there was a chair that we left outside for people working outside the dc so in my infinite wisdom i dragged the chair over to the wall and lifted a ceiling tile unlike the dc where the ceiling tiles were weighed down with hundreds of heavy cables the office was free and clear and the wall itself stopped at the ceiling so pushing the tile into the cavity between the suspended ceiling and the concrete i hoisted myself up into the ceiling this did not work as well as id hoped because i was not very strong i kicked and pushed off the wall scrambling to push myself up onto what i now realised was a very thin wall for those not familiar with a suspended ceiling metal rods are drilled into the concrete block above and a grid pattern hangs below it inside those grids are weak light tiles basically made of a combination of cardboard and plaster looking at the predicament id gotten myself into it became apparent that the only things that were going to support my weight up here were the tierods into the concrete so id hold onto the rods with my hands and lying prone in the ceiling distribute the rest of my weight along the horizontal connectors id drop down onto the file cabinet at the far end of the room about feet away this plan was flawless and it worked for about of the required feet upon which point my hands slipped and i fell through the centre of the ceiling tile towards the floor below by some insane miracle i landed mostly on my feet scrambling ungracefully to regain balance coughing up ceiling tile dust and god knows what else probably asbestos when the coughing stopped i ran over to the security panel pulled the power and plugged it back in it beeped a single happy post beep and hummed to life making normal sounds instead of the endless buzzing it had been making before my access restored i quickly found the problem a circuit breaker had tripped and due to a wiring error on the part of an electrician at some point both route servers had been wired into the same circuit rather than the different feeds on different upss via different distribution boards that they were supposed to with a dustpan and brush i set about cleaning up the nightmare my dramatic entrance had caused it was not a small mess ceiling tiles are about feet by feet and this one had exploded it took about an hour after finally sweeping up all the mess putting the ceiling tile id broken to get up there back together and replacing the one id broken getting down i walked my ass out the door feeling smug that noone would be the wiser for my ceiling entrance and id have a grand story to tell monday morning rolled around and i was the last one in aaron stared at me gt aaron what the hell did you do to my desk gt chhopsky wha i walked into the office and stared in horror i dont know what the hell id cleaned up but it looked someone had hit a bag of flour with a baseball bat it was everywhere how wasted was i what did i spend an hour cleaning and how in almighty crap did i diagnose an electrical circuit being miswired and split with no electrician tools of any kind i have no idea but what i did know was how to break in so i documented the procedure and added it to the tech support wiki

first off ive never actually done tech support ive always been a programmer but i shared this story elsewhere and someone said it was appropriate for here so now im posting a more detailed version its the summer of and my first day of my first job after spending years at college for an ms in computer science while the boss is showing me around he gets an important phone call leaving me outside with his secretaries he was always very busy and would be lost without their assistance we strike up some conversation about our jobs and one complains about how she has to keep track of some stuff on the server to make reports that the boss wanted daily and its just the most boring tedious crap eventually boss comes back out and finishes showing me around and i get settled in at my desk as the lead dev comes by to get me started on some work of course being the brighteyed notyetdisillusioned earlytwenties computer nerd eager to prove my worth i didnt just want to do my job i wanted to do it great and really impress people go above and beyond and be appreciated and the complaining secretary from that morning had plopped a great opportunity to show that im a real gogetter right into my lap so over my lunch break i cooked up a simple script to collate all the information she needed for her reports so that all she had to do was press one button and make sure the report was generated correctly i run it by the lead dev and he okays it i eagerly rush to tell the secretary how ive made the worst part of her job much less horrible expecting her to be giddy at how helpful i am the boss comes back from lunch as im starting to tell her and he wants to know what im so happy about as i tell them how ive automated the creation of those daily reports he wants his face lights up like hes found the goose that lays golden eggs while hers drops like i just took a dump in her purse it turns out that making those reports was all she was doing the boss had hired her for that rather than just asking one of the devs to do what i had because he didnt even know it was possible that was her last day there and i was instantly promoted from junior dev to normal dev with a nice pay raise for showing great initiative and saving the company the money for her salary and benefits i guess i did get what i wanted out of it
deep in the bowels of the southern us swamps there lies a collection of halfnerds halfrednecks cast me the hero whose sanity is tested greatly by those he tries to save benchtech an old navy vet who doubles as both inhouse support phone support and procurement for the business mma former mma fighter who now works as one of our front two receptionists really nice but can come off as really direct and intimidating ikid youll see imom youll cringe eldson imoms eldest son now normally i hate getting problem customers so early in the morningbut this one ended up being quite hilarioussad i am normally the second one to arrive at deepsouthit in the mornings benchtech always gets there way before opening time to catch up on his paperwork and take inventory in case we need to order anything now before i get into the meat of the story a small notewe mark up our prices compared to where we buy them fairly standard practice i know and its not by much just enough to make a reliable profit this goes for anything a customer asks us to order as well now onto the show i arrived this morning to find a car already parked out in front of the shop and waiting for the doors to open at since i am an onsite tech primarily i normally park up front as it is easier to get in and out of where our building is located as i get out the lady in the car sees my company uniform and gets out she is followed by a little freckled preteen i tell them good morning they seem friendly enough as they greet me back i open the door and for lack of other things to do i flip the open sign on and decide to man the front desk until mma gets here gtme so how can i help you folks this morning without saying anything the kid puts a sheet of paper on the desk i take it and look it overits a list of pc parts along with a vendor name and price its some pretty decent hardware too lga i sli s w psu something you dont expect to get from a year oldalso very expensive gtikid i need this built gtme this is a pretty nice computer also expensive what are you going to use it for gtikid a few video games gtme is that all you are going to be using it for gtikid yeah mostly minecraft league of legends and a few shooter games gtme well this will definitely run all those but this build might be a little overkill for that gtimom look we already discussed this with his older brother he works with computers too and thats what we want we already did the research for you and those are where you can get the parts cheapest from gtme well i thank you for doing that maam but if we order all these parts it will come out more expensive than your total listed here because we ultimately mark up our prices on hardware we order except on prebuilt machines that we sell up front gtimom thats ridiculous theyre our parts why should we pay extra for them gtme thats just our policy maam we wouldnt make much a profit on custom built machines if all we charged for was the labor so if we have to go through the trouble of ordering in all the parts especially from so many different vendors if these were parts we had in stock id be willing to negotiate but all of this is pretty nonstandard high end equipment now if you want to order the parts yourself and bring them to us well be more than happy to just bill you for the labor then gtimom i dont have time to go hunting for all those parts and who knows when theyd get shipped here at this point imom is looking a little upset i can see benchtech looking around the corner from the back area and mma walks in and takes her seat at the second front desk and ikid is currently playing on the demo computer we keep up front gtme if youll give me a moment maam ill tally up all these parts and tell you what our price would be for it she huffs but nods and lets me do the mathafterward wed gone from a significant amount of money to a fairly hefty markup with the price as high as it was i tell her and at that point the vein throbbing in her temple became that much more prominent gtimom youre trying to rip me off arent you gtme no maam im trying to give you some options to better fit your situation this build if we build it will be an amazing piece of technology however for what it is being used for we can build you a significantly cheaper machine that will achieved nearly the same results at this point her phone rings and she steps off to answer it mma rolled over and asked what was going on which i fill her in to the details shes not a tech but she pays attention and understands the role various parts play in pcs so she got the jist of what imoms issue was at this point imom came back up to the counter and holds her phone up to me gtimom this is my oldest son he is the one who told us to buy that computer taking the phone i say gtme hello this is cyrillus at deepsouthit gteldson did she just say i recommended that monster of a pc gtme yes sir they said you recommended these as the parts best fitting your little brothers situation gteldson son of a balright look i told them very very clearly that he did not need that build that i could put together a list of parts that would work great for him but he wanted what i have and i let my mother pressure me into making that list i do a lot of graphic work for my company so my computer needs that horsepower his doesnt do not let them talk you into building a pc that expensive my parents dont need to go spending that kind of money right now they can afford up to about two grand right now gtme i understand sir i can definitely work with that gteldson greatthankshere is my phone number in case you need my help convincing them i took down his name and phone number in case i needed the leveragewhich i am glad i did gtimom well gtme maam he and i are in agreement that the parts you have listed here which he uses for a business machine is too much and too expensive for what you want gtimom youre lying he told me those were the right parts gtme he said those are his parts for his work computer your son there will not be doing the kind of things that eldson is doing as i said i can save you a lot of money if you will let me put together a parts list based on what we have here and what i can order from our usual vendors where we get discounts and the mark ups may actually come out cheaper than standard that seemed to get her attention and she agreed to at least let me make another list of parts and our price i checked what we had in stock and put together a good listing for her it was a decent build high end i one of msis better gaming mobos gb ram aio water coolingyou know the kind of front line gaming build that can tackle just about anything you throw at it short of massively demanding games and applications i showed imom the specs and more importantly the price tag which included assembly labor she looked at the price difference and said gtimom wowand youre sure this will be good gtme yes maam thats in line with what a lot of gamers these days use in fact for the games he told me he was playing most this build is probably still overkill gtimom thats awesome how long would it take you to have this ready gtme end of the week at the least we need to order two of the parts on this list as we dont carry those standard the rest we have in house and you wont have to pay the extra shipping costs on at this point ikid got bored of messing with our computer and decided to come up to the bench and look at the parts list i had made his mom and i were in the middle of discussing payment as for things we order we have to get that in advance the rest

today everyone on our network received an email in foreign language with suspicious attachment word document with macro with encryption virus it is called locky i receive a request to look into suspicios email from user me have you opened the email everyone has received a suspicious email with encryption virus so you should not open any emails from unknown senders user no i havent opened it yet me good lets delete the email using shift and delete so it is not stored even in deleted items folder user wait a second me alright just delete it and be careful with such emails in future user it had a document attached but it is only gibberish could you look at it me you opened the attachment user yes me well turn off the computer unplug internet cable and you are free for the rest of the day tomorrow we will take your computer it will have all its files encrypted and unusable user why did you do that me i told you it is a virus and not to open it user im writing a complaint she then hang up edit today my boss listened to recording of the phone conversation and praised me for being so calm computer was indeed disconnected and our engineers are working on it there are few more computers that were infected from these emails recording of the phone call will be used in investigation about the user probably will result in firing her as it turns out these emails have been sent to all work stations that our company support our guys managed to block couple of thousand emails and we have warned everyone about the virus but probably going to have quite a few more of idiots opening the virus edit user faces charges for knowingly putting computer system at risk which can result in fairly large fine and almost certainly leads to firing also it might even be considered a criminal offense
many years ago i got a field report of a few systems that were turning themselves off during the night without warning or seemingly a reason we had some temperaturemonitoring software that would automatically shut the system down if it got too hot and the logs showed that was what was happening but it was november and the systems were in snowy regions so toohot didnt make sense a quick look through the code showed me the problem the programmer was reading the current temperature as an unsigned byte instead of a signed one as the data sheet for the part specified so that an actual temperature of c which is crazy cold for a system was being read as c and so it would shut down immediately later investigation found that the affected systems were in unheated loading dock areas the fix was of course easy but testing it required putting the system in our kitchen freezer with the various cables coming out for power the monitor and so on the ceo walked in while i was sitting there with a keyboard mouse and monitor seemingly hooked up to the refrigerator and just said i dont think that i should ask what youre doing 
after recovery from my stroke i was in desperate need of work so desperate i took an overnight shift at an webhost for tech support most nights it was pretty calm and people that called on my shift were usually just looking for more help with their website than just trouble shooting but night staff had the time and it helped break up the monotony of the shift occasionally i would get gems like this ampnbsp i get a call and the guy is frantic on the phone after finally getting him to confirm his username and password i ask which website of his is down i type the url into my web browser and surprise i get his website no issues next i vpn to my home computer and pull it up there no issue again this is where we get into basic pc troubleshooting reminder this guy is losing khr because his website is down ampnbsp it is at this point that we get into basic pc troubleshooting and the following transpired me okay are you using a mac or pc cus pc me can you click on the start menu and type in cmd cus i cannot the screen is black me deep breath is there a light on the front of your monitor and or your tower cus no me deeper breath is the cable plugged into the back of the device and can you trace that cable back to make sure it is plugged into the wall if you have a power strip can you see if it is in the on position cus rustling i think it is but cannot quite tell me what do you mean you cannot tell cus i cant tell it is dark me dark can you turn on a light cus i could get a flashlight but there is no power me head desk i assure you sir your website is up you can check it again when you have power back ampnbsp tldr someone making khr from his website was unable to tell the difference between him being out of power and his website being down ampnbsp edit formatting second edit rip inbox thanks for all the replies stories very entertaining
okay so the vpn service went down and as a result everyone in the universe is calling us asking whats wrong why cant they get in when will it be up yada yada yada we put a voice message on the line telling people theres an outage and well get it taken care of as soon as possible some people hear this and probably hang up knowing that its being addressed others wait on hold for fifteen or twenty minutes just to complain to us that the hold time was too long and give us belligerent advise on how to maintain a vpn that we have no control over of course there are lots of people whove been on hold for twenty minutes long enough to hear the outage alert at least ten times just so they can ask us questions that would have been explained in the outage alert i would get calls like when is it going to be back up what happened why cant i get in im literally praying for an asteroid strike because humanity has become that damn stupid i get a lot of really belligerent callers who are threatening to take me to task if i dont get them a solution to log in soon i keep telling them that there is nothing to be done but one lady i have to write up a complaint on to my manager for follow up with hr because she crossed a line in her complaints this is the pattern of the day and finally it happened two cubes over from me a loud angry call goes into a headset motherfucker clean the shit out of your ears you sit on hold listening to a message that answers all these questions and you still wait to ask me what you already know howd some peckerwood motherfucker like you get a job with a computer she called him peckerwood maybe the caller is in the south she growled into the phone some incoherent words hung up grabbed her purse and walked out just then my boss comes running up after hearing what was yelled at a client wondering what happened the lady i was on the phone with who wasnt being belligerent heard what was said and asked me specifically if she really heard someone tell a caller to clean the shit out of their ears i apologized to the caller and explained were inundated with calls and weve gotten so many rude callers our ability to keep professional has strained to its limits she was understanding and hoped everything worked out i dont know what her standing will be tomorrow im pretty sure shes gonna get fired but for a minute i looked back on what she said into the phone and managed to laugh she lived the dream i wish i didnt envy her a little bit but how many times have i wanted to say the same thing to a rude caller update update update update update she was not fired but shes been suspended for a couple of days and is has to get some counselling the call was recorded and though it was not made available to anyone i learned that the caller was very nasty to her shes going to be coming back but shes had some other things that have been bothering her and its all compounded 
i work at a hospital doctors are the worst people to support and because of that i see a voodoo witchdoctor for all my health needs asside from that most people are pretty average accept for benjamin benjamin works in the mailroom of my buiding hes always friendly and smiles at everyone he also has down syndrome but we sort of take care of him and let him know what a good job he does ever chance we get so today im derping at my desk and i get a call its ben me helpdesk this is wonderweirdo ben hi wonderweirdo i need someone to come look at the computer in the mail room it wont get onto the net me okay lets do some trouble shooting ben i already tried a couple of things i rebooted the computer and when that didnt work i tried to refresh the ip and a dns flush that didnt work either i tried to ping yahoocom but nothing came back me impressed wow you did all that already okay did you check to see if the network cable is connected ben yeah the ligh is flashing that orange color me nodding okay ill put in a ticket and get someone from deskside over there ben thank you me you know ben that was some pretty good work you did you should come over to it and work with us ben giggling nah i see the way you guys go crazy over there im too smart to do that i chuckle for a second and after i put in the ticket and end the call i realize how a kid with down syndrome did the trouble shooting before he called for help and how that kid with down syndrome had better computer skills than the doctors i support then it hit me that he said he was too smart to come over to it and work because he can see how we all go crazy so he said hes basically smarter than me after taking a minute to look around at myself and my peers i think hes right 
my first job out of college was a catchall position im an aerospace engineer with a minor in mechanical and ive worked it my whole life before i graduated so they had me consulting on design drafting modeling programming everything so im working at a small aerospace company making a system for light aircraft hence my faa story one of the things i had to do while i was there was design a database to track all the paperwork and keep track of everything that we madetestedsold for a year period so i do spent about months getting everything ironed out to the point where i could roll it out to the office like whole users i sent a page document with it on how to operate it and tell them that if they have an error they are to click on nothing i put a lot of effort into error reporting this was my first groundup sql program and it integrated a lot of external functionality with office documents pdfs automatically printing reports etc so there were a lot of moving parts that could go wrong they didnt listen so i sent out a link to everybody that would update the program on their computer with the only explanation being improved error reporting functionality and tell them that their old program will no longer work so they have to update fast forward to about lunch time when i suddenly hear the old monty python line no one expects the spanish inquisition at maximum volume from down the hall closely followed by holy s and a few other choice surprise expletives i quickly hop out of my seat and walk down the hall only to find my boss is sitting about feet from his desk looking a bit pale as i walk in and try to not laugh gtgtboss man what the hell just happened gtgtme you hit an error gtgtboss man but why did it yell at me gtgtme because nobody was telling me what errors they were getting so i rigged up a notification for myself and this was the simplest solution to the problem what the update really did was add a few lines of code to set the system volume to and play a wav file at full blast so i would hear it and i could come talk to the user about what they were doing when the error occurred and read what the error said needless to say they were less than thrilled with my improved error reporting functionality and i told them id take it out as long as they continued to report errors to me and they gladly complied tldr the average user would rather talk to the developer than face the wrath of the spanish inquisition edit yay gold thanks mister anonymous you seem to be everywhere on the web
a little rantey as i am still annoyed over this mostly because i shouldve seen it coming my brotherinlaw came to me with a request two weeks before christmas if i could preconfigure a new gaming laptop for his sister and her year old son in such a way it would be as kidsafe as possible sure no big deal i upgraded the windows it came with to windows set up a mother account as admin and a kid account as a limited user preinstalled the games it came with and installed steam all setup for her account to top it off i installed a copy of avira antivirus and set everything up to update automatically then gave my bil specific instructions to tell his sister never to allow the kid to log into her account laptop is packaged back up and goes under her tree and yesterday i receive a frantic phone call if i can come over to my bils place as the laptop has problems i boot it up to windows and find a cryptolockerlike virus has made its way onboard glad its not connected to any network just as a client on the guest wireless i ask for the history december th laptop is unpacked and little vandal is overjoyed joy that quickly turns to anger as he cant install random apps december th little vandal has gotten his moms password and finds he still cannot install the crapware he wants so he disables uac and uninstalls avira december morning cryptolocker has done its work and has destroyed the laptop december midday i pull my hair out in frustration fortunately i had a recovery disc with me so i just wiped the os and did a reinstall windows automatically reactivated i reinstall avira and lock it with a separate password unfortunately i had to still give the mom admin rights but i emphasized how it was definitely that little vandal managed to get access to her account that messed things up laptop works again mom is happy with me and angry with the kid bil beers me and i tell them all that the next time i will be charging money uac user account control tldr if you allow the vandals to enter italy dont cry if rome is sacked
to set the scene im currently a student studying computer science and i work at my universitys help and repair desk ive seen a lot everything from a natty lights turning into a macbook replacements to grad students losing dissertations to cryptolocker people still using dialup in and of course tons of virus as a result of college students clicking ads in an endless search of free music movies and porn this specific case happened about a year ago and i want to share it because i think about it from time to time i was sitting in my consulting station probably browsing reddit and attempting to homework when our receptionist greeted a user took his information a brief description of his problem and added his ticket to the queue i dont remember his name but his problem description was just needs to remove audio file from phone figured heh this should be easy a typical old faculty member needing help with his phone kinda thing i asked him to come sit at my station and took a look at his problem he sat down next to me and pulled out his phone an old gs ii i think and an even older laptop i asked him what was wrong and he told me that he had some voicemails on his phone that he wanted to save on his computer kind of an odd request but i went with it anyway he unlocks his phone for me and i navigate to his phone app and pull up the voicemail while i was looking at the phone he said there were voicemails from the previous weekend were the ones he wanted saved i played the first one on speaker to see if they were playing properly and it was really quick message hey dad just wanted to let you know im on my way home see you soon love ya bye oh no i looked up from the phone and i saw this poor man start crying i put two and two together and my worst thought was confirmed this poor man had just lost his daughter in a car accident a few days before and he want her last voicemails to him so he and his wife could still hear her voice whenever they missed her not breaking down into tears for his man was harder than any ticket ive ever taken his daughter was my age and it immediately made me think of my family and how much they missed me i knew then i was going to do everything in my power to get this right my first thought was to just plug an aux cord into the headphone jack on his phone and record the audio using audacity on his laptop but when i plugged an aux cable into his phone and laptop i couldnt get anything to record shit i tried using my headphones to see if i could hear anything on his phone and nothing i looked inside the aux jack and i all i could see was dirt and something sticking out of a caked on mess i ran his phone upstairs to our repair desk and grabbed compressed air tweezers qtips alcohol swabs just about anything that i could thing of that would clean out his headphone jack after about min or so of cleaning i could finally hear audio coming out of my headphones relieved i recorded all the voicemail messages and saved them for him to be able to listen to whenever he wanted i felt awful for what this guy had to go through and i was glad i was able to help him to me this was a reminder of how quickly life can change im sure everyone on this subreddit will sympathize with me whenever i need to complain about bad users or just dumb people but just remember for some users you can make a world of difference for them edit wow thanks to everyone showing support i never thought working tech support would ever leave me with a story i would never forget edit thanks for the gold as awesome as it is to get gold it feels different getting it for a story like this
my story takes place at a radio station yesterday i got a ticket with the title gt no sound need it to work with the very detailed description gt please fix it i didnt know it yet but ive been waiting for this ticket for about a year a similar thing happened then and ive been plotting what id do in a similar situation since then i came to users desk and immediately knew what i had to do what i had prepared for what i was destined to do what would be my legacy in this company i was about to blow this poor users mind i saw the little circle with the red line through it next to the speaker in the task bar and my adrenaline started pumping it was time so i wave both my hands over the keyboard humming quietly and as im waving my hands around i subtly hit the mute button on the keyboard i turn to the user and proclaim its fixed and walk away from the mind explosion behind me i hear what followed by a click and the sound of a promotion audio clip playing and i know from this point on my story will be passed on to generations the story of the machine whisperer the legendary pc guy the tech support wizard from this day on i have to lead a life of secrecy what if anyone found out what i had actually done i would become an outcast declared a freak driven into exile im the hero this station deserves they wont hunt me because i know magic because im not their hero im a silent guardian a watchful protector a tech support wizard 
so this happened to me a few days ago and if its taught me anything its that jobs will apparently come back to haunt you from the grave a little bit of background im a former arcade technician and used to coown a small business which i quit a year ago for reasons every so often ill get stray clients calling me for service from looking at old business cards and a few times ive actually gone and done work for them no problem extra money is never an issue i got a call a couple days ago from an angry customer that i vaguely remember servicing nearly years ago who we shall call al the exchange that ensued goes as follows gt me hello this is mini speaking gt al yes you serviced a machine of mine a while back and something has gone wrong with it i understand my warranty is still good and i was hoping to get this fixed as soon as possible at this point im wondering how she got my number i recently got a new phone with a new number so this really didnt make much sense but i carried on gt me alright miss im sorry to say i dont work there anymore but i can certainly come out and do the job for you for a fee if thats not an issue could you please tell me what machine and what sort of issues its having perhaps i can work it out over the phone gt al but the machine is still under warranty shouldnt the repair be free gt me no maam i dont work for company anymore if you ask me to come and repair your machine ill be working freelance that warranty is only valid with company who to be honest i dont know if they exist anymore gt al but the warranty has your name on it that should mean you honour it no matter what at this point shes getting irritated apparently she expects me to do the work for free gt me while it may have my name on it it doesnt mean i have to honour it granted yes ill discount because it was my work to begin with im not going to come out and service the machine for free as i said the warranty is only with company who i am not a part of anymore gt al this is ridiculous i was told by formerboss at company that youd come out and do this no problem i really need this fixed as soon as possible and i was guaranteed there wouldnt be a problem gt me im sorry maam im sorry for any inconvenience but im certainly not going to come out for free to do work that company should be handling even if it has my name on it you still havent said what the issue is gt al no the issue here is that i have a warranty a signed contract with your name on it gt me but that is only valid with company im not going to go out and do their work for them on my free time for free at this point im ready to just hang up the phone ive been polite and professional even though i didnt have to be at all and to be honest im rather confused now because im sure ive said to her im not their employee anymore gt al but i was assured by company that this would be handled for free they told me you would have no problems and this warranty was guaranteed for the lifetime of the machine gt me maam what part of i dont work there anymore dont you understand i dont care what he said im not tied to them anymore im seriously happy to help but im not going to fuckin come out and do this for free just because the guy i worked for a year ago said i would thats not how it works gt al im reporting you this is absolutely ridiculous gt me hah to who my mum at that point she hung up its been days now and going over that im still just as confused as to what she was thinking as i was when she called me if not more people will never cease to amaze me and i still dont know how she got my number oo edit oh dear oo i certainly wasnt expecting to make it to rall im humbled and i took out an erroneous that was in the wrong place 
today i am a semi retired semi burnt out old tech spending my declining years in a small rural area but when i was little more than a pimply faced youth i was the technical manager of a electronics distribution company that was in the process of being swallowed up by a big multinational it was an exciting time complete upgrade of the network new servers and computers integration into a multinational system extra it support staff and i was in charge of the project from our end exciting times in a very short time the project was completed and would you believe it well under the expected time and under budget it was even fun to complete then the fun came to a crashing halt in the teleconference between us and the executive in charge of it for the company that now owned us i was expecting a thanks for exceeding all requirements maybe even a small bonus instead i was told that the systems would all be run from new head office and there would only be it positions to support all offices across the country all hardware support was being outsourced the real kicker was that the positions being offered where little more than tier positions to submit tickets to the hardware support company or to the head office support team the salaries being offered was less than my current salary i calmly asked him to confirm that he was firing people and offering a pittance to the who would remain then i simply said no dropped my id and keys on the desk picked up my coffee cup and left the building all the it staff followed me i never formally resigned but i think they got the idea that i was not coming back i got a job delivering pizza for the two months it took me to find a new it position i still made more money than they had offered me tldr a young it manager has his first brush with corporate management refuses to play the game 
i love my cousins oi not in that way but theyre often thick as mince so it was with no shock to me when i get a text from one of them saying that he cant connect to the internet oh and someones changed the name of his wifi to stop stealing my wifi having been to his house before and connected to his wifi i know for a fact he has a wireless router and a password set up by his isp i go through basic troubleshooting turn it on and off it it plugged in etc and eventually say he should look at the label on his router and connect to the ssid written on it he says its not on the list and asks me to come round and have a look im a minute train journey from his house so come round feels more like a day trip anyway i get there and sure enough the ssid on his router isnt there i try the stop stealing ssid tried the password written on the router and it didnt work i ask him if hes changed the wifi password he of course said he didnt have one that he went into the admin controls and turned it off a week ago because he got a new phone and forgot what the password was i go back to the router and show him the label with the ssid and the password its at this point i noticed that all the lights on the front are geblinkken on et eauf rapido and then it clicks he made his wifi public someone nearby accidentally connected to his and thinks its their own wifi yet they had enough computer knowledge or googlefu or luck to get into the admin page and lock it down so i look up the default admin credentials on my phone turns out its admin with no password reset the router to factory settings log in to the admin console set up a secure admin password of my choosing and set up wpa and a password of his choosing and told him not to remove it and changed the ssid to no its not your wifi tldr its not your wifi if you dont have physical access to the router
so im doing my casual helping hand labor at college making sure all professors have backups and working cad software everything okay happy flowers everywhere but then the fire nation attacked i was done doing backups of everyones favourite glassesprofessor after getting his laptop back happy ending when we suddenly see his superior mrangryglasses come in and point at me with an angry yet cold look gtmrangryglasses crescent you playing tech support student was funny but now you managed to screw everything this time pack your stuff and get out me and glassesprofessor couldnt get to understand what was just going on why was he being like that gtme excuse me professor mrangryglasses but what are you talking about gtmrangryglasses you know what you did you caused a massive security breach at this college pack your stuff and get out ill let the principal know what you did gtme but what then i saw the security guard coming through the door making me signs to stand up and follow him i still had no idea what was going on thankfully our hero glassesprofessor decided to stand up for me gtglassesprofessor woah woah woah hold it mrangryglasses crescent did nothing like that hes been a good student and tech support guy you are not taking him away until we all get to know what happened gtme please professor mrangryglasses what are you even me accusing of another teacher heard what was going on the head teacher of the carrer gtmrsengineering what is even going on here what are you even doing to crescent gtmrangryglasses ah head teacher good that you are here he pointed at me gtmrangryglasses this kid messed with the secretarys computer now her files are lost the screen is broken and a robotic voice is controlling it my capacity to even was broken first im never allowed to handle computers like that second its obvious why third what was that robotic voice and broken screen gtmrsengineering calm down mrangryglasses we need to first take a look at that virus of yours and so we were escorted to the principals office and a very angry secretary was staring at me after a discussion with everyone involved i was able to handle the computer what could possibly go wrong i was just on the edge of being expelled so i take a look at the screen and immediately recognize it it was no virus no spyware it was something much worse for everyone in the room windows gtme professors this isnt a virus this is the new version of windows everyone was staring at me i sigh and look at them gtme secretary you installed a recommended update right gtsecretary yes for security measures now look at what it happened with everything you did to the other computers i struggled not to loose my mind but the kind glassesprofessor help me explain the whole windows thing and the secretary nearly cried for what she did not the only one so i reverted windows back to everything was still working good good everyone was happy except mrangryglasses who refused to say a thing i need a break tldr secretary got windows by herself i deserve the chair update so i did have a meeting with the board of teachers and the director in case it wasnt clear this is how colleges in mexico work or so its my understanding i summarised the whole story to the director of the college with glassesprofessor to my side she was patient and hear us both with mrangryglasses sitting on the other end of the table she concluded it was a extremely serious accusation and turns out the rumors were true his attitude and hes already undergoing internal investigation for bribery while hes unlikely to be fired for reasons i cannot learn about i wont be assisting any of his classes in the future so im completely exonerated of all charges and to avoid any future incidents we are revoking all user permissions and hope to create an official it department ill have some compensation for the incident no semester payment for two years woo hoo and a couple of other things thanks everyone for their wonderful support your ideas will help this college have a better future cheers
i saw a story yesterday about letting users set ticket priority and it hit home with me we allow the same thing so naturally every single ticket i get is marked critical i just laugh about it now anyway about a week ago one of my favorite users kurt came over to my cube with a problem hey man he said ive been going back and forth for a while trying to decide whether to mark this case minor or moderate i dont want to cause you guys too much trouble what do you think kurt bless your heart i said i havent looked at that field in five years then i dropped everything i was doing and helped him set up his new phone because he deserved it
so this was an interesting one we have a user who uses a laptop and a docking station the docking station is wired into an ethernet port so if the wifi went down for whatever reason there is a backup wired connection well i was tasked to install a new desktop computer in the same room as the user unfortunately we have run out of ports in our switch to accommodate this extra desktop pc so it was agreed that we would recycle this users ethernet cable from his docking station so i simply unplug his cable and plug it into the new desktop i was having trouble assigning an ip from our dhcp server so after a bit of faffing about i realized the network cable was coiled up and unplugged from the wall under the table so i plug it into wall and patch the switch upstairs job done hours later i get a complaint from the irate user saying now that he is using wifi his network connection is very slow and unusable and demands we sort a cable for him so i pick up a new cable connect one end into his docking station coil up the other end and leave it dangling under his table and ask him to reboot his laptop not had a complaint since
at the university i work for we regularly get calls from parents trying to do everything for their children even though we arent really supposed to do a password reset for someone who isnt the account holder our standard procedure in the case of a parent trying to reset their kids password is to get the account holder on the line and ask their permission for the password reset before continuing with freshman orientation coming up we had several calls like this today but this one was a little different gt me university service desk this is nathan how can i help you gt mother i need to reset my sons password and get some information about his account i wont be going with him to orientation and want to write it all down for him gt me do you have your son there with you we will need to get his permission to reset his password gt mother of course let me go get him gt mother yelling get down here i need you to give the man on the phone permission to look at your account gt son hello gt me this is nathan from university service desk i just need your permission to reset your password gt son no my password does not need to be reset we will call you again if there are any issues gt phone slams down but line does not drop gt background yelling for the remainder of the time before i leave the line i think i may have just been party to the moment a child became independent

i dont technically have a job in it but i work in a games shop so i spend most of my day reformatting playstations and showing people how to connect controllers one day a kid came in with his parents he was around years old he walked up to the counter put a copy of gta v for the in front of me and announced that it didnt work and he wanted his money back i glanced at his parents unsure whether or not they knew that this was an s game that they were allowing their child to play but they looked annoyed so i didnt comment me sure no problem whats the problem exactly kid so i put in the disc and thats all fine but then i put in disc and nothing changes it still wants disc me okay that is odd ill just throw it in my xbox and have a look he looked annoyed that i wasnt just taking his word but i ignored it and carried on the customer is almost never right about these things i test it in front of him and everything works fine i look up at his parents as i put the game back on the counter kid but it doesnt work on my xbox both him and his father looked annoyed at me i dont know how it even crossed my mind the only explanation is that this job has desensitised me to the total lack of common sense of the general public me hmm probably a silly question but when it asks for disc you take disc out of the tray before inserting disc right i looked at the kid silence i look up at the father who is also staring at his kid dad you did that right more silence i slide the game across the counter have a nice day
like most sane individuals i am on my countries national do not call list unfortunately a few less than scrupulous companies didnt get the memo this is the story of how i provided tech support to one in particular for the past few months i have been receiving calls from telemarketers asking if i want voicespammers services the first few times i politely told them to respect the do not call list and do not call again when they kept on ignoring that i figured it was time to use my voip support abilities for some fun so one evening i was hanging out with my family raising my kids and such when i hear my phone politely inform me that there is a long distance call coming in looking at the caller id i see the number of someone who legally should not be calling me being slightly bored i answered and prepared to have some fun this telemarketing company gave away alot of information about its system within the first few seconds of a call by having seconds of silence followed by the unmistakable default conference join sound i already know what software they are running how they manage their agent queue and quite a few ways to forcefully ask them to not call again once i heard the conference connect beep i have to work quickly to set my trap hoping that they would take the bait me tech support can i have your agent please spammer um hello im calling from company and me im going to stop you there your system has detected that there is a issue with your workstation and has automatically sent you through to tech support can i have your agent id please confused spammer is this mr psychotc im speaking with me no your system is still displaying the last expected connection on the screen however you have been connected to tech support due to the issue which your system detected can i have your agent id so i can help you with this im obviously making a guess about what type of setup they might have hoping that im close enough to completely lure the prey into the trap sheep oh ok my id is probably a default setup value incremented by the number of agents me ok thank you now i just need some info while i pull up your system can you take a quick look at your phone does it say polycom on the front sheep yes me ok im showing a potential issue with your phone i need you to run a diagnostic on the phone can you let me know when you are ready sheep on the ramp to the abattoir ok what do i have to do me ok on your phone i need you to press and at the same time let me know when you are done sheep ok its asking for a password me hoping their voip admin left things at default ok now enter as the password then press the button marked enter mutton unjoin conference sound and it has been a few months since i last heard from them some technical details for those who do not work with voip and polycom products the sequence above is the reload firmware and reset to factory defaults hotkey and the default password to allow the reload most polycom phones take about minutes to reload the firmware reboot and reload settings more if they didnt setup dhcp properly tldr i know more about your phone system than your company does edit grammartypo and a thank you to everyone who upvoted downvoted or replied especially haakon for letting us know about lenny

got a priority request from a corneroffice executive her new laptop was broken a minor fix easily corrected by system restore while the restore was going on ms senior executive was having an epic rant we waste both my time and yours by purchasing these unreliable offbrand laptops whoever heard of d laptops anyway i was mystified for a moment and then silently turned her laptop around so that she could see that d was actually hp upside down she turned bright red and then started laughing then she gave me a glare that could freeze ice and said if i find this story posted on facebook your employment with this company is over i nodded and solemnly agreed this episode was absolutely inappropriate for facebook 
i thought id share one of my proudest moments as a bench tech i suspect most of us who are interested in this type of work frequently encounter customers with lost data usually the issue is resolved with a simple undelete application of which there are many sometimes we have to roll up our sleeves and image the disk and attempt to recover readable files no matter the method its the best feeling in the world to be able to call the customer and tell then you did recover their wedding pictures or important school work the look on their faces when they come in to pick up the freshly burned dvd with their critical data makes you forget all the mouthbreathers with their insect ridden emachines almost but then theres that feeling you get in the pit of your stomach when you plug in the customers pc and hear the click bang or boing whirllllll of a failed hdd while the bios reports no bootable drive you have to look them in the eye and tell them you are already sure the drive is dead and there is nothing you can do about it you hand them the little card with the number to drivesavers or similar professional data recovery and warn them its going to cost a lot of money you are kind enough not to scold them about their lack of a backup that would only cause pain now they already know flash back to one morning i get to the shop to find a customer standing outside the front door with one of those ubiquitous claimshell dell pcs under an arm the look in his eyes alone tells me all i really need to know about the situation i tell him to come in and put the pc on the counter we exchange niceties as i plug in the monitor and keyboard and turn it on we encounter the message he told me to expect the pc cant find a bootable drive i open it up to make sure everything is plugged in and notice the drive is not spinning not good but there could be an innocent answer i pull the drive and try it out with a known good power supply unfortunately with the same result i tell him customer it seems you have a failed hard drive since it wont spin up i cant really help you his exact words it doesnt matter what it costs please get my data back it turns out this guy is an office manager at a local veterinary practice it must be a fairly big organization as they employ about vets and about other folks including cleaning staff etc this pc under his arm contains the entirety of their accounting everything payroll tax stuff accounts receivable everything he explains that they will go out of business if they cant get the data on that drive i let him know that data recovery from a failed drive takes specialized skills and resources neither of which we have in this mom n pop computer repair outfit i give him the drivesavers card and tell him to be prepared for a bill in the s if they are successful at all considering the importance of his data i thought it was a nobrainer to go this route is nothing to a medical office likely billing out over a million dollars each year well i would not be writing this if the dude had any sense hes like for data recovery and it might take weeks i dont know cant you do it i tell him the truth if i try to recover his data and fail there is a huge chance ill make it worse and less likely for a professional data recovery specialist to get it he really needs to go to the specialist yet despite this he continues to talk me into it telling me they cant possibly go weeks without this pc they need their data by tomorrow for tax reasons so i told him to give me his number and id do some research and get back to him i call in my fellow nerds and we research our googlefu was strong that day we end up with a list of about or so things to try to order them by risk we even manage to find two of the same model drives from the junkyard downstairs to look at by early afternoon i think weve learned what we can and i call the customer i tell him ill try it but its foolish he describes an office in pure chaos and says they are willing to take the risk i tell him im going to charge hour for my time successful or not to which he agrees i also tell him to bring in any other dells they purchased as the same time as the broken one as i want more drives from the same batch if possible my boss prints out a unique addendum to our usual waver all customers sign something to protect us from the consequences of potentially likely destroying this data and the other pc drives as well guy shows up minutes later with sweat on his brow and three more clamshell dells were lucky the serial numbers on these drives are close enough be the same batch as the broken one these are a better match than the drives we already found so we now have the one failed drive and three good ones i go shopping to pick up items needed for the potential data recovery methods i purchase some dry ice a couple of torque bits and eyeglass screwdriver to fit ziplock bags and microfiber gloves from a photography shop i try to make arrangements with a buddy who works in a chip fabrication plant to use their clean room if needed that was impossible but he was able to get me a couple of those dust free bunny suits and face masks unfortunately they were pink but this was war so i did not complain the first thing i try is swapping the pcb between a good drive and the failed one the good drive works fine with the failed drives pcb but the opposite is not true next we tried putting the drive in a usb enclosure and plastic bags and cooling the drive with the dry ice after hour we tried again again without success i then tried powering the drive and kinda spinning it back and forth hoping to jump start the motor or something needless to say that was not working we needed to open the drive up and see what secrets might be inside we took apart one of the three good drives to see if it was even possible to do a platter swap ive taken apart many drives and knew the most difficult part would be not damaging the heads sometimes you have to remove the arms holding the heads to even get the platter out but luck was on our side the arm in these particular drives could be pushed down and would not get in the way when we pulled the platters even better they smoothly went back onto the platters without hanging when you carefully pushed it back i dawned the bunny suit much to the delight of the other nerds and took the drive and tools into the bathroom i set an audiobook playing and started scrubbing wall to ceiling with wet rags to collect all the dust i could i taped over the air vent and along the door frame then i collected hot water into a trash can and added the dry ice that much dry ice in that small room made quite a bit of fog which supposedly helps bring any dust out of the air i dont know if this actually works but i was concerned about adding that much co into a small sealed room i made it a point to hold my breath if i was reaching down to the floor after the fog was gone i noticed no ill effects and proceeded to phase the actual platter swap went without incident and hardly warrants description in this story just a few screws and aluminum spacer rings i just tried to line up the two platters so they were aligned the same way relative to each other in the new case obviously i could not get nearly the same level of precision at the physical scale of the data on the drive but i did the best i could we held our breath while we booted up the bench pc with a linux data recovery live cd it found the drive i started to read an image from the drive which seemed to work fine i did a typical data recovery on the image and i found files i actually recovered that data the customer was thrilled and didnt blink an eye at the bill something like or the fact we destroyed the other drives in the other pcs i even got a tip for risking o deprivation and the ridicule of my peers that evening we had pizza and mountain dew paid for out of the register i kicked butt at counter strike my wife called to say my mother in law was not able to visit after all it was the perfect day
a tale from awhile back i was relatively fresh on senior staff senior staff and management have access to a pretty great albeit arcane tool that lets us essentially enable or disable any box while completely bypassing the billing system while extremely handy for troubleshooting its a recipe for abuse in the wrong hands therefore everything we do with it is thoroughly logged but thats just it its only logged nobody checks these logs unless something comes up back then something came up at the time we were trying something new when it came to office parties it being overwhelmingly men and sales csr overwhelmingly women we came up with the creative idea of having joint csr parties great idea that works to this day but there was this incident a likeable frontline guy i knew had a pretty sweet girlfriend with an odd quirk shes young very young legal in canada at the time age of consent laws changed since but their age gap was already borderline creepy still none of my business this guys manager was well over years older than him and at our first joint csr party he hit on his young girlfriend and stuff ensued the story only became official watercooler talk material two months later when she was officially pregnant my frontline coworker was losing his mind here crying during his breaks and i soon learned the details his manager was always a bit shady but damn he was more than old enough to be his girlfriends father thing i knew though was that he almost got fired once by direction for giving shady discounts to some members of his extended family since he wasnt in my good graces after i heard about all this and on a hunch i decided to check his internal tools logs i discovered fifteen manuallyprovisioned modems and just as many cable boxes with test profiles aka full access to everything and unlimited speeds and unmonitored data usage no related accounts just a series of mac addresses that werent linked to anything that blatant theft of service was already more than enough to get him fired but just to be sure i put our horrible plaintext password offender status to good use and read his emails and yep hes actually got evidence in his private mailbox that hes been giving freebies to his family now i was already pissed about the cheating with a girl too young to know whats up but being stupid enough to so blatantly steal service through support tools really made me angry thats the kind of thing that could make us all lose access to tools we need to get things done wasnt particularly interested in being officially involved in all this though so i just took the relevant logs showing hes freeriding his family along with email evidence logged in into an untraceable training account and printed them on all corporate printers all corporate printers yeah i wasted paper i apologize to the dead trees he lasted twelve hours reader is free to determine if he deserved it either for quasipedophilia abuse of emergency technical tools or just being that dumb personally at the time i deemed he was guilty on all three counts all of bytewaves tales on 
i am a semi retired semi burnt out old tech who left support in the big city to spend my declining years in a small country town helping small business home users and the occasional farmer in spite of the fact that i left the city over years ago i still get a cry for help from the big smoke australian for city this one came from a favorite client a silk or queens counsel for those of you not from oz he was a lawyer and a very senior one at that he had just moved on from his aging blackberry after many years of being prodded by his wife who was an apple fanatic he now had a shiny fruit phone that he was rapidly growing fond of after a couple of calls when he asked a few simple how to type questions he was very happy with the new phone till a couple of weeks later when i got a panicked phone call qc mountainwombat there is something wrong with my phone i am missing calls it doesnt ring anymore should i return it mw hmmm qc look on the side of the phone remember i told you how to turn the ring off so you wont be disturbed in court is the mute switch on qc oh mw you know that i deal with the criminal element on a daily basis and that i could engage any number of people to ensure your silence mw yes qc i trust that you are going to be discreet and not tell my wife about this i wouldnt hear the end of it i promised to remain silent forever and that his wife wouldnt learn of it from me provided the account was settled promptly we both laughed a few days later i received a small wooden box in the mail that included a cheque a bottle of bundaberg master distillers collection rum and a note that read as agreed i love a client with a sense of humour edit words spelling

about a year back a good friend of mine worked at my universitys it help desk where students could come with computer issues between classes i would often come over to hang out with him and other people working there that i knew from our unis computer club most issues people wanted help with were usually pretty easy to fix things internet problems viruses and malware changed settings and broken hardware which we dont offer support for but usually help troubleshoot sometimes something more serious like a shot os on a somewhat busy day this guy suddenly storms in with a huge desktop tower now usually people came in with laptops phones and tablets so we were all a little taken by surprise he slams it on the counter and explains that he just built it the day before and it doesnt want to turn on my friend asks me if i would take a look at it with him since i can get quite enthusiastic about self built desktops we open it up and i immediately notice that this guy did not mess around as the gtx and the asus rog motherboard spring into view immediately we bring over a monitor mouse and keyboard plug everything in and hit the power button nothing we tried it one more time and wrote down the error code on the motherboard a quick google search revealed that something was wrong with the processor we double checked all the cables made sure the psu was strong enough to power the rig and even plugged in a spare psu we had lying around all with the same result we tell him that it looks like that his cpu might be faulty and i ask if i can detach the cooler to take a look at the cpu itself maybe it is physically damaged he agrees and as i screw off the heatsink i immediately notice that there is no thermal paste underneath it i point this out to him and ask if when he started it for the first time it did turn on but then killed the cpu due to it overheating he replies that he is sure he applied the thermal paste i show him that there was nothing i between the cooler and the cpu itself and ask him were he put the thermal paste turns out he put it on the wrong side of the processor and probably gooed up and bent the socket pins we ended up giving him the contact support information from the mobo retailer and manufacturer and then sending him on his way tldr dude comes into it help desk with a self built desktop that wont turn on turns out he put the thermal paste on the wrong side of the cpu 
this happened a few years ago when i worked at a small web design firm because we were so small us designers would sometimes take to the phones and offer support for our clients it could be anything from explaining why something wasnt working to giving them support on a cms a bit of back story to this call we had a new client who we had just completed a total rebrand for new website logo company colours fliers the works it looked awesome except for one thing the client insisted on us keeping an animated gif of a little guy waving a flag whatever her money i get a call one day after she received the fliers and business cards that we had redesigned and had printed for her i think you can figure where this is going gt client hi i received the cards and fliers today there is a problem with the printing gtme thats not good can you let me know what it is and i can get onto the printing company to sort it out for you gt client sure the wee man on the logo he isnt animated like on the website hes still gtme silent gt client hello i said the little man isnt moving like on the site thats what i wanted the same as on the site gtme erm ahh hrm okay you do realise that having the little man move isnt possible gt client why not gtme because it is a printed picture on paper gt client but it moves on the website and it is just a picture there gtme um i dont know what to say thats not how it works ill pass you to my supervisor she genuinely couldnt figure out why the gif wasnt moving on printed paper i was completely lost for words edit words also front page this is my first post to hit it i guess im like internet famous now ill work on my thank you speech edit ow my inbox
the call center i work at caters to the employees for our company we help with anything from troubleshooting hardware at the warehouse to error messages from sites that we support one of the sites we support is for the employees to be able to access their paystubs banking info timecards etc and for the most part the most challenging bit about it is trying to navigate to the damn thing i can relate i can empathize but design issues are out of my hands my caller lady in question was having problems with her password sounded easy enough id dealt with many similar calls in the past if only id known what i did now innocent past self just hang up that call right now it started out with the normal routine got her employee number her warehouse number and name gtshe told me i just got transferred to this number and i just want to access my time card ive signed in and everything and i cant get my time card gtso you were able to sign into the main site just fine i asked to confirm gtyes she says i find out that to access the time card you actually have to sign in again mmkay whatever design choice is a little annoying but we all have to deal right so i tell her to use the same login info that she did originally to get into the site gtshe tells me its not working i just changed my password why is this not working i dont know lady you tell me of course i try to keep as polite as possible asked her to verify her username asked her if her keyboard has the caps lock on is the num lock on you know the usual gttheres nothing wrong with my computer i just got this mac its a computer theres nothing wrong with my computer umok gtat this point i can hear her frustration heighten are they doing this on purpose she says gtdoing what i asked not knowing what i was in for gttheyre blocking me from my time card they arent allowed to do that thats illegal theyre doing this on purpose i wont stand for this oh my god i dont know what the proper response is i try to reassure her that the company wouldnt do something like that i try to kindly tell her that possibly she mistyped her credentials or password gtshe shuts me down no i just changed my password i know what my password is ok time for plan b i ask her to try to log out and try and change her password again she is adamant against it she pushes eager to take whatever is left of my patience and crush it from existence gti dont want to change my password again at this point i am desperate to get out of this call i login via my own username and password everything works fine i log into my time card damn thing works fine on my end i tell her that this doesnt seem to be an issue with the site a nice way of telling her that it is user error from her end gtshe tells me no no no thats with your user that it works with ok thats not my username somehow i manage to convince her to change her password again i wait in silence while she goes through the process a part of me wished that she offered to call us back while she did this i normally start up small talk but i frankly didnt care at this point she resets the password she tries to login again it says usernamepassword incorrect someone end my suffering now she is not pleased gtwhy is it saying this now whatwhat did you do to my username you broke it oh hell no this accusation throws me off i try to tell her that this username should be the same i did nothing nothing she is still convinced i am guilty gtshe mentions to me i have a witness to this conversation you know my friend has been watching me talk with you this entire time why is this happening to me she starts muttering profanities about the site she continues to blame me i decide it is time to talk to one of our specialists for help i walk a bit too fast when i come to him i almost trip over myself in relief when i explain the situation and he offers to take the call from me my only regret is that i didnt come to him sooner i come back to the caller ready to let goonly to find she is not quite done with me gtafter i tell her that someone else is going to take the call she asks wait a minute whats your name i hate it when they do this nonetheless i give her my entire name i spell out my last name she tells me to slow down gti try to spell it again and then she finally says ok you know you need to speak more clearly ok i have been more than patient with you this entire call this is the least i deserve im sorrywhat im seething but then i speak more slowly she is finally able to write down my info i park the call my specialist picks up the call i sigh in relief at this finally being over and chat the ticket number to my specialist to look over my troubleshooting steps at this time i take my much needed break i end up taking a walk to a secluded area and crying i start worrying that ill be in trouble and shell report me i wasnt thinking clearly however this is not where it ends when i return from my break my specialist is walking over to me oh no i think except then he has me sit down and talks with me gtshe was rude to me too started cussing and giving me a hard time oh my god gthe continues so i put her on hold and called her warehouse and talked to the administrator on duty he tells me that he told him about her behavior he found that this woman is not a model employee shes pulled this kind of behavior before he tells me that he would like me to make a summary of everything that happened and send him the email and cc our supervisor and our manager he makes sure i think none of this is my fault and tells me that the warehouse is going to look into writing her up i could die of happiness i could have been satisfied with just thatbut then half an hour later my specialist comes back gtshe called back he tells me with a grin oh gtwhat happened gt she was much nicer this time to the person who answered pft of course and then he tells me gtthey found out she was fat fingering and she didnt type in her password correctly this whole time yup update thank you to everyone who has been responding i didnt anticipate my story picking up like this i usually dont frequent reddit so im sorry that im not able to respond to everyone im going to read through everyones comments though thank you for the advice and encouragement this experience has beeninteresting by the way i got a couple emails recently from the users admin and gm apologizing for her behavior and saying that they are personally speaking with her about it nothing further than that but i think at this point im not really angry about it anymore also a few of my co workers who sit near me gave me some chocolate hugs and some of the more senior csrs told me some more user horror stories which made me feel much better 
this didnt happen directly to me but it did happen to my supervisor at my old job hes told me enough stories over the years between his many different jobs prior to it that i can safely say that this is a true story lets call my old boss oldboss lets call his supervisor powertrip lets call the new guy whiteintern one friday like any other friday oldboss throws a weekly full backup tape inside each of the three servers left in his small data center a large reel into his vax dropped off last weeks backup tapes at the building next door and walks down the block to the local burger joint for a beer and the burger special then he heads home it had been a hellish week at work oldboss had to fight with powertrip about data center improvements that powertrip implemented without consulting him initially it was things that were a major improvement keypads on all doors coming into the offices and a new kick ass door for the data center there had been some small thefts in the office and keys were no longer trusted even after all of the locks were changed the installers had tons of issues installing this crazy data center door because the building was so old and used huge granite blocks about feet thick and the data center was in the basement this building could probably withstand a nuke the door installers were instructed to keep the room safe from smokefire and water no matter the cost so the door was sealed on all sides and damn near impenetrable oldboss loved this but as soon as it was done powertrip decided to have the sprinkler system extended into the data center as well oldboss flipped out over the idea of having water rushing above very expensive equipment but powertrip basically told him its not your data center its powertrips data center and ill do whatever i think is best for it oldboss youre just my flunkie that shows up to keep it in shape and i pay you of my salary so that you keep your opinionated mouth shut oldboss told me that it took every fiber in his body to not hit the man let alone keep his mouth shut he did however go to hr the next day and report the issue it was dismissed without any reason given to him and since he wasnt in the union with the rest of the employees he had little power he told me that he decided to stick with the company because they were paying him well the job was stable normally and his daughter was getting a discount at the local college after all family does come before happiness sometimes and oldboss simply looked at it as a place where he could get paid for the next few years until his daughter graduated only years to begin a job search and network with other people compared to his other previous jobs which were much more dangerous this desk job was a godsend over the next few years he had few runins with powertrip but they did what they were required to do and avoided each other one thing that oldboss did regularly that really pissed off powertrip was to request environmental monitoring equipment for the data center now that there were new ac units added as well as the sprinkler systems he wanted humidity monitoring equipment as well as the noise sensors and flood detection systems compared to other projects this one was cheap but powertrip looked at it as a reason that oldboss was trying to throw him under the bus powertrip why do we need this equipment again oldboss because there are a few sources of water and moisture in that room now and we didnt put these sensors in the room back when we added those water sources powertrip soyoure saying that i made a mistake i dont make mistakes i fix them having this meeting with you was a mistake ill talk it over with the bosses oldboss would send an interoffice memo to powertrip ever year or so with the same proposal worded differently each time but apparently the damage had already been done it was returned to him denied every year with the same reason every time i dont make mistakes written every time on the project approval notes form finally oldbosss daughter was due up for graduating the discounted education and the money they both contributed meant that she never had to worry about loans and her education was fully paid off she was going to be graduating in only a few weeks oldboss planned on leaving in the next few months but figured he better follow rule just one more time cya cover your ass oldboss found a new job that was going to pay a ton more and told them that hed need weeks notice to hand over the reigns and give all of the proper info to the next guy so he sent the interoffice memo one last time to powertrip for the environmental sensors project who responded with a nasty handwritten note saying to never question him again or hed be fired needless to say he went upstairs put in his weeks notice to a stunned powertrip went to hr and got his paperwork in order and took the rest of the day off as sick the last weeks at this job had absolutely no interaction between oldboss and powertrip except on the final day when powertrip had oldboss escorted out by police officers and all access codes to the doors were promptly changed oldboss had met his replacement that same day some freshoutofcollege kid who he would have gladly hired as an intern but not someone to replace him he went off to his new job where everyone loved and respected him and his pay went up about in the first year due to the major improvements he implemented he was as happy as he could be but then the event happened a few years later nobody knows exactly how it started but the fire marshal concluded that the vax dotmatrix printer apparently caught fire for some reason and probably lit the many large boxes of paper next to it the closest sprinkler went off and it kept draining water keep in mind the following this data center is in the basement it is now a sealed room ever since the insane door was installed the walls are not drywall but ft thick stone blocks on all sides all cables ran out of the data center ceiling into the maintenance room directly above them there is nowhere for this water to go but up or through a vaultlike door that isnt moving the ceiling in the room was about feet above the water didnt reach the ceiling but it did go up roughly feetapparently someone at the nightly guard desk stopped the system when the generic building alarm went off however since the office had keypad access installed in the last few years none of the guards had ever needed to get into it during the night the night guard could have probably called the head of the cleaning crew of the locksmith but it was am on a saturday whats the worst that could happen monday rolls around and the intern replacement is called in early since vax isnt working he tries to open the vault but cant he calls the locksmith who takes one look at the vault said says i didnt install this beastly thing call that company by this time its am and the many employees at this office are flipping out and execs are pulling their hair out intern decides to go up to the maintenance closet and he peers down into the cable run hole and he goes white youre not supposed to go full white but he did he ran to powertrip whose office had become a war room of sorts for the execs since he was in charge of the it department i was told the conversation went like this whiteintern hey um quick question powertripdo we have any environmental sensors in the data center powertrip not this again why isnt the system up and running yet slacker get the out of here and fix it whiteintern in a pissed off tone youre not paying me enough for this so ill just say it the data center is filled with water and looks like a swimming pool all of your equipment is now scrap everyone in the room freaked out all at once it was disorder as everyone implemented cya policy and the finger was immediately pointed at powertrip who was lost for a few seconds but quickly found someone to blame powertrip get the police on the phone i know who did this whiteintern who did this powertrip obviously its oldboss getting back at me i bet he did this oldbosss new job was only a few blocks away and he was busy enjoying his monday morning with the free donuts that management would bring in at the beginning of every week he was looking at a promotion to management and had his feet kicked up on his desk when he heard a commotion at the front desk he looks out from behind his office door and sees a few executives from his old company standing there shouting for him oldboss gets up walks over and then notices purplefaced powertrip being the primary agitator oh god was his only though powertrip here he is you you terrible person youre coming with us and youre going to rot in jail after the police get to you either come with us now or well have the cops come over here oldboss what in the hell is going on what are you talking about im not going anywhere powertrip you flooded the data center to get back at me you oldboss i what yousighyou know what yea ill come with you they walk him down to the old building where police have already begun an inspection and the fire marshal was setting up pumps to get rid of the water everyone of any importance was there head of hr security guards every executive and all eyes looked at him as soon as oldboss walked into the room the glares were piercing the cops didnt know that powertrip had done this and were in the process of telling him that he shouldnt have done this when oldboss says oldboss id like to make a statement right now in front of everyone police that can wait until were oldboss nope this needs to be done now ive been enjoying my new job for about years now and id like to get back to it as soon as possible hrsally if youll note that before i left in my record i gave you every interoffice memo i ever had with powertrip explaining why we needed environmental monitoring and his reasons for denying them can you read them aloud hrsally let me find them hereumtoo expensive i dont make mistakes i dont make mistakes and i dont make mistakes and ill fire you next time you bring this up oldboss thank you sally and youll note that despite my extensive knowledge of the equipment and what was needed that my boss doesnt make mistakes and he didnt feel that this was needed powertrip i know you must have started the fire oldboss actually i was away with the ceo of my new company all weekend where he offered me a raise and a management position i can call him down here if youd like upper management apologized to oldboss and let him leave at the loud protest of powertrip he didnt get to see what happened next less than a week later he got a call to please come back to the old office at am by the guy that runs the company you cant really ignore that call so he went back oldboss you wanted to see me bigboss bigboss we just started trying to figure out how to start over here and i realized that none of us have any idea what were doing how would you like to come back to the company oldboss theres no way in hell bigboss we fired powertrip as soon as you left the room last week and escorted him out of the building for gross negligence of company property as we had never heard about this environmental monitoring plan that you proposed in fact im not offering you your old position as the guy that replaced you is one of my relatives im offering you powertrips old position as our management head for it with an increase from what he was getting paid oldboss was actually thinking of retirement in a few years but this was too good to pass up oldboss when do you want me to start in the end oldboss took the job and spent the next few years training whiteintern as best as he could and along the way they happily worked on many projects together and hired many underlings as it was becoming more and more popular with the other departments i was one of the many underlings underneath whiteintern that were hired to implement the new data center this story is definitely one of my favorites despite it taking a long time to tell because it hits nearly some important rules in it cover your ass all of the time do a good job dont burn bridges have a data recovery plan storage area for reels and tapes was a separate building and everything was moved over there at the end of every week listen to those under you beside you and above you in it there are a million ways to get something done and your way might not be the best way at his retirement party i remember that bigboss gave oldboss a fishbowl full of vodka but with a little metal data center in the bottom of it someone made for him probably the best going away present anyone could have
this was a few years ago but it was embarrassing tacomputerstore sells your normal stuff you need to build and maintain pcs all of it hanging in the wall behind the main counter for clients to see including of course our dear thermal paste we were attending a few clients when suddenly a police truck stand in front of the store and a couple of policemen and a dog came in through the door my boss reached for them gtelboss officers how may i help you gtofficer seor we received reports that your store is suspicious of selling illegal merchandise me and the other two guys were shocked the policeman with the dog came behind the counter and started sniffing around i didnt do much except lean againts the counter and let them through gtelboss what we dont sell those things we sell computer and computer accessories gtofficer well see about that the officer with the dog reached for the syringe of thermal paste then hand it over at the other one i tried to contain my laugh since we had joked how the syringes looked like heroin gtofficer holding the paste what is this gtelboss that is called thermal grease paste or silicone its for connecting some parts of computers to the metalic surfaces that irradiate heat so the pcs dont overheat and die not exactly the best description but a good eli he has used before the officer opened it up and gave it a sniff then the dog sniffed it as well no reaction we were allowed to open youtube and show him some videos of its use they spent about minutes searching the store and the back of it they found nothing of course gtofficer sorry for the bother we got an anonymous call that your store was selling heroine false alarm our apologies he signed some papers and later they left good times tldr thermal paste is heroine
i work for a small computer repair shop we deal with people whose computers have no warranty people who want their tech support a bit cheaper as such we get some pretty crazy calls and people id like to share one today callerive got a problem with my computer its telling me to buy a pet snake and i dont want one methinking its a virus alright sir are you trying to reach a specific website and it is redirecting you asking you to buy a pet snake caller no every time i click this stupid file it asks me to go out and buy a snake then try again mealright sir can you read back the exact error message caller yeah it says python required to run script me sir im going to put you on hold for a few seconds commence laughter including tears my coworkers stared at me i walked him through the process of installing python then showed the call to my manager who regretted not being on the line when the call was made edit wow frontpage thank you to everyone ill be sure to post more stories as they occur edit edit whoo boy one more edit people holy sht in the it sector have upvoted this i cant express how grateful i am nor did i ever think id get so many but before this turns in what sounds like an acceptance speech i was thinking of starting a theory list as to how this happened in the first place ill list the direct quotations and whom they came from if someone wants to add a theory or disprove one feel free mine and my managers theory the caller had a techsavvy son who had copied over a python script to the dads computer which didnt have python and was planning on installing it but forgot to or something dad clicked on file and got suspicious uargonwolf theory bitcoin will give you bitcoins for basically acting as a proxy for their transaction network essentially converting electricity into bitcoin before the bitcoin boom and crash it was pretty common for hobbyists to install the necessary software on all the computers in the house to increase cash flow i even saw a guy take like raspberry pis and convert them into a bitcoin strip mine just having them run the proxy software usirenstogo theory what it probably was an application that was a wrapper for the script and it could run without py but it wouldnt be able to launch the script uhellkittyanarchy theory doesnt python have a portable version maybe he was just drag and dropping it onto a portable version urandommook theory there are python scripts for cracking wep encryption maybe he downloaded one of those without understanding what python was uchipaca theory python was probably installed but not on the path umalak theory i would guess mining a cpu coin crypto is really greek when you first get into it unuclearweaponry theory some mods for skyrim require python 
i was working graveyards about a decade ago doing wireless networking support for a major pc manufacturer i get this call at about am its a woman fairly young early s maybe and she cant get on the internet she is getting connected to her router wired and wirelessly but no internet i walk her through some standard steps but the router is still acting kind of funky plus i think she had comcast we had a lot of trouble with them finally in the troubleshooting steps we get to the point where doing a manual reset on her router is the next best step before just replacing it so i told her to pick it up turn it around find that small recessed button on the back left and use a pen to press and hold that for seconds after a brief silence she asks where is this hole again on the back of your ltbrandgt router where you plug the cables in its on the far left hmm i dont see it back here id done this many many times before and i knew the mistakes customers usually made so i said move your left thumb you have it over the hole ohill be right back the phone clickclacks as it hits the desk and the pattering of feet walking off in the distance can be heard about seconds later the footsteps are back and getting closer then she picks the phone up again she says ok whew im ready now i just had to put a robe on i didnt know you had cameras on these things sorry for the free show
client runs a bunch of hour convenience stores and im typically the one they call when the fecal matter hits the rotary air impeller when the phone goes off about minutes ago at pm here i assume its some kind of significant failure a little quite voice goes hey tacticalbacon can i get a favour from you im bigboss child process and friends with your daughter can you tell me how to wipe my search history really quickly obviously im in cya mode as shes about so immediately start recording the call just in case but im not going to nark her out to her dad just because she might have been up to something naughty briefly she want to only wipe a single set of searches and a few page views from history which is trickyish to step someone through over the phone so setup a quick remote session to do it for her que an oh fuck moment because shes researching womens shelters and abuse reporting helplines and needs to hide it i have a significant feeling im going to be dropping this client soon 
yesyes you areladies and gentlemen of tfts i give you another wonderful tale of users who will not listenand pay the price because of it ampnbsp todays tale involves a lovely little business that shall henceforth be named staffingagency this business is one of our largest and most loyalfriendly customers we have a contract with them that boils down to if its within business hours weve got your back many at staffingagency have direct numbers to my and other technicians cell phones as a courtesy and are a treat to deal with there is that one thoughohhhh there is that oneevery business has them that employee is miss cantread cr ampnbsp it is pm on a saturday evening when i received her call i was prepping for a raid in insert favorite mmo here and joking with friends on our voip server when i was forced to break away i didnt recognize the number which unfortunately sets of a dozen red flags immediately within my mind ampnbsp gtme this is cyrillus gtcr oh thank god someone finally answered ive been calling the office number for an hour now gtme im sorry who is this gtcr cr with staffingagency i cant print my report and it was due at you need to fix it at this point i set my cell phone to record the call yay for work phones gtme ookkkaayyyare there any error messages on the printer gtcr no can you come out here gtme i could but i want to try some troubleshooting over the phone first gtcr no i dont have the time for it and i know yall are under contract to provide on site service gtme thats only on weekdays during work hours any kind of after hours or weekend work which i am not required to do is billable time gtcr well thats stupid gtme thats our contract maam im willing to spend a little time troubleshooting over the phone or if i was already out near your area but im at home so phone troubleshooting is my next best option gtcr fine ask away gtme so there are no error messages on the printer how about the pc are there any error messages there have you tried turning it off and on have you checked for jams have you checked to see if there is paper gtcr it just wont print ive tried all of that gtme ok could you go into the control panel and tell me what you see gtcr i see the printer and it says it has a document waiting gtme and nothing else i think yall had a few other printers on the network that you should have listed there gtcr nothing look justhow much does it cost to have you come out gtme this would be under emergency rates after hours and weekend so youre looking at an houri could also do remote support to see if maybe i could fix the issue from here that would only be a weekend rate ampnbsp i figured that would dissuade her or at least let me fix the issue while doing my raid prep nope ampnbsp gtcr fine make the trip out here ive got to get this report printed out before the end of the night ampnbsp about this time something clicked that hadnt before staffingagency had their main office in the same town i was in but they had a bunch of satellite offices scattered all over the place and i hadnt ever met cr in my many trips out to the main office gtme hey cr which office are you at again gtcr im at bigcitylocation ampnbsp i began cursing myself bigcitylocation was and a half hours of driving away but i couldnt just say thats too far for a saturday night id never hear the end of it come monday gtme ok crjust so you know this is going to be an hour plus travel time saturday traffic in bigcity is bad as i recall so i cant guarantee that my travel estimate will be accurate but im thinking no less than a hour drive gtcr ill pay it just get here gtme ok then ampnbsp after venting a little bit of the inconvenience to my guildies i prep myself and begin the drive it was uneventful until i reached bigcity where traffic became absolute hell my two hour estimate turned into three i finally arrived at the agency office a little building nestled in the center of the city with barely five parking spots to its lot walking in the building i met cr whom quickly ushered me off to the printer ampnbsp in big bold letters on the front of the printer out of paper i couldnt believe it i walk over to the pc and sure enough on the printers status screen it shows in big bold letters out of paper i take a new ream of paper which were right beside the printer open the tray put it in and sure enough her queued report comes spitting outto be sure i did some additional printing checked to see if anything was worn out but it was in vain the printer was perfectly fine ampnbsp cr shows up at my shoulder gtcr oh good you fixed it what was the problem gtme it was out of paperit said so on the screen and on the computer she flushed and had a look of anger as she looked down at the printer then back up to me gtcr and im supposed to pay for that gtme you agreed to the service call gtcr this is going to be over a thousand dollars of billable time to have just changed a paper ream im not paying that much ampnbsp im not a very confrontational person i get nervous and hate being under pressurebut occasionally i do snap this lady interrupted my saturday evening made me miss out on an activity i greatly enjoy and only do once a week and made me fight evening traffic on one of the worst days of the week to do it gtme you wont have to worry about paying me because im sending the bill to your main office with a full detailing of what it is we did here today along with a recording of that phone call a phone call where i told you to check the printer for any sort of error messages missing paper and so on i gave you the rate the trip would be a trip i could have rightly refused to do because it is outside of our support contract but i came anyway at your urging it didnt quite come out as i typed in person but i was able to calmly convey the meat of it and thats more than i can usually accomplish she seemed to realize she had messed up her reaction as you would imagine was the same quote used for the title ampnbsp tldr luser couldnt read requests on site support gets bill because of it possibly fired ampnbsp update well shes not fired but ive been informed any troubleshooting calls from her location are now going to come through their main office first they also worked out a deal with my boss to only pay half the owed bill due to how ridiculous the situation was edit clarification this satellite office had pc and printer that only cr used the other staff were specialized staff that didnt need a pc or worked from home off a vpn
yep you read that right a user got terminated from his job for forgetting his password before you think thats harsh consider that the user was a medical doctor assigned patients in the critical care department this is the story this morning around am i get a call from the ccu from dr ccudoctor saying he cant log into the computer now we use bigmedicalsoftwarecompany that has several different components to it each needing its own password but there are three main logon credentials that you need and if you are a doctor you need less than normal since we use imprivata onesign normally all the physician has to do is swipe the badge in the reader and enter a digitpin but they also need their badge to leave the ccu so no one really forgets it at work and has someone else use it to access the systems all the doors are rfid locked and youre not getting anywhere without your badge so once the doctor calls i ask him what hes trying to log into and he responds with the computer i say which application and he said where i chart so i say ok where do you chart and he has the audacity to respond on the computer thank you captain obvious i say okay so do you use the vm or portal and he said he uses the vm so i remote into his computer ask him to badge the reader and enter his pin it didnt work i reset the pin and asked him to do it again and now its asking for his ad password i ask him to enter his ad password to verify its him and then it will ask him to create a new digit pin he doesnt remember his ad password so i change his password to password and prompt the computer to make him change it the computer prompts him to change it and he enters characters and hits the enter key really hard the computer rejects the password because it doesnt meet security protocol for a physician they deal with medical records and can view phi on any patient in this hospital so we want this complex he gets flustered and starts complaining that his password doesnt work i tell him that he has to have at least characters one capital letter and one number he says i dont have time for this shit fix it and hangs up the phone come to find out he went in the break room and ignored his patients blaming it all on it after he hung up on me i called the department director so she could maybe talk some sense into him i didnt want a patient getting delayed care because a doctor cant come up with a password but of course the patient he was caring for went into cardiac arrest because he failed to resort to paper charting and delayed patient care the house supervisor found out about it and told him to leave the property immediately security had to physically remove him the patient is alive though all is well with a new younger doctor thats actually kind of computer savvy when i created his ccu account he created a password with characters and my system showed me it was high security thats rare he probably used symbols tldr doctor forgot his log in information and delayed patient care patient almost dies and doctor is escorted off the property update i was informed this morning that this particular doctor had a long list of previous issues with administration and failure to comply with hospital policy and procedure this current incident was the last straw so to speak update wow front page and quote of the day thats awesome thanks guys
where i work is closed thursday amp friday for christmas of the thousand or so people who work here im among the remaining hundred who didnt take the week off for vacation with my only work for today and tomorrow being a handful of pcs to image i naively stayed up later than usual last night expecting to spend most the morning dozing through that process just to spite me a ticket arrived at am gt user recently changed offices and reporting that the display on his tablet is not working user powers device on and nothing happens i called user and learned the tablets display is fine it just doesnt work with the monitor when its docked user is an engineer and since he is trusted with a tablet he should at least know how to plug in the two power cables and hdmi cable for his dockmonitor my first assumption was after the move he connected the w travel power brick to the dock instead of the w and the dock just wasnt getting enough power the bricks are roughly the same size and it happens all the time user was too busy to read the label on his brick and verify whether that was the case or not so i grabbed a brick and some video cables and made the drive to users new office minutes away what i was greeted with was the dock monitor and tablet still sealed in the users moving box i looked at the box i looked at the user i scowled the user acknowledged my scowl the user attempted to explain how he had unpacked everything and it didnt work so he put it all back and resealed the box and and i continued scowling user sensed i wasnt buying any and excused himself from the scene i unpacked and connected everything it all worked fine just as it should have user had a box of a dozen dunkin donuts on his desk i liberated half edit surprising level of interest in this one no i wasnt going to notify a managersupervisor installing it equipment is part of my job so this clearly fell under it id have been perfectly happy to make the minute drive to connect it for him if thats what hed initially asked for instead of saying something was broken and putting my brain in troubleshoot mode yes the donuts were delicious 
hello all this is my first post on this forum my colleague having only recently shown it to me this story is true although i sincerely wish it wasnt one weekend in while oncall doing internal support for a mortgage company i get a call from a remote underwriter she tells me that due to a winter storm she was working from home rather than the office today as a result shes using a desktop she has had for several years already rather than her usual laptop her complaint is that it is slow and noisy to demonstrate the noise she held the phone up to the machine i conceded that yes it was indeed whirring audibly i remoted in and couldnt find anything seriously wrong with the machine aside from it was old and somewhat overwhelmed with the workload it had gb of ram and was running xp with quite a lot of company preinstalled bloat eg just enough memory to boot up and not much else i told her there wasnt much i could do about the performance but she should clean the machine out with some canned air and check for random loose parts that could be rattling in the bottom of the machine satisfied she hung up agreeing shed clean it out minutes later she calls again to inform me that the machine has stopped working all together nothing she could do would get it to turn back on again she said it hadnt worked since she cleaned it out upset for her and annoyed my advice had led to the problem i sent her a shipping label to get the machine to me so i could fix it when the system arrived i could not power it on either i looked inside it to investigate and found a nightmare there was literally melted plastic everywhere some had dripped onto the cpu fan one of the corners of the motherboard was drooping like cheese on a tv commercial whopper immediately i called the user gtso this machine is a goner maam gtwhy i did exactly as you said gtyou used canned air gti didnt have time to go to the store i just used a hairdryer gtyou what gtyou know a hairdryer it blows air and it got all the dust out gtyou used a hairdryer inside your desktop tower gtyeah and it scared me when it started making sparks gtyou had it plugged in while you were doing that gti never turned it off i didnt want to disconnect from the vpn 
this one just happened so i work as the it manager at a hotel and resort our spa had called me to tell me one of their keyboards wasnt swiping credit cards its a keyboard model that has a built in credit card swipe so i head down there open up notepad slide my card and sure enough nothing so while i am looking at it one of the employees at the desk asks me if ive ever seen the it crowd do you ever get the urge to answer the phone and say hello it have you tried turning it off and back on again i smile and tell her yes then i say to her ok your keyboard is fixed she looks surprised as they had assumed the keyboard would need replacing what did you do i look at her smiling at the irony of the situation i unplugged it and plugged it back in aka turned it off and back on again she smiled and gave me a high five i love easy fixes
sigh if you are aspiring to be an it tech stay the hell away from hospitals that being said i get a call from an ed doctor and it goes like this gt me it this is smhdd can i help you doc yes this is dr givesentirename and this computer down here in the ed next to room will not com on i tried to holding the button i tried unplugging it and plugging it back in nothing works i have patients that need my services and my care and i am being prevented from doing my job i need to get these orders in so i can get meds on my patient me okay just go to paper charting im going to grab a prebuilt brand new system and head that way right now doc okay because i have to get this charting done and provide for my patients i have to be able to access the computers in a timely fashion me yes maam on my way now doc okay thank you the thing about the computers is that they are there to assist the physicians never should a computer cause patient care delays because human beings dont need to be rebooted and repaired as often these doctors should know that if they know a patient needs drug they can give the patient that drug and use the forms like they did before the wonderful world of computers so i get down to the ed and as im rolling a cart with a brand new system on it up to the terminal there she is with her overly detailed explanation of what she has tried in terms of troubleshooting the entire time my eyes are fixed on the monitor standby light that is not on and i cant look away she finally stops talking and i walk over and reseat the power cable into the back of the monitor in one swift motion and the monitor pops on and springs to life i smiled at the doctor and told her merry christmas and walked away because thats what you do you fix the issue and get the hell out of the way they need to work and smalltalk is not something that we do we do what we need to do and move like the wind once i got back in my office the house supervisor called me telling me that this particular doctor filed a complaint on me for making her look like she was stupid i explained what happened what i did and what i said and the house supervisor started laughing and said oh so she actually is stupid oh the joys of working in a hospital

her office looked lake a tornado passed through writing utensils scattered about several of which were broken in half papers scattered everywhere spilled cola after staring at one another for a moment i speak up gt me hi end user im here t gt end user about time she directs me to a laptop on her desk gt me so i understand it wont power on is that correct gt end user annoyed yes thats the reason i called the damn thing is dead and it wont turn on fix it gt me sure thing maam but first id like to ask you some ques gt end user go on ask gt me when did you first encounter the problem have you had issues with your battery holding charge issues with the charging portcable or anyth gt end user no i dont know just fix it gt me okay well i ju gt end user well i just dont care do you know who i am do you know what will happen if you cant get this working do you realize how important this is i sat and listened to all the reasons why this needed to get done now for about minutes straight it doesnt sound like a long time but it was after she was done i said nothing and just took a look at the computer to try and see if the led diagnostics work before i even tried it appeared as though end user tried jamming the charging cable into the jack violently and missed several times there was obvious signs of damage to the plastic hopefully its just cosmetic gt me would you happen to have the ac adapter here gt end user the what gt me the charging cable she points to a drawer i open it up to find the end connector has been damaged bent at a pretty decent angle i close the drawer gt me hesitantly erm actually i brought one of my own along i was surprised i didnt get an earful from end user for about seconds while i fetched the ac adapter from box containing every part this computer has little did i know i was just in the eye of the storm plugged my ac adapter in the charging light flickers once after i jiggle the adapter in the loose socket i get it in a sweet spot and am able to maintain power and turn the laptop on end user begins to turn that frown upside down the lcd is damaged the display is completely useless as policy dictates because i discovered customer induced damage i had to inform end user that i would have to call the manufacturer company to check to see if her warranty covers accidental damage i was really cutting her a break with jack damage but a damaged lcd couldnt be ignored or id get in trouble gt me maam because ive discovered some physical damage on your laptop im going to have to call into support to confirm your warranty covers accidental damage gt end user are you serious its covered just fix it gt me unfortunately maam i cant until i call thats our poli gt end user i cant believe this well see what boss man has to say about that while i call in to confirm her warranty end user goes and frantically dials the phone im not even sure if she knows what number shes pressing she definitely dialed more than digits when her call does not connect she lets out a bloodcurdling scream and slams the phone down on the receiver as hard as she could breaking the handset pretty impressive actually end user was not by any means a dainty woman at this point end user just stares at the wall breathing heavily while im on the phone with support her warranty does not cover accidental damage i inform her that her warranty does not cover accidental damage and i would be unable to perform the repair unless she or someone else was able to sign the work order authorizing the repair and incurring the cost of the outofwarranty repair for a new motherboard and lcd assembly evidently her scream from earlier had worried the few workers that were still left on the floor security was summoned and arrived at end users office it was the guy who gave me my visitor badge gt security man very concerned is everything alright in here i could not still cannot believe what happened next end user breaks down screaming and in tears after about seconds of uncontrollable screaming and sobbing end user lashes out gt end user he sob he came in here and he attacked meeeeeeeeeeeeee sob i i i i sob was j j just trying to help him fix it and

so im a relative newbie in the land of tech support started around months ago still that hasnt stopped me from running into some real airheads though i will say that of my users have been very very good sometimes they do stupid stuff but most of the time theyre apologetic when theyve done something silly and are generally pleasant people to work with except a few so about months ago user puts in a ticket she uses a personal laptop for work to remote access into the system and shes forgotten her password this also happens to be the admin account she is locked out of her laptop now were usually an agreeable lot if someone had come to us and said that they had locked themselves out of their personal laptop and they werent sure how to fix it wed help them out probably say it might take us a little while since itd be a spare time sort of job but wed get it sorted for them unless the person in question happens to be a gigantic tool let me set the scene user comes up to my desk five minutes after writing the ticket carrying a laptop bag and immediately im on red alert i know for a fact this isnt a companyissued laptop and i also know this woman is notorious for being a pain to deal with every time my boss sits on the other side of my desk facing me so is easily in eyesight and earshot of everything thats happening gt user hi ive forgotten my password for the admin account on my laptop do you have a record of it immediately i wince of course we dont have records of the noncompanyissued laptops but i have a feeling she isnt going to see it that way gt me this is your personal laptop correct gt user yes but i use it for work so its a work laptop you should have the password i wanted to point out how wrong that logic was but decided not to anger the fairly senior member of staff instead i just nodded sagely as though she was completely correct and offered to help gt me well im afraid we dont we might be able to gt user well thats ridiculous its a work laptop you should be able to get into it for me you set it up gt me well no we set up the remote desktop application so you could do your work remotely we didnt gt user you should have tracked the admin password i know this stuff my husband works in it at this point im just sort of blankly staring at her wondering what i did to deserve this woman speaking to me as though im something stuck on the bottom of her shoe being new i was already being quailed into just doing as she said but thankfully my boss isnt so easily frightened gt boss excuse me just so im hearing this correctly you have a personal laptop that you have forgotten the password for and youre saying this is our fault and instead of asking politely for us to solve this problem for you youre talking to my staff like dirt he did not say dirt at this point she gets a little meek and places the laptop on his desk gt user well can you get me in i really need it my boss looks at the laptop he looks at me he looks at the user he looks back to the laptop and carefully pushes it back towards her gt boss your husband works in it right im sure he can sort this out for you bye bye to this day i dont think her it husband has got into her laptop edit well this blew up while i was asleep for all those talking about a fix we certainly could have got her in we didnt want to and yes my boss is awesome as are the rest of my coworkers and thank you for my first gold
this tale comes from many moons ago when i worked it at a college this was originally going to be a reply to a comment on another story but it wound up being huge so ill submit a new post instead i was doing the rounds one day in the admin block only to find an elderly woman leaning right across her desk squinting at a crt i thought she must have been an old hag at first and that was her punishment for upsetting someone in it but i still felt bad for her and asked if she would like me to at least make her font bigger so she could read it from her chair she turned out to be one of the nicest people that worked there and she never submitted any tickets for anything because she didnt want to be any trouble so i asked my manager if i could take spare monitors over to her desk to assist her work besides leaning across like that all day cant be good for you i found lcd monitors biggest available at the time and took them over to her desk and showed her how to easily switch between monitors for multitasking and window management i left the office feeling good for having made such a difference to someones job and making things much easier for her even though it was such a simple task then i got back to my pc to update the job on the system only to find a ticket submitted from the admin block i knew the username well she always submitted priority one tickets for her audio not working hurry you must go unmute her audio or her mouse stopped working better go plug it back in proto turns out her monitors werent big enough not now someone in the office had monitors of course priority i had the pleasure of informing her that we had none left in our asset stock and our next asset order wasnt for another months so she would have to wait for the order to come through a week later i was doing the rounds again and i saw she had switched monitors with the elderly woman not on my watch i went back to my office to fetch my tools and the swiveling monitor bracket that was taking up my limited space in the storage room glad to get rid of it i made my way back and began drilling and screwing making sure this bracket was fully secured then began the monitor transfer removing the stand so they were completely useless without the whole bracket as the last cable was being plugged in the monitor thief returned and demanded to know what i was doing ampgtme im returning these monitors to the machine theyre assigned to ampgther you cant do that she doesnt even need monitors that big anyway ampgtme actually i have to the asset tags are assigned to that machine so they must stay where they are for security purposes ampgther what a load of bullshit dont try pulling that on me ill be seeing you manager as soon as im done here you just wait ampgtceo whats all the yelling out here ampgther he took my monitors ampgtceo what are those on your desk ampgther ampgtme as i was just explaining the monitors ive just mounted on this bracket are assigned to this machine so shes not to take them again which is why theyre now a permanent feature of this desk ampgtceo didnt we have this conversation a few months ago i told you before to stop helping yourself to all the office equipment because it makes for unnecessary hunting down of asset tags and updating of locations when we have our monthly audits ampgther yes sir i then took the opportunity to remind her the ticket system is not to be abused and if she submits a priority for something like plugging in a mouse again ill be setting up a script that automatically sets her to priority ceo had a good chuckle and wandered off shaking his head while i left out the opposite door feeling a burning in my back as she stared daggers at me edit wow this was more popular than i thought it would be ill have to dig into the deep recesses of my mind and bring you guys another story of the same calibre 
short but im sure many of you have had the same or a similar experience very brief background i work for a company who does it support for businesses and schools both on site and remote work this stemmed from a user logging tickets on our fault logging system that started off reasonably pleasant but quickly became pretty ridiculous it then led to this phonecall to my boss gtuser since billerss attended site and installed the new projector my internet at home has not been working i want someone to come to my house and resolve this issue free of charge gtmy boss obviously this is not related as the two are in no way linked at all user interupted gtuser of course they are all linked they are all computers how can you be serious you need to resolve this issue gtmy boss unfortunately that is not our issue and we have are not obligated to provide free home support i can maybe help you through some possible fixes gtuser but youre it all it is supported by our contract it was at this point my boss proceeded to sit them down and discuss what is and isnt in their contract safe to say that user hasnt called again 
 years ago i was neck deep in a project when i get a frantic call from a customer representative our normal mortgage rep was on vacation so they threw cuterep in the deep end of mortgage lending despite no training gtcuterep crying i was doing the paperwork for a home equity loan and i dont know what i did but all the documents are gone and theyre going to fire me and ill have to go work at mcdonalds or start stripping and gtme well dont go buy pasties yet let me take a look i go over but ill be damned if she didnt manage to delete all of the mortgage lending templates gtme give me an hour and ill see what i can do i had to drive minutes to where we stored our offsite backup tapes i get back throw the tape in and about minutes later have everything recovered gtme ok double check but everything should be back out there now waitwhy are you still crying gtcuterep its just been a really stressful week and i just knew id messed up really bad thank you so much harp for everything sniff would you like to come to my birthday party this weekend years later were married and have a year old girl so always remember to have good backups and dont judge a user from your first impression they may just go and turn out to be a smart funny chill person edit whoa this blew up after we started dating a few weeks later she pretty much just moved into my apartment we dated and worked together for about years and on election night she took a pregnancy test before going out with her friends for her birthday we have a nepotism policy at work that management ended up rewriting for situations like this we decided she would resign after her maternity leave was up side note i still appreciate work for letting her stay on and pay her maternity leave when they didnt have to months after our daughter was born cuterep and i eloped in vegas a year and a half later we bought a house and were still in love and happy together
 my very first job was as the help desk for a company of employees my office was literally a converted closet in the back corner of the building and my entire purpose was to sit there and wait for someone to call me so i could assist them with a technical issue when i first started i was paranoid of doing anything wrong which could get me fired so i didnt even use the computer to browse the internet i just sat there each day staring at a phone waiting for someone to call for technical help unbeknownst to me the company occasionally had a surprise halfday on a random friday the ceo would email the company informing everyone they could leave at noon and start their weekend early unfortunately since i was new i had not been added to the all mailing list and was not informed of this occasion and no one thought to check on the help desk kid sitting in the back closet to make sure he knew to leave early so my first surprise halfday was spent sitting in a closet alone staring at a desk phone diligently waiting for a call from someone anyone when the entire company had left hours earlier i only realized something was amiss when i walked to my car at the end of the day and the entire parking lot was empty to add salt to my wounds my dad also worked at the company at the time when i arrived home my dad just asked what took you so long thanks dad tldr started job as help desk sat alone in a closet staring at a phone was not informed that the entire company left early 
my career in it is relatively young prior to this i made lattes and dealt with day to day abuse from cranky yuppies nothing has really changed honestly i got a call from my boss the other day gthey hrdwrsftwrmlwr one of our new clients is opening an office and theyre going with imacs youre familiar with macs right ah shit i know exactly where this is going gtyeah why whats up gtwell youre kinda the only one at the office who knows them i havent touched a mac since the first gen imacs so im gonna send you out to set things up ahh yes the ol putting os x on the resume coming to bite me in the ass mind you i do know os x better than i know windows at this point to be fair because thats what i use at home and have since so seeing as its part of my skill set i head miles out to do their setup upon arrival im greeted by the owner of this particular company gtso we bought new imacs since theyre the best computer out there shit gtand i just need to know this is going to run all of the software we use at our other offices shit gtits kinda mission critical these all play nice with our windows machines and do what they do shit gtin fact is it possible to just install windows on all of them im flabbergasted this guy this fucking guy he bought imacs he spent per machine for a tb of flash storage and gb of memory and he wants me to basically completely remove any reason for having purchased macs so i stood there for a second and thought you know what im not gonna argue with him im just going to sit here with my head buried in my hands and rub my eyes and think about my life choices im going to stop at starbucks on the way home and ask for my old job back and just forget about all of this tomfoolery gtyeah actually we can do that but youre going to have to buy windows licenses for them thats gonna run you around k plus the time its going to take to do the installs and what have you you will probably go over budget gti dont care these are the best computers money can buy and i want windows gtalright ill have to make a couple calls really quick and i did and we got it all sorted out and the better part of two days was spent loading the machines with windows and the boot camp software aside from the resolution maxing out at k they were coming out great and then another request from the owner gthey can you make these look like macs they dont look like macs they look like windows i dont want our clients to think were using windows this office isnt a client facing office no one but the employees come in here there isnt a single client that is going to see these machines ever for any reason so im going to try my best to convince him this is a bad idea because i am a rookie and thats what we do best try to reason with people people that buy machines to run office and a handful of other applications also i dont feel like dealing with the inevitable calls and complaints from skinning these things but thats neither here nor there gtwell any unnecessary skins or overlays might affect the stability and performance of the machines itd be best to leave it as it is gtthese are the best computers money can buy theyre not going to be affected at all stop using that phrase gtits not about the machines its about the software your programs wont run properly with those skins installed ah yes tell him the things wont run then he has no option gtwell cant you program one that will work youre an it guy you have to know how to program this stuff i dont i have no fucking clue how to do what hes asking of me and i dont want to touch it with a ten foot pole gtim sorry but thats a bit outside my skill set youd have to contact a programmer to do it specifically for what you need gtdont you have one at your company gtno unfortunately we dont have any programmers on staff that do this sort of thing gtwell then ask them someone has to know how so i step into the other room and call one of our programmers gthey chiefprogrammer the windows imac guy wants a mac skin on these things gtthat guy is insane his last lab was a nightmare he kept going on about buying the best machines money can buy and wouldnt shut up about how much money he spent on the workstations gtso what do i do now gtput him on the phone there is a couple minutes of back and forth between the owner and the programmer he hands the phone back to me gtyour programmer said it would cost a half million to write that program and take at least a year to deliver what thats notactually that was not a bad move gtyeah it creates some serious compatibility issues i mean it could ruin these machines if its not done properly gtwell im not paying that much or waiting that long no one sees these machines other than the employees anyway thats absolutely fucking ridiculous if apple can make them look like macs i dont see why you cant too and that was that he went back to his office i finished up with cable management and the other housekeeping and headed back to our office where i promptly went into chiefprogrammers office gtyou told him k and a year for that gtthe only language this guy talks is money you have to reason with people in that sense sometimes just throw outrageous figures and they accept the limitations this guy just needed a really outrageous figure tldr programmer speaks many languages even user edit for all of you suggesting a vm dont worry it was suggested but thats not real windows it wont work with our software trumped any other suggestion i had 
in my last we met the owner of a particular restaurant where i used to work a particular individual who had a particular aversion to spending a single penny on anything that she didnt deem absolutely necessary and her definition of necessary was very very skewed in that story the cat was let out of the bag that i was good with computers so henceforth i became the computer guy and i got tasked with looking at anything vaguely electronic in the restaurant this wasnt as bad as it sounded despite our antiquated pointofsale and backend software running on aging and failing hardware which as previously explained would no longer be serviced by the original vendor after the owner called them up and cussed them out over the terms of the service contract claiming they were ripping her off this also meant that other folks who worked at the restaurant brought me stuff to fix this was during the recession maybe two years or so after the iphone had been released and during the start of the smartphone boom so i got brought a lot of phones laptops netbooks and sometimes even desktop machines to fix i worked up a standardized rate for my services so everyone got the same fair deal and i got paid the kitchen staff in particular were always especially appreciative and had were happy to pay me for my trouble but then one day there was a third computer on our counter our usual two pointofsale machines of course including the one which was still running with an espresso tumbler full of pennies weighing down its northbridge heat sink that computer and the owners refusal to replace or repair it properly is where we left of last time but next to it was a swanky allinone touchscreen terminal running a demo of a new pos package be still my heart an actual monetary investment i almost couldnt believe it but then the inevitable happened gttwo thousand dollars the owner shrieked to no one in particular as she stormed through the dining room one day she had a freshly torn open envelope in her hand which she thew into the cashiers wastebasket on her way past i surreptitiously took it and found it was an installation estimate from the vendor who supplied the new pos terminal it had a new printer with it as well presumably which would replace our stone age kitchen ticket printers i noticed it was networked and plugged into our hub with an ethernet cable rather than a parallel cable gttwo thousand dollars for a few wires she continued to rant we can do it ourselves she poked me in the chest as she said this gtim going to go out on a limb and assume that by we you mean me i said gtof course youre the computer guy right gt an hour i said nonchalantly as possible gtwhat she bellowed beyond ridiculous i already pay you gtbarely i said i work for tips you pay me an hour if im climbing around in the rafters stringing cables all over the place thats way outside my job description and im not making any tips while im doing it you want skilled work you pay skilled rates just like the kitchen staff does if you want me to do it when im on my shift im staying clocked in too if you dont want to pay me twice ill do it on my next day off gtfine whatever do it tomorrow gtafter we close or what i asked gtshe was turning increasingly crimson no right when we open i should point out that the entire kitchen which is where all the cables and printers had to go had a drop ceiling from the s over it all the existing cables went through the ceiling since the floor was a concrete slab anything i touched up there would trigger a dustandplaster blizzard gtbad plan i tried to explain youre going to get dust and god knows what else all over an operating kitchen gti dont care im not coming in early just for wires she stormed off well the business license aint in my name lady see if i care if a health inspector shows up when im elbow deep in year old drop tiles right over your grill i bought a big ol spool of cat and got chewed out for the expense and a box of rj cable ends why cant we reuse the ones from our old cables and right at opening the next morning i got to work all told it took me three hours to make six cable drops because i had to keep working around the cooks if i werent doing it in a running kitchen i could have finished in half the time but at the end of the day i pocketed and kept the rest of the cat i forgot to tell you the rationale behind getting the new system in the first place though at least as the owner explained to me she was convinced money was disappearing from the tills and employees were stealing it our old pos system was set up to require manager overrides out the wazoo for pretty much everything including changing already printed orders for any reason and opening the till without the key which was frequently missing the owner had the only override code and she was rarely there so her code was an open secret presumably since she canceled the service contract with the vendor of the old system she was unable to or unable to get help with changing anyone elses user permissions the new system was going to solve all of our problems it will stop money from getting filched from the till it will solve our ingredient waste itll scrub the bathroom floor whatever i told her in no uncertain terms this was nuts but i imagine shed painted herself into a corner by pissing off the old systems vendor for what its worth the guys from the new pos company spent a lot of time customizing the system to meet our or rather her perceived needs this included setting up our menu in the system all the accounting stuff automatic mapping of our delivery area the whole nine yards this system also supported newfangled for the time rfid keys which could be used in lieu of passwords i imagine this made the owners little ears perk up most of all since it meant she could just keep her key with her and micromanage to her hearts content without anyone being able to shoulder surf her password the demo terminal was kept on the counter for a few weeks and we were able to play with it make practice orders and also provide feedback to the vendor to help with the setup so far so good i asked the owner when the new system was going to be installed figuring id have to be on hand to help she refused to tell me i found out why on a sunday morning about a month later i arrived at the restaurant a little before opening because the owner had gone on vacation back to greece for two weeks her notoriously unreliable maintenance guy and secondincommand was predictably still in bed hung over guess who was actually doing the stealing by the way and thus no one else could open still a little foggy from working until close the night before i was pleasantly surprised initially to find that all of our old computers and printers were gone and replaced with swanky new touchscreen terminals and the new network printers i guess they must have come in after closing last night with the owner and set everything up how kind of her to tell me that surprise became much less pleasant when i booted up one of the machines to discover that it was blank as in it had the software installed but it hadnt been configured all of that work we did with the vendor on the demo terminal not apparent our menu blank our map blank our user list empty except for one user with the owners initials grand i said a very naughty word and went to the supply closet to see if our old computers were there of course they were gone i phoned the owner no response i left her a voicemail employing a few choice words i was just about ready to drive downtown or wherever it was to the vendors office and strangle somebody but i had a restaurant to open my cashiers were starting to show up now and we had a really big problem so having to take orders by hand on paper is not technically the end of the universe occasionally we had to do it during for instance power outages and so forth of course the owner had us working and cooking by flashlight rather than closing temporarily but a bigger problem was that everything went through the system this was true with our old system as well it was our punch clock for tracking employees hours and i wasnt going to trust that to paper because the owner was already notorious for wage theft and looking for any excuse to cheat people out of pay our inventory of ingredients and purchases from vendors was tracked through it our deliveries tracked and assigned to specific drivers etc even our credit cards were processed through the system in other words we were hosed and since we didnt open until well into lunchtime on sundays i already had customers queuing up at the door suddenly a lot of eyeballs were on me gtwhat are we supposed to do our head cashier asked me gttake orders on paper i said cash only use the old carbon copy pads we have under the counters just use the damn computers as calculators for now anybody needs to clock in or out see me ill see what i can do about this what would i do about this i tried the owners phone again and got nothing perhaps stupidly i did not have any contact info for the new systems vendor because the owner was being so secretive with me i started wishing i kept that estimate she threw away all the times she met with the vendor it was behind closed doors with our maintenance guy needless to say he was not answering his phone i singled out our second most reliable driver gtyou go to bobs house and wake his punk ass up im calling him bob on account of how thats his name gtin his best darth vader impersonation my driver said find him and bring him to me so the rfid keyfobs the new system used could also be overridden with a password on a lark i tried the owners old password which unsurprisingly didnt work on the third attempt i got in though youngest daughters birthday backwards the passwords were numeric only and since the touch screen terminals didnt have keyboards this was obvious enough because when you were prompted for a password it only gave you a number pad it was at least an hour before my driver managed to drag bob redeyed and hung over back to the restaurant in the meantime business worked like this i using the owners admin account holding a paper copy of our menu in one hand added things to the systems menu in the order they were needed as customers ordered them then one of the cashiers on the other terminal would enter the order and itd print in the kitchen in the scant seconds between orders i managed to set up pretty much everybody with an employee login and get them clocked in and using the owners manager override ability edit their time card to the correct time i figured as soon as i had a chance to breathe after lunch rush id go through and add in anything we missed on the menu and figure out how to get the credit card processing working so eventually bob was brought before me looking very miserable i didnt even have to ask him the question gtso the owner flipped out about paying the new computer guys for the service contract he said openly lighting a cigarette right there behind the counter but she didnt want to give back the new computers so they said theyll take back all the set up stuff they did and she said she didnt need them anyway so they left gtand i was supposed to learn this when i asked he just shrugged and slouched off to the back room i was later able to confirm the story from the vendor after i got their contact info from bob the support guy i talked to there was apologetic and very reasonable about the whole thing and once he figured out he was dealing with me and not the owner he even went a bit above the call of duty and helped me with getting our credit card processing set up but i can understand the vendors viewpoint no pay no service no ticket no shirt by the end of the day i was able to get the system fully set up get everyone put in the payroll system and clocking in and out and get the ingredient inventory tracking working i didnt get a phone call from the owner until the next day obviously i had to give her a brief rundown of what i was able to accomplish as soon as it dawned on her that id done many things like setting up new users which she was promised could only be done by an administrator her she went ballistic never mind all the other problems that this illconceived plan of hers caused her only concern was having complete and total control of the system while everyone else had none gtyou hacked my system she shrieked at me through the phone gtno i said i saved your business i hung up on her
so i am an it specialist at a small company and we often get samples of furniture that is to be shown to the directors via a piece of software that was created in house before i started working there the program simply allows for someone me to add an image of the sample and then the program will send an email to the director and tell them to view the image on the program its tedious but only has to be done every so often so we just got some new samples into the office and before i got chance to take a picture and upload it to the program the office manager send a picture of them to one of the directors via text he didnt tell me about doing this he simply did it when i uploaded the images to the program and the director got an email i was asked to bring the samples to his house i started to move the samples at which point the office manager realised what has happened and proceeded to explode at me telling me this program i made was useless and undermining his work even though i didnt make it he told me to take the samples to the director and never come back because i was fired i told the director this when i got to his house and i also told him how the office manager had spent hours out of the office to buy a football shirt the director looked furious told me to go back to the office and he would follow he went in before me and is now currently down the hall screaming at the office manager while i type this up feels good tldr office manager fires me over program i didnt make he gets a royal bollocking from director for trying to fire me and also for being out of the office for hours to buy a football shirt update first of all im so shocked at how much this has blown up may not be considered blown up for some but this now has more up votes than all of my other posts combined a lot of you have been saying to start logging everythingget dirt on the manager and ive been logging whats been going on since ive also just managed to get access to his emails so i can start to mess with him to take his mind of me if i need to so far what he has done is just ask me stupid things like why is my laptop not turning on when its out of battery and not plugged in i tell him this and he tuts like it wasnt the correct answer more to come soon update yes i am british update so i took your guys advice and scrapped the whole going through his emails thing he also seems to be being friendly with me i was stuck in edinburgh yesterday and couldnt get back to work in manchester and hes been cracking jokes about it

this is a tale about bravery bravery in the face of execution bravery of those small few holdouts that serve their caustic masters so that they can feed themselves their wives and their children those men and women who listened understood and resolved an issue of monstrous proportions i am a computer scientist i am a software engineer i am an electrical engineer i have designed cpus written oss implemented network stacks and developed system libraries i am a guru my disciples think i am some kind of motherfucking magician in this story i am user for a year i had comcast and lived in a run down apartment in oakland for six months i had an unusable connection between the hours of pm and pm circa week saturday calling regarding ridiculous ping to the outside world ms after minutes of music tech ltspeechgt me ltaccount infogt tech how can i help you me i have been having a very high ping to the internet after about pm till about pm everyday since i got your service installed i have tried restarting the modem the router and my computer tech please restart your computer me ok but i have already done that i actually had restarted my computer but i did it again anyways tech i understand but we need to make sure that this doesnt fix it me well i get these high pings from all five of my computers not just the one i am working on right now tech um how do you have five computers using the internet me with my router tech uh a what me a router tech sir we dont support nonstandard equipment me excuse me more minutes goes by as i disconnect my router directly connect my computer to the router and power cycle the modem twice such that my pcs mac address would get registered with their systemrelevant the high ping remains and i eventually get the tech to say the magic words tech it looks like we are going to have to send out somebody me thank you next monday the tech arrives and we go down to the drop i had not been present for the installation the drop was in a locked basement inside of a locked cabinet both of which will be relevant later the rcablefail was truly astonishing the single rg line that came in from the street was split times none of the lines were labeled there were splitters involved we spent the first minutes yelling at eachother th floor window to exterior basement door to figure out which line was mine through the process of disconnecting one connection at a time mine ended up being the forth split down rjgtwaygtwaygtwaygtwaygt me which i had split again with a way one for cable one for internet me well what can we do about it onsite tech i dont know me it works in the morning and late at night onsite tech it is probably because when people get home in the evening they turn on their tvinternet and you are getting interference me so what can we do about it the onsite tech closes and locks the cabinet onsite tech nothing it is a wiring issue on the premises we are not responsible talk to your landlord my landlord was more or less a slum lord oakland the building was falling apart and was in serious need of repair the landlord to put it mildly didnt care i was frustrated by the time i got done playing phone tag with my worthless piece of shit of a landlord i had decided that i needed to talk to comcast again week thursday still have a ping of ms after minutes of elevator music pm tech ltintrogt what can i help you with me i have had a very high ping to the outside world between the hours of pm till pm rendering my internet unusable i am interested in obtaining a partial refund for the time tech i am sorry to hear that sir would you please reboot your computer me this is not an issue with my computer comcast does not have a large enough drop for the apartment building i am in tech i am sorry to hear that sir we need to go through these basic troubleshooting steps to see if we can alleviate the issue for the next twenty minutes i play repair man eventually the tech once again says the magic words me can i schedule the tech to come between pm and pm tech very well sir you will have to wait until next thursday if that is the time slot you want week thursday onsite tech arrives around pm perfect after explaining the issue and what the last tech had said he checked the signal in my apartment onsite tech lets go look at the box downstairs after unlocking the basement and the cabinet he lets out a low whistle onsite tech which one is yours me this one i point at the line that goes to my apartment onsite tech alright so here is the issue you have way too many splitters between your line and the drop coming in i am going to replace the ends on your line to ensure we can get the best possible connection and then i am going to check the pole we can run a new drop but that could take up to six months at this point the tech looks at me onsite tech i am not allowed to reorder these splitters because they are the owners property and other customers utilize these lines and now i realize he is staring deep into my soul onsite tech the customers with these do not have internet and only subscribe to basic tv here he gestures to several of the lines he lets his hand come to rest on a filtered line i blink it is connected directly to the first splitter onsite tech they require much less signal it is going to take me minutes with my wrench and crimps to replace this tip then i will be on the pole for twenty minutes then i will come back to your apartment to check your signal again i am sorry but i am not fixing this for you i simply cant i blink again twice actually the tech turns his back on me and starts removing my line from the splitter to replace the tip i back out the basement door and bolt upstairs i pull out my wrench set and grab my i run back downstairs just as the tech leaves the basement he doesnt close the door i wait until he walks out the front gate inside the basement i find the cabinet is closed but unlocked quick quick quick i am taking my line and switching it with the filtered line on the first splitter after everything is tight i close the cabinet and run back upstairs the tech true to his word showed up at my door twenty five minutes after this all started i had already reset my modem and had a ms ping to google success after testing my line ran with acceptable numbers onsite tech i am glad that replacing the tip on your line improved the signal to such an extent i am going to go lock up the cabinet now and he was gone into the night i really honestly truly wish that this was the last i would have to see him but it wasnt no it can never be simple with comcast my connection had improved considerably a vast majority of the time i was receiving my advertised speed i could downloaduploadtorrent to my hearts content the only problem i had was when i would attempt to connect to a server in southern california you see anytime between roughly pm and pm i would have a ping of ms to any server south of san jose this wouldnt normally be a problem for average web browsing but i also happen to be a gamer and for online gamers latency can be the difference between life and death how did i know that the problem was in san jose traceroutes tons of them automatically generated every minute every hour every day the issue appeared to be that the peering between comcast and level in san jose consisted of two k modems and smoke signals graphs of average latency times over the course of the day showed two bumps a small one in the morning as people woke up for coffee and internet and a longer one in the evening when people got off of work and decided it was time for a good wanking i decided to do comparisons with some friends from around the bay area apparently comcast routed everything from the entire bay area through that l peering arrangement in san jose this was confirmed by onsite tech the third time i met him week friday pm cannot play win enjoy any matches due to higher than average pings minutes of music tech ltintrogt how can i help you me i have an issue where when i connect to some servers south of san jose i get high pings and it is difficult to enjoy my games at those pings it is only during high traffic times and i have the traceroutes that describe the issue tech will you please restart your computer me look i know what the issue is it is not with my computer i can demonstrate that it is a problem with comcasts network tech i am sorry sir but we must go through these steps to ensure that it is not your equipment often times restarting your computer will fix many problems me i know i have restarted my computer many times trust me i have traceroutes that identify the issue tech you have what me traceroutes tech uhh i am going to elevate you to tier minutes of music tech ltintrogt how can i help you me ltexplains the situationgt tech can you please restart your computer me no look i have traceroutes that identify the issue ltexplains about san josegt tech sir after reviewing the network status board it does not appear that there are any issues on our network this is most likely an issue on your end me look can i send you the traceroutes tech the what me ltgrowlinggt traceroutes they show the path that your connection travels between your computer and the server you are attempting to reach tech i am going to transfer you to another tech please hold seconds of music tech ltintrogt how can i help you me i have traceroutes that identify a connection between the comcast network and level in san jose as the source of an exceptionally high ping that makes it difficult to play games online tech interesting i am going to send a tech out to your location to see if it is in relation to your earlier support tickets me i can plainly see that i get a sub ms ping to everywhere else in your network before the san jose hop tech how about monday at am me really tech yes week monday am onsite tech shows up and smiles at me i try to tell him everything that is going on onsite tech lets go down and look at your line again i am worried he is going to say something about the fact that i moved my line he opens up the cabinet and smirks onsite tech i forgot which one was your line which one is it i identify my moved line he comments on the fact that it seems to be in an advantageous position and shouldnt be the issue at this point he says he is going to go up on the pole and do some monitoring for the next two hours his van sits outside the apartment complex he comes back and informs me that he will be unable to fix the issue at this time because he cannot identify anything other than the fact that the lines in this area are old and need to be replaced he said that might happen within the next two to ten years as he leaves onsite tech keep calling for the next two weeks i call every other day and get the run around they are refusing to offer to send a tech out because the last report identified no issues i am not willing to pay the eighty dollars to have a tech come out if i request it every time they insist that the network is operating normally and does not have any issues finally in the middle of week i get escalated and after what feels like the hundredth time they tell me everything is fine me the fuck it is i can prove it isnt tech something i am going to transfer you me to who nobody you transfer me to listens to what i have to say or understands what i am telling ltimmediately music cuts me offgt minutes of music later tech answers the phone tech ltintrogt how can i help you me lti attempt to explain everything againgt tech we are going to send out the field tech again me again this isnt going to fix it tech i know me what tech after he is done call this number week monday pm onsite tech shows up we talk he goes up on the pole he sits in his van he wanders around the neighborhood and checks various other drops eventually he comes back to my door onsite tech were oversold me how much onsite tech all of it me what onsite tech bay area all of it six months until the money people will even talk about buying more bandwidth me six months onsite tech yup me why when it impacts everyone onsite tech most people never notice most people dont care me what can i do about it onsite tech keep calling me why onsite tech they only spend money to fix things if there are enough calls logged about an issue the number tech gave to me turned out to be the number to his line for the next two months i would call him every week and onsite tech would come out and sit in his van for two to three hours then one day the call went a little differently tech ltintrogt how may i help you me i am still having the same problem with the high latency out of san jose tech i am not going to help you with this me excuse me tech the network is working as it is intended me uh tech we do not officially support rd party devices like your router lthe has never brought this up beforegt me um why not ltgetting suspiciousgt tech rd party devices like yours are able to change their mac addresses and we need to know that your mac address will not change to verify that you are the correct customer ltthis is obviously bullshit but whygt me i dont understand but ok what should i do about this issue with lthe cuts me offgt tech i am not going to do anything to address this the network is working as intended ltsomeone must be listening into the conversationgt me ok tech please call the help line at if your issues persist ltand the line goes dead not like he hung up just deadgt to seconds later there is a dialtone i check my traceroute logs just about minutes before my call i see that my connection is no longer being routed through san jose i have ms pings to every server i can try tldr isps are corporations driven by greed but there are always technicians at these institutions who know what they are doing they know the situation is fucked up they know the ridiculousness of the problem

this one happened about a month into my first it gig for a major company was freelance before im visiting the hq from my branch office to meet the rest of the team for the first time and get the full training on the cos systems on my last night before my flight back home i get one of those youre new so lets see what you do with a crazy call requests from my super i go upstairs and there is this lady shouting about how she just cant stand to have other people touching her computer she is having such a meltdown that shes pretty much driven all of her fellow humans gt yds away and they are keeping their distance oh dear i attempt to get a description of what happened from her telling another tech had been to her desk earlier that day and had erased all her files i look at him poor guy keeping a safe distance with with all the other refugees and ask him what he did apparently he had originally been called because her pc was slow he had looked around and found the usual monster stash of temporary files registry errors you know the stuff ccleaner knocks out with minimal fuss he had also noticed that her recycle bin was bloated with some gb worth of files you probably see where were going by now so he like any tech confronted by that much bloat emptied it turns out the lady had been saving her work by hitting the delete button upon being asked why the hell she thought that was a sound strategy for saving important documents in nicer language of course she said well its the easiest way to do it i only need to hit one button i know where they end up and i knew i could always get them back i started to explain to her that doing that was like parking your car in a scrap yard and then getting miffed when the guys who work there send it the the crusher in nicer language of course i quickly gave up fished out my handy portable recuva usb and spent an extra hour and a half recovering files that she could remember while she insisted on acting like her actions were remotely logical 
so this happened back in august when north and south korea fired a few rockets back and forth i had been stationed here for weeks when sk put up those giant speakers that play kpop and propaganda nk got all pissy and shot a few rockets at them and sk retaliated well i just so happened to be stationed here when all that kicked off and was working nights pmam not any more i get the call around pm to come in its urgent we need all hands on deck to get the generals phones and what not up okay normally our day shift would handle it but with the act of aggression everyone and their mother is getting called in and i get tasked to the stars room to set up his iptv in the bunker is it up yet the colonel asks me again and again and again no sir im jamming away at my desk configuring the new switch and scope for his office everyone is freaking out its the apocalypse and he needs his systems up and running now and the colonel is making sure i know that finally get the switch up and running with the colonel breathing down my neck rack that bitch in the comm closet patch everything back to his office all with mr nosey right behind asking me when i was going to be finished every step of the way i finally get everything set up in his office phones are up all his different networks are greened up and ready to go his iptv is live the man is set finally after i finish this i am pouring sweat because it is hot as hell in korea in august and we are not allowed to have cars while we are stationed here so i had made a nice long walk to work the three star comes in and sees my sloppy mess and the full bird standing beside me he takes one look at me and tells me that i look like hell cant disagree with that then asks me one question so does this mean i can watch football in my office now with the iptv im a little taken back by that considering the current events that had taken place i wasnt used to the tension between the two countries so was a little worried uh yes sir should be good to go hell yeah appreciate it and that was the first and only time i have talked to the three star
big fan of this subreddit havent seen a story like this posted but im sure this is a common occurrence in our field ill try to keep the companyspecific details to a minimum to protect the guilty about a year prior to this story company had created an energy conglomerate of sorts instead of towns and cities buying power straight from the power company theyd buy through company because they were buying in bulk company would get a discount on all that electron juice and pass some of that discount onto the towns in the conglomerate i was the new guy in it and i had finished all of my assignments so i went around to different employees asking what i could do or make to make their lives easier turns out the current it staff was pretty overworked trying to upkeep all the old stuff so my offer to make new stuff quickly made me a favorite among the employees well all but one the power company didnt like the idea that they were selling the same amount of power but now at a lower price they had a tool to check account information month by month power usage on and off peak price per kilowatt hour etc but the tool requires you to enter the account numbers one at a time presumably to slow down anyone like us who wanted to manage multiple accounts anyway i started asking one woman if she had any computer troubles and she started going on and on about how difficult her job was it boiled down to her keeping an excel sheet of all of the account numbers for every account in every town or city in the conglomerate and a column for every piece of information the web app would give you shed copy the account number into the web app hit go then copy each number into the excel sheet there were hundreds of accounts it took her months to finish a single months data retrieval i took a look at what she was actually doing and found that when she typed in an account number the web app would just use phps get to craft a url which included that number i wrote a script that made a url for every account number then scraped the html for the different pieces of data on the page i also dealt with various bugs in their system i had to add a delay if you checked pages too often it would effectively start blocking you either to prevent this behavior or because i was ddosing their system anyway about an hour of programming then three hours of letting the program run and i had automated this womans three month excursion we had our weekly meeting and i showed the woman her boss and my boss the tool i presented it while happily smiling in much the same way that a sad person would frown everyone was excited by the massive drop in workloadexcept the woman whose job i apparently just automated it turns out that what i thought was a description of a difficulty was actually her way of bragging about the difficulty of her job like a surgeon might tell you about a recent heart complication that he fixed blindfolded while playing that was the only thing she did for the company she had no marketable skills and spent the last year training herself in the muscle memory of the locations of the copy and paste options were on the right click menus ctrlc ampamp ctrlv would have changed her life as well she was not pleased she was even less pleased when she was fired the next week after her boss had failed to find something else she could do tldr i turned quarterly into daily human into script happy into sad and a full salary with benefits into zilch and i never saw a penny of the money i saved them because i was dumb

back in i worked the phones for a callcentre that provided outsourced techsupport services for an industry giant in the realm of american multinational computer technology corporations my averagehandletime numbers were never very good and i was constantly being told to bring my call times down from the orso minute mark to under as per the service agreement with said corporation while most of my coworkers had no problem dumping their callers as soon as possible earning a big pat on the back from the floor managers i was not able to just push my clients back into the endless cycle of minute wait times my firstcall resolution rate of or better however was always at the top of the chart nobody gave a rats ass about that though for anyone that has been in my shoes youll agree that trying to actually fix a problem in under minutes is pretty difficult add the fact that most customers vent on you for about minutes before you can start to help them and there isnt much that you can do if you are in the business of actually supporting the system so i made the decision to ignore my aht as much as the managers would let me and just try to fix everything as quickly as i could there were times when they would just hover and stare at me if they saw that my timer was over one particular day i end up on a call with a nice elderly woman she was and had received her computer as a christmas gift from her son who had put the service account in her name what her son neglected to do however was get her a warranty that included service to go along with her replacement parts in scrolling through the log of her ordeal with our technicians i find that i am her th call to support in days she had originally called to ask about error messages that she was receiving and had been taken through driverapp reinstallations system restore the dreaded call formatreinstall windows me no less and finally a motherboard replacement how she was not filled with rage and fury is still beyond me instead of the profanitylaced tirade that i had come to expect muriel was very pleasant i just received your parcel and i am ready to go it took a moment for it to sink in but it wasnt long before the realization hit i had to walk this lady through a motherboard install while it occurred to me that most of my coworkers would have gone as far as to just dump the call by hitting the release button on their phone i felt obligated to put an end to this saga muriel we are going to need a phillips screwdriver for this do you have one handy i have one right here she was ready to rock while she was waiting in the queue she had managed to unhook all of the external cables and get the case onto her dining room table i opened my rd extralarge tripletriple of the shift it was on she followed every instruction with precision and passion as if she had been preparing all her life for this moment i could hear her grunting and occasionally cursing under her breath as her crooked old fingers fumbled for dropped screws in the bottom of the case i could mark the end of most steps with the signature plunk of a card or cable being pried free of its slot others she would confirm with a simple ok got it whats next when the pci cards went back in i would add make sure its seated nice and securely to her refrain its in there minutes later the tower was back under the desk for the first of what i figured would be many attempts at getting the system to fire up the managers were circling nervously trying their best to signal me to finish the call i smiled and waved ok muriel lets try the power button be sure to let me know what you see on the screen i listened closely and prepared to count the post beeps one beep what do you see muriel there was some white writing on a black screen but now it says windows me thats a great sign is the light on the floppy drive lit in the thousands of times i had reseated a floppy cable my success rate at getting it the right side up the first time had to have been less than it was for a second but its off now windowsstartupmusicwav one boot impossible i had her look through the device manager for conflictsbangs for which there were none i had her launch her office applications and open a few of her documents without any issues play an audio cd check i even went as far as to have her test her internet connection aol dialup which required i call her back no problems there either i was in awe we had just completed an entire motherboard replacement with accuracy in minutes sometimes it would take users minutes to find the my computer icon muriel this has been the single greatest call i have ever been a part of you can now tell your friends that you have assembled a computer from scratch she cackled i had a lot of fun but i hope you dont take it the wrong way when i say that i hope to never have to speak to any of you ever again tldr i walked an old lady through a motherboard replacement in minutes edit you guys are awesome i am truly humbled if i would have known i would have said muriel one day i will post on reddit about this and technicians worldwide will cheer
during my uni days i felt i needed to have a proper job on the side particularly one that i wouldnt ashamed of telling people about up to that point all my jobs had revolved around annoying others eg telemarketing doing surveys on the street things like that now i wanted to do something useful that people would actually appreciate so i applied for a job at the universitys tech support team i in no way had sufficient skills or experience to deal with tech support issues but i was hired anyway and learned a lot as i went there was a professor of one of the linguistics departments who was infamous for constantly ringing up and get really agitated condescending about all kinds of things that were supposedly wrong with her computer of course the first time she called they immediately deferred her to the new guy me she was really worked up and told me i had to come over immediately i asked her what the problem was and she yelled my computer is infected with a virus its invading my privacy by showing my password to everybody i had no idea what it could be but i was pretty sure she was not even capable of getting a virus installed unintentionally or not so i went over there to see what she was going on about when i got there i didnt see anything out of the ordinary on her screen so i asked her to follow the same steps that caused the issue before and this was the result to quickly get to het university webmail she had placed a shortcut to the web page on her desktop she would double click the shortcut icon but at such a slow pace that the clicks were registered as two individual clicks instead of course the first click caused the shortcut icon to be selected while the second click made its caption text editable now focusing on the her own fingers and ignoring the screen she assumed the login page had loaded and that she could start typing her password to log into her mail account as she typed her password she would replace the highlighted shortcut caption text with her password and press enter intended to submit the login form but actually confirming the caption text edit and lo her password was displayed on screen for all to see she looked at me triumphantly as if she had just proven a discovery that had somehow slipped by our team all of a sudden i felt i was going to be alright at this job despite my lack of experience edit spelling

i man the it help desk for the faculty of medicine in a university as the buildings we support are fairly spread out we try to do as much remote support as we can we therefore have ultravnc as a part of our standard image this morning user called up asking to have skype installed on her computer it was a desktop so she didnt have admin privileges no biggie i ask her for her ip address since most of our users draw a blank when i ask this i then guide them through checking it by hovering their mouse over the vnc icon in the task bar our repeat offenders however know the drill and sometimes will give the address to us straight away great saves time i remote in and install skype while still connected she asks me a question about her webcam as im replying notepad opens in the remote session inside notepad the following appears who is this what are you doing to my computer i demand to know who you are and where you are connecting from turns out my dear friend user had written down her ip address on to a sticky note three months ago thinking that it would never change i had just freaked out some poor staff member by taking control of their mouse and keyboard while they were in the middle of writing their thesis oops i quickly found out users real ip address installed skype and ended the call so i could find out who the other staff member was and contact them to explain i then had to deal half an hour of ranting about how bloody insecure our system is if just anyone can connect at any time dont we have anything better to do breach of privacy etc etc
whoa this sub really dies during the weekends ive mentioned my grandmother in the comments before i thought that id share a short story about her this lazy sunday my grandmother is yo and looks like a typical sweet old lady she is also really since she is that old she has been around for the entire evolution of modern computing and is thus naturally very good with computers why this doesnt seem to apply to other old people is beyond me a couple of years ago my aunt took grandma to the hospital for a routine checkup my aunt waited outside the room as grandma was examined by a doctor after a while a nurse came out of the room and rushed past my aunt only to return with another doctor a moment later both disappeared back into the room without a word just as my aunt started to wonder what was going on the nurse came rushing out again fetching yet another doctor my aunt started to worry what medical crisis could possibly require three doctors luckily the nurse didnt close the door properly the last time so my aunt decided to take a peek inside grandma was sitting on the bed surrounded by the three doctors who were all taking notes gtgrandma dont go for the cheapest models they break down quickly and the software is harder to use she was teaching the doctors how to digitalize old picture slides and what scanner to get at the time grandma was spending a lot of time scanning slides which she apparently had mentioned to the first doctor the doctor and her two colleagues all had major collections of picture slides but had no idea that you now can scan them yourself they were pretty amazed edit since this story got popular i called my aunt to confirm because i wrote this from memory apparently the actual quote was even better gtlisten doctor do you even know what a scanner is
some days i find myself questioning whether the end justifies the means if a lie improves the lives of all parties involved is it not in the end a good thing can this deception be forgiven or is it one of the small degrees by which a man inexplicably slides towards the abyss gt boss i just had bitchycoworker in my office did you tell her it would take a full hour to install a critical update on her computer gt me words to that effect may have been said yes gt boss isnt this the update that took five minutes including reboot on my computer gt me yes gt boss then what are the other minutes for gt we stared each other down over the last cup of coffee neither willing to give the other any grounds heh gt me how much is five minutes gt boss almost nothing but that doesnt answer my question gt me but it does five minutes is almost nothing and thats the problem to you and me a task that takes five minutes is a good thing its done quickly you show up get stuff done and bobs your uncle mums the word and drop bears are real but to someone who has spent the last three years convinced her monitor is a touch screen a five minute task is something that can be put off indefinitely if i tell her its a five minute job she will keep me from doing it right up until i have to put on my shitavoidance goggles and dive into flaming mass of excrement gt boss but if you tell her it will take a full hour gt me shell find the time to let me do it because its important gt boss and shell be happy because you came in under your estimate gt me exactly gt boss all right whatever can you make some more coffee gt me sure just give me an hour
this is happening right now client came in wants a website have the design premade so we skip the first few steps on the workflow his design is in photoshop files and our guys are slicing it into html backends are coding it etc etc everything fine and a few days later we upload it to a test site for the client to approve it we walked trough some days of ridiculous demands all coming down to his design being sucky and not really working for him but since we are the good guys we are changing things on his demands the interesting things started the next morning gt client the website is not ok at all when i view it on my iphone it looks all different gt my boss this is normal we had to fit the elements somehow to fit smaller resolutions it is responsive website after all gt client no i dont want it like that make it look as the provided design gt my boss you understand the design you provided is made for x right it cant downsize to smaller screens like on a tablet or on your phone gt client i dont want it downsized i want it to look gt my boss this cant happen without having the website being unreadable on smaller screens you wanted us to make a responsive website right gt client of course i wanted responsive just dont change anything on it gt my boss what does responsive means for you gt client it means i can open the website on my iphone gt my boss you want to open it on your iphone but how would you view it there only a small portion of the website will fit your screen you will have a massive horizontal and vertical scrollbars and the font size will be absolutely tiny gt client yes like that all normal websites have scrollbars i want scrollbars update right now my boss just finally fired the client it went like this gt client the site is not good again i can view only a portion of it on my screen boss yes because your design is px wide and this is the design you approved and wanted to do it exactly with frozen elements client it is not looking good see for example site x how are they doing it boss site x uses narrow px centered design yours is way bigger than that you cant have it to render fully on smaller screens it is technically not possible with the design you approved client what do you mean not possible dont tell me it is not possible i see it done on site x this went for a couple of minutes then a few unpleasantries were exchanged stating that we are unprofessional and not a serious company

a few years ago i was working for a contracted support desk for hugeorganization i would get calls from all sorts of people from office workers to janitors to software developers of the whole year i worked there one particular call stood out to me the most hugeorganization obviously had rules about not letting users share their passwords and if we found out this was happening we were supposed to quietly lock out their account after the call was over one day i get what appeared t be a standard call from a user he needs help with his program that hes using he hasnt rebooted the computer yet so i have him do that real quick for me when he goes to log into the computer i hear a couple beeps over the phone but we hear weird noises all the time so i disregard it so i msra into his machine and do some basic troubleshooting with the program and after a few things i have him open the program and log into it when he goes to login he places his cursor in the username field i hear the beep again and the field fills out immediately password does the same thing what the heck gtme what are you doing to login gtuser oh i got tired of typing in my information so i printed it out as a barcode and put it on my desk i scan it with the barcode gun on my computer gtme wow never would have though of that this guys idea was so awesome i just didnt have the heart to screw him over just because the rules say and plus its not like his password is actually written down plus who can read barcode tldr genius warehouse worker never has to type his password again by printing it out as a barcode 
short story time my gf and i had been dating for awhile so it was time to do that whole hey come meet my family so they can judge you thing which to be honest is still fairly terrifying as an older something about halfway into dinner her dad starts complaining about his phone damn new technology this damn cellphonecompany that back in my day yadda yadda turns out his touch screen had stopped working win phone surprise and the company had told him over the phone he was going to have to come in and get it replaced at the low low cost of bucks gf mentioned i knew a thing or two about tech because as we all know being the person known for being techie automatically gets you shopped out as tech help to familyfriendsneighboursrandom strangers in a line at the grocery store and that i should have a look at it no problem says i of course still trying to make a good first impression two minutes of googlefoo to pull up which keys to press to get his phone to do a softreset and it works perfectly best part he turns to me and says son you can come over and drink my beer and watch hockey on the big screen any time you want 
my office had one of its lights out which made it slightly gloomy the gloom cast a shadow over half my face as i spoke i decided that was acceptable the light stayed broken the head of marketing had entered my office in dramatic fashion hed swung the door wide jumped through the opening and rushed to the desk slamming down a mouse and glaring into my relaxed posture with an accusatory stare i decided i wasnt a drama fan gtme thats a mouse i decided clear factual statements are the opposite of what a good drama lover would do they like to stay in the realm of ambiguity gtheadmarketing no head of marketing stopped lengthening out the silence between us leaving a long pregnant pause gtheadmarketing thats a wired mouse i picked up the offending accessory and examined it closely i gave a few tugs at the wire then smiled broadly gtme so it is head of marketing looked confusedly at my actions i internally reassessed my opinions on the situation perhaps this could be a comedy yet gtheadmarketing i want a wireless mouse last week when i went up to accounting theyd already received wireless mice in what world does accounting get wireless mice but designers do not gtme apparently this one no wonder head of marketing is so dramatic he thinks hes a designer i smiled at the thought of rectifying this obvious oversight gtheadmarketing you cant constrain us with wires why do accountants who use keyboards all day get wireless whilst those of us who actually use our mice get wired gtme the world is a strange place accountants unconstrained by the wires of their mice can work from wherever they want but alas the marketing department least loved of all the departments are chained to their desks slaves to the wired mice they so depend on gtheadmarketing are you are you mocking me i realized id probably gone a little far trying to hide the smile i continued gtme lets just see how long this cord is i stretched the cord out on the desk its total length was around feet gtme so you need wireless mice so you can work at greater then feet away from the computer gtheadmarketing its not so much the distance as it is the wire it gets in the way you cant expect good designs and clean visuals to come when the artist is continually moving cords it breaks the flow it breaks the flow i looked again closely at the offending wired mouse it was surprisingly good quality unlike most mice at work it had a high dpi replacing this mouse with the low quality wireless junk we had would actually be a downgrade gtme listen this mouse its better dpi then anything we offer a higher dpi means gtheadmarketing you will get me my wireless mouse not only had head of marketing cut me off hed also grabbed the mouse away from me i watched in shock as he loomed over my desk gtheadmarketing go get me a wireless mouse drama thats clearly all he wanted id tried for comedy id tried for documentary no he wanted drama gtme no let me explain exactly why i wont do that head of marketing grabbed the scissors off my desk and in one quick swoop cut the cord on the mouse in his hand in his moment of victory he smiled down at me i sat in my chair oddly impressed hed actually just cut a cord in front of me i decided id had enough of drama i waited it was a long pause before he spoke again gtheadmarketing oh no looks like i need a new mouse perhaps you could go get me one id prefer wireless gtme im afraid as i was trying to explain weve none left also you just destroyed property in front of me headmarketing didnt seemed phased at all by this he looked like he just wanted to leave he spotted a very old mouse sitting next to an ancient computer grabbed it and started walking off about twenty minutes later i got a call gtheadmarketing this mouse doesnt have the right cord thingy gtme doesnt it thats weird ill get you a new one i went searching around the department for the worst mouse i finally found one it was an old ball mouse with a usb input its rollers were as dirty as sin the entire ball continually stuck at one point or another even better for reasons no one could fathom the cord was only feet long gtheadmarketing thanks so much head of marketing took stock of the mouse i was attempting to give him i plugged it into the back of his computer and the mouse only made it half way to where his mouse pad was normally placed i moved the mouse pad gtheadmarketing what the this mouse has a tiny cord gtme i know its practically wireless
my claim to fame comes from a few years ago i was working nd line support at a company making hotel and hospitality software room bookings databases point of sale stuff etc the point of sale pos stuff was written in vb and was basically garbage the pos hardware itself was a pc with a resistive touchscreen and a cash drawer the cash drawer was always fun to set up and then setup again when the settings were inevitably lost wed connect in over vnc and then send a selection of commands to any com ports on the pc until the drawer popped open from memory there were possible command strings and and com ports physical through usb converter if used needless to say this took some time and we had to be sure someone was nearby when testing as there was never a response to a command and the drawer could be full of cash so there i was talking to a fairly reasonable bar manager at lunch time trying to sort out his pos which suddenly wouldnt open the cash drawer i did the usual thing of letting him know not to wander off leaving an open drawer full of cash and to let me know when the drawer opens send command nothing send command nothing send command nothing send command nothing send command urghhhhhhh that wasnt usually the response i got when i fixed something after a few seconds the bar manager told me through gritted teeth that the drawer had popped open right into his cajones tldr i punched someone in the nuts over the internet living the dream oh my gold thanks kind stranger
my mother despite being in her mid s is awesome with computers shes a public librarian and is often at the wrong end of users questions i came home for a quick mothers day visit and she told me this gem user i cant copy this highlighted section this mouse must be broken mom just press the control and c keys at the same time yes thatll copy it now hit the control and v keys at the same time user v why not p mom v stands for velcro so when you paste it itll stick user ooh ok that makes sense tldr my mom is amazing 
many years ago someone decided that all our servers would be named after green things and all our networked printers would be named after movie stars so we had servers names envy kiwi hulk leaf etc and printers named bogart bacall carey bronson eastwood etc one day i received a call from someone who was upset about the name of the printer in her new office lets call her crazed new office worker cnow gt djxiii it servicedesk djxiii speaking gt cnow hello id like to request that the printer in our office receive a proper name the one it has now is offensive gt djxiii a networked printer which office are you in gt cnow im in the academic and career prep offices i dont know why our printer is named this way in my old office we had a nicely named printer named after meg ryan i do a lookup and see that the printer in her new office is named garland after judy garland gt djxiii yes all our network printers are named after celebrities do you want the one in your area named after a different celebrity gt cnow i think they must have missed ours its named garlnad i dont know what that is supposed to mean but i have teenaged sons and i know what nads are its definitely inappropriate gt djxiii i think you are just reading it wrong the name of the printer is judy garland or just garland for short gt cnow thank you for you time click i have often wondered if she had dyslexia or if it was just a case of being a bit overwhelmed with the change of office one of our network guys started using garlnad as his quake handle not long after that tldr user misreads name of printer and thinks it is offensive edit great scott ive earned a nsfw tag never underestimate the power of nads edit quote of the day wipes a tear

let me state this plainly and clearly for everyone there is nothing that will derail and destroy a project with a greater efficiency than a project manager in my years of doing this sort of thing i have never found a project manager that can manage a project and ive found quite a few that cant even manage their own lives i am convinced that if all the people whos only job is project manager were gathered up and put on a small pacific island then had a nuclear weapon dropped on them they would survive for two reasons the only thing to survive a nuclear holocaust would be cockroaches and pms and the bomb would never actually detonate due to the project managers delaying the explosion for a few weeks while they try to get a few nuclear weapon smes involved to discuss the explosion with the bomb in a conference call that the bomb was forced to attend and during that meeting the pms had some questions that couldnt be answered by anyone on the phone so theyre going to setup another call next tuesday at and send the invite to the people that need to be there to answer those questions but before the tuesday meeting the pms spoke with the question answerers during an email chain containing people and they are now confused by the word detonating because they were under the impression that we were going to be exploding the bomb and now they need to rewrite the project plan with this new information and theyll attach the plan to a new meeting invite so we can go over the plan to make sure that its correct and by the time that meeting starts the bombs batteries will have died and it will be rendered useless the only thing worse than a project manager is a project manager that refuses to do anything about the project being derailed since february i have been working on a project to archive a bunch of data this requires creating or new nat statements and opening some ports on the firewalls we have a biweekly meeting on tuesdays and fridays scheduled for hour in which were supposed to discuss the project were working on theres two pms involved in this project because we split it into two parts pm well call her pebbles is a complete moron before she became a pm she worked in hr and this the first project shes managed alone shes never worked in it and doesnt know anything about it shes also the person that emailed me this with people ccd gtkc thanks for attending the call today i have a couple questions that thought would be better answered offline so we didnt make the meeting go over you said in the call that you needed to poke a couple holes in the firewall since youre not onsite who are you going to get to create the holes and are they going to fill the holes back in after were done with the project how long does it take to make the holes and how long to fill them are you poking holes so we can run cables and if so do i need to get our electrical contractor involved to run the cables for you since this is a firewall wouldnt it be a fire hazard to have holes in it let me know so i can add it to the project plan and meeting minutes ill be sending out i shit you not she really did ask that pm well call him bammbamm has a very unique skill hes the only man in the world that can talk for an entire hour and never say anything his favorite phrase is so let me get this straight afterwards he will repeat everything the person just said but he will take minutes to say something like so you need to open ports on the firewall before we can move any data its not that he talks slow quite the opposite he just doesnt say anything of substance its hard to describe but imagine having a gun to your head and the person holding the gun told you that you had to describe how to walk across a room but you had to speak in your normal cadence and if you repeated yourself or stopped talking in the next minutes hed kill you that what this sounds like lots of filler words and fluff that add absolutely nothing to the conversation other than to make the minute call last the full minutes scheduled bammbamm has also never worked in it and requires extensive definitions for everything stuff like what do you mean sftp can you explain sftp to me oh its encrypted how does the other engineer know how to use the sftp have you tested this in the lab environment anyway back to the story at hand this project was supposed to be completed by may now it appears that it wont be complete until the middle of july it took me months to get the other side to do the required changes routing statements acl rules for the machines on both sides to communicate i spent two weeks trying to troubleshoot an issue with the servers not communicating only to finally get the dba on the other side to share his screen with me while he was trying to connect and saw that he was using our servernamecompanylocal name to connect rather than the public ip addresses i gave him he then stopped because hes never used an ip to connect before and didnt feel comfortable doing it so he had to wait until someone over there could edit the hosts file on the server so he could use the companylocal name rather than the ip this database admin had no idea what dns was or how it works when i attempted to contact pebbles and bammbamms boss about how they were destroying this project she got involved and screwed it up even worse what is it about large companies that they think they can hire people to do a job they dont know how to do and it will all turn out peachy in the end why would you hire someone thats never worked in it as an it project manager would you hire a lifeguard that cant swim would you hire a blind race car driver 
its easy to forget in these modern usb days that in simpler days there was no device detection or autoconfiguration you plugged something into a serial port or parallel port configured the computer for the same speedssettings the device was expecting and we were off ah those simple glorious days the serial port was indeed universal before it became the universal serial bus but one class of device hasnt forgotten those days networking equipment all serious routers switches and firewalls come with a baud rs serial for configuring them this may sound silly to people who grew up with usb as a standard but by the time you need access to the serial port of a network device you really need it no drivers no compatibility just access and for something like textbase configuration its perfect enter the modern age serial ports on desktop pcs slowly fade into the history books and that db pin is all but forgotten but not for some as these started to disappear from laptops ones that still had a physical serial port became highly sought after the prolific usbtoserial was around but drivers were lacking and buggy at best unusable at worst it was and i was still clinging desperately to my old work laptop it had everything i needed a serial port a gigabit ethernet port and wifi but the battery life was woeful the case was cracked and it had not been right in some time the only thing i used it for was when i had to go downstairs to the datacentre to reconfigure something and today i needed to reconfigure something thats when it happened my laptop lost a battle with a bottle of water and was permanently dead then it occured to me this is really stupid i kept an entire computer for the sole purpose of being a serial port adapter how wasteful and more importantly how not able to be kept in my pocket what if i could use my phone as a serial port it was a tiny nix computer i already had a terminal program on it i searched and googled and searched and googled but no such device existed thats when i decided to build my own my g iphone had a pin connector and i never knew what they were for so i set about doing some research into what they did and how people connected things to them what i found was impressive that connector had audio in audio out usb firewire video three lots of power and some mysterious ports labelled rx and tx could it be could the iphone have a serial port already that i could use id been stressing that id need to port osx prolific drivers to ios but could it really be as simple as just wiring them up i bought a breakout from an electronics store online and that night plugged it in fired up minicom a terminal emulator and started messing with it but no matter what i did i couldnt get anything to happen thats when i threw the multimeter it wasnt rs but it might have been ttl a lowvoltage version of the serial protocol hell it was worth a shot some more research and another trip to the electronics store i picked up a maxim max chip which converts ttl to rs a bunch of capacitors and wired it up i connected it to the v power output of the iphone pin wired up the ground connected the accessory detect pin to ground and then put the rx and tx stuffed the whole thing inside a and plugged it and it worked holy crap i had never been so excited in my life i was configuring my home router with my damn the next day i wrote a small post on my technical blog and then posted a link to a network operators group mailing list to share my discovery and posted a wiring diagram of how to do the whole thing blew up like crazy my article was reposted hundreds of times it got slashdotted it got featured in computerworld people asked me to test it on an ipad so i i got contacted by journalists at this point i was starting to get a little nervous this was in no way approved apple hardware and you had to jailbreak the phone to get access to the serial port devttyiap this was long before the is it legal to jailbreak debate was finished and i knew that apple had denied others use of the serial port for this exact thing and without knowing it id made worldwide news that it was not only possible but posted a full set of instructions on how to do it but as the days and weeks rolled by and nothing but requests to buy them came in i started to relax i learnt pcb design and made schematics i miniaturised the device to its original size i looked into manufacturing in australia but it was too expensive i checked out the possibility of getting them made in china but noone wanted to build the whole thing it was only pcbs cases or assembly not all three then it happened a journalist contacted me to ask me what i thought of the security flaws in the iphone i didnt really know what he was talking about so i played it cool for a while until i had to ask him what the eff he was talking about hackers had discovered a kernelmode debugger that could be activated at boot time using the serial port my heart leapt into my throat my notyetcommercial product that i was still promising to sell could be used to expose major vulnerabilities in the iphone any and all chance of not getting a cease amp desist letter from apple disappeared in an instant i removed any mention of selling the devices from my site and rewrote the article as a how to then intentionally reversed the tx and rx pins in the schematic to prevent it from working for plausible deniability i kept my iphone serial port in my bag for years as a useful tool until i finally got a retina macbook pro which was small and light enough to live there instead and now that the prolific drivers didnt suck i had no need for it anymore i disassembled the prototype and returned the electronics to my spare parts pile where they still live today but for one fleeting moment i was internet famous the best kind of famous
in a past life i was an avionics technician i had quite a few interesting experiences good bad and otherwise a few of them i can even share with all of you here about ten years ago as a lowly avionic tech i was told to debrief the pilot first debrief ever on the circumstances of a recurring problem with one of their systems while delving into the how and when of the issue with one of the crew members the electronic warfare officer edub pulls me aside and to ask me a question his awkward nervousness was apparent after about five minutes of beating it around the bush he asks his question i am not sure that my system is working correctly in offensive mode he says to me there is no offensive mode on system there is a wafer switch with four positions off stby test and def i inform him that there is no offensive mode that that was the off as in offline position and that if the system is not powered on then that position is working as intended instead of accepting that he is wrong edub becomes indignant he does not believe me obviously if there is a def position that means defensive mode then there must also be an offensive mode off he then proceeds to confer with the rest of the aircrew they come to his aide only to haze him after another minutes of disagreement the senior pilot suggests we go out to another jet and see who is right they all watch as i go through the power on process which requires i drag a heavy power cord from the generator to the jet check breakers and finally flip the required switches no one helps once fully warmed up we check the systems we flip the system to stby as part of the warm up cycle ready lights come on he flips it back to off the lights go out edub turns to me with a self satisfied look and shouts see right in my face i reply that this is functioning as designed of course he wont accept it we move to another jet different jet same results at this point i am tired of hooking up power and shutting down these jets the aircrew have had their fun now it is time for me to have mine i suggest that we look at his operations manual he didnt bring his today i am not surprised one of the other crew members has one i look up that system and guess what off powers the system down as in turns it off i point this out to him he complains to my boss about my disrespectful attitude this story is dedicated to you babycakes the intern 
names have been changed to protect the notsoinnocent around i worked for a major computer manufacturer doing consumer technical escalations when you were so upset about your computer that you wrote to the corporate office i was one of the people you spoke to i pretty much had leeway to do whatever it took to resolve the customers issue whether its issuing a refund sending a new computer giving away upgrades etc however when it came to purchasing items from the company we had to go through the normal consumer channels to do so if we had a problem with our purchases we also had to go through the same routine as anyone else in order to prevent abuse like improperly getting upgrades and the like often times this meant that youd be routed to a call center in india usually support was fine but just like anywhere else sometimes you have a bad egg i ordered a refurbished pda online because they were on heavy discount i had always been curious about them so i figured id splurge i get the device that week and im stoked until that is i try to plug headphones into the device no sound the headphone plug actually wiggles in the jack i shine a flashlight into the jack theres literally nothing in the jack either the jack broke or there wasnt one soldered on in the first place i was surprised that this got past quality control so on the phone i go calling tech support i get india gthello thanks for calling ltcomputercogt this is melissa how can i help you gtgthi i bought a refurbished pda from you i receive it and theres no headphone jack theres a hole where one is supposed to be gtmmmhmm so you have a problem with sound from the headphones have you made sure that the device isnt muted gtgtyes its unmuted but i dont see how thats going to help the fact that there is no jack on the device at all gtyes sir mmm can you please turn the device off then back on and see what happens gtgtsure reboots device its back on theres still no headphone jack gtuh huh okay thank you sir it seems like the settings might be corrupt i need you to power the device down and when you turn it on please hold the button gtgtwait are you telling me to do a hard reset to bring the device back to factory defaults how is that supposed to make the headphone jack appear gtmmmhmm well sir we wont know until we try gtgt do you understand what im telling you we can do all we want with the software but physically there is no jack to plug headphones into gt ok so shall we proceed to resetting the device to defaults now shes not getting this i ask to speak to her supervisor she puts me on hold comes back and tells me of course hes not available this isnt something youre normally supposed to do but i pulled up my devices serial number in our internal ticketing program i see that she has already written up call notes and put a resolution in of customer had no sound ensured device was unmuted settings now correct call resolved oh hell no she comes back on the phone and says gtokay sir if we dont reset the device we cant troubleshoot any further is there anything else i can do for you gtgtyes melissa or is it sandra im a corporate escalations rep i just looked up this case in the ticketing system and it says you told me to reset my audio settings that im already off the phone and the issue is resolved you do realize that falsifying logs is a terminable offense right gtum i uh gtgtplease put your manager on the phone so that he can set up an exchange for this device seconds later someone else is on the phone confirming my address days later i have a replacement device that actually has a headphone jack i know i might get some flak for coming down on a frontline tech so hard threatening firing for what she did but i worked every day dealing with customers who got the same kind of runaround i just wasnt going to let it stand addendum what makes this especially bad is that per our pda support process doing a factory reset on the device is something youre supposed to walk the customer through but then you end the call so that they can finish going through the first time setup process that process takes around minutes doing routine stuff like entering your name wifi information etc once a customer does that theyre supposed to call back not only would the factory reset not solve my problem it was obvious that she knew a factory reset would get me off of the phone 
a bit over month or so ago we set up a virtualized windowsserver for a customer where they connected over remote desktop services if they needed to interact with the server software running there everything had ran smoothly ever since the initial setup but today i received a call from the customer the customer was really frustrated as they needed something done fast and the ms own mac client just gave errors about trust issues to the server not fluent with mac i still decided to poke around with teamviewer and soon discovered that my colleague who had set up that specific mac had installed microsoft remote desktop from the app store and left a note for the customer to use that instead of the remote desktop connection which also was on that computer turns out the customer had been on a week vacation and had forgotten about it i demonstrated how to use the correct software over teamviewer and was preparing for the usual closing complaints about lost work time lost money difficult it stuff and so forth then it happened like a unicorn with rainbow colored spots gt client im so sorry for wasting your time i now remember reading the note and using the correct software but i just had forgotten all about it during my vacation gt me long pause not believing what i hear gt client hello gt me uh umm absolutely no problem gt client oh and just bill me for the time thank you gt me okay thanks and bye i remember my mother reading me about people apologizing when i was a kid but honestly this mustve been the first time ive actually heard it i tip my hat to the customer you were awesome today
my mother has for a long time been wanting some sort of streaming device for her house however her home internet kind of sucked so id dissuaded her for a while shes periodically called her isp and had them troubleshoot and has been told that the highest speed she can get in her area a fairly popular suburb of the largest city in our state is mbps they seemed to get things sorted out a bit better and last time i was there i ran some speedtests to show she was actually getting about mbps down so i mentioned that maybe she could stream video after all she went to get a chromecast but couldnt get it set up on wireless downstairs she said something about the connection not being strong enough and really the connection in that room does suck so she went to buy a wireless extender for that room and got it set up by herself then she bought an appletv and got that set up by herself too seriously she didnt even call me to find out the ssid and wpa key that information is written on a postit on her fridge and she must have remembered where it was shes discovered youtube and is planning to set up a netflix account you go mom

so this tale starts with an irate customer and ends with confusion which i guess could be said of most tech issues so to go back a pissed off client of ours calls and explains he is having trouble with an area of our website that he is accessing via his imac ok we go through all the usual fixes and still the client is unable to access it he gets more pissed off we have a test machine in the office and we try to recreate the issue but cannot which irriates him even more so we ask him to send us a screenshot so we can see it and verify this guy is actually following our instructions he is actually having the issue as he describes at this point both the client and us are pissed at the situation and the client reluctantly agrees to send us a screenshot me sir since we cant recreate the issue on our end im going to ask you to send us a screenshot of the screen which youre having problems with can you do that for us client sigh yes fine ill send you a screenshot me do you need me to walk you through the process client hardly so we wait for the screenshot and it doesnt show up a couple of days later i receive a piece of mail which i open and after a minute of confusion break into laughter the clients screenshot that he sent consisted of a handdrawn representation of what he was seeing on his screen he even doodled in the desktop iconsi typed this before remembering i had the screenshot sorry about the confusion and wrote me a message outlining the situation he had used a ruler to draw the borders of the screenneedless to say i had to call him back to walk him through the process but goddamn it ive never laughed so hard in my life not to mention the fact that he had to pay for a stamp to mail it to us edit adding screenshot edit holy smoke front page thats pretty cool edit gold thank you

trouble was brewing at the restaurant ampnbsp this actually wasnt much of a surprise trouble was always brewing at the restaurant as a result of the regular operating procedure procedure which i once again point out usually revolved around the owner refusing to spend a penny on anything regardless of how necessary it was therefore we also had a couple of instances of promising future trouble ticking time bombs you know the drill one of these was our new touch screen point of sale system this was a very complicated all singing and all dancing hardwaresoftware solution from a fairly large and well known vendor which id spent an entire panicked sunday resetting up from scratch after the owner freaked out on the vendor over cost fired them before they finished the setup and then buggered off on vacation to greece without telling anyone after trashing our old point of sale system a refresher did i mention the old point of sale system had to be replaced because shed done exactly the same thing to its vendor and they refused to support us anymore because i feel like that pattern is an important thing to remember gttheyre just after my money she often fumed to no one in particular installation contracts service contracts updates its all a scam very little the owner ever said didnt come with an exclamation point at the end of it ampnbsp speaking of getting ripped off the key rationale behind replacing our old system was her ironclad belief that money and ingredients were being stolen from the restaurant the new register system had very comprehensive inventory ingredient and employee tracking features that she was convinced perhaps by enthusiastic salesmen that the supposed thefts could be solved via software i pointed out more than once that the constant imbalances in the books probably had more to do with the secretive and byzantine creative bookkeeping she used to systematically rip off her employees of owed tips and wages plus feeble attempts to con her vendors plus the fact that her maintenance man who had a long and colorful history of alcoholism drug abuse theft paranoia and general untrustworthyness also had keys to the building and the safe and was the only other person aside from her who ever had unsupervised access to the restaurant i didnt need a pipe and a magnifying glass to figure out where any stolen money was going at any rate the long and short of it was that everything was recorded in the systems audit log were talking maniacial levels of detail every individual pizza topping added and removed to every order was tracked which employee login was being used on which register what the tender amount the cashier entered was and how much change they were supposed to give the length of delay between completing one order and entering another how much time the operator spent on the credit card screen im surprised she didnt want us to serial number the damn pepperoni chief among the owners ridiculous ideas about cash register security was that practically nothing should be able to be done on a register without requiring a manager override this extended from logical things like the ability to enter refunds to absurd things like the ability of most employees to clock in and out need to remove a dish from an order before submitting it to the kitchen because a customer changed their mind manager override need to add to an order already placed manager override want to view your own logged hours manager override etc etc ampnbsp there were only two users who had manager permissions the owner and me and as soon as she figured out how to do it she revoked my access this caused a fair few problems because everyone in the restaurant was using my override to you know get actual work done anytime anyone needed to do anything they needed either me or the owner so guess whose initials were all over the audit logs yours truly i caught a lot of static because of this the owner loved her audit logs she barely knew how to do anything else in the system except set up and change user accounts eg hiring and firing people and looking at the logs and printing out the logs and waving them in peoples faces while getting angry over imaginary transgressions another feature of this system the owner loved were the rfid keys every terminal had a little usb thingy on it with a pair of sockets into which you could plug rfid keyfobs you could use these in lieu of override passwords or any employee login and as long as you had one plugged in any override prompt would be skipped using the credentials of the account associated with the most priveleged key plugged in at the time the side effect of this that the owner loved the most was that it prevented people from figuring out her password since she never had to enter it the main weak link in this plan was the fact that the owner was only around about two days a week tops when she left she took her key with her why would she leave it lying around anyone could do anything with it after all the other weak link in this plan was that she could never remember her password because she rarely had to enter it she also changed it frequently because unsurprisingly her current password got passed around the kitchen with lightning speed whenever anyone figured out what it was ill bet a lot of you have already figured out how this story ends we were engaged in a battle of wills the restaurant staff just wanted to be able to clock in and out when the owner wasnt around and were complaining to me since id worked magic by setting the system up in the first place when no one could do anything the owners asinine paranoia led to her locking everyone out of everything and she couldnt be made to see how this made doing business very difficult then the inevitable happened ampnbsp gtmy password doesnt work the owner bellowed at me one day gtwheres your key i asked from the kitchen i was trying not to roll my eyes i really was gti cant find it i think someone stole it the owner said gti find that highly unlikely i replied gtfix it she ordered gtcant i said sounding more than a little smug gtwhat do you mean you cant gti used to be an administrator just like you but you changed my account now i cant change anything i cant even clock in without your key remember gtthat is because everyone was using your account for everything gtand that i said was because you locked everyone else out of everything gtthey are stealing from me doctoring orders changing money i cant let them do anything in the system gtand if youd left people able to do their own work on their own account youd be able to tell who was doing this stealing instead of seeing my initials all the time i concluded for her gears were turning very slowly in her head gtwhat do we do now she said gtcall the vendor i suggested and shrugged damned if i was letting this become my problem again ultimately the owner called the vendor and after they were done lauging at her they changed some absurd perincident support fee reset her password and mailed her a new keyfob besides her bellyaching about it for ages the main implication of this was that payroll was inexplicably delayed because she claimed she was locked out of the system for too long in reality i think it was less than hours the other upshot of this was that i overheard the owners new password this was rapidly getting out of hand for the next month and a half or so the restaurant ran like clockwork the owner had fished her wish and after changing her password yet again no one was using it to do nefarious things like clock in and out or add pizzas to orders she clamped down on user permissions even harder for about a day at one point you even needed an override to enter in a new order but employees were clocking in and out effortlessly even when the owner wasnt there orders were getting written served assigned and delivered modifications were being made to tickets on demand and the owners audit log was filling up with pages and pages of flawlessly executed orders with ingredients moving in and food moving out in perfect synchronization meanwhile my paychecks and only my paychecks were getting increasingly past due everyone had their pay delayed by about two weeks following the password disaster but mine was going on two months and still missing i started job hunting in earnest while living off only my tips i can only assume that this was a combination of retaliation for not being able to magically solve the owners password issue and thus costing her an expensive service call plus the lingering suspicion that the reason everyone was having such a peachy time with the computer system was somehow my doing well ampnbsp gtagain with this password the owner shrieked shed made a rare appearance at the restaurant one night her office had a little window that overlooked the kitchen so everyone could hear her yelling sometimes it was at employees usually these days it was at the computer gtget in here she ordered me gthave you finally found my paychecks i asked coyly gti dont know what youre talking about she said evasively gtsure i said gtthis thing does not work she screamed gtthats your old key i pointed out the one that was stolen all those weeks ago gtno it isnt she insisted gtyes it is i said its green the new one is blue but just put in your password gtthat doesnt work either she complained gtyou forgot it again gtno i didnt forget it wont work gtcall the vendor then i suggested and started to walk away gtabsolutely not that cost me two hundred dollars last time gtwell i said tactfully i have no idea what you expect me to do about it tech support is above my pay grade i set your system up once for free before you locked me out and im not touching it again without pay and considering you havent paid me my normal hours in two months im not pressing a single button until you settle up for both she glared at me in silence for a while gtorder up came the call from the kitchen i shrugged and walked away the next day the owner presented me with a wad of cash contianing about gthere she said your damn money ridiculous holding me for ransom everyone has their hands in my pockets i see so fix it i carefully tallied up the bills before putting them away gtall right i said but i never promised i could do anything about it bring it up she bought up the change users screen on one of the cash registers and tried to open her own account the usual manager override prompt popped up gtlets try this i said carefully deliberately i entered a password the prompt went away next to me the owner was rapidly turning crimson and then purple i quietly edged out of the room before she exploded gtwhat she shrieked the dining room went silent stunned patrons dropped their forks what was that gtnumber of the beast i said cheerfully sticking my head round the door from the kitchen gtwhose password is that she demanded gtdunno i said presumably the beast himself gtridiculous she spat how did you do that gtdo what i said innocently she stormed off to her office for the rest of the night i didnt see her again until closing time ampnbsp she cornered be just before i walked out the door gti want you to take that thing off my comptuer she demanded gtand i need you to pay me my back wages i responded casually she did not respond so i went home ampnbsp the next morning when i walked in the door i was immediately approached by bob our previously mentioned habitually unreliable maintenance man he handed me another wad of cash that was roughly equivalent to the amount of my outstanding paychecks needless to say the owner was not evident gtshe wants you to fix the computer thingy he said gtand where is she i asked bob just shrugged i tried the owners cell phone and she picked up before the first ring was finished gtyou got your stupid money yes she asked accusingly gtyeah it looks like its all here i said gtare you happy now now i want that beast thing off my computers she barked gtyou do realize its the sole reason your business has been functioning for the last two months right gti dont care she barked delete it gti think ill pass i said as a matter of fact as of thirty seconds ago i quit you have your password back ill let you take care of it i had to hold the phone away from my ear with the onlaught of cursing that came down the line after this gtyou are not allowed to quit she finally finished gtim not sure youre understanding how atwill employment works i said i was quit when i came in here and im twice as quit now surely the reference was lost more invective followed so i put her on speaker gtand you are huge ahole and i hope you rot in hell you owe me you cant quit i own you i leaned against the soda machine while this was going on pretending not to pay attention all work had stopped at the counter customers were staring gtuh whos that one of the customers asked gtthe owner i said gtoh he said and then walked out without ordering ampnbsp i would like to say that i followed that customer out the door to thunderous applause from the kitchen and waitstaff company shirt thrown one way rfid keyfob the other out the front door with both middle fingers in the air as the music swelled and the camera panned out roll credits but of course it doesnt happen that way instead i handed bob a shopping bag full of all my company shirts and my rfid key before quietly leaving out the back door he caught up with me in the parking lot as i was adjusting my tie cigarette hanging out of his mouth as usual gtwhere the hell are you off to he asked gtwork i said gtdid did you plan all this gti always have a plan i told him that was the last day i ever set foot in that place ampnbsp i still have some friends who work there every once in a while i ask how things are going at the restaurant to this day the beast still roams the computer system the owner has never deleted him even though technically she could every time someone needs to clock in write an order or add extra pepperoni to a pizza god forbid the beast is there watching over them making the audit logs look pretty and turning the gears of business protecting everyone from the owner bringing up timesheets that have been tampered with when the labor board comes knocking and in an extraordinarily circuitous way ensuring that the system is working as it was originally intended everyone is happy well almost everyone

this story takes place during the period known as last week in the frozen wastelands of a land known as canada the hero of our story had been battling a herd of wild rhinoviruses for days and now found himself on the losing side my daylight alarm clock graced me with simulated sunlight as it often does i rolled over and muttered a curse at it however the only sound that came from my mouth was white noise crap id completely lost my voice i was also sick as a dog coated in mucous definitely one to call in well text no problem my boss replied take all the time you need yay exactly minutes later i had another message i know youre sick but we need you to come in now thanks boss but i was curious about what precipitated this request so i said id stop by by the time i showed up the workday had been going for about an hour or should have been half the office was at a standstill my boss pulled me to one side and handed me a list everythings broken she said i tried to squeak out a question but i couldnt even manage a whisper instead i had to resort to semaphore with my majestic eyebrows everthing i gestured yes everything she replied without missing a beat start with the printer now you might think being that sick at work with that much crap hitting the fan is a bad thingi certainly didbut its actually liberating no one wants to bother you when you look like something scraped off the hull of a boat i checked the first item on the list printer cant print anymore all right lets have a look as i entered the room people fled like oil from dish soap i looked at the printer and wheezed out a laugh among other things someone had accidentally paused it as evidenced by the blinking pause indicator next on the list computer cant print anymore thankfully pushing resume solved this issue too server wont restart i thought this would have been at the top of the list but whatever i didnt write it turns out the ups died an ungraceful death that very morning and on it went for about two snotfilled hours somehow nearly every electronic device in the office managed to get sick along with me my boss came to the same conclusion so i think it was only half a joke that im not allowed to leave anymore tldr beware the groooove
ok so the previous happened a few weeks ago and after the awesome response i got from you guys i called up friend to get an update the investigation ended a few days after the charge was reversed and the investigation found that there was no wrongdoing in the part of the company but their lawyers suggested a change in their terms of service the lady later called back crying because she took out a bank loan to pay for the server and had no way to pay it back without the profit of the pottery company which is why she had to reverse the charge the call was being recorded and she confessed all that so the recording was given to the police and the fraud charges were dropped my friend asked her why she got such a big server and apparently she thought that gb of ram meant that person could access the website at once so she wanted to be able to get onto it at once in the end no real harm was done to the company beyond legal fees which were paid by the woman since she fraudulently declared fraud and the initial deployment cost of the server she was obviously placed on the noservice list of the company
just want to say i just found this sub and love it i created a google sheet for our head of principals so that he could track the ordering of it equipment and share it with our in school techs i wrote a small script that sends any info to another sheet so the techs only see what they need to and to sort by column in that order it works well and i am happy with it he shares this document with his secretary who works in our it department i came in one morning and people were around her desk because she is saying nothing has worked for minutes no matter what she types it doesnt appear it people google sheet i walk over and look she has grey cells and guess what she had grey font it people couldnt see the font colour ah edit my first post made it to front pageim geeking out and want to say thanks to all of you i look forward to enjoying many a tales from the board
urawkouts story reminded me of my own experience with please hurry i dont work in tech support ready your pitchforks im a developer ive had plenty of roles that have involved doing stuff outside by job due to a combination of small company and all computer work is the same anyway i was working for a small web dev company that sold software to the public sector it was all about public engagement so we had some enthusiastic clients who really wanted to use it and others that didnt really care as long as they were seen to care this particular month wed been adding a few features for our first client in a new country even though it seemed to be one of the boxticking clients it was a good excuse to get the features ready for the serious users it got to the day before launch and i was told to put the site live on the internet i asked for the hosting details and was told that the only decision made was to use aws so i start putting together the machines well need and i ask about budget none there was literally no hosting budget at all so convinced this client was about the fact it was a boxticking exercise i asked if we could ask the client for something in writing about how little traffic they were expecting and got back maybe two or three sessions a day were only referencing it in one place so fine its their money i put it on a small instance and go home true i had the next day off but what could the harm be its only going to be mentioned in one place theyre expecting a dozen or so sessions all day if its slow well bolster it a bit and well have data to show to the client that its needed the next day im at home watching tv having not long woken up and i get a call get in here now fires sure i say ill hop in the shower and head over to the office ill be there in an hour not soon enough skip the shower we dont mind weve sent a taxi get in now fine i get in the taxi to go half a mile to the office the first thing i see when i get in is three people starting ec instances as quickly as they could the hosting budget had been increased by this point to be effectively unlimited you see it turns out that the clients session estimate was a little off they were right it was only announced in one place however that one place was a speech made by the countrys head of state on television and covered in the morning news on all channels it all worked out in the end but it involved working until am halfarsing all the performance fixes we could think of until the site was stable enough to turn off the additional instances added during the day youve never configured varnish until youve done so with representatives of the executive wing of a foreign government shouting weve got a patient whos bleeding what are you going to do to stop the bleeding at you
hello tfts never posted here but my dad told me quite a good story from his days in tech support and i couldnt help but share it so back in the s my dad worked for a company that gave tech support to offices so they wouldnt have to hire a designated it guy one day he got a call from a client who claimed she lost all of her work at lunch every day my dad clearly didnt believe her so he went to the clients office the next day and followed her daily routine throughout the morning she did her work and saved it on a floppy disk all good then came lunchtime oh boy my father said to the client ok its lunch what do you do the client then took out the floppy disk and pinned it to her filing cabinet using a magnet it took him a while to explain to the client that magnets mess up floppy disks and any kind of computer hardware edit this is like months later so not a lot of people will see this but thanks for all the likes n stuff my dad wasnt as excited as i was with an oh cool representing his amount of excitement for the support it got but for me thanks for all the support and especially anyone who posted a comment got some good stories and laughs out of them
i work for a company that is contracted to provide government support we have many contractors but government employees outnumber us about as such they feel they can act and treat us any way they like i am sitting in the call center about minutes prior to the end of my shift i get a call from a particularly nasty customer gtrik supportdepartment how can i help you gtcustomer yeah your ticketing system is broke gtrik give me just a moment let me take a look at it i log in verify i can submit resolve reassign and modify tickets i check the srm imc and woc nothing is remiss gt rik i cant see any issue on my end can you tell me the exact error youre seeing gt customer yeah its knownerror gt rik ah i see i just so happen to know how to fix that can i remotely access your machine he agrees i do so i modify some of the ticket details and do a onceover on the ticket itself i notice he is requesting three separate actions and he is trying to assign it directly to a technician which is against policy gt rik sir this will have to be submitted as three tickets gt customer why ive always done it like this gt rik youre requesting work on three machines that is three tickets in addition you cannot directly assign it to a technician thats done on our end thats the policy gt customer well im not changing how i do it i look over to my supervisor who happens to be in the room i inform him of the situation he tells me to enforce the policy which is to inform the customer that his actions are not permitted and will be cancelled if he submits it gtrik sir while you have the ability to assign the ticket to a technician that technician might not be available just because he is the one that responds the majority of the time does not mean he will always be available in order to provide you with quick and consistent service we assign the tickets to the technicians based on their workload and current taskings if this ticket is submitted and directly assigned it will be cancelled also this must be submitted as three tickets or else it will be cancelled as well as an improper submission my supervisor is next to me and gives me a thumbs up i finish the call disconnect from his machine and walk over to my supervisor gt rik well that was fun gt supervisor let me know what happens chances are hes going to submit it anyways i check and sure enough that technician has a new ticket assigned i cancel the ticket sending the customer an email ccd to supervisor shiftlead and departmentmanager i get a call from him about five minutes after yelling at me for cancelling his ticket i send him a copy of our policy which isnt new and tell him the specific paragraphs that were violated he hangs up midconversation i then see another ticket assigned to the same tech from the same person with the same exact request this is cancelled and emails are sent again this happens twice more that shift the next morning i arrive at work and see that he waited for me to leave before doing it again the technician has already begun working on this ticket so i cannot cancel it i open outlook and find an email from departmentmanager with supervisor and shiftlead ccd the email is a meeting location and time all four of us arrive at the meeting location when departmentmanager suggests going outside for the conversation we go out to the smoking area where supervisor and departmentmanager start smoking i start vaping and shiftlead looks a bit peeved as shiftlead is the only one that does not partake i fill in all three of the saga between customer and myself gt departmentmanager well that explains why he filed a complaint against you gt riksupervisor he did what gt departmentmanager yep said you were rude unprofessional and obscene he also said you had a demeaning tone gt supervisor thats a load of bullshit right there i was standing right next to him and told him what to say he was lucky he didnt have to deal with me because im tired of his shit gt departmentmanager and thats why were out here in an informal environment instead of the conference room where id write your ass up for that we all laugh a little because that week was so stressful we were all about to crack finally it all gets sorted out departmentmanager says he will contact customers supervisor regarding the issue shiftlead leaves and goes back to work the three of us still smokevape outside for a few more minutes supervisor and i discuss ways to prevent the situation from happening in the future i suggest revoking his ticketing credentials and have him use the srm as normal customers do i go back to my desk and modify the customers account in our ticketing system to reflect the changes ten minutes later i get another call gt rik supportdepartment how can i help you gt customer yeah your ticketing system is broke gt rik what seems to be the issue gt customer i cant submit tickets i can only request services gt rik we have recently revoked submission rights from everyone but department heads and technicians if you submit a service request a ticket will be generated and routed appropriately gt customer very infuriated who are you to tell me what i can and cant do give me ticketing rights or im going right to your boss gt rik cant do that sir if you have a complaint i suggest contacting your department head or the supportdepartmentcoordinator the customer hangs up and i dont hear anything for another hour out of the blue a knock lands on our door our office is restricted to authorized personnel enforced by rfid access cards only technicians have authorization to enter this room as well as most management i answer the door with my foot braced against it the customer attempts to push his way through me and fails when that occurs he begins screaming during his tirade a few people had stopped to watch i still have not let him in the office we then hear a voice that was quite loud and quite pissed off gt mysteryvoice what is going on here he turns and i poke my head out the door not two feet away is a very tall very pissed high ranking official his uniform instantly gave away who he was customer stops midsentence and turns white gt official how about we continue this conversation somewhere more appropriate my office five minutes bring your leadership i dont care what they are doing i find supervisor and departmentmanager interrupt the meeting they are having and inform them of what occurred both follow me to officials office in that office we find official officialsecretary customer customerboss and a few other people i dont recognize the conversation gets very brutal very quickly official has to silence everybody and then he looks at me gt official rik what was that about i tell him and stumble over quite a few of my words i have really bad anxiety i take ativan for and finally get the whole story out my body shaking i feel nauseous and certain im going to lose my job official dismisses me and my leadership and we walk outside we start smokingvaping and wait to see the result fifteen minutes later official is standing outside the building holding it open while two security guards walk customer outside and to his car they remove his id access cards and give him a box of all of his stuff from his desk ever since then most of the people that work here have begun treating us like people apparently the government never knew how bad we were being treated but they put a stop to it after that this wasnt the first time something like this had happened but i havent heard anything close to this happen since then 
i did a lot of unpaid it work in high school and was fairly knowledgeable so when i got to college in applying to my universitys help desk seemed to be a logical choice since it was my first professional interview i was really nervous about it before now i had just worked retail and as a line cookdishwasher at a local cafetwo jobs basically given to me with no real interview when i arrived for my interview it was in one of the it conference roomsvery professional very business like the gentleman interviewing me wore a suit and had a stone cold expressionless face sitting across from me after a quick greetingexchange of names he started the interview by saying im a user my computer doesnt work fix it he just sat there staring at meno computer in sight i said well what exactly is it that youre trying to do that wont work use my computer it wont work fix it he said still emotionless whats displayed on your monitor at the moment i asked i dont know that that means my computer isnt working and i cant check my email or grade student assignments fix it i just kind of stared for a momentkind of in shock at how the interview was going but realizing this was probably a fairly common user interaction isis it plugged in i asked no sure of what else to do with no actual computer in this hypothetical and fairly high stress at this point interview my interviewer looked at me grinned mischievously reached across the table to shake my hand and said youre hired youll do well here and then got up and walked out another person came in shortly after and asked me to fill out a w and thats how i got my first real it job

a few years ago i took over a sysadmin job at a highschool because my predecessor was sick and there was no estimate on when hell come back he came back a year later and was fine the system was in a catastrophic state and i had to reinstall most of the servers over the summer and upgrade the year old software that was running the school this included deleting the old active directory domain and users and basically remodeling the whole school a few weeks after school started again a senior came to me and said in a kind of angry voice gt excuse me when will my domain admin account work again i cant log on to the new servers i thought i misheard him or he meant his local machine or something but he was serious the old admin had absolutley no technical skills and just learned how to use some systems but he gave selected students domain admin accounts so they can manage the system also the file servers with the teachers files on them for him and also once a year log onto every computer and install windows updates by hand yes once a year when i told the headmistress about the whole thing she was furious and when the original sysadmin came back he wasnt put in it anymore and i still manage that school

well since my last story was justifiably taken down i dug up another one from my memories two years ago a teacher at my school who is super techilliterate needed some help with her ipad she told me that it wouldnt turn on so i asked to see it there were no visible signs of damage i asked her when it broke and she told me that it had broken over winter break when she was in hawaii i asked her if she knew what happened to it and she said to me gtteacher well i dropped it in the sand on the beach and there wasnt a single grain of sand gtskateguy i dont see any sand on it or in it how did you get the sand out of it gtteacher i walked down to the water and rinsed it off silly wut gtskateguy you mean you wiped it off with water or you actually rinsed it in the ocean gtteacher i dipped it in the water and rinsed it off is something wrong with that gtskateguy actually yes something is wrong with that you cant put your electronics in water she looked at me like she had just witnessed a murder gtskateguy water conducts electricity and the electronic parts inside the ipad that arent supposed to touch will make electrical contact and it will break gtteacher but ive washed off my phone and laptop before i stared at her for a few seconds then i looked at the ipad then back at her gtskateguy its a miracle they survived that you shouldnt do that in the future she walked away in silence sometimes people just need some common sense talked into them edit holy shit this blew up thank you all so much edit to everyone who keeps talking about distilled and ultrapure water i know about all that stuff i just wasnt going to explain all of that to her for fear that she would misunderstand and make the same mistake again because generally water is not something you want around and especially inside your electronics
hey guys so i posted this about two years ago but had to remove it im reposting it again because you liked it so much a bit of back story i work at an isp that deals with fixedwireless and satellite internet to reach rural customers i do tier support for all platforms that we offer for those of you not familiar with the technology used heres the breakdown fixedwireless fw technology uses a pointtomultipoint system where our customers have a transeiver on their roof basically their modem which is connected to a power over ethernet adapter indoors that gets a signal from a tower in the area essentially just an over glorified router that sends the signal upto km or miles away satellite internet works the same way as your tv satellite but in fullduplex simple enough not for some as you can imagine both of these mediums for providing an internet connection can have a few draw backs like weather line of sight and best of all the the customer tampering with the equipment this story involves one of the fw systems that we have and a customer that is fairly new to the whole high speed internet game gtme thank you for calling megacorp technical how can i help you gtcustomer yeah we just got megacorp installed today and it wont work gtme okay maam lets see what we can do after looking into her modem i see that it is online and should be working properly okay maam do you connect to the internet wirelessly or by an ethernet cable gtcustomer how can i tell gtme well do you see a small black power supply that says motorola and has a green light if you follow that cable can you tell me what its plugged into gtcustomer it says tplink gtso i get the model number and google a picture of it gtme okay maam that black box with the silver trim and the green lights it might be warm to the touch do you see what im talking about gtcustomer oh yes i see it gtme perfect i want you to unplug it gtafter asking her to unplug the router she gets up and starts walking i then hear something fall on the floor a fork or a knife maybei start to get worried gtcustomer okay its unplugged gti look at my screen and can clearly see that our modem still has an ethernet link gtme maam i still see that the router is plugged inwhat did you unplug gtcustomer it says kenmore gtawkward silence gtme umm maam did you unplug your blender gtcustomer no i unplugged my toaster gtanother awkward silence gtmeumm okaymay i ask why gtcustomer you told me to unplug my black box with the silver trim green light and it gtme its warm to the touch yesi apparently facepalmed audibly enough that people around me heard and poked their heads up ummm can i get you back over to where your modem is and out of your kitchen tldr asked customer to unplug her router after giving a description and she unplugged her toaster 
this is my second one today but theyre both fairly short so i figured i could get away with posting another we got a support request in our ticketing system pronounced mailing list today that i thought was particularly obtuse gtsubject how do i get this script to work gtbodyim trying to use this script path to script here but i keep getting this error message unable to run script have you checked the preferences allow scripts to run setting my coworker turned around gave me a look of disbelief and replied to his email copypasting the end of the error message verbatim as his only response have you checked the preferences allow scripts to run setting the users reply gtwow that worked howd you figure it out so quickly tldr reading and breathing at the same time is hard
background i do inbound technical support for a large company that sells electronic devices including phones and computers one day i get a call from an elderly woman elderly who has travelled overseas and is currently living on her daughters daughter property elderlys phone and tablet have been giving her some error messages when she tries to access the internet gt ot me thanks for contacting large company my name is oztown how can i help you today gt elderly hi ot i have a phone and tablet with me and i cant get them to access the internet anymore would you be able to help me gt ot sure give me some background information regarding the issue and ill see what i can do gt elderly ok well up until this morning they worked fine i was able to access my email account and browse google but then this morning i get an error cannot connect to network i contacted my wireless carrier back in overseas country but they referred me to you guys its unlikely her phonetablet would have been utilising a cellular network especially with international roaming charges so fair enough gt ot hmmm ok now im assuming youre using a home wifi network to connect these devices to the internet correct gt elderly yes i think so but its weird because all the other phones and computers are working my daughter and her kids havent had any issues its extremely unlikely that two devices blew their wifi connections at the same time so i delve deeper into possible issues with their home network gt ot insert generic home network troubleshooting questions here suddenly daughters voice comes over the line gt daughter this is elderlys daughter im not sure why youre insinuating our wifi network is the problem my mothers two devices are the only ones having issues everything else works fine sigh gt ot i understand but before i go any further i just want to double check a few things can you bring up a webpage on your phone gt daughter ive already told you our devices are working its just my motheoh what im getting cannot connect to network as well prolonged sigh at this point most users get the message and see where im going with this gt ot can you turn off your phones wifi and try the webpage on cellular data please lo and behold it works on cellular data but not on wifi gt daughter well now that means three of your devices dont work this is ridiculous its clearly an issue with them because i have multiple computers in the house that still work fine on the same wireless network i was just on facebook before gt ot are they connected to your network wirelessly or via an ethernet cable gt daughter everything in my house is wireless thats why ive told you its an issue with your hardware daughter had mentioned her computer was a desktop even in the st century its unusual for a desktop to be connected wirelessly so i obviously did not believe her gt ot sure i believe you what i would like to do is for you to go to your computer and test a website for me again she huffs and begrudgingly walks over to the computer gt daughter it works fine i told you gt ot so just to be certain you have not plugged an ethernet cable from your router into the ethernet port on your computer gt daughter how many times do i have to tell you this computer is wireless the only cables plugged in are for power the monitor and keyboardmouse gt ot would you be able to double check the back of the computer just to be sure gt daughter this is ridiculous ive said it times theres no ethernet cable plugged in i make up some bullshit to convince daughter to check gt ot ok gotcha however sometimes a cable can press against the ethernet port which can cause network issues on other devices connected to the same router could you have a quick look for me cue seconds of shuffling the desktop around gt ot so what can you see any cables pressing against it gt daughter theres an ethernet cable plugged in and there it is finally i am victorious time to let this user know who is in charge now gt ot sorry the line cut out for a second could you repeat that for me gt daughter there is an ethernet cable plugged into the ethernet port i could practically hear her grinding her teeth in the background gt ot so the computer is not connected wirelessly gt daughter no unfortunately as most of you fellow techs know users will almost never admit they were wrong and this was the best i could get finally i was able to troubleshoot the wifi network and determine that it wasnt able to establish a connection to whatever provider she was using for internet i verified the devices had no hardware issues then told her to contact said provider for further support

was so cynical that he could make vestal virgins cry he was blunt honest straightforward and called bullshit when he saw and heard it naturally the management hated him he had however saved their collective arses more than once and with his complete disregard for their opinions on him his knowledge and experience they could not get rid of him he also had the smoothest silk tounge i have ever seen from a tech guy small ugly and fat and balding he still chatted up the most beautiful girls on account of his tounge and being the most confident bastard ever i still aspire to be like him not

own systems on this was standard on all help desks even st line in our native country but not where we were working now we got brand new flatscreens to replace our crt screens in with and started fighting about the graphics cards bbbbb thought we could just open the computers and put in a new one stationary ones so it was easy asset management threatened that we would lose support we said hey we are nd line windows support we can support our own computers asset management then said we would void any hardware warranty if we opened the computers so that was that instead we purchased silly expensive crappy usb graphics cards at least times the cost of a basic graphics card capable of having two screens and stashed them in our lockable drawers waiting for our second flatscreen and waited and waited after several months bbbbb went more or less ballistic new equipment was arriving every week but we did not get anything of it instead it was used to replace old crt screens at the sales department so he went after a manager about it bbbbb so when is my team getting their second screens manager well we have other needs to prioritise right now bbbbb so you are saying we are not getting them manager it has worked fine for two months already has it not i dont think you really need them bbbbb we have the budget for it manager well going under budget is a good thing bbbbb comes back furious and hatches a plan using his silk tounge he chats up the girl in the reception and gets her to agree to call him before she calls asset management next time theres a delivery bbbbb come on you vikings time for pillage and plunder follow me me what what are we doing bbbbb you shame your forefathers i would have said pillage and they would have had their axes out were stealing our second screens of course me very well so we went there took screens off the pile of delivered equipment and ran back with them as we are unpacking them the manager comes running manager what are you doing bbbbb installing our second screen manager you have not been assigned this equipment bbbbb oh i did not know that well we have the budget for it so you can just order some more screens right no harm done fighting bbbbb over this when the screens were already in place he had registered them in the asset management system they were in operation and we had the budget was too much for management so we got to keep the screens tolling it tolls for thee the country we were working in used the euro and we all got lots and lots and lots of useless and eurocent copper coins commonly called brownies and change everytime we bought something i managed to use most of mine when i was riding the bus you could only use eurocent and bigger in the softdrink machine so the smaller ones were useless and lots of people assembled large amounts of them so for fun and giggles we started paying roadtolls to each other as we passed each others desks basically just dumping whatever brownies you had at hand when you passed to the curses of the one sitting there then a poor guy went back home for an extended weekend came back and found his desk covered in brownies most of the building had seen them accumulating on his desk and took the opportunity to dump their change there as well there were easily coins on his desk he sighed and cursed a bit when he got back then he got a really slow case some of the users on his account wre local admins and now and then they would get a case with a computer completely filled with spyware and malware he told the user to go home after lunch connected to his computer and started the cleanup being bored just watching the status bar millimetring its way through the cleanup he started sorting piling and pyramiding the coins on his desk after a while bbbbb passes by sees on the screen that he is working nods and keeps walking after a short while he returns and points to a small pyramid of coins bbbbb that is one euro isnt it collegue yeah why bbbbb throws a euro bill on the desks and proceeds to rake in five piles of coins with a devilish smile collegue nice but what are you doing with the coins bbbbb the girls at the cafeteria fucked with me yesterday im going for a coffee learning well me and bbbbb are part of a documentation group management recently changed the document standard for no real reason at all so we need to lift everything weve done to the new format manually as they dont provide any kind of automatisation with the new format bbbbb management i swear to god if i could see their inbred genepool me they dont have a genepool they have a cesspool bbbbb me what bbbbb i have taught you well young padawan exactly what we want a team meeting discussing the latest ideas of reorganisation from management trying to mitigate the disaster it would bring bbbbb alright then we have a good plan collegue yeah then we get exactly what we want me salma hayek covered in honey collegue no i he goes silent for a second thinks and then breaks up in a big smile yeah bbbbb i really like how you think vonadler let me google that ooooh wow that is wow we also had a software distribution team that was overstaffed due to organisational changes it also continued to work together with the team in the home country for several months since they had a long notice time so there was work for people and there were persons doing it one of the guys at our place got bored got a new job and gave his weeks notice since there were so little work and the other guys were not fully trained yet as they got too little work to do to properly train he and them agreed that he would not do any work for the weeks notice time so he installed world of warcraft on his machine and sat there playing for weeks bbbbb who knows the situation walks by and spots the collegue playing wow bbbbb what are you doing collegue playing wow bbbbb what level are you collegue bbbbb haha i am better than you he then proceeds to walk off edit

years ago i worked for a company that sold staffing software our product scheduled staff according to predicted need employee availability and business rules it was pretty neat it could store data to a number of formatstargets including a proprietary database format on a local drive we had one client that chose to use the latter database format while they were in beta testing i taught all the employees involved in the project how to do everything and things went well at first one day about halfway through beta their database started getting corrupted frequently but with no discernible pattern i was at wits end and the clients management was starting to doubt our product so naturally i was worried we had great recovery tools and never lost data but it was a serious pita after a lot of back amp forth with questions i went back to roots troubleshooting the clients rep and i had a call in which we walked through a typical days procedures for data import validation and running reports everything she did was correct so i was baffled why we were having problems until she interrupted me saying hold on the screen is scrambled up i replied saying what do you mean scrambled up she replied oh well when the elevator goes by the screen gets all mixed up with static and oddly enough the data file was corrupted once again skip to the punch line they moved my reps desk next to a large electric elevator and the electromagnetic interference was impacting her computer i told her to move the pc to a less electrically noisy location and after one more data recovery there were no more issues sometimes location is as important in it as it is in real estate
hey tfts remember my last story about the girl who brought me her monitor instead of the pc today i had a similar situation last week i sold a new imac to one of our customers because he didnt want to deal with viruses anymore bullshit i know and since he already had a macbook he didnt want me to install it at his home today he called in furious anger me hello this is customer how dare you ripping me off like that me good day sir you dont mind telling me the problem before you scream like a maniac customer you know exactly what you did you ripped me off i have all the right to scream since he didnt bother to tell me his name i looked up his phone number in our customerdatabase and saw that i sold him an imac a week ago me if i have to guess theres something wrong with your imac customer damn right theres something wrong with my imac you didnt give me the whole thing me how didnt i send the whole thing customer you just gave me the freaking monitor me have you tried to plug it in and turn it on before customer goes away from the phone i hear the typical apple boot sound and the customer hangs up the phone tldr customer thought i was ripping him off by just sending the monitor he ordered an imac

this was from several years back when i was working as roaming tech support for a number of urgent care facilities management had come up with a brilliant way of extracting a few extra dollars from clients generating more revenue by selling a computer clean up amp maintenance package basically this meant i would run updates by hand use thatonecleanerutility to clean up temporary files and if need be i would open up the case and vacuum out some dust monday morning a new client so i decide to hit their office first new clients just love when it shows up first thing makes them feel important the manager at genericurgentcare thought herself quite techsavvy im moving from computer to computer and there were about at this one location doing my thing it usually takes me about minutes to get everything cleaning and updating before i would move on to the next manager would follow me around from computer to computer all the while giving me nfl style commentary tips and play by plays everything is going swimmingly the office staff loves me im being charming chatting with the nurses while working on the computers you can type without looking cool says cutefrontdeskgirl yeah cool as i get to the last couple of computers im thinking that i just aced this first visit thats when i hear manager come stomping down the hall gtmanager what did you do to my documents gtme im sorry i havent touched any documents thinking on my feet i immediately follow that up with lets go take a look at your computer im sure theyre still there we get to her computer she clacks into the keyboard loudly her four character password gtmanager i dont know what you did but you need to fix it all of my documents are gone without asking her to move i reach for the mouse and open the my documents folder there are dozens of files and pictures mostly of one of those little yipyip dogs fitting i look at the folder confused and then back to the manager gtme sorry are these not the documents youre referring to gtmanager exasperated sigh no not those documents she snatches the mouse from me and to my disbelief double clicks on the recycling bin gtmanager i had dozens of documents in the recycling bin i need those files dumbfounded i say nothing for probably seconds as i look from her deadpan stare to the computer screen and back gtme so you keep your documents in the recycling bin gtmanager im not an idiot my normal documents arent in there just the ones that we reuse all the time like the patient sign in forms and things like that it hits me like a ton of bricks she thinks that the recycling bin is for recycled or reuse documents gtmanager why on earth would you delete my documents an hour later and a getdataback later her documents were back i moved them into a new folder and spent the next minutes trying to explain to her that the recycling bin was for deleting documents manager being techsavvy as she was held her ground and adamantly refused to believe me it wasnt until cutefrontdeskgirl came over and agreed with me that she finally caved 
context i work at a wireless phone service and im the highest level of tech support customer calls in pretty heated me hi sorry for the long wait how can i assist you today customer are you a supervisor i specifically need to talk to a supervisor in billing support me no maam im in tech support are you having a technical issue or a billing issue customer why arent you a supervisor me umm i guess because i didnt apply at the time my supervisor was listening to the teams calls and happened to be listening to mine he almost fell out of his chair laughing i kinda got in trouble for saying that but i couldnt resist upon such a ridiculous question 
hey kiddos im back with a story that happened recently it started with a guy who looked like he was maybe in his fifties but generally pretty nice as he approached the tech support counter he was with a woman who seemed a lot younger and they smile and set a new lenovo laptop on the counter explaining that they want to hook it up to a projector i tell them that their laptop has an hdmi port so all theyll need to do is grab an hdmi cable which can be found in several places in our store the man seems confused and pulls out a packaged adaptor one end usb gtman well we found this can we use this i explain that no that particular adaptor wont work it wont transfer over the picture i explain that the only port for this on his laptop is an hdmi and if the projector for some reason does not have hmdi he can get an adaptor to go to vga at that he nods and says that he wants to use vgu that he has to all the devices he has has these vgus and nothing uses hdmi he wants to know how he can use a vgu port on his laptop gtme sir your laptop does not have vga you can get an adaptor but its a lot more efficient to get an hdmi cable gtman okay well sweetie no one uses this hdmi in the real world everywhere has vgu i understand you like your high tech stuff but the world real does not use hdmi i literally stared at him as he ranted for the next minutes about the real world not using hdmi it was condescending enough i stared at him let him finish and just said okay that seemed to alert him that maybe hes being a jerk and he apologizes for lecturing me about it its just that really no one uses hdmi gee thanks mister its a wonder how i got this job good thing i have smart clients like you to educate me on my job the entire time the woman hes with is rolling her eyes as he rants and finally speaks up gtwoman shes saying this is what is going to work with your computer this is what you get for buying something new new things use hdmi our projector has hdmi your stuff is old lets go get a cable i think i fell in love regardless the man stops ranting about the real world and is dragged off to go get a cable edit wow was not expecting the response that i got here thank you guys as a note i understand that a lot of places still use vga thats fine what i was pointing out was that he brought his laptop to me to ask how to connect it and then ranted and raved when my answer used the hdmi port his laptop had and apparently his projector has as well while its fine that some places still utilize vga its ignorant to assume hdmi is unused as he was trying to say hdmi is in the majority of consumer products such as tvs and laptops and is utilized in business devices as well not everyone has made the switch but the real world does in fact use hdmi also quote of the day thank you again im happy to see that me venting about work has been so well received

thought i should share another story from a few years ago this one is a happier story though to lead into the new week with so a few years ago we had some political event in the city because of all the foreign dignitaries and so on it was decided that the city was essentially on a public holiday for one day only as parts of the city would be shut down this meant that we were getting a paid day off even though we were far away from anywhere affected so a lot of us were looking forward to it the friday before the day off a monday some of us were having after work drinks in one of the common areas and the sales manager asks a serious question who is working from tech support over the shut down only the city is shutting down the rest of the country still needs support a few moments before he said this i had seen my coworker leave for the day i also knew my boss and supervisor lived over an hour away and could already tell that because i lived ten minutes away i was going to be the likely candidate my manager immediately decided that this had to be decided now and i was called into his office to discuss this he knew i had no plans for the day from an earlier discussion but wasnt going to screw me over in leave time either he offered that if i came in hed give me two and a half days off in place of my standard day off we also knew that it would possibly be quite so he told me flat out to bring in video games books etc to keep myself entertained i made the deal agreed to come in and even got money to order pizza so far the deal was a good one in my mind on the day i had to work i enjoyed a five minute drive to work all green lights no traffic a parking space right out the front and then sat in a dim office for a few hours not being sure where the light switches were i wandered around a few times i got maybe five calls that day and was pretty sure i was the only one in the building im basically sitting there earning a half week free holiday by playing zelda about midday the managing director turns up i realise this when the lights all turn on and he finds ive been sitting in mood lighting for the past few hours we chat back and forth a bit he has come in to catch up on some paperwork and go about our business after an hour or so he starts to get bored and begins wandering around the building weve only been there a few months if memory serves me right and he was prone to go exploring he appears while im becoming the scourge of chickens with a very serious expression turelio ive found something and need your help ok whats up he produces from the other side of the partition a few bags of crisps i found these on a shelf in the storage room they expire a few months from now if we leave them there they could go off and someone could get sick for the good of the business we should eat these now i have no problem with this plan also this orange juice a tray appears with a dozen or so bottles from where the crisps were i believe i can help with this assignment good i knew i could count on you ill do my share as well remember if this food is left in a few months it could be an ohamps issue he returns to his office with his own drinks and crisps for the next few hours i basically conform to the tech supportgaming stereotype drinking sugary drinks and eating junk food every so often he comes to check on my progress offer a fact from under the lid of an orange juice bottle and generally tell me im doing a good job later that day he appears with more food and drink and asks if i want some as i had said i was catching up with friends that night and he thinks they can help with this dangerous matter yes yes they can also as thanks from the company have these polo shirts wait are you just raiding the marketing stash these are for an old promotion but there is nothing wrong with them they probably forgot about them cool free clothes as im leaving i stop by his office to say thanks and goodbye he waves goodbye and says in the gravest tone just remember you may have saved some lives today i laugh and leave all is good a few weeks later people are sorting out after work drinks and at some point he must have been asked what happened to the crisps and juice the first i hear of it is when he leads someone from marketing to my desk makes me stand up and says lives were in danger this man is a hero and leaves with no more explanation tldr ate junk food management claimed i saved lives because of it edit well this seems to have got a lot of interest im pretty shocked also thank you for the gold doecky

hi tfts thought it was about time i shared this little anecdote about years ago i worked at a national newspaper in the tech support department my team of was responsible for networks and telephony which meant our tickets were always related to internet connection issues or problems with their desk phones we had an sla service level agreement to respond to a ticket within hours and resolve it within days which was pretty reasonable considering we received so few tickets in to our queue thanks to our surprisingly exemplary first line support team so one day at around pm while my colleague is trying to get me to go with him to the pub for the remainder of the day our empty queue receives a ticket im so bored at this point i snap it up a journalist who tech support refer to as journos is unable to make phone calls from her desk phone so ignoring my colleagues desire for a stiff drink i jump up and dash off to the journalists desk to deal with her problem the second i arrive she starts yelling at me doesnt even say hello or explain her problem just starts yelling at me and bear in mind that its a fully open plan office of over people that she cant make any fing phone calls and its an absolute disgrace etc etc after a few seconds of this i stopped listening to the specifics of her angry shouting and eventually cut her off and calmly explained i have an sla to respond within hours ive arrived within minutes so im going to go away and come back in another hours and minutes and if youve calmed down by then ill take a look at your phone and walked off leaving her standing by her desk mouth wide and speechless it was still a very quiet day so i returned about an hour later this time she didnt say a word and just gestured towards her phone at which point i lean over and plug the ethernet cable back in to it and the phone boots up as normal she wheels around a look of disbelief on her face and says thats it it just needed to be plugged in to which i respond well if youd let me look at it earlier rather than shouting about it i could have dealt with it then short pause is there anything else i can help you with to which she replies sheepishly no awkward pause thank you i felt pretty good about closing that ticket tldr shouty journalist just needed to plug her desk phone in
lady brings in a laptop for service sets it on the front counter i start to open the lid and at least a half dozen roaches immediately crawl out of the vents a quickly start to scatter out everywhere over my front counter i start tracking down and smashing said roaches and lady hands son the laptop tells him to go outside and shake the laptop out during which i politely explain that you cant just shake them out of a laptop and that unfortunately i wont be able to check the laptop in this condition in for service now lets be logical for a moment shall we the way i stay in business is to check in computers for service so if im turning it away there is good reason the cost of paying to get rid of the roaches would greatly exceed the money wed make servicing her laptop plus liability issues if they got in other customers machines plusroaches anyway i do my best to explain politely several times that we cant check it in but shes not having any of it gtyou wont even look at it and tell me whats wrong finally she gives up and starts storming out gtwell well never come back here againand ive got six family members and ill make sure they know to never come here so you just lost six customers you know whenever i hear the ill never come here again line i always have to bite a hole in my lip to keep from saying promise 
i traveled to iran recently with my dad and sister im british but my dad is iranian and speaks the language farsi my sister and i dont speak farsi at all and it means were usually bored when were dragged to family friends houses and everyone speaks farsi anyway one day we went to a family friends house for lunch after eating lunch people were just sitting around talking in farsi for literally hours and i got pretty bored so i went on my phone and searched for a wifi network so i could browse reddit keep in mind i dont have access to gg on my british phone so i need wifi no wifi networks found so i had to endure more boredom what i would usually do is find out if a network is available and if so if they have a password get my dad to ask them for it politely in farsi in this case as i couldnt find a network i just forgot about it and assumed they either didnt have internet access or just had a wired connection with a single pc anyway later on my sister asks me if they have wifi as she was bored i told her that i couldnt find any networks about an hour after that i told my dad we were really bored and they had no wifi my dad then insisted on asking the homeowner if we could use their wifi despite no networks being available the following conversation took place with my dad speaking farsi to the homeowner and translating everything i say in english gt dad do you mind if we use your wifi gt homeowner sure just switch on your bluetooth gt me waitwhat bluetooth surely you mean wifi gt homeowner no i mean bluetooth youll need that to use our wifi i decided to humour him and just switch on my bluetooth no devices found i showed homeowner gt homeowner thats strange let me show you my phone he then shows me that his phones wifi is switched off the bluetooth is switched on and hes paired with another device which hes using the internet connection of gt me whose device are you connected to how come youre using that instead of a wifi router gt homeowner i have no idea what youre talking about my son set it all up for me hes good with computers gt me ummmok so i investigate further and found their home wifi network works like this the family dont have broadband or a wifi router at all homeowners son has g on his phone and is bluetooth paired with his dads phone security settings on both devices mean neither can be found by other devices eg my iphone and both devices trust each other if homeowners sons phone moves too far away from his his phone loses internet as he doesnt have g on his own phone this meant he had no internet if he was at home but his son wasnt at home their son spoke a tiny bit of english so i spoke to him and he said we had to do the following he adds my iphone to his phones bluetooth trusted devices list ask homeowner if its okay if we unpair his phone and then pair mine as multiple devices cant be paired to his phone pair my phone and use his g connection i then suggested just setting up a hotspot on his phone and then both homeowner and i connect by actual wifi he had no idea what i was talking about homeowner was also unhappy about unpairing his phone from his sons on the grounds that were changing everything my dad was unable to explain coherently in farsi the benefits of using wifi instead of bluetooth so basically i couldnt use the internet a new life goal of mine is to learn farsi go back there and actually help them with this mess tldr tech illiteracy language barrier boredom and frustration
a few requested that i finish the story here i guess i want to let it out this all happened a while back and i have never really opened up about it so after the events detailed the previous post there was an uncomfortable apology from the boss that could be translated as technically i have to apologise again but i will expose you one day this was a very stressful workplace a culture of paranoia coupled with a dismal technical capacity in management created many story worthy events during the short time i was there for example gtboss who is this alpha why did you have him test our software gtme explains that alpha testing is people in our own company providing feedback gtboss people should not be pointing out problems in our software its disrespectful to the company i want to see all these testers in my office now anyway there was a series of baseless accusations some comically funny others just sad eg accusing me of stealing the sata cables from a left over motherboard box the results were always the same me proved undeniably innocent and two apologetic managers only more determined to justify their persecution of myself it got quite petty after a while long hours at a keyboard left me with bad carpel tunnel cold triggered the pain and hot water relived it so i often did the dishes for the company a chance to relive pain management became aware of why i was being so helpful and enforced a new rule that staff were not allowed to use hot water for cleaning dishes yep you read that right every time the tap was found to be warm it was inspected regularly i was accused of breaking company policy and raked over the coals always another employee would come forward and explain they had used hot water to clean a coffee cup and i was not at fault thanks guys if your reading this anyway denial of hot water not being enough to destry my nerves out of shear malice management now instituted deg cel air con standard and a table set outside my office held a burning incense thing that management had discovered triggered my hayfever then came a big problem the two managers would be away for a fortnight obviously chaos would rain while the tech nerds happily made free with the companies hot water so one of the managers sneekly turned of the water tap to thee hot water system before leaving again technology was not thier strong suite the water was off but not the power so the bloody hot water system exploded the next day then something really bad happened australia introduced enterprise bargaining a policy that destroyed many workplace rights under the new system i had been forced to become a subcontractor not an employee then my wages started to be delayed i had not been paid in two months others much longer one lady months in the final days before i quit we were made to sign contracts stating we would be fired without pay even back pay if we were found to have broken any law in anyway even outside of the company and then the persecution turned ugly i was brought into a random meeting with the two managers and told that i should not be logging out of my firefox browser before leaving work i said i did this so other people would not access my email etc they replied that protecting myself like this was very suspicious and i should not do it i didnt budge on the issue one day i was rushed out of work and forgot to log out of firefox i decided to go back in and do so just incase i discovered my favorite two managers at my desk looking at my computer they demanded to know why i had returned i said i want to log my internet browser out i got a reprimand for being paranoid and untrusting after this i had given notice another firm had made me a good offer and i was due to leave for what would turn out to be an awesome job else where if i left without being fired for breaking the law however they would be forced to pay me my back wages now over k many things were attempted in vain to see if even the flimsiest evidence of wrong doing could be found i had never broken the law and not done anything unprofessional in the slightest yet the persecution was now unrelenting what followed in my final weeks a software licence we were using expired when it failed to start i was accused of stealing the licence for myself a consultant was hired under pretext of job handover his real job to look over my shoulder i was being followed into the toilet no idea why boss walked in having seen my car was not in the carpark shouted loudly to the whole firm that i was half an hour late and would be made an example off then saw me in my office put on his shit i will have to make another formal apology face then a dim light bulb went of in his head and instead he told me i was not allowed to park in other than my allocated spot i told him i had taken the train today because my car was in the shop he stormed away apology came hrs later on one of my last days i was sitting in my office all offices had plate glass walls and saw the other manager stomping around the office she plugged her laptop into every ethernet port trying to do something got annoyed that something did not work and moved onto the next port then she found the companies adsl router and plugged into that she tried whatever it was she was doing and then it worked she sat at the desk next to the router with her laptop and gave me a very smug look this was the smuggest i finally got you face i had ever seen and that irritated me knowing the router was a hub not a switch and that all internet traffic was going through it i quickly acted on a hunch about what i thought was going on i opened up a browser window and in google typed please dont spy on what i do on the internet she startled in pure disbelif when the shock wore off she comprehended the situation i had her breaking australian law she was at that time not allowed to spy on workers internet usage in this way but i had no proof unless she admitted it so angry as a cat in a tutu she slammed her laptop shut and stormed into my office to angry to even speak she sat down in the desk opposite mine opened hep laptop and just sat glaring at me and there she remained for a couple of hours till my lunch break just sitting unmoving unblinking and glaring as for me totally unphased and unstressed for the first time in my life i just couldnt give a fk any more edit since someone asked i thought i should share what the last day was like 
back in years after windows nt ran out of support and years after it was released we could finally convince our customers that we dont intend to continue supporting ie and that all endusers should be upgraded to ie which was out for years by then we knew that the site was working mostly ok in ie but there was a nasty display glitch as we have agreed with our customers to not support ie we werent going to fix that glitch cue the support ticket reporting the display glitch we told them to upgrade their ie as the minimum version required was a then years old browser they told us they were running ie and still had the issue i told them to send me a screenshot of the aboutdialog box of their ie and yes it was showing ie though the design of the dialog box was different from my machine which made me suspicious ive told them to visit some specially crafted url that was basically listing some request parameters i told them to scroll to the line that says useragent and to list me what it says there they responded with mozilla compatible msie windows nt busted and that was the day when that company updated their yearsoutof support os to an os that was only years old at the time when this happened to windows and of which only later versions already existed at that point xp server vista so not only did they lie about the browser version they also went through the trouble of faking a screenshot of the about box in the vain hope that we might magically fix the issue if we believe they were using a browser that was supported of course even if we did believe them fixing an issue we cannot reproduce is next to impossible

back in the late s i did troubleshooting over the phone for pcs and printers this was when printers were moving off of dos drivers and onto those at the time really sketchy windows only drivers that were a beast to troubleshoot and would get jobs stuck in queue quite regularly one day i mlady get a call from a gentleman gent who cant print mlady thank you for calling hcpb my name is mlady how may i assist you gent i cant print and need help mlady i can certainly assist you let me take a look at your account go ahead and tell me a little more about whats happening gent says some vague things about it working earlier and now it wont print mlady sir that is a very common issue that is typically resolved worth a restart of your computer i do show you are out of warranty and to walk you through rebooting your computer i would have to charge you or you can hang up restart and if it doesnt work you can give us a call back gent he smells a hose and close theres no way thats it blah blah blah i know better mlady sir i promise you ive seen this hundreds of times were open for hours yet although we didnt have a toll free number and if it doesnt work you can call right back gent doesnt believe me and im going to get scored down if i accidentally hang up on him so we go through the minutes of taking his credit card information you know whats coming mlady ok sir click start shutdown restart and let me know when the computer is back up theres no chit chat he thinks im a fucking idiot the appropriate amount of time goes by gent k is rebooted sounding smug in my memory mlady pick anything you want and try and print for me printer noises gent i just paid to reboot my computer didnt i mlady yes sir you did speaking as level as i could gent ltclickgt
it was about pm the entire building had long since gone home but id stuck around to do some afterhours maintenance on a few routers in the public colo room where our customers housed all their equipment when youve been working for hours straight your brain stops working the way it normally would and tends to get a narrow focus one thing thats vital for any tech is the three pocket tap back right left wallet keys phone no matter where you are you can probably work something out as long as you have them as i heard the officetodc door click closed i immediately realised id been so caught up debugging id forgotten to pt please let them be there for the love of god let them be there they were not there the awareness of my situation came slowly no wallet means no access card okay ill call someone no phone okay well i guess i can always just abandon the work and go home wait no wallet means no bus i guess i could always walk i mean its far but no keys it was a rare winters day that the heavilystocked datacentre was cold but dear god was it cold that night and i had no jacket the trio of ac units hummed merrily pumping degree air into the room sleeping on the floor of the datacentre was not an option although it would become one later thats a story for another time wow i was really stuck i could use egress buttons to get further out of the facility and gamble on being able to break back in somewhere else but i would only end up stuck further away from the things i so desperately wished id remembered alright chhopsky you can do this you just have to figure something out this is what we trained for i checked everything jimmying the door and lock didnt work the lock was a strike so i couldnt cut power to it either i tried every technique i could think of to bypass the security after half an hour i was starting to wonder whether maybe sleeping on the floor was the best plan after all and just living with pneumonia like a bolt of lightning genius struck in one particular rack there was an old cisco for those lucky enough to have missed these things a is an ancient serial router commonly used for out of band management stick a dialup modem on one end and then serial ports out to routersswitchesserverswhatever i had a phone line and id been testing ports to identify phone numbers earlier in the week and by random chance id left the crappy old telecom phone in the rack i was saved snapping in the rj socket with a relieved grin i dialled the only number i knew my home number my girlfriend at the time who ill call pants picked up her sweet voice echoing through the crackling line like an innocent cherub gt pants hello gt chhopsky oh my god pants im so happy i need y gt pants hello gt chhopsky what hello pants can you hear me gt pants covering the receiver yeah i dont know who it is theres some crackling but noones talking gt chhopsky you have got to be kidding me gt pants guess its a bad line or a fax machine or something she hung up i immediately called back gt chhopsky hello pants hello gt pants its doing the thing again i dont know i think someones there gt chhopsky hello i am here its chhopsky please i am stuck the receiver clicking down was the most gutwrenching sound of disappoinment id ever heard i realised id never actually used this phone to talk only ever to dial numbers and hit modems something in it was busted so noone was ever going to hear me through it i tried to get it open to fix it but without tools which were also on the other side of the door it wasnt going anywhere at this point ethics kind of went out the window the one solitary thing i had in my posession was a key for those not in the know the key is a magical key that most racks ship with by default armed with a tiny piece of metal i was going to go through every customers rack until i found something that could help me i opened every single rack in the room nothing no tools no tape no zip ties nothing i slumped against the back wall of the back row defeated thats when i saw it the most beautiful sight in the world a brand new touchtone analogue phone hidden under a waterfall of console cables behind a customers i shouted in joy to noone in particular thanked the gods that someone else had been doing the same work that i had and hastily stole the hell out of it when i finally got through to pants i was able to talk her through logging onto my computer connecting to my work vpn rdping into the security system and the incredibly long and drawnout process of navigating the ancient awful security software to manually override the locks default state to open when that relay clicked it was like the hills were alive with the sound of metal on metal i dropped the phone and busted through the door shivering and ecstatic both at once i had won i had beaten the impossible situation i had opened a door wrapping myself in a jacket i stood behind the airconditioner heat vents in the plant room for five minutes then ziptied my wallet to my belt and got back to work these routers werent going to upgrade themselves
i get a call from a user asking me to reset her password no problem i just need to confirm its in fact her so call up the security question where did you meet mans name ann arbor michigan thats not the answer we have on file maam that is where i met him your hint is somewhere hot maam oh yeah i forgot i changed it after i divorced him i made the answer hell didnt i yes you did maam ill reset your password now
i am just a humble mostlytechilliterate enduser operations manager at a bank i read your tales from time to time it helps me feel better about myself at least im not that bad anyway reading your posts has helped me communicate better with my it department i used to be superintimidated communicating with it folks sometimes i would just live with issues rather than try and resolve them i actually went or months with a wonky mouse because i figured it was easier than dealing with the help desk after a month or two of reading this subreddit i started to become more comfortable submitting help desk tickets first i never call i always submit a ticket second i always try rebooting first third i dont try to diagnose the problem myself i just state clearly what the issue is never just saying it just doesnt work if there is an error message i screenshot it or repeat it verbatim lastly and perhaps most importantly i never pretend to know more than i do if i dont understand something i say so you guys most of you have made it clear that you dont expect us to know your job just like we dont expect you to know ours you just expect us to be reasonable clear and polite which is exactly what we expect from you anyway sorry if this post doesnt belong here its just that i had another pleasant experience with my help desk and felt like saying thank you to all of you have a nice day
background i work as an internal helpdesk technician in the corporate offices of a usbased chain of bigbox stores another day another round of users this morning starts with a fairly generic ticket to fix some printer settings after a store mucked it up fixed the printer but now i need the store to restart it commence calling the store in gt ring ring ring now where the stores are concerned policy states that it comes first if someone from it is calling you pick up the phone because either something is broken or theyre giving you updates on something else that was broken either way it still affects your bottom line four minutes of ringing go by no one has yet picked up the phone what is a lowly tech supposed to do whelp lets see what theyre up to while the phone is still ringing ive pulled up their security cameras and logged in were now at six minutes of ringing gt ring ring ring theres a man standing next to the obviously ringing phone on one of the manager computers judging by his shirt hes definitely a manager as im watching on the cameras he turns and looks at the ringing phone which has caller id so he can see its me thats calling and goes back to his computer this cannot stand so i remote into his computer hes writing an email its a very nonimportant email one click later and his mouse and keyboard stop taking input a sly grin slowly stretches across my face as he quickly spirals into despair that he cant type his email he doesnt take frustration well grabbing the mouse and slamming it onto the counter hitting the keyboard it was actually like watching a toddler gt open notepad gt please pick up the phone gt ring ring hello tldr i dont know who you are i dont know what you want if you are looking for peace and quiet i can tell you i dont have any but what i do have are a very particular set of skills skills i have acquired over a very long career skills that make me a nightmare for people like you if you pick up the phone now thatll be the end of it i will not look for you i will not pursue you but if you dont i will look for you i will find you and i will call you again previous tales on tfts its a christmas those guys are worthless absolutely 
back in july i was downtown on business and was just waiting for a cab to get back to the office it was a beautiful day and all was well in the world but a panicked man next to me clearly felt otherwise he seemed angry and frustrated he kept looking at his phone then the street signs then the phone again then the street signs looked like he was about to throw the phone in the general direction of a brick wall he was close enough i could see he was looking at the maps app and that his phone was a nexus gt bytewave hey do you need directions to some place looks like the phones not being very helpful gt stranger yes oh god yes im soooo late theres this restaurant i have to get to for a business lunch and the phones all messed up again and i dont know this city can you give me directions to this place unfortunately i had no idea where the place he wanted to get to was theres a ridiculous amount of restaurants around there no man knows them all but at a glance i could tell the maps app was putting him several blocks away a symptom i was all too familiar with gt bytewave im sorry not familiar with the restaurant but maybe i can help you with the phone thats kind of my thing there arent that many reasons why maps would give you wrong positioning mind telling me what carrier youre in business with when you got that nexus whether or not you ever switched sim cards and how long ago you started having this kind of trouble he looked at me a little puzzled for a second of course its unusual for strangers to try to troubleshoot your phone out on the street but when i see a problem i can solve easily sometimes i just get into troubleshooting mode its hard to leave a problem i can fix unattended gt stranger eh at this point why not im with mildlyevilcable name i use in my tales for the telco i work at i got this like soon after it was commercially available no switch of cards and this began a few months back how will any of that help though the antenna inside must just be broken im planning to replace it soon i smiled knowing i probably knew already what was wrong with it gt bytewave i assure you im going somewhere with this is there any chance that you had to do a factory reset on that phone a few months back gt stranger ehh err yes how would you gt bytewave settings wirelessampnetworks more preferred network type itll be set as lte select g instead then do a power cycle then maps will work fine and youll get where you need to go later you should get your sim card switched to an lte one at any of their stores its free this is a commonplace issue for us at the telco with nexus s when they launched much of our network was still g and we sold them with g sim cards later we went fullblown lte but thing is if you do a factory reset on those and it detects our lte network on setup itll set its preferred network type to lte even though theres a g sim inside we replace those sims for lte ones without charge but most customers dont know about any of this and end up with the wrong network preference what happens when you select lte with a g sim in a n phone precisely what was happening to this guy the phone still works mostly but your location data will be all messed up causing severe issues with apps like maps your location will show up as far as a halfmile away from where you really are and there are other consequences such as delayed connectivity as you exit an elevator or a subway things like that all it takes to fix it is either to switch to an lte sim or manually set it back to g in one instance its even caused issues for our internal security department which turned out to be unable to execute a police warrant to track a phone properly the known issue network ticket about that has not been updated in over a year last entry just says on hold pending external input aka google isnt in much of a hurry to help our engineering figure out whose fault it is either way the stranger complied gt stranger theres no way it shows the right place now how how could you just guess it just like that gt bytewave my cabs coming over there you just stumbled on the right guy at the right time happy to be able to help have a good day as i was walking towards the cab he ran after me reached for my left arm and rammed a bunch of bills into my hand turns out that sometimes you can actually get paid for random acts of tech support all of bytewaves tales on 
a longtime client of mine called me with an unusual problem his energy bill tripled last month from to and the only new addition to his house is a multifunction printer i figured itd definitely be something trivial like heating as its been a very cold and wet winter here ive been called over for far simpler things in the past but thought id pay him a visit as hed do the same for me if the roles were reversed i arrive at the gentlemans house and run over the obvious devices with high energy consumption space heater nope client runs gas water heater nope client runs gas clothing dryer yes twice a week for a few hours per week in energy costs splitsystem aircon yes only twice this month for one hour at a time total cost tv yes but usage patterns match previous months perplexed i reluctantly checked out the new printer as nothing else seems to have changed theres no way in hell a small inkjet can account for such high power consumption without someone noticing excessive heat a smell or something the printer showed no obvious signs of malfunction its the standard cheapshit orificeworks hp mfc inkjet with a crappy printer glued to a crappier scanner inside of which lies an insanely noisy belt drive it printed normally and its power supply was cool to the touch i suspected a misreading of the energy meter by the power company as were talking triple the previous months bill here i had to be sure though as id look like a complete ass to everyone if im wrong so out comes the trusty ac clampmeter and i tell everyone not to turn anything on or off i removed the screws to the clients switchbox calibrate zero the clampmeter attach it the main circuit breaker feed and wait for it to stabilize for those unfamiliar with clampmeters they allow you to fairly safely measure realtime power consumption using something called the halleffect the readings displayed are usually in amps but you can multiply the reading by the line voltage to get watts and divide watts by to get kilowatts youre usually billed in kilowatt hours which is how many kilowatts you consume per hour based on the clients normal bills i ballpark his hourly consumption at kilowatts per hour which works out to a meter reading of amps of course the reading will change depending on whether or not the fridge or other appliances are active but were just after a sanity check here the meter reading finally stabilizes and were at an idle reading of amps so i break out the calculator and run some figures i have an approximate reading of amps and a line voltage of volts australia amps x volts watts which is kilowatts per hour kilowatts per hour x hours in a day kilowatts per day kilowatts per day x days in july kilowatts the client is charged at roughly cents per kilowatt hour so kilowatts used in july x per kilowatt hour jesus christ were pretty close to last months bill its likely that there wasnt a misreading afterall i ran through the house and verified active devices one pc one lcd tv one large fridge one bar fridge and a couple of small led downlights i have the same energy provider and much more running idle at home with half the idle consumption something is seriously wrong here with the clampmeter still attached i turned off all the auxillary breakers my idea was to turn the breakers on one by one until i find the circuit that draws an unusual amount of current i start flicking the breakers on one by one until theyre all on with nothing unusual reported by the meter i get to the last breaker and im still only at amp total current i ensure all the devices that should be on are on and they are except the fridges they cycle on and off automatically as required turning their power source off then on wont guarantee that their compressors will restart immediately so now im feeling like a smug git thinking that its definitely one of the fridges that are at fault so i sit there for a good twenty minutes waiting for the click of a fridge compressor i hear two almost concurrent clicks as both the main and bar fridges power up pretty unusual and almost trip over myself running outside to get a current reading its amps one point six the fridges are fine everythings back to normal what the hell happened to the five amps i was getting before try as i might i could not get the fault to reappear devastated i tell the client that there was a fault somewhere but it disappeared when i reset the breakers he thanked me and said some words of encouragement that i cant remember as i was too busy wallowing in pool of shame and utter defeat i didnt even charge him for my time i left his house and went back to work but secretly hoped that the issue would return and that hed call me a month passes and i get a phone call from the client i had the biggest shiteating grin on my face man i knew what the call was going to be about and i started making my way over to his house as soon as i saw his name popup on my phone i didnt even answer yet his energy bill was still high but it dropped from to i immediately broke out my clamp meter and got to work lo and behold the current consumption was almost the same as last time amps well call it a amp measurement inaccuracy i really didnt want to reset the breakers this time as id risk the problem disappearing again i also couldnt fit my clampmeter around the wires of the auxillary breakers to test them one at a time this left me only one choice i had to remove and test every actively used power point in the house hoping that the problem isnt inside the roof cavity or floorspace i started with all the major appliances first i unscrewed the appliances powerpoint from the wall then i placed the clampmeter around the hot line and recorded the current measurement i did this for the tv fridges microwave pc aircon mobile phone charger inductive oven even the new bloody printer i added all the current measurements and so far the consumption is normal theres still three amps being drawn by something somewhere i take a break and have a coffee with the client who asks me how things are going i explained that the fault still exists somewhere and that theres an electrical leak that im trying to find but its likely in the roof or floorspace for some reason the topic then turned to his new inkjet printer on how he didnt expect the replacement ink cartridges to be so expensive i explained that laser printers are generally cheaper in the longrun and that the upfront cost of the toner just seems more expensive he told me that he actually has a networked laser printer for everyone in the house to use samsung mono mfc but it was more convenient for him to use his locally attached inkjet printer in fact he hasnt touched the laser printer a couple of months and that sometimes he gets a popup complaining that its out of paper when he accidentally prints to it so this printer is it plugged in now sure is can i see it sure can there is no way i missed this printer even if i did its a freakin printer i mean how the surely its not the problem surely its kept inside a stationary cupboard near the living room with its own powerpoint behind the cupboard first thing i notice is a funny smell reminiscent of hot plastic the top of the printer is hot to the touch and its lcd screen is asking someone to load some paper into it i undo the power point attach my clamp meter and sure enough i measure over amps while the printer is doing nothing but waiting i am in utter disbelief i figure the fuser unit is stuck on so its keeping itself warmed up to accelerate printing when the page is finally loaded i load a few pages into the printer and it runs through its list of queued jobs when its finally completed the fuser turns off and the power consumption drops to nearly zero i check the switchboard outside again and lo and behold were back down to sane readings i thought back to when i last visited and realised that i must have cleared the printer queue when i cycled all the power off and on again which is why the current consumption became normal later on in the month the client mustve tried to print to the printer again causing it to turn on its fuser and wait for paper to be loaded im still in disbelief of course this is dangerous behaviour for a printer so ive reached out to samsung for comment i guess ill wait to see if i receive a call next month tldr clients energy bill triples only new addition to the house is a cheap inkjet printer suspected many different major appliances all check out fine turns out clients old laser printer has been out of paper for two months and its heater fuser was stuck on while waiting for replacement paper drawing kwh per month on its own

few years back my team was migrating about users to a new build in preparation wed asked each users to label all their computer equipement so the movers would know which offices to move stuff to the night before the move i did a walkthrought and found this note attached to one of the screens gtit please dont forget to setup google at the new office i cant do my job without it i added a small message in reply gti will personally see to it that google is there afterward i got a email from the user thanking me for looking out 
i work at a nuclear generation station ill keep it generic with a staff of roughly people a ticket came in stating that the wifi was not working in one of the shops so it heads down to the shop to find that the wifi is indeed not active down there upon inspecting the wireless gateway we find that it has been unplugged the gateway is mounted to the ceiling someone had to climb up into the ceiling tiles and unplug it which is exactly what happened the same guy that put in the ticket about the wifi not working climbed up there and unplugged it because he didnt want that thing giving me cancer he was under the impression that because it was mounted right above his desk that it shot a focused wireless beam right down on to him and was going to give him cancer after explaining that it doesnt shoot beams at people we asked him if he uses a cell phone which you hold right up to your head and he relied in the affirmative we also pointed out that he works at a nuclear facility and is worried about getting cancer from a wireless gateway
today while at work my fellow tech support agent threatened me with a remote wipe on my computer so i shouted chatted do it and forgot about it five minutes later our dba comes into my office and starts wiping down my monitor and desktop with a tissue he looks at me and says remote wipe complete and walks away edit oh wow thanks for the gold
as some of you have noticed im female i dont usually catch flak for it despite having a very mechanical job and when i do its usually from other women which just irritates me to no end i think sewing is such quintessential woman thing to do despite the fact that probably of my customers are men that a woman working on sewing machines just doesnt raise eyebrows but every once in awhile theres that guy this time it was mr brown mrs brown called her machine was having some electrical problems she thought running up and down her husband had been unable to fix it could i take a look at it an appointment was made for her to bring it in whenever i hear those magic words i cringe just like with the plumber etc if the husband couldnt fix it that generally means i have to undo whatever he did figure out the real problem and then fix it when those words get used i charge by the hour not the job the next day mrs brown a whitehaired old lady with a cane turned up at the door mr brown was right behind her carrying the machine mrs browns machine had a knee controller the difference between a knee controller and a foot controller is strictly down to user preference you like what you like and dont usually like the other one but theres no difference functionally mrs brown had had polio as a child and had braces on both feetlegs and didnt have the physical ability to use a foot controller but did just fine with the knee controller then she told me not to plug it in until after id looked the controller ok why not apparently mr browns fix had created enough of an electrical arc that shed been knocked out of her chair when shed tried to use it and it had tripped the breaker and smoked the outlet so i opened the knee controller and there were solder burns everywhere i dont know what mr brown had done beside the obvious crossing of something he shouldnt have but he had gone back and unsoldered everything apparently without mrs browns knowledge i plugged it andnothing mr brown had killed it in the meantime in the background mr brown is making nearly continuous comments about my gender and likely ability to fix anything let alone anything as complicated as electricity and what i should instead be doingbasically anything at home having to do with dishes laundry and kids mrs brown is shooting him increasingly lethal glares and finally after a comment about how is she supposed to fix it when i couldnt she cant know what shes doing mrs brown turned around whacked himnot gentlyin the shin with her cane and told him it was his fault they were there at all and that he should go wait in the carhed been quite enough help already thank you the expression on his face was comical but he left i had a spare knee controller and offered to sell it to her she agreed and i checked her machine in for whatever its original issue had been when i called her three days later to tell her it was done she told me shed come get it in a week hes going to hear about this for awhile silly man always thinks he knows better than anyone else and this time could have been bad i still have bruises from falling out of the chairim not young you knowand the electrician is coming tomorrow to check the wiring and replace the outlet in my sewing room you just hang on to it for a bit dear and when his ears are good and burnt off well come get it a week later they came back mrs brown insisted i go into great detail about what was wrong with it brushes worn into nothingness carbon dust everywhere and how id fixed it new brushes thorough cleaning mostly i think to demonstrate to mr brown that i did know what i was doing mr brown said nothing just waited by the door i dont care if youre friendly or notbusinesslike is fine but if you cant be that at least be civil or quieteither works for me 
good cooks believe in the concept of mise en place having every ingredient and tool out and ready before you start cooking that way you wont be caught burning your food while scrambling to find something that was missed that concept also applies to other areas of expertise such as todays story recently i had to take over support of an application due to the regular support guy going on vacation no big deal i get a request from the applications development team asking me to provision database role x for them which they need for testing no problem i gladly write up the request and send it on its merry way it takes a day to process and provision but throughout the day the dev team is hounding me asking for the status once i submit the thing its out of my hands so i dont have much to tell them the next day i get invited to a meeting including the project manager who goes into a big wasteful lecture on how they are now a day behind and why is this late and what can we do to prevent further delays securing this database role is something the project manager could have had taken care of weeks ago but due to lack of foresight is suddenly needed immediately the old saying about lack of planning and emergencies pops into my head as i helpfully suggest that they get me a list of everything that they need set up so i can send all the requests in one batch the pm then says i dont have the details ask the dev team the dev team says database role x was all they needed meeting adjourns i go about my day so now the dev team has their shiny new database role x and are testing out their code but theres a problem their stuff is failing after they spend some time figuring out why the dev team comes back to me and says they also need me to request database roles y and z as soon as possible and whats the status of the request now how about now are we there yet yo project manager i found your problem you and your dev team aint got your mise en place tldr my souffl is burning quick knit me some pot holders

i work as senior tech support at a telco not long ago i got a call from a manager at a department i rarely work with recoveries the people who handle unpaid bills gt bytewave senior line bytewave you may send me your ticket gt recoveries no can do im recoveries i mean from recoveries manager for the red team thats how they call the team that handles desperate recoveries cases where theres no chance were going to be getting a penny anymore from customers with a huge unpaid bill typically most of their work is escalating files to credit rating agencies to ensure theres some consequence for bad faith nonpayment gt bytewave how may i help bring the full wrath of telco on our nonpaying customers today gt recoveries i have a dossier on a customer that has consistently avoided payment or contact with us she has been disconnected a couple weeks ago sending you the account number via internal chat soon after our staff got info from the datamonitoring tool that her modem was still heavily using the network internal security even sent them notices for possible piracy so i figured there had to be something wrong with our disconnect command and sent it up to networks they said the disconnect was successful on her mac and that they disabled the tap on the pmd just to be sure pasted the ticket but the heavy data usage was still ongoing so we sent a road tech to physically disconnect the drop from the pmd they did but she found a way and is still abusing our service without paying ive been asked to doublecheck with tech support first but if you cant shut this modem down now were going to call the cops have them get a warrant and physically remove the modem from the premises i let all that sink in with a deep breath theres no way to somehow keep a modem online once its mac has been blacklisted via our software and the notion that work orders had been issued to physically disconnect the drop regardless was hilarious but that even after the drop was cut they were thinking about calling law enforcement because they were still seeing data usage i had few words it took a few seconds to regain composure gt recoveries hello can you help any way to really kill this modem or do we need cops gt bytewave i can help according to our tools there are four drops going out of this pmd with only tap servicing the potential youre looking at according to our files there is only one device in there a modem macaddress but gt recoveries yes like i said one device that somehow cant be disabled remotely or physically gt bytewave if youd let me finish tap was disabled via software days ago and the drop on tap was physically removed days ago but the modem youre looking at stayed online and has recorded heavy network usage especially upstream ever since obviously thats impossible given the line was disconnected at both software and hardware levels the live tools confirm that theres nothing physically connected to tap right now gt recoveries okay so how did she juryrig it past our systems oh ffs gt bytewave theres nothing physically connected to our network on that tap and if there was it would be offline because networks shut it down remotely the obvious conclusion is that youre looking at readings and history logs from the wrong modem long silence gt recoveries but its in the file the billing system would have never allowed this gt bytewave unless the mac youre looking at is legitimately provisioned elsewhere in the node which it is all we needed to do is to run a simple search the mac youre looking at is physically as far removed as possible while being in the same node and the actual modem of the nonpaying customer is definitely offline has been disconnected for some time before it even got to the red team the billing system is full of holes you guys know that right why is this the first time anyone at tech support heard about this theres no prior tickets the guys at networks will blacklist any mac theyre told to and have no time to investigate were the ones who should be called first per the procedure to look into this kind of issue before we involve them gt recoveries how is this possible its in another file and it still works gt bytewave yes and if you look at that file which i just imd you youll see the paying customer who actually has this modem has been complaining about nonservice for a couple weeks well need to issue a full credit there and if you look at the file history you can figure out in eight seconds they used to live together we sent a road tech out to replace his modem because nobody could figure out that theres a recoveries block there because we were never contacted despite procedure this is both a perfect example of why our outdated billing and provisioning systems need to be updated and why interdepartment policies should gt recoveries but what about the lady not paying can we cut her service or not i gave up obviously her service had been cut since they asked networks to shut down the pmds tap when we sent a guy to disconnect the drop physically we were obviously wasting our time it had been out for three days how is that even something i still need to explain gt bytewave tsss hereby confirms on record that there is no possible way that service currently functions at the address of this nonpaying customer the tap has been shut down by networks and the physical cable is disconnected i have double confirmation logs and tickets no contact with law enforcement needed your job is done close the file gt recoveries oh well then okay gonna close it this would be simpler if the system was a bit more intuitive yes it would this would also have been simpler given a touch of common sense all of bytewaves tales on 
so im not the best storyteller but this happened last week i support all our organizations human resources and payroll applications and for some reason the cafeteria credit card machines fall under payroll so naturally i have to troubleshoot four touch screen network machines that ring up tunasalad sandwiches from time to time last week we get a call from the supervisor of employee food services and she is frantic she tell us that the entire system is down and no one can use the checkout machines we ask her to reboot the machines and she told us that she already tried that and everyone he is trying to eat and if you dont hurry everyone is going to starve okay so we call the network guys and they assure is that the application is live on the network and is responding we go down to check the hardware and everything works except right when you press the checkout button we try using a mouse we try different ethernet cables we check the permissions for the machines nothing atampt services our network so we ask them to come down and take a look they are outside the building on the roof under the building making sure that everything is wired correctly we cant figure it out we have multiple meetings with different it managers trying to troubleshoot this system one meeting in particular is pushing three hours to come up with a solution for the rest of week card readers and pen and paper when the phone rings its the supervisor from the cafeteria hey sorry for the trouble we figured it out long silence we forgot to pay the application license bill this month
this phone call actually took minutes to determine what she was trying to do and what she was looking at this is the abbreviated version one magical day i was the lucky recipient to answer this helpdesk call while working on this particular campus i set my beloved coffee down to answer the phone gt client hello i need some help the email server is down gt me one second let me check on that monitoring never said anything about it being down clickyclicky gt me well it looks okay from here and i just ran some tests against it what exactly seems to be the problem gt client well i cant open my email program outlook i think its called gt me oh okay do you get an error message when you click on it gt client well its not even there the icon is gone gt me alright no problem lets get it back on your desktop from your start menu gt client is that the button in the corner it looks like that is gone too cover me im going in gt me okay let me try to remote in whats your asset tag number gt client xxxxx gt me i cant get in can you make sure your network is connected there should be an icon that shows the x in the tray by the clock gt client my screen is black i cant see it her screen isnt on wait is the computer on gt me can i have you check to see if your tower is turned on do you see a green light gt client no its not how it normally looks i think its supposed to be green or blue the round turn on button isnt working gt me i know you guys have tight desks over there can you make sure its plugged in to the wall gt client hold on a second let me get a flashlight its really dark under my desk muffled noises gt client ugh its so dark in here when the power is out
my brain is still recovering from this call i got about minutes ago i do contract it a customer called to have a new user set up for email on their phone i configure the account and email the credentials to their boss with some brief setup instructions about minutes later i get a call from the customer explaining that the new employee is attempting to get email working theyve already looked at whats on the screen and everything appears correct to them theyre using the correct email protocol so now we move on to the password and the customer passes the phone to the new employee oh hi yeah ive tried to do this damn thing about times and it just wont work is there any way we can change my password to something shorter when he showed it to me i was like wow thats a long password i usually set a character random alphanumeric mixed case password so im used to getting complaints but its just temporary they can pick what they want after initial setup and i never have to know how terrible of a password they chose so after having them retype the password very slowly times and verifying it works from webmail i start reading off letterforletter what the password should be making sure letters are capitalized where necessary we get to the end thats it what about the rest thats the whole password what do you mean well ive got more here theres a space then a bracket thing and then a lowercase c a s at this point i realize whats happening after the password i wrote case sensitive so theyd know that it matters for some bizarre reason this guy has no idea what this means and has been typing case sensitive at the end of his password the whole time after correcting that minor error im happy to say his email is now working on his phone

the phrase digging themselves a deeper hole comes to mind with this story there was no subtly here no underhanded tricks justpure stupidity stubbornness and nonsense from a client the story prominently features mma previously featured a badass girl in her mid s who is an exmma fighter she now works the front desk here at deepsouthit ampnbsp at deepsouthit we have three divisions voip isp and it services i work for it services and mma handles all of it services incoming calls and scheduling she also unofficially acts as our t support by virtue of her listening carefully when we explain a problem and while she has no desire to continue into the it field has taken the time to let us teach her a lot of stuff we have to deal with so that she can save us time rather than just pushing a call back to our department i say this purely to show that i have confidence in mmas diagnostic capabilities if she cant fix it over the phone its not a basic problem ampnbsp one issue we run into a lot is that our isp side and it services side gets mixed up a lotwe have it spelled out on our website exactly what each department does isp has free support for internet related things and generally you only pay for the service and any local networking equipment such as your router though we are willing to provide one manage it and support it for an additional small fee it by comparison is a contracted or hourly service if you dont have a monthly contract with us its flatfee per hour of service and it is quite a bit of money people confuse this and get offended that we want to charge them for what they think is an internet issue but is actually an it issue ampnbsp in this particular case we had medicalsupplybusiness call in they are a fairly well known client of ours we provide internet to their building as well as their it services since they do not call us very often they opted to just do our hourly rates whenever we were needed as opposed to a maintenance contract normally we deal with nicedirector a middle aged lady whom is at a level with technology that she is our designated power user on site this week nicedirector was out on vacation taking advantage of the holiday instead we had harpy call in harpy actively tried to avoid us being one of the ones to insist that whatever systems they had before we arrived pen and paper were just fine for their needs as an aside nicedirector and harpy are both equal rank in the company and are both directly under the owner in terms of what power they wield ampnbsp harpy called in towards the th hour of the day mma had just prepared her tea and was at that point where her normally happygolucky attitude was fully cranked up and ready to roll harpy threw a stick in that engine real quicki didnt get the first part of the conversation but overhearing mma from down the hall it sounded like there were a lot of accusations being thrown she later told me that she had been questioning the quality of service they were receiving for situations like this in which one of our front desk workers may need help but not necessarily taking over the call we have an im client that is all linked together i ping her on it and let her know im about to conference into the call with my phone muted to listen in in case she needed help she thanked me and the conversation went more or less as follows ampnbsp from this point forward anything in bold is between myself and mma on our im client normal text is over the phone gtharpy i just dont understand why you people cant keep our connection stable every computer in this office has been disconnecting randomly all morning me ask her if this has been interrupting their connection to their medical program gtmma maam have you been losing connection to your medical program as well as the internet i have a note here saying that you have a medical database program hosted on one of your local servers gtharpy yeah whenever we get into the program it kicks us out after a few minutes saying there is an address problem and that the server doesnt exist that means we cant get out to it gtmma no maam that server with the program and database are in your building we installed it if it was a problem with the internet you would still be able to access the program mma just imd isptech and he says the link to their building couldnt be any better something else is up gtmma maam have yall done anything today to your network such as add a new device or gtharpy of course not all we did was add a couple of wireless routers to help put wifi to the rest of the building mma sends me an emoji with an eye twitch going on gtmma maam you said a couple of wireless routers gtharpy five gtmma ok so you put five wireless routers throughout the buildingthat is more than likely what the problem is gtharpy explain my brother works in it and has a setup like this at his workplace so it should just work me we quoted them for a set of unifi dishes to give them wifi throughout the entire building and she declined it mma fing figures gtmma well maam your brother more than likely configured them to work together like they are they can do that but out of the box they have settings enabled that fight one another gtharpy well thats stupid what setting is this why havent i heard of it before on my home router or something gtmma its something called dhcp it hands out ip addresses over the network to various devices so that gtharpy put it in a way ill understand it i dont speak tech me hurr durr gtmma ok think of it this wayyour network is a street in the big city of internet your street name is the same as your buildings ip address on that street there are buildings with numbers dhcp decides which number house that is data is like the mailman bringing you your letters when you have more than one router on the network doing dhcp it is like a group of people going around the street and changing the building numbers over and over againthe mailman doesnt know where to go me good analogy gtharpy well the mailman is fing stupid gtmma im sorry gtharpy if the mailman doesnt know what god damned building hes going to then hes a pretty piss poor mailman and id have fired him gtmma thatsnotwhat i meantlook bottom line is either those routers get unplugged or you pay for a tech to come out there and and configure the routers to not fight each other mma omfg gtharpy let me speak to your manager or someone who knows what the hell theyre doing were not paying a thing when its your internet thats messed up gtmma whatever you say maam mma you want this or should i pass this onto boss me go ahead and pass her to me if need be ill elevate it to boss gtme after seeing mma mute herself i unmute myself and take over this is cyrillus how can i help you gtharpy she proceeds to explain that mma was no help at all and that she needed this problem resolved i take a moment to finish a trouble ticket i had been closing out instead gtme alright maam i have her notes here it says you added five wireless routers unconfigured to your network gtharpy well i mean theyre configured we can get on the wirelessit just doesnt work gtme she also notes that she explained that dhcp should only be handled by one device on the network that device being your dhcp server in your network room gtharpy oh not this bullshit again look are you a tech gtme i am part of the it team yes gtharpy ohwellis there anyone above you i can speak with gtme i can pass you on to boss but hell tell you the exact same thing your routers are fighting one another and they need to either have dhcp disabled or disconnected from the network gtharpy that isnt what i want to hear put me through to boss i transfer her and go about my day ampnbsp two hours later boss sent me a forwarded email along with mma on the email it explained spoke with her for an hour she got abusive and i disconnected their internet service owner called in i showed him the call recordings then got this a few minutes later it was an email from owner requesting harpys ad account to be disabled and for a manager who was previously under her to be given the elevated privileges on the network that were normally reserved for harpy owner and nicedirector an hour later there was another email forwarded to me harpys replacement and owner had approved of our unifi quote and i am now in the process of organizing getting it set up ampnbsp i love happy endings
just a bit of fluff for a chuckle i get in the earliest i get an hour or so before most staff are in even the helpdesk so the occasional call filters through so i get one this morning before i even normally get in and its from a remote depot user depot user oh houston the whole erp system is down how long do you think before its back up me i dont think its down ive receive no alerts how many people are reporting that there is a drama depot user everyone is down no one can log in me shit right how many users are there at the moment depot user well its just me at the moment sigh technically all users are down of is still ha ha turned out to be a password change she had ignored all week
so i posted a while back that manglement has had a way of listening to the wrong people until things go horribly wrong then they have a information gathering meeting ltrenamed to hide facts so i have been begging for cooling in a server closet for years i keep getting everything but what i asked for each time we pay someone to come and do something or make some workaround but in the end when the door is shut or uhm summer comes the proverbial shit hits the fan this year finished it the servers all died came in and equipment had fried i had people crawling and running around asking what could be done could we replace them what how who why i went out and surveyed the damage systems fried and we would be repairing from stored parts good times and completely preventable i remind manglement that we need cooling i point out the amount of money lost and projects now delayed because of this no one actually paid attention they just wandered around asking what else could be done someone not in it suggested moving the equipment from that hot closet to a storage room ding ding ding we have a winnah so instead of simply putting cooling in the server closet we will rewire the building as we need outlets for power repatch the network panels needed for the room move the equipment alarm the storage room along with adding door locks and hey are those winders to the outside right there yeah so instead of simply putting in cooling we went with the uninformed manglement option im still wondering what the hell just happened
when i got promoted to tech supports senior staff many years ago i was given a on class for the new job i was a little surprised because i had been told there were no classes those who pass the tough exams are deemed already qualified as far as the telco is concerned the class was scheduled as special training senior staff stephan one of the old timers sometimes featured in my tales was the teacher gt stephan okay no boring powerpoints for this one this class is basically where we tell new tsss hires about the things weve been lying to you about since you started working here he paused a few seconds for dramatic effect but i knew some things are withheld on purpose so i wasnt too surprised after explaining the confidentiality rules he started with rather benign material like secret phone numbers or undisclosed locations where we operate once we got to the tech parts it got more interesting learned the true reasons behind the worse flaws in our tools and how to work around them learned about security flaws left live on purpose on the internal network because too many people needed them to work around bugs that there was no budget to fix properly about thumbdrives with autorun scripts that they used to get admin on their workstations whenever required minor stuff like that p but he really kept the best for the end the last portion were things that actually could impact customers about which we were expected to lie not only to them but to most internal employees too its one thing to have secrets about our own systems but maybe another to systematically hand down bs answers as directed by management to a customers queries about our service this was the worst one gt stephan okay now the password system for email and customers accounts on the website ever gotten calls when working frontline from customers complaining being able to access either despite being sure they typed in the wrong password gt bytewave nope guy next to me got one a few months ago i believe but it couldnt be replicated easily he wasnt sure exactly why tsss said the password was fine and there was no anomaly gt stephan thats the typical confusion that lets us get away with the worst password system in the multiverse the entire system is slated for replacement in fiscal quarters so with a little luck maybe itll actually happen sometime in the next years gt bytewave okay we advertise that its not casesensitive thats not perfect but thats still not an explanation for why customers would think they can log in if they noticed they made typos obviously whats the secret flaw gt stephan flaws every character after the th is discarded and the system does not actually support special characters its actually purely alphanumeric gt bytewave but i have special characters in my own password he gave me a few seconds to think it over which i used to mull every call i overheard about this every bit of relevant hallway gossip too many frontline techs getting too many weird calls about passwords not working like they should at that moment i was torn between oh so it all makes sense and please tell me someone got fired for this gt bytewave is the password system greenlighting alternate keys for characters the system doesnt actually support just to avoid admitting that our passwords are all weak gt stephan first try congrats it started many years ago when the internet product director decided announcing publicly that our passwords can only be alphanumeric non casesensitive and characters long could be damaging to our brand previously featured in many of my tales the ipd is the closest thing i have to a personal nemesis cloaked in plot armor despite his countless stupid decisions he remains not only employed but paid like a vicepresident despite utterly screwing up one time out of three previously featured in tales like this or this or this gt stephan everyone is aware were not casesensitive but what they dont know is that every character past the th is ignored and most importantly that any special character defaults to a which is unfortunately used as the wildcard thats when the extent of it hit me like a truck if your password was qwraaa and youd type in qw youd get in just the same as if you typed in qw in fact if your password was amp youd get in typing casesensitiveness or a chars limit was one thing having all special characters default to an alphanumeric wildcard on both ends was absolutely insane given our plaintext password offender is well established stephan was able to use the moment during which i was mesmerized to change a test accounts pw to special characters and demonstrate the flaw by showing our internal system saw it as a string of zeros only the system could never know whether a customer legitimately put a in their password or if it was in fact a special character that had defaulted to for someone trying to log in of course special characters were also interpreted as zeros gt stephan this is also part of why you can never ever tell a frontline tech any customers password the whole thing would be exposed if they spelled it out to the customer for any reason even though they shouldnt ever obviously customers shouldnt know we do plaintext either gt bytewave this is crazy were all playing along with this any customer who puts in a complex password is to be unaware what they believe makes their password secure actually weakens it because the ipd decided it could damage the brand and somewhere a customer is putting in a chars password unaware that only the first digits count gt stephan basically it was signed off on as a temporary solution by systems and networks good while ago timetables got busted happens a lot around here but itll change in the meantime if this gets out bunch of people will get their email bruteforced as we still dont have a decent lockout solution were playing along for now you can complain about it in teamonly meetings or on nonrecorded lines with sysadmins but not to lower management in general they were not deemed needtoknow moving right along this entire time stephan looked like he was just letting me on a little quirky funfact and thats probably how id tell it today too experience in this job gets you jaded real quick as for the odd customer who occasionally called us about a typo apparently not preventing them from logging in they were often people with or chars long passwords who noticed they mistyped the last letter or that kind of thing and still got in while a handful of people might have guessed this much the crazy notion of special characters all defaulting to somehow never got out of house though it took about years this horrible system did get replaced entirely otherwise i wouldnt be posting this tale though were still plaintext password offenders all of bytewaves tales on 
part part i am testing my workflows still not exactly sure why it works on the test site but not on the live site and the phone ringsi really hate the phone ringing gt me hello the is it what can i help you with today gt hr hey its hr can you come up to my office for a few minutes now gt me need me to bring supervisor with me gt hr no just yourself were ready and waiting click were waiting who is the other person that makes up the we i head up the hallway towards hrs office hoping this isnt going to be something that gets out of control my control mostly i knock on his door and i see him sitting behind his desk with buck sitting across from him my phone vibrates a quick macarena gt me hey man i thought you were heading out of town for a wedding gt buck oh i am later today i had something else to do this morning gt me oh ok whats this meeting about gt hr an exit interview you need to do the equipment check in for him to sign a millions thoughts were rushing through my mind and i didnt know what i could say in front of him my phone vibrates again gt me um ok is the equipment here gt buck its all in my office do we need to go over and do that now gt me we can i need to print off a checklist and ill come back by shortly then we can go do the check in for the equipment gt buck great ill be here i have some other stuff to sign and go over i think gt hr yep quite a few things to go over and sign ill give you a ring when he is free of the form storm im going to hit him with now i laugh at the form storm comment wave goodbye then head back to my desk i have to stop at supervisors door on my way my phone vibrates yet again gt me bucks doing the exit interview gt supervisor really did you find something and i missed it gt me no i think he got another job and just decided to cut the strings suddenly gt supervisor guess devman got his way after all heard anything from him gt me not directly you getting an alert message from the firewall phone goes bzzz bzzz bzzz he looks over at his email and drills down to a folder and frowns gt supervisor yes content hits on a laptop its gt me developerpci right gt supervisor yeah you got the messages too gt me no but thats the pc that i let developer manager take is it content hits gt supervisor yes its only been four hits bzzz bzzz five hits so far mostly dating sites and gun sites nothing adult fingerquotes related gt me kind of sucks that developer manager is going to try to drag this guy through the dirt i wonder why he is doing this gt supervisor i wonder if he was looking for something to screw the guys new job up at this point odd for buck to suddenly be out of here think devman knew he was looking already and was trying to figure a way to screw his options that hadnt occurred to me and it made as much sense as anything else gt me that is a good evil plan itd never work but ill be damned if the common passerby would guess thats whats happening i hear my desk phone ringing i wave a quick adios to supervisor and rush over to my desk to grab the phone gt me it guy here what do you need help with today gt hr do you have like a random teleprompter for these greetings i take a moment to disable the phone notification for emails digital sticky note on my desktop to turn it back on later gt me yep thats what that last server was for it thinks for me i just read the words the silence from the phone concerns me enough that i feel i must explain that its a joke gt me thats a joke i was asked to improve my greetings i accidentally answered the phone with a joke the other day and it upset someone gt hr snort what was the joke gt me um you wont think its funny but i answered the phone with have you tried turning it off and on again and then when he said excuse me i said reboot the computer and call back he hung up before i noticed it wasnt who i was expecting gt hr yeah thats not a good joke anyways buck is ready to do the equipment check out i tab over send his gear sheet to hrs printer gt me is your printer spitting out a piece of paper gt hr why yes it is do you want me to do the check out gt me no just figured it would save some time sending it to source on my way up now im in bucks office once more and hes initially the lines as i verify the equipment he is returning gt me so was this a sudden thing or you been heading out for a while gt buck well it was sort of sudden but not as well i was looking for work closer to pure development instead of database performance and documentation and just between us a change of management gt me change is goodyou have trouble with your management mine seems ok for the most part gt buck laugh you are a special case you walk around and management tries to agree with you im not sure what to say to that so i got back to checking everything off the list he seems to agree that things are awkward and waits for me to point at a spot to initial gt buck i didnt mean to insult you if you took that as an insult but you dont seem to be an employee most of the time its like you are here and everyone else works around you gt buck dont take me wrong something needs done you do it ive not seen anything except outstanding support from your department but like yesterday you told a manager to be quiet and listen and he didid never do that even if i was planning on quitting gt me ok last linethen sign here as we were checking things off i had been loading most of it on a trolley cart i stand up and offer him a hand to shake he grabs it and shakes it firmly gt me sorry im not sure how to respond to what you said i guess i do tend to just roll over people on some things dont take my silence as being upset or offended by anything you said good luck with the travel wedding and new job gt buck um do i leave now gt me no you need to go back over to hrs office i imagine you have to have a meeting with developer manager before actually leaving gt buck no no i requested he not be involved gt me ok well head back over there hr can get you signed out for the last time cut you a check for pay period and your remaining leave he nodded and headed off down the hallway i push the cart back to the cold room and head to my desk i have content alert emails and an email from developer manager about stopping by to look at something i forward it to supervisor and then send him another message that bucks equipment is in the cold room then i head back to developer land devmans door is closed when i get there so i knock i hear someone moving around inside and the door suddenly opens developer manager looks both ways then waves me into his office he has a desk lamp on and the over heard light is off gt me can i turn the overhead light on this is a very uncomfortable situation for me gt devman sure sure you know you didnt do a very good job with this internet history stuff gt me what do you mean gt devman well i found all this dating website stuff and there is a bunch of gun enthusiast stuff hes also been looking at personal ads and not for lawn ornaments gt me really show me i cant believe i missed something yesterday when i did the snoop gt devman snoop gt me sorry we call it a pc snoop inside our circle gt devman oh ok look see last week he was on these sites and then he went here this week gt me man i swear that wasnt there yesterday i wonder how i missed it gt devman its ok man were only human well one of us is gt me yeah i guess i need to redo this but it will have to be on a new pc investigation form the other one was closed out already he looks at me glares really i can tell hes trying to give me cancer with his mind then he sighs gt devman ok ill submit another form can you do the investigation today gt me sure as soon as i get the form can you get it submitted before i get back to my desk gt devman sure ill do it now he almost pushes the laptop into the floor getting to his keyboard i watch him typing fiercely at his keyboard and then he looks up with a grin gt devman there its submitted how long will it take gt me a few hours schedule a meeting for again he nods and starts whistling i turn towards the door gt devman wait dont you need this gt me nope we have a copy of it back in our area setup already gt devman oh right ok see you at three i leave and i think he surely will demand i do the snoop on the laptop hes been messing with this morning i get around the first corner and quicken my pace a little just knowing he is going to call out my name as he rushes down the hall with the laptop thrust out at me i get around the second corner and i think i might be in the clear and hr grabs my arm suddenly from his doorway gt hr hey why is there a new pc investigation form for a guy that doesnt work here anymore gt me developer manager request i take another look in light of what he found this morning gt hr what did he find gt me some questionable activity was found on the cloned laptop im going to take at it again to be helpful i grin and head down the hallway as i turn the corner i see hr shacking a head hung very low i zoom past supervisors office and he hollers out my name gt supervisor hey troublemaker come back in here a minute gt me whats up im mid mischief at the moment gt supervisor he submitted a request that we take a second look at that machine what is that about gt me hey did you run a report on the content filter gt supervisor yes nowwhatareyouupto gt me just doing my job thats what you pay me for right gt supervisor you are going to give me grey hair or make me go bald i grin and wave as i head to my office i detour to the cold room to grab bucks laptop then i get to my desk i plug in the forensic thumb drive and run all my reports he has removed his dropbox and i dont spend much time working on his file contents to be honest i used some of the reports from yesterdays report i think this one is primarily aimed at someone else and the three pages of content filter report will be the centerpiece of the meeting i accept the meeting request and head to lunch when i get back i send an email to developer manager i ask him if he found anything else and letting him know to bring the laptop to the meeting i know he found something else because the content filter report is now four pages right before the meeting i turn the notifications back on for emails on my phone gt hr hello guys man this is some serious deja vu or what i nod and offer up a weak grin supervisor looks at the floor an scratches his head developer manager is very lively and developer director appears to need a nap i could use a nap now that i think about it gt me yep seems pretty familiar here is a copy of the report of the pc investigation i hand out four printed summary reports from the form ive signed the bottom of each cover sheet swearing to its accuracy devman instantly goes thumbing through the pages looking for something gt hr well from the cover sheet summary you found nothing worthy of noting in the bad column so that sums this all up meeting concluded i grin at him hes trying to prevent my mischief he tries to smile back at me gt devman this isnt right none of the stuff i found is in this report where is the dating and gun stuff gt me i was unable to find anything related to dating or gun site traffic on bucks laptop developer director has nodded off at least he isnt snoring gt devman i showed it to you you saw it in my office gt me you did show me something on the laptop in your office but i was unable to find it on bucks laptop and the logs for his web activity to do show any non work related traffic gt devman you didnt take his laptop you left it in my office you said you had another copy in your area gt me yes we have the laptop that was assigned to buck he turned it in today gt devman wait let me show you this stuff i look at supervisor with a grin as devman opens the laptop and shows that it has indeed visited some dating sites in the past week hes animated enough about it that he wakes developer director up from his afternoon nap gt director what is this then he leans in to look at the laptop he goes a little pale and then turns red in the face he is a stickler for internet access abuse in the office he has a conniption when anyone mention msn messenger he looks across the table at me gt director i thought you said you didnt find anything on his laptop gt me i didnt find anything on bucks laptop gt director well this is a copy of his laptop right if its on this machine its on his machine right you just overlooked this on his computer gt me no sir none of this traffic exists on the equipment buck was assigned director looks around then focuses on hr gt director buck has been processed out correct gt hr yes hes up in the break room waiting for a meeting with one of the vice presidents before leaving gt devman wait processed out is buck no longer an employee why wasnt i told gt hr you were clocked out in a meeting your phone went to voice mail and buck requested you not be involved in the exit interview i notified developer director and he said to go ahead and process him out you should have an email about it from me i dont know if you read it ive not seen a read receipt yet gt devman i was busywith a meetingon the phone he looked cornered without anyone in the room moving at all he sounded unnerved but that made sense to me gt director so why did this traffic not show on his laptop on in the content filter gt me that traffic wasnt generate until this morning to afternoon on that laptop gt director how did buck get this laptop to visit those sites gt devman buck didnt have this laptop its been in my office all morning and now developer manager looks as if hes swallowed a green egg gt director wait you had this laptop all morning and this traffic magically appeared gt devman the dates say the traffic was last week i giggle from the stares i receive from the others in the room it sounded as odd to them as it did to me gt me well the dates on that laptop do say the traffic happened last week but the report from the content filter say the traffic happened this morning and early afternoon gt director how did buck do this gt hr buck didnt do this i think it guy is saying that the traffic was generated by the person with the laptop this morning gt devman then how does the stuff show up as being accessed last week gt me you changed the system date on the laptop i bet you didnt change it back i quickly spin it around and see that its days short of the proper date gt me yep today is not the th hr stands and ends the original meeting is concluded and thanks us for attending developer director is looking at his employee with less than a pleasing look supervisor is slowly shaking his head and gathering his papers a little after pm i am alerted that i have a new email instantly followed by a second the first email is letting the staff know that developer buck has chose to follow employment with another company the second email is a request to report on the activity concerning the cloned laptop with a note to be sure to include my meeting record i know you recorded it hr and the content filter report im also supposed to explain how the someone could create internet activity in the past the following monday there are two messages sent out one is a notice about developer director is looking to interview people for a management position and the second is to disable access for developer manager while i was logging saving the remnants of developer manager i happened to find a im conversation where someone informed devman that buck was interviewing for a management position in development i decide that devman decided that buck was after his job and wanted dirt to make him look less appealing i found out that devman ended up working under buck at the other company a month or two later i dont know if buck was ever informed of the day before his last day or not

so this is still a story of tech support changed many details to protect identities i was working for a small it firm years ago and we had a branch of estate agents that operated a couple of towns away they recently opened a new branch so im there running cable setting up pcs and servers the usual small it stuff im the first one there the boss opened up for me in order to get as much done before the staff arrived so bring on the staff begin entering this is a small branch office only desks the usual small estate agency thing in comes this young girl probably or i was a single year old at the time so of course i noticed her obviously estate agencies hire good looking girls yes its sexist but thats the way of the world any edge a company needs to survive so we introduce ourselves i smile and shake her hand she immediately blushes and gets very girly and giggly so i knew she was interested but i am a professional id never mess up a career for a lay after everything that was available was set up i went on my way when i got back to my office she emailed me it was the usual thing of small tech questions i would be polite and friendly in my responses but never flirty or inappropriate as we had a very good relationship with this agency we would do home visits to the staff members if they had small it issues foc it was just a small value add providing they didnt take the piss the boss knew not to take liberties with it the girl lived alone laptop printer etc so she gets permission from her boss to get someone round to look at her printer as it was printing lines or jamming paper or something she only lived around the corner from the new office so i twinned it with a normal checkup visit to the office i finish my visit to the office and ask her if shes ready to look at that printer so we leave the office and walk to her flat as soon as we left the office she asked me if i had a girlfriend i answered no asked her why and she just said ohno reason and we continued to her flat funnily enough there was a problem with her printer under the desk it was so i was down on my hands and knees sorting it out some rollers or feeding contraption was loose i shouted to her ok its done and i stood up and turned around and she was right there in my face with her shirt buttons seemingly loose and that kids is how i met your mother tldr point to the doll where she touched you i consider myself quite professional but this isnt the only story of similar bootycallness maybe im a whore 
spreadsheets are the worst id gotten a call for help late one evening the lady on the phone was not specific about which particular part of her computing experience was broken with a sigh i grabbed my bag and coat and headed up to her office hoping to leave quickly upon entering the department i noted there was only a single lady left she was busy clicking and typing at a speed id only seen in movies it was mesmerizing gtfastclick are you it gtme yep whats wrong fastclick went into a monologue that i could only vaguely fathom i finally realized what it people must sound like to people with no experience with computers it was terrifying fastclick was busy explaining where various pieces of data came from how they are interconnected with other pieces of data i felt my head nodding at things i had no idea about agreeing with things that sounded like i should be agreeing too gtfastclick so yeah basically i need a graph of that fastclick had paused her eyes looked up into mine expectantly i had nothing gtme er not really an it problem persay gtfastclick oh her face looked crushed it crumpled back to looking at the spreadsheet in vain her hands were slower now they seemed to tap the keys hopelessly compared to the ferocious typing id seen earlier my bag felt heavy in my hand i remembered it was time to leave i couldnt gtme wheres everyone else does anyone know gtfastclick unfortunately theyve all gone home i looked at the clock i couldnt blame them gtme maybe leave it till tomorrow aye gtfastclick huh oh its was actually due a few hours ago dont worry about it thanks for coming all the way up here she attempted a smile it had a defeated edge to it my mind was in shock i had gotten a thank you an actual thank you a nonforced full thank you just for trying i stood agape for a full minute in that time fastclick had tabbed out of her spreadsheets and vaguely searched around other documents hoping to find the solution my mind had been made up as i swung another chair around next to her desk sure i didnt know much about financial modeling but i knew how to search gtme okay what specifically is wrong gtfastclick oh no dont stay its so late i can figure this out myself i think gtme dont worry i got this gtfastclick how much do you know about financial modeling gtme almost nothing but the internetit knows everything that slight flicker of hope in her eyes had ignited i smiled that night i spent a few hours searching various terms learning which equations to use where it was the most amount of information id ever absorbed in the shortest amount of time eventually at a time when normally id be asleep it was done gtfastclick it works it actually works the next day in it was the largest plate of cupcakes i had ever seen a mountain of delights stood towering in the break room a single card was placed on the table in front of it pantsuit was nearest the tower and had picked up the card she decided to read it aloud with a devilish grin gtpantsuit to airz thank you so much for going beyond my expectations x i could feel the eyes of my coworkers turning to me in shocked astonishment gtme err a voice behind me broke in gtfastclick enjoy the cupcakes i turned to see the brightly smiling face of fastclick i wondered how she looked so fresh and also how she had time to bake so many cupcakes i didnt have time to ask however as fastclick was already leaving gtfastclick thanks for your help last night airz lets do it again sometime and with a slight blush fastclick left the department people were still standing around in astonishment gtmessy airz you and that pretty lady did you gtme back to work everyone i walked over to the mountain of cupcakes and selected one i tried to decided between the blue or green topping ones eventually i selected a greenyblue one ambiguity is fun
long time lurker yadda yadda yadda so i work for a fairly large company with offices and locations all over montana recently we made the decision to switch from barcode stickers on assets to a rfid built into a barcode stickers just in case well one of the offices that we support that also happens to be the farthest away from our location is constantly needing new equipmentand policy is to inventory the entire office since we may not be near there until the next major error well lo and behold when i get there and replace their main switch which had a coffee spilt on itin the locked closet i got to work on doing inventory the first computer had no rfid or barcode thinking this had been an accident of ours by not putting one on well each and every piece of equipment didnt have our tracking on it i then went to the manager at the office and he says that he told his employees to take them off because they werent needed so after a call to my office i go about reinventorying the office and getting the stickers installed after sternly talking to manager and telling him to leave them in in head back home about months later a coworker went up to upgrade the desktops guess what he found if you guessed that he found that each piece of equipment furniture and technology was bare he gave me a call to let me know i went to my boss and let him know his answer to was for my coworker to not do the upgrades and instead leave them as is not too bad of an ending however it got better about an hour later my boss asks me how i feel about overtime and i go for it the job was to take iphone phones to that office and switch out with what they have for the record each and every employee there had a iphone s issued by the company when i showed up and told them what was happening they were beyond pissed when the manager who was the last one to turn his in asked why they were downgrade i simply said if we cant track what you guys have on site the boss says you get equipment that doesnt cost so much when it goes missing

i worked tech support for a rated nationwide sunday morning tv talk show one morning i got called to the studio because none of the fluorescent lights in the set were working my meter confirmed that the ballasts had v i was assured that they had worked last week i scratched my head while the pressure mounted a dozen people were watching me then i decided to take one of the bulbs out the instant i touched it it started working i had to touch each lamp briefly and they all lit up they thought i had a magic touch in reality someone had disconnected the ground wire to the fixtures in order to troubleshoot a microphone buzz and never reconnected it some fluorescent lamps need a grounded reflector near them to start my body capacitance was enough to make it start just dont tell them that they think im brilliant 
happy friday everyone heres a shorter story this time for an incident that just occurred earlier today for those that dont know i provide tech support to a mediumsized hospital todays tale is courtesy of our hr department lunch time the thirty minutes of peace and tranquility that no man or machine can break the law protects you and watches you as you eat your cheap slop for an unpaid minute period unless youre it apparently so while my coworker and i are eating lunch the head hr unionized pencil pusher we will call her hr lady comes in with a personal camera and looks at my coworker we will call him d while he chews on his sandwich gthr lady hey i want to get some pictures off this hr lady waves her camera around d continues to stare back while chewing i intercept gtme were eating lunch right now gthr lady this will only take a minute sooo she begins looking at d again knowing my position he continues eating without doing much else to acknowledge her gthr lady come on guys gtme ill come help you as soon as im done eating just give me about minutes even then i would be cutting my break short sigh gthr lady that wont work gtme why not gthr lady i go to my lunch in minutes mental facepalm gtme well we can either go in a few minutes or wait till you get back from lunch gthr lady you cant interrupt my lunch break thats against the law my coworker and i just silently stare at her i think she finally got the message because she had the good graces to look ashamed before slowly walking out of the room ampnbsp tldr im union so my lunch break is more important blows raspberry
last xmas i received an email from my companys technical support team to let me know their closed days for xmas holidays as well as wishing me a merry xmas i thought that was nice so i replied to the email wishing them a merry xmas in return next thing i know i receive an email from them assigning me a job number xxxxx for wishing them a merry xmas and informed it would be given a medium priority funniest present ever as i was having a shit day until then i came back from xmas holidays to find a new email from tech support telling me that i would be contacted within days to resolve the issue days later they sent me an email saying the matter was closed 
this occurs back in summer full of massive rainfall and floods i arrive at the office at the usual check the answerphone and am ready for am when the phones go live no messages left overnight the first two hours of the day are taken with mundane password resets locked out of encryption cant find a file and so on after i come back from my break the head of it hit and the manager whos new agency staff tempman approach me and ask if i can spare them a moment i glance towards my boss who nods and off i go gthit it gives me no pleasure to inform you that as of now we are suspending you on full pay pending a formal investigation the bottom falls out of my world gthit do you understand gtme i want my union rep here please they seem unphased but hesitate to get up and fetch him from the other side of the it office five minutes later hes sat next to me and hit repeats what he said to me earlier gtrep as dpg is a union member and because hes been here for five years you have to allow him to defend himself here and now you then get to make the decision for suspension based on that gthit the charge is gross professional misconduct a sackable offense and one where the investigation is done quickly and quietly on the grounds of he brought tempman and the it department and the council as a whole into disrepute by his actions rep glances at me and i shrug my shoulders to my knowledge ive done nothing wrong ive not posted anything on social media blogs or the internet in general for ages and certainly not from work my only interaction with tempman was to say hi days ago when he started and to recommend a meeting room to him yesterday gtme ill need a little bit more to go on than that its extremely vague gthit you told tempman that he had to use the main library meeting room for his meeting last night part way through the meeting all it in the building was lost and he was made to look a fool we could have lost out on significant ppp deals because of that gtme the library meeting room was the only one that fitted his exacting criteria holding people projector screen and network point food services on site and in a building open at pm i neither caused the network outage or realised that it was going to occur gttempman it was planned maintenance apparently he looks smug gtrep no it wasnt theres no planned maintenance until next month im the one who schedules it in there was a deathly pause gtrep look this is starting to sound like a vendetta against dpg ill work with him and lets find out why the it failed in that building last night give us an hour then make your decision if you still want to go down the investigation route then if you can prove any wrongdoing well accept the suspension if not and you still suspend dpg is within his rights to go to acas for tribunal or to sue personally if he feels its a vendetta they nod grudgingly and we go to work logs on the switches show that at that evening the connection to the wan dropped it attempted every seconds for nearly an hour before finally reconnecting at we checked the other end of the connection and got the same message although the entire wan other than two buildings were connected gtme what have the library and the depot have in common network wise gtrep theyre both slow networks are trying to upgrade the link gtme why would they both drop within a minute of each other gtrep pass ill find out what link theyre using perhaps its a faulty circuit he calls networks and after a brief conversation hangs up and turns to me gtrep google last nights weather for the area print it out and follow me i do as he says and we go back into the meeting room hit and tempman are joined by hr director dir gtrep i want this matter dropped immediately otherwise well lodge a harassment charge gtdir thats not the way it works ive been briefed on the situation and i cant see how you can refute this gtrep so no dropping this gtdir no gtrep the library connects to the town hall next door to it by a shortrange lineofsight transmitter using lasers it was done that way because of the problem digging a conduit across the road last night at round about half past seven it became foggy the depot just around the corner also lost connection at a similar time it too uses a laser gttempman what idiot put that system in then gthit i did tempman looks rather shamefaced then he perks up gttempman why didnt you say that the library had this issue and why didnt you call me and let me know that it was getting foggy gtme firstly i only found this out ten minutes ago secondly its never proven an issue in the five years ive worked here and thirdly my work stops when i leave here in an afternoon as you dont pay callout or overtime i dont work for free i turn to the hr director how do i lodge a harassment complaint tldr temporary manager attempts to fire me because i cannot control the weather update it management asked me to drop harassment complaint in lieu of a slight promotion i declined i won the harassment complaint and tempmans month contract was not renewed during those months tempman did everything within his powers and within corporate policies and logical reasoning to deny me anything i asked for it turned out that he and hit were really close friends since university and that some of the better working practices i had suggested already in documented format he wanted to introduce and claim credit for i was treading on his toes they ended up paying me compensation in the form of double my annual salary and hit was replaced about a month later after he quit because he accidentally knocked an employee down a flight of stairs and broke her arm
 pm yesterday my phone rings i sigh for some reason the later in the day the phone rings the more annoying the call and answer with my best i only have three more days before a glorious twoweek christmas break cheer gtcan you help me with my computer or do i need to talk to a tech oh one of you almost and half my callers still default to believing that the female voice on the phone is a secretary i assure him i can help that i am a tech and quite literally the only person here gtwell im having a software problem how much will it cost oh one of you i attempt to get him to troubleshoot a little bit with me but the best i can get out of him is his pc is intermittently bluescreening and he cant tell me when it happens if theres a pattern to the bsods any numbers or error information on the bsods when it started happening or if it has been happening with more frequency lately and of course the more questions i ask the more annoyed he gets gtlook i just want to know what it will cost for you to fix it sigh gtwell sir i hate to give a solid quote before i see the system there can be a lot of different underlying causes to an error like this and without being able to run proper diagnostics it will be hard to give you a proper price i will say our minimum fee for most repairs is price and the standard fee for repairs with underlying hardware problems is price hardware costs however gtbut you just said you dont know whats wrong with it gtcant get fired before christmas cant get fired before christmas however we do offer free estimates if you want to stop by and have me take a look at it i can give you a much better quote and that part would be free gtfinally how late are you open tonight i glance back at the clock it is i inform him that i close in fifteen minutes gtgreat im only five minutes away ill stop by and you can tell me how much itll cost gtgroan i could check it in tonight sir but itll be tomorrow before i could take a look at it and ill warn you were going to be closed next week and the week after so i may not be able to repair it before the holidays i am still more than happy to look at it but those are our hours for the holidays he didnt bother responding and just hung up which sadly i am used to i shrugged and started closing he was back at this morning i know this because he informed me id kept him waiting for half an hour we open at he plops a gateway desktop pc on my counter without ceremony and stares at me soundless save for the complaining about time as i plug it in the poor machine whirrs to life sluggishly and eventually deposits me at a vista login screen i have him log in and start some basic troubleshooting every question i ask is met with an increasingly annoyed im not sure its my kids pc of course i can see shadows and hints of the errors in the event viewer and various logs but not the fault itself meaning that like i already knew its going to have to get the full diagnostic workup to figure out whats wrong with it even though i suspect that the final diagnosis is going to be its old i pull an intake form out from under the desk and pause before i hand it to him gtwell theres definitely something wrong with it besides being a gateway machine running vista but im going to need to check it in to find out what before i do that i want to remind you that we are going to be closed for the weeks of christmas and new years after friday we wont be open again until the th it may not be done by friday if you dont want to leave the computer here that long i recommend you take it elsewhere i can give you the names of several other places in the area gtso you cant fix it whyd you tell me to drive over here then gti can fix it it just may be january before its done i told you that on the phone last night gt gtwell how much will it cost gt gtlike i said i have to check it in and properly test it its not going to be something quick and easy also with a system this old and outdated its probably better to just replace it rather than dump a lot of money into fixing it you can get some nice systems around the holidays and almost anything is going to be an upgrade over this one gt gtwell then why did i bring this down here you told me you could fix it this morning what do you mean itll be january before its fixed im trying very hard to care enough to be nice to this jerk gtbecause something is very wrong with the computer and im not sure what it is yet because were closing for the holidays for two weeks and nobody will be here to work on it gt gtwell why dont you have a sign up or something reddit i tried i did i wanted to be good but i was standing right in front of the twofoothigh poster with our holiday closure warning on it theres one pasted in the front window too surrounded by blinking christmas lights and forty pounds of duct tape to hold them on since boss ran out of masking tape and improvised its on our yelp page its on our voicemail ive worked customer service in one form or another since i was i knew what would happen gti said sarcastically like this sign of course that sparked the explosion how dare i assume he was stupid hes just trying to do something nice for his kid for christmas by fixing his pc im the obstinate little redacted thats keeping his kid from playing that apocalypse game later determined to be fallout that he just dropped a ton of money on every statement is punctuated by him leaning across the counter and staring pointedly at me as if i will crumble before the onslaught of his customer fury eventually i cut through the tirade gtsir im sorry i dont think i can fix your pc please try a different shop thank you its my get out of my store mantra i merely repeat it until they leave combined with the fact that my please dont realize im shaking in terror face apparently looks like a im about to rip your heart out indiana jones style face it makes people go away it didnt work gti want you to fix it for me now what that always works i repeat myself several times he repeats himself several times we must have sounded like a weird broken recording or a futurama episode eventually he stopped leaned over the counter and in his best dramatic voice stagewhispered gtyou are ruining christmas gtcompetitor is open every day next week except for thursday geek squad is open every day next week afaik competitor is open until wednesday best buy and frys both have pcs on sale right now i was very proud of myself for neither a running away or b laughing at the image of his face all screwed up together as he bent over this poor pc to threaten me i hope he thought the shaky voice was my barely restrained fury instead of the repressed urge to piss myself eventually he did leave threatening to write bad reviews up as he was tearing the assorted cables and cords from the back of the computer he sat in his car in front of the store for several minutes presumably attempting to write said bad review before screeching out of the lot no sign of the bad review yet and the nice lady directly after him could troubleshoot to the point where she had cloned her own hard drive to eliminate the possibility of hardware errors and merely needed reassurance that reinstalling the os was a valid repair choice i almost offered her a job on the spot edit for the tale my my nice user go here 
the office i work in is a big hub and spoke configuration wan with remote locations across the country one day while eating my lunch the power goes out despite my constant protests and demands for multiple battery backups we only had one and the msp who had installed it apparently just bought one at our local computer store and plugged our big vmware cluster into it so i figured i had about minutes to shut down the whole system gracefully i sprint into the server room knocking a sales person out of the way and begin the process and just in the nick of time i shut down the last server and watch the lights die on the battery backup i catch my breath gather my thoughts and head back to the breakroom in the now dark office when i get back to the break room that random sales person is now sitting eating my lunch for what felt like minutes all i could do was stare at him with as much hate as i could possible muster his superisor got me lunch and wrote him up for it sad thing is its not the first time he has done stuff like this notorious for grabbing a whole pizza when the office brings pizza and eating it at his desk
the next couple of days seemed more irritating than usual with angie taking any opportunity to shadow work from almost any its engineer for me there was a notable visit to the desk occupied by the hr tank angie appeared mere seconds after my arrival as i walked hr tank how to switch off those stupid red lines under everything i write in ms word thinking she was just up there to see hr tank i mostly ignored her while i explained what those stupid red lines were when i got done angie corrected my imminent departure by with now ask your customer if there is anything else you can do for her today barely time to react the hr tank rolled herself back in front of the monitor almost steamrolling me out of her path actually yes there is i want to know why i cant change the text on this button here she bellows pointing at the start menu after two tedious hours of this sea creature barely able to muster the muscles in her head to stop dribbling as she spoke it was finally time for their regular starbucks visit never have i been subject to the most inane lines of questioning and constant corrections by angie after taking note that hr tank really needs a faster computer i take shelter in the canteen kept company by the sole remaining cheese and pickle sandwich they had left did i ever mention i really do not like pickle it was either that or starve i returned to find bhit pacing around the room his ruffled jacket and red face added to his now urgent stance the few hairs that seemed strapped to the side of his head for once looking windswept despite their nominal length he immediately pounced margie from legal affairs needs her machine back are you done with it after racking my brains and my ticket list for several minutes i found his solution that was one of the machines removed by you and the third line guys from the meeting room and so begins the epic hunt we first visit the third line guys who profess innocence our next stop is facilities who again have no idea what were on about the facilities manager takes great pains to point out that they want nothing to do with it and are getting annoyed with being implicated a two hour whistlestop tour of the building with mafg in tow shows up nothing even the it cupboard is untouched on returning to bhit angie who is fully tanked on coffee has now just been made aware of the missing machines and is scouring the ticket systems for evidence of my failings sometimes it pays to be an astute record keeper on several of the tickets i noted machine in hands of third linefacilities angie is her usual helpful self demanding to know why i informed nobody of these machines importance or even questioned where they were off to its nice to have a policy one moment of facilities looking after the whereabouts of it kit yet when it goes wrong it goes back to the nearest support monkey i took great pleasure on relaying the reaction of the facilities manager and also that each machine had been clearly labelled with a ticket number and name after growing weary of angies bitchy comments mafg and i spend the final hour of the day searching out any nook and cranny we come across for either the missing machines or even the facilities guys who did the clearout it seemed my inspired plan of doing my job and gaining an ounce of vengeance was quickly backfiring as the day grew dim on our way to one network riser room we passed margie from legal affairs she couldnt help but stop me to ask for progress and relay the updates shed gotten which amounted to apparently you managed to misplace it and still cant find it nice one angie way to pour salt in the wound we had given up in a purely flippant move by pure chance mafg opened the door to a janitors cupboard sat behind an industrialsized bottle of domestos bleach and providing gravitational support for a mop and bucket was our ghost server it stood almost majestic it had seen many an its engineer through the worst of conferences and the coldest of late nights we rescued the discolored hp proliant from this murky cesspit and carried it back to its we relayed our voyage to bhit as angie stood stonyfaced glaring disapprovingly at our failure the ghost server standing as testament to their managerial apathy bhit saw no alternative he commanded that margies machine must be replaced by tomorrow morning even if we take another one from stock the other missing machines would have to be queried with the facilities department to determine their location after clarifying a bend in the rules was ok just this one time i duly began the process of getting the ghost server back up and running to image a brand new optiplex from the it cupboard at my desk i set to work pm rolled around as the drone of people leaving and passing me by grew steadily to silence i sat illuminated by a single monitor prepping the optiplex with all manner of legal type software domain configurations etc as i was the only soul left the auto lights had dimmed most of the office only to be activated in sequence by the cleaner almost like a searchlight dancing on the stage illuminating some actress performing against the backdrop of the hoover motor after visiting margies desk and reconnecting her new pc i fired an email off to bhit and angie it read its and im done replacing this machine surely this is a testament to how ridiculous it has been for support lately we have asked several times for a permanent outofsight build and repair area in order to perform our duties after the one we had been using and had been in use for several years was summarily decided to be unsatisfactory this matter needs resolution immediately feeling authoritative in myself i hoped that demonstrating dedication to resolving these matters would help score points with anyone in the chain who mattered i reached for the monitor switch to sign out for the night but as if big brother were watching outlooks new mail balloon popped up with its accompanying selfimportant boink angies name adorned the balloon like a warning label i opened it addressed directly to me were the ominous words we will discuss this tomorrow pt a new world pt safety pt the it induction from pt pt how to make friends pt marking pt one friday to rue them pt best laid pt its one step for man pt and one step back for its

in the late s i worked for an it company and we had one of those old hp laserjet printers where the toner would bunch up and it would print half of a page youd take the cartridge out smack it a couple of times and youd be able to print again for ages well we finally ran out of toner and the new cartridge started acting up on about day two you could feel the toner in there but it would get cranky after an hour or two it was bad on about day five which was a friday the boss got pissed he was one of those guys that went from zero to explosive over a drop of a hat type guys well just after lunch the toner acted up again the boss smacked it against the wall a couple times tried to print and it came out all mucked up this time he smashed the cartridge against the wall and it exploded fine black dust just filled the room covering him in his nice white business shirt his favorite goofy tie and anything within about ten feet around him he lost it screaming and yelling and almost in tears we all started laughing which made him madder we were all ordered to leave the office and not come back until monday morning tldr napoleon cried while being covered in printer toner
 this is from the audit files i was doing vendor security audits for a bank most of the time these were quick show up go over a questionnaire ask a few questions and determine the level of risk the vendor presented to the bank sometimes they revealed bad bad practices other times it was an opportunity to commiserate with a fellow itis worker the vendor in question is an outsourced helpdesk vendor im concerned because these guys have fairly serious access in our clients active directory infrastructure i ask about what they do to prevent compromise somehow we get to talking about sony and phishing the director of is has a rare moment of candor director of is diswe recently did a phishing exercise we sent employees a phish offering to replace their current dells with macbook airs that went wrong fast mehow diswe collected a bunch of credentials and then sent a reminder about how to identify phishing emails meok what went wrong disi sent the reminder i had two users who kept asking when they were going to get their new macbooks even after i called them up to tell them that they responded to a phish i ranked them fairly secure especially since anyone whod admit to this is only telling me what i already know 
 entering the vps office i realized the vp seemed genuinely pleased to see me i had an erie feeling gtvp whilst you were away we had a little slip up gtme what kind of slipup the vp rose from him chair and walked over to the door gtvp its probably easier just to show you as we made our way down through the building in silence i wondered what could have gone wrong too many things eventually we made our way to the delivery dock i wondered what problems with it would have happened in such an it unrelated place the delivery dock was located underneath one of the buildings a ramp down from the street led to an underground open area with a few storage garages located on the side gtvp airz do you remember before you left i told the marketing department they could have an upgrade i remembered not having the budget for such an upgrade gtme yes the vp walked over to one of the garages to the side of the delivery dock he pulled out a key unlocked the roller door and opened up to a darkened car space gtairz wha i saw about ten boxes lying on the ground on top of a huge puddle gtvp see it turns out this week had some particularly hard rain and unfortunately this particular garage managed to collect some of it looking down at the puddle on the ground i couldnt see the floor it was a fairly deep puddle gtme a mini flood in a storage garage more of a building maintenance problem then an it one vps eyes caught mine his hand twitched he looked at though he was about to close the garage and leave it eventually however and with a slightly defeated face he explained gtvp remember those pcs i got for marketing well they got delivered late tuesday so they needed a place to go oh darn it gtvp anyway one of the boxes managed to block the drain and we didnt realize until after it had filled with water gtme you managed to leave new computers in a pool of water gtvp wha oh no wednesday morning i went and got it however everyone agreed since they were wet they could be dangerous if plugged in i looked down at the boxes sitting in the middle of the puddle gtme so you realized wednesday and its now monday you left them here the whole time how much bigger is the puddle a look of horror mixed with realization crossed his face gtvp oh yeah a little bigger mostly just deeper f sake gtme this is mismanagement on a scale i havent seen before youve left new computers in a pool of water for almost a week gtvp speaking of its been a week and marketing wants to know how long till the new computers come i looked down at the puddle of decaying boxes f this gtme i gotta go talk to the big p gtvp so youre just going to leave them here in a puddle gtme does seem a lot like mismanagement doesnt it i walked back to the elevators to make my journey back up to the bigps office ping the elevator door opened gtvp wait up im gonna come too 
so preface this was not an angry cry or frustration cry i literally cried my eyes out after leaving this job customer was in his s and im in my young s so i get a ticket for a customer whos internet stopped working on a friday with a note attached saying his wife passed away this morning and he wanted someone to come onsite monday to setup a new routermodem and printer i was not looking forward to this as it was going to be awkward but a jobs a job so i get there and it was kind of awkward got everything setup and working and he asked if id like to go get dinner somewhere couldnt say no well we went to dinner and ended up staying and talking for an hour or so about life and he told me about his wife and football and everything under the sun when i left he gave me the greatest thank you ive ever gotten and started crying he said it was great to talk to someone and he felt a little bit better on the drive home i started crying and told everyone in my family how much i love them
longtime lurker firsttime poster blah blah blah i hope this is appropriate for this sub since its not technically tech support when i was in college i had a parttime job in the tutoring office the way they handle assigning tutors is that you can tutor for any class you got an a or b in and having good grades at the time wanting to make more money i signed up to tutor about different classes i ended up being assigned to tutor an introlevel foreign language class about of the time but every once in a while someone would book me for something else at my school there was a computer science gened that was mandatory for everyone to take or test out of that was essentially how to use microsoft office for people who cant computer good and want to do other stuff good too every time i checked my schedule and saw someone had booked me for that class i would groan because it meant an hour a week for the rest of the semester sitting next to someone at a computer and saying no open word the w click the w no double click click it two times fast there you go so on one particular day in the beginning of my senior year i go to check my schedule and see that not only have i been assigned to tutor this microsoft office class but the student has booked me for a twohour block twice a week now tutoring is not a free service freshmen get one free hour per class per week but this guy is doing hours a week even if hes a freshman and getting one hour free thats still a good chunk of cash to shell out for tutoring before i even meet this guy im dreading him i cant imagine the type of person who needs hours of oneonone instruction per week on top of hours of class time to learn how to use word excel and powerpoint when i do finally meet him for our first session my biggest fear was confirmed he was a nontraditional student aka someone not fresh out of high school aka an old fantastic i thought this is going to be four hours a week of teaching my grandpa how to computer i introduce myself to him and another fear i didnt even know i had was confirmed he had a very thick accent and was struggling with english thats ok i told myself ive worked with esl students before i can manage we sat down at a computer in the tutoring center and i was happy to at least notice he seemed excited to learn he was very friendly and motivated ok i thought this may not be so bad i instructed him to log on he didnt know what that meant i told him to click the username box and enter his student id he didnt know what click meant he didnt know how to use a mouse he poked at the keyboard experimentally with one finger like it might bite if he wasnt careful oh no no no no this was worse than i thought very gently trying not to offend him since apparently i was going to be seeing a lot of him over the next few months i asked him if he maybe owned a laptop or tablet he would be more comfortable using trying to ascertain if he had any computer experience at all he smiled apologetically and said sorry but no i groaned internally but then he continued he informed me that he didnt own a computer because in his village at home they didnt have electricity he had just arrived in the us a few weeks ago on a refugee visa from wartorn south sudan where he had spent most of his life migrating from village to village escaping genocidal militia groups and most recently had lived in a povertystricken refugee camp he hadnt had electricity because he barely had food and shelter let alone a computer so he finally manages to get out of sudan to the us on asylum enroll in college and the first class they stick this guy in intro to microsoft office and did i mention international students have to maintain a c average to stay enrolled so failure was not an option so this guy needed to learn how to use a computer from scratch in weeks to pass his midterm then pass the final too challenge accepted im proud to say he got a b in the class kept up his gpa and went on to major in biology with premed aspirations he learned how to use a computer and i learned a valuable afterschool special lesson about judging books by their covers tldr one time i got annoyed with a genocide survivor for being bad at computers edit holy shit snacks this blew up and someone gave me gold thank you you glorious bastard whoever you are 
background i worked for a company that handled level one helpdesk for multiple companies i was the manager for a team that handled a larger international company with users who varied from unbearably nice to people youd burn in hell for just so you could have the satisfaction of watching them burn too since ive recently changed jobs i wanted to share a few tales from here i know there are a few people there who may recognize these so if you do keep it to yourself a while back i was managering and doing manager stuff reddit probably when i get it brought to my attention that one of the people on the phone is having trouble with a user so i went over to see what was going on gtjb hey whats going on gttech puts user on mute this is important this user is having trouble with big name pdf program and trying to upload it it keeps spitting out an error gtjb okay gttech i keep trying to fix it but she wont let me have the mouse for long and she keeps telling me no nows shes talking about me at this point the tech is a little flustered and upset she was a nice woman and very sweet so getting berated by an angry harpy was a little out of her comfort zone i really hated it when users bad mouthed my techs or gave them grief when they didnt deserve it but i took a deep breath and told her wed figure it out she let the user know i was there and that we were resolving the issue within twenty seconds she tells me that the user is going off again i asked her to give me the headset and put it on gtuser fcking it they are so worthless she has no idea what shes fcking doing stupid moron i could fcking do its job now this is big because im of the opinion that if you believe this you shouldnt be on the phone with it ever so my blood pressure immediately went through the roof and my body started acting before my mind could stop it gtjb hey user this is jb im the manager i could hear you talking and just wanted to see what i could help you with the twenty seconds of silence was pure gold she then begins to tell me what is going on whats wrong and how it needs to be fixed gtjb i understand you see thats exactly what tech was trying to fix and this is how it needs to be fixed but she said that you were uncomfortable with it gt user well it worked before gt jb i believe you but updates uptimes funky bits of code stuck in some cache ram something somewhere can cause things to not always work properly so would you like us to fix it gt user sure we went ahead and fixed it and surprise it worked the user hung up and called back a few minutes later about a similar issue with a different document and started giving another tech a hard time her reasoning while not totally unsound was that while it worked the previous time that it wasnt permanent and that the fix needed was more than what we did so i got back on the phone gtjb this is jb whats going on now gtuser this is happening again obviously you didnt fix it and i need it fixed again she wasnt entirely wrong i should have applied the fix to the pdf printer in the devices and printer options rather than on the individual document but i had mistakenly tried to give her the benefit of the doubt and figured it was just the original document gtjb obviously we did fix it this is because we thought it was an isolated incident i can apply this globally and youll be fine gtuser so it will never happen again gtjb look i understand youre frustrated be we are trying to get this taken care of for you i cant promise that this will never happen again because computer systems and software just doesnt work that way now i can apply the fix and you can get back to work or we can keep arguing she let us do the fix and she never called in about that issue again what was funny was that for a few weeks after that anytime a tech would put her on mute so they could work on something or ask a question she stop them gtuser please dont put jb on the phone we didnt have any more problems from her after that edit for formatting edit gilded wow thanks

i work in a monopolistic internet company we are the only providers of the service in this country it sucks and i work herethe pay is great only because the company provides shit packages for high prices most customers pay a month for mbps a month since the government owns of the company and has no taxes they use the profits of this company to indirectly subsidise stuff without the need for tax so yeah high prices this usually generates with people complaining and paying late lucky me gets to sit about and go through all the tickets and calls and the customers we get are very aggressive so i have built an immunity to this rudeness and kept my cool until a few days ago i was answering tickets when my manager directed me to a call the lady was super nice and a restart to her router along with a change of a dynamic to static address solved her problems my manager told me to answer the next call since i was already on the line i also have the pleasure of having to harass customers about late payments even a payment minutes late is a fine or the customer is blacklisted we randomly generate numbers to make sure the customer answers horrible but company policy and legal i was told it was a late payment the call went like this m me and c customer m hello sir this is xxxx and im here calling regarding your late payments and overdue fees it appears as though we will be forced to blacklist you and remove certain privileges associated with your account c why my payment was late due to the banks opening late m i froze that voice sounded really similar c can you make an exception m it was my dad umm ugh well c please m sure sir i have decided to not blacklist you and give the exception i will also remove you from the list of callers and promote you to the xxxx class so that you wont get anymore calls even if the payment was late its a privilege for that class c thanks xxxxx m no problem dad end a bit shaken i let it go and went back to tickets later that day my manager called me in he said that from the tickets and calls i had answered i been fantastic however from a random inspection of recordings i would be fired the unluckiest random search they check tickets i had broken company policy and was forced to leave i also am blacklisted on the company service forever at least my dad is happy with his service but now i need to get a new job

my firm uses a web based ticketing system for all of our support requests weve been using this system for years but just like the rest of you we still have users who refuse to use it some of them are vips in the company bigwigs that can do whatever they want so when they email one of us individually or use the group email instead of creating a ticket we just let it slide others like to think theyre as important but are nowhere near the level where they can disregard long standing company policy and skirt the ticketing system this is the tale of one such user aside from not using the ticketing system my other pet peeve is users who give no description whatsoever of their problem they just say broken or again or fix it todays email simply said help in the subject line and it was sent to two of the four of us on the support team i make eye contact with my fellow techie who was also lucky enough to receive it and said i got this before we get too far into this story you should know that this particular user and i get along famously shes one of our special users for sure but shes a great person and we give each other crap all the time her office is floors up and normally i take the elevator i decided this time to take the stairs and i ran i ran as fast as i could by the time i got to her office i was out of breath and a little sweaty shes sitting there filing her nails looking bored i reach deep back to my high school days and find my inner actor me oh my god are you ok her blank stare me your email only said help so i came as fast as i could can you breathe alright did you fall whats going on mind you i am not being quiet about this so the commotion starts to attract some attention from her nosy coworkers chairs swivel and necks crane she starts getting self conscious as all of her coworkers are now notsosubtly looking her no no umm my outlook icon disappeared i found it in the start menu but i need it back on my desktop me but youre ok its just about an icon on your desktop her uh yeah her coworkers start to chuckle quietly me deep breath and sit down at her computer oh well why didnt you say that her i didnt really know how to describe it me your icon is back on the desktop if youd like to avoid throwing us all into a panic next time please use the ticketing system and maybe try using your big girl words to describe whats going on i may show up with building security to make sure there isnt a hostage situation or something equally embarrassing lunch today her icy daggers stabbing into my face from her eyes yeah sounds good
hello long time reader first time poster i was a tech support engineer for the best part of years before moving into sales a large chunk of this time was spent working in london as a mobile desktop and server engineer attending onsite to fix things the st and nd line remote guys could not this is one of my more interesting stories from the job ampnbsp it was just an average cold day in london in december when i got a ticket to go to one of our largest customers locations and pull some cctv footage this customer was a holdings customer who owned several exclusive bars cafes and restaurants around london for some reason this ticket had to be done onsite and not remotely i arrived onsite and was met by the manager and taken to the basement where the cctv system sat next to kegs of beer and pumping stations the manager sat over my shoulder and watched as i pulled and played the footage around pm you could clearly see a guy get ejected from the premises by a security guard then a few minutes later the guy comes back and attacks the security guard with what may or may not have been a bottle the security guard fights him off and he runs off up the street ampnbsp the manager seemed troubled by this and walked off in silance my ticket said i needed to pull the footage and take it back to the companies head quarters and give it to one of the directors i started to pull the footage onto a usb drive when the manager came back with a plane clothes police officer who identified himself as a detective of some kind and asked to see the footage i explained that as i was in the process of pulling the footage i couldnt access play back but if he wanted to hang around for minutes i could show him he didnt seem to have time for this so he left me his card and asked me to call him when i had the footage ampnbsp all seemed normal right i proceeded to return to the company hq with the footage and went to the top floor where the directors can be found i met one of the directors who shook my hand with a smile and said i had saved us a tremendous amount of trouble young man we wont forget what you have done for us today i mean normally this job is pretty thankless at the best of times as we all know so it was appreciated but it did seemodd but hey praise is great right ampnbsp shortly after i had left the building and was checking for my next ticket my phone my phone rang josh another guy on my team was on the line ampnbsp hey fielder have you just completed ticket because im being sent onsite with instructions to clear the memory on the same cctv system any ideas why ampnbsp what why why would they want us to purge cctv footage while there was an ongoing police investigation shit this is not good shit this is stuff that gets people fired fuck josh agreed this was strange i asked him to hold fire until i could make a phone call ampnbsp i pulled out the business card the detective had given me earlier and called him telling him i had given the footage to the director and that we now had orders to purge the cctv system i asked if he needed anything else he said thank you that i had been very helpful and saved him a tremendous amount of trouble and hung up why is everyone so grateful today ampnbsp that was the end of my involvement i didnt find out what happened for another week when i was back in the office it turned out the bar had been hosting the companies own christmas party the night of the incident the guy who attacked a bouncer was a senior member of staff at one of the top bars in london he had got a little out of control thanks to the open bar got rejected then attacked the bouncer with london being what it was the company was scared that it would make the newspapers and tarnish the entire company brand the request to pull the footage was totally legitimate but the directors planned to bury the footage and have us purge it so prevent their being sufficient evidence for a case to be brought against the staff member and the company we were about to start the process of destroying evidence a pretty major crime ampnbsp josh had been waiting in the basement by the door so he had phone signal waiting on my call back when he heard a police siren outside and a loud commotion the plain clothes officer had screamed back to the bar with his blue lights on came into the bar and pushed the manager out of the way and rushed to the basement to stop josh from removing the footage fortunately josh had not even logged into the system and had the good forward thinking to remove the system from the internet to prevent outside interaction he then pulled a copy of the footage and gave it to the officer who thanked him for his assistance and promised he would keep this part of the interaction vague so josh would not get in trouble ampnbsp the situation was crap it put me in a tough situation being a year old engineer and having to choose between doing the right thing and keeping things legal or keeping my job being able to pay the bills fortunately nobody found out about my phone call to the police so the people involved just assumed he got onsite too late and the police got their before he could purge the system we never found out what happened in the end but there was no blow back between the client and my company and we didnt get in any trouble nor did we hear or read anything about it in the papers unfortunately the people who had organised the whole thing and tried to destroy evidence also got away with it so in the end nothing happened ampnbsp tldr manager assaults doorman senior management tried to bury it i was the poor engineer stuck in the middle between having to give the footage to the police and keeping my job 
several years ago i was working as a help desk tech for a large well known bank in the eastern us now my desk was comprised of a dwindling number of people or so for around k bank employees needless to say this made for a stressful environment we had our fair share of idiots but one woman absolutely wins for handsdown idiocy on this particular day high profile vp calls in because shes having issues looking at anything in her email outlook was and always will be a regular bane of existence so i went through the basics of verification and settled in for what i thought would be a fairly normal call god was i wrong me so tell me maam when did this issue start for you vp listen i dont have time to go into a story i just need you to fix my email im about to finish up a multimillion dollar contract and this has to be fixed now me alright allow me to remote in to your system and see what i can see so i get into the computer and immediately notice a major red flag her archive file is way over the size limit the system is supposed to cap employee pst files at mb hers was at gb sigh of course it was her inbox a mb cap was hovering around mb the kicker though was her deleted items gb and change i just looked at that and whistled me well i can tell you exactly what your problem is you are over your size limit on absolutely everything and i dont even know how so what youre going to need to do is create some additional pst files and move a substant vp young man what part of i dont have time did you not grasp im not going to do that now i cant move anything into my archive and i need my email fixed without jumping through your stupid hoops me alright well the only other thing that i can try to do is clear out space in your main inbox is that alright vp i dont care what you do as long as you get it fixed jesus christ why do you people always have to ask questions do you not know how to do your job me maam i just have to verify vp fix it fine so i immediately selected deleted files gt right click gt delete a shriek of pure terror and anguish flooded out of my headset the likes of which i have never before experienced i started to ask what the problem was when she whimpered vp youyou just deleted all of my most important emails me uh no i emptied your deleted items folder which was massively over size vp thats where i kept my most importantthere were years of vital emails in that folder i couldnt move them to my stupid archive because my fucking email never works you just deleted all of my most important emails me you have got to bewhy would you put anything important in your deleted items vp bring them back all of them and then transfer me to your manager i cannot believe this iyou me i dont have the ability to do that all of your emails are stored locally there is no server backup we would have to send out a tech to run an undelete tool the soonest of which can be out later today at this point i am in disbelief and shes just screaming obscenities at me so i calmly tell her im putting her on hold to get my manager he listens to what just happened puts his head in his hands and tells me to just kill him at least i managed to keep my job that day

a few years ago we got the kids a pc for christmas i set it up and created accounts for each child with appropriate time restrictions and login times now like most kids they are obsessed with minecraft i played it a few times found it beyond boring and regretted that i spent on it but i digress when the kids werent playing minecraft they were watching youtube videos of other people playing it this of course led to the inevitable i wanna make my own minecraft videos so they download a screen recording program and get me to use my admin access to let it install and every time they want to run it i have to go upstairs and type in the admin password fuck this noise theyre getting just as tired of it as i am they whine and complain just give us admin access hell no i saw what you did with admin access to the laptop you had been using before you got the pc i had to reinstall it times because you managed to load it with viruses get a different video recording software they look around but all of these applications require admin access because of the way they interface with directx on the products website it even says you must have local administrator access in order to run the program there is no way around this i go searching surely there must be a better way to do this that doesnt involve giving the children the technological equivalent of a loaded gun the wisdom of the interwebs remains firm the program requires local admin access in order to function the documentation and the product faq both say so and as we all know programmers are never wrong but im a unix admin i find windows to be stupidly restrictive and theres a paradigm at play here theres no way to run an application with administrator privileges without typing in the local admin password unix has this ability its called sudo as in sodo make me a i check there is in fact a sudo for windows it uses a service that runs as the local administrator to spawn off child processes that run with elevated privileges based on rules in an xml file i edit the file and add the program path and the kids accounts to the authorized users list gt me login as yourself gt child why gt me you want this to work or not gt child yes gt child i guess but how the guy who made it said theres no way to make it work without admin gt me because we all know hes the absolute authority on all things computer i roll my eyes so hard i give myself a headache gt child its not going to work just give me admin gt me just log in for christsakes gt child huff fine he logs in then immediately doubleclicks on the icon for the program predictably it throws up an error stating that it needs local admin access gt child see now give me admin access i take the mouse from him rightclick on the icon and select run with sudo there is a moment of dead silence in the room as the program starts up gt child how gt child hes smarter than you dummy gt child shut up child then proceeds to rightclick on firefox and selects run with sudo predictably it fails with an access denied error gt child so thats the only thing i can run gt me what do i look stupid to you i let you run anything else as admin and this pc will have more viruses than a really sick person i manage to stop myself from saying hooker in front of an year old yay me gt child oh ok well thanks all was right with the world until he managed to install some kind of spyware that set up a local proxy server to redirect all browser traffic through when avg removed said spyware the web browser stopped working im still trying to figure out how he managed to install spyware edit formatting
var props firsttimeposterfalse longtimelurkertrue hey guys so its me again with friend who is a manager at a hosting company this time another tale of a guy who wanted out of the company so this guy had a vps virtual private server which is just a tiny vm living on a massive host also worth mentioning the company offers clients the option to pay full price for the host if they have a dedicated server and take it away with all their data and no support after that so the guy called in guy hey i want to cancel my service when can i come over and pay for the server and take it home please friend finds his info well sir it seems that you have a vps so the server does not really exist physically if youd like to cancel you will have to migrate the data off yourself and buy a server elsewhere though that would be very expensive and likely not worth it mind you this guy is paying a month for gb ram and gb of ssd guy look i dont care if it is virtual or real or whatever you said i want the server home so my son can play minecraft with his friends friend that is unfortunately not possible friend could have made him pay k for a physical host install a hypervisor and give him the vm but that would make him no profit and this guy was difficult enough to deal with guy give me the server or i will sue you friend secretly hoping it would come to this since you have threatened legal action i have no choice but to terminate this call you will be hearing from our lawyers on legal action moving forward click tldr is this the real life is this a virtual machine
it finally happened after nearly a year of working for my schools help desk i found that user the magical mythical user that goes out of their way to do their own research on a problem and try to fix it on their own before calling us i got scheduled to go out to her office to troubleshoot a slow computer and when i got there she said that it had been running fine all day but she had an issue with some monitors she got most desktops on our campus are older dells that have a proprietary video card that needs a splitter to use two monitors and it only works for dvi she was given vga cables and was really confused about how she was supposed to use the dvi splitters we gave her heres the crazy part instead of calling and just asking for new cables and us having to spend a crazy amount of time trying to figure out what she needed she took time to look up video cable types and put in a ticket herself asking for dvi cables instead of vga she said she pulled up a diagram she found on google and figured it out using the cables we gave her so i instantly ran and grabbed her the dvi cables she needed and helped her set them up around the building the monitors were in and she even set up two on her own crawled under the desk and everything and she didnt even need to i wouldve gladly done it all especially with how nice and helpful she was and it wasnt even the thing i got sent out on so now if she ever calls in ill gladly go out and help her with whatever she needs best user ever edit i used the wrong form of their rip in pepperonis
by request my nice customer by some perverse universal sense of humor this took place about twenty minutes or so after the events of im ruining phone rings mid coffee i regard it warily after my entertaining morning my polite phone spiel is a little less chipper than normal gthi i have a toshiba laptop do you work on those at least its a normal question i answer yes pleased that clone had mr christmas ruiner beat at being a decent human being just on vocal tone and shed barely said ten words total to me yet she asks how long a software fix might take to fix and i ask her to describe the problem gtwell it boots up okay but when it gets to windows all you see is a black screen with a cursor itll boot up in safe mode all right but not normally the reference to safe mode should have tripped me off but my brain was still calming down gtew thats a tricky one how long has it been doing this did it just start today i gauge the systems on my desk trying to anticipate if i should tell her to bring it in or if its hopeless to try to repair this before friday ive seen this error before and its usually hopeless once it gets to that state at least a windows reinstall doesnt take long gtwell off and on for several months probably almost a year it would work fine once you rebooted but the last few days we havent been able to get it into windows at all months was my trip bad hdd screwed up windows update minor malware any combination of those two can set windows into permanent tease mode and for an error thats been in the system that long it usually has hardware at its core i got a few more details about her system and the specifics of the error gtill warn you its not good i would definitely have to have you check it in so that i can run diagnostics on it this error is commonly a problem with the hardware i could probably get it done before friday but no guarantees i go to load up my were closed for the next two weeks speech when gtwell i thought that too so we got a new hard drive and i cloned it over but its still doing it would that mean its a virus i damned near dropped the phone first i get accused of being somewhere lower than the grinch on the scale of santa and now now i have a unicorn gtyoucloned your own hard drive i immediately felt bad because she got slightly defensive and asked if that was wrong gtno no you dont understand i was about to ask if you even knew what a hard drive was i was trying to figure out how to explain that the thing with all your pictures on it might be damaged gtoh yes i know what a hard drive is my husband really was the one that cloned it im not super techsaavy but since the error stuck around we werent sure where to go from here i explained about drive corruption and bad sectors and how damage to system files would persist across a cloning due to the nature of both a bad sectors and b the imperfect cloning process gtso can you fix it gtill be honest with what youve already told me youve tried id suggest a straightup reinstall i can sometimes fix this error but the system usually doesnt work great afterwards and its only got about a chance of working at all its easiest to cut to the chase and just start over gtoh sad i thought it would be that i was just hoping since some of my programs are annoying to reinstall i can do a windows reload i just i just wanted there to be an easier answer she laughed i boggled gtyeah if you can reinstall your own windows thats going to be the fastest just dont forget to back up all your data she laughed again gtyeah you only make that mistake once right once she said she made that mistake once i remember this feeling im falling in love she asked a few questions about if i had any tips about reinstalling windows i warned her to make a list of software she had on there first and doublecheck for finicky drivers she lamented how bad she was at this again and promised that when she got stuck shed call me for help i almost asked her to send me a resume but i couldnt break a magical creature like that better for her to stay where she was protected safe untarnished besides the pay here is shit she asked if she owed me anything for the advice i said no that while i could have made time for her reinstall i really was busy and it works out better for me this way she asked if i was sure i told her that never in over a decade and a half that ive been doing this some professionally some as the friend who knows computers have i ever had someone call me who even knew that a hard drive could be cloned save one dba who doesnt do his own hardware work but hes special and it was my absolute pleasure to assist a competent user i still dont think she believed me but she was grateful for the information and swears shell call back when she breaks something a part of me hopes ill never hear from her again a part of me sincerely hopes i will
 this is years ago when i was a poor exstudent who just got started in it and i forgot the details but a recent fire drill at my current employer reminded me of it the shortest time i ever worked for one employer was one week i started work on a monday as the it guy meaning that as long as it had anything to do with computers it landed on my desk technically i was part of the it department but since that consisted of me the guy i was temporarily replacing who was hospitalized and the hr lady who doubled as head of it but did not even know what an ip address was in practice i was just the only occupant of the it office service desk who got to jump when a clueless luddite called the servicedesk with an it problem usually a lost password thursday the fire alarm goes off theres no panic so i expect it was just a drill even if we were not informed before now i dont particularly like the idea of becoming a statistic so i decide it was better to be safe than sorry i locked my pc before i went outside having just grabbed my coat cue some joking with the others in the company while we wait for the alarm to stop my feeling it was a false alarm is proven correct when security guy comes outside and tells us we can return hr lady comes by and proceeds to flip out that i left the desk because what if an urgent call cames in i point out that there was a fire alarm but she claims i shouldve known better and that it is vital that it is manned at all times i ask her how i was supposed to know it is a drill false alarm and she says that doesnt matter i shouldve remained at my post i ask her to point out where i missed in the employee handbook that it was supposed to ignore fire alarms which of course is not listed there perhaps a bit confrontational but i firmly believed i was right the next day i arrive at work and am resolving various tickets for perhaps two hours when hr lady comes by with the security guy and tells me to pack my stuff i am fired and since im still in my one month trial period theres nothing i can do about it since we both me and the company have the rights to back out for any reason tldr i heard a fire alarm and left my desk and got fired over it

so this happen literally this morning i was sitting at my desk happily minding other peoples businesses when i had an alert the worst kind of alert server name is offine joyous occasion i immediately called the company to just alert them that their network shares etc will be down whilst i figure out what went wrong when i was made aware that they had switched the server off and on my immediate question was how because i know full well there was no engineer on site today the person nonchalantly replied oh i turned it off at the wall my shock must have been apparent and i stammered why did you do that he replied how else was i supposed to there is no screen me please dont do that again please just ask us i hung up the phone and i sit here waiting and praying that the server comes back online because i dont want to have to fit in an already full day with a site visit to repair god knows what may have gone wrong with the server after an improper shutdown edit the server has just come back online thankfully 
until a few years back if any employee called internal it at the big telco i work for saying they forget their password our subcontracted internalit scriptmonkeys would ask for your name which doubles as your username within the network and then immediately say your password was reset to the default qwerty theyd them ask you to change it yourself to something more secure as per script and hang up politely my last and some others explained that our internal it grew so big they started cutting corners contracted down and have some terrible policies but to my team tech supports senior staff this one always seemed particularly unacceptable anyone who knew this and had their number could theoretically pose as any employee of the same gender and get access to anyones account and personal drive through a default password reset this had been formally reported as utterly unacceptable security several times over a years period prior to the following conservation yet nothing had ever been done about it my colleague at tsss called frank in many of my tales such as this had the biggest axe to grind with this particular security issue we have many more of those but he was personally outraged by this one having had a personal experience where he was screwed by another company because they were doing the same damn thing he really wanted it to change and told me about how hed get it done since proper channels didnt work asked me about his scheme i erred on the side of caution with my advice gt bytewave i wouldnt do it this way out of it works sure but calls are recorded voices are recognizable someone figures it out and youll lose your job weve been here for a damn long time and you like the job despite the crazy right can try through proper channels again its insane they never fixed it after its been reported so many times but i wouldnt stick my neck out to clean after systems manglement gt frank sure i do like this gig but weve got access to the call monitoring software can immediately delete the recording do everything from a test lab gt bytewave deleting calls from that software always worked so far but if someone with a really good suit gets pissed there are data recovery options i know weve taken liberties but your idea is socialengineering your way into upper managements email to prove your point forget job union security thats being instantly fired if caught and theres no arbitrator in this country who will roll that back no matter the grievance basically all im saying is itll probably work but its your ass and im not sure you should be risking a job you like for them union staff sometimes think were invincible because we get away with a lot more than others without being fired but its important to keep in mind there are lines you cross at your own peril frank wanted to and i couldnt talk him down that day personally i was also concerned because we need him around hes not someone id consider expendable to put it lightly but he went forward with his gamble by trying to log into someone elses internal account from the lab a few times with random passwords he got their account locked and then reached for the labs phone gt frank dialing internal it from a test lab this is hermann thomas exec assist to the call centers veep ive locked myself out of my account i didnt see caps lock was on and i really need to gt systems herman thomas login hermanthomas executive assistant for gt frank hermann with two ns but yes gt sysyems your internal password is reset to qwerty temporarily you must immediately change it to something else for security purposes anything else we can help you with gt frank no that will be all thank you frank logged in the quality purposes call monitoring tool and deleted the recording then he logged into the vicepresidents secretarys account using the default password and emailed several people at upper management with multiple scans of evidence this particular security risk had been underlined without results for years a seven words apology and a smiley face he didnt look at or touch anything else even though he was briefly privy to tons of things upper management would likely never want a union employee to see i at least thought pretending to be one of the executive assistants rather than a vp himself was a nice touch good way to keep a lower profile while still getting access to their data but he still risked his job a little recklessly the next day the veeps secretary couldnt log in his workstation obviously and likely called systems who then reset his default password to the default password thats when hed have noticed upper management was in an uproar about a major security breach i dont know how it all played out from there but very soon after we learned a frontline sales employee who called systems for a password reset was told that cannot happen at this time youll remain locked out for the rest of the day due to technical issues the poor girl freaked thinking she was getting fired for some reason until her manager told her otherwise she spent the whole day waiting not taking a single call unable to log into her account upper management had handed down orders that no password resets were to happen until further notice only three days later they came up with a more secure solution in line with most of the industry in the meantime anyone who knew could have purposely locked themselves out of the network and would have then been paid to do no work but very few people ever learned what was actually going on frank took a rather big risk but who am i to argue with results all of bytewaves tales on

so i wrote a comment about an office move at my previous employer where i was told that air con was not as cost efficient as opening a window there is a bigger story to it which is really worth sharing so i joined the company after a long stint with a very well known organisation in the uk at that job my opinion was largely respected i was part of some major projects and regularly sat on advisory boards for it within the org the only thing lacking was the onward progression and after years i had reached a plateau the interview was good a strange location but close to home and reasonable pay managing a small team some tough questions thrown in but nothing i did not know how to handle or hadnt come across in the past i got offered the role and started after a brief notice period many platitudes were thrown my way by my director at my leaving party and there was a genuine feeling of loss from everyone in the department in the build up to my last day i started in the new role and quickly tried to get the lay of the land i sat with the staff and asked what they do and how they do it one particular member of staff was prone to working from home to cover sick leave which i had been told to get a handle on i changed the working from home policy and within two months my entire team had attempted to have me fired by whistleblowing that i refused to let the team have my password and i was hacking the computers it ended with the instigator being let go so i was down one member of first line in short the outgoing it manager was related to the boss and was being moved sideways the team itself was a ragtag bunch making do with what they had been left with after an it outsourcer had ballsed up the systems years previously two of the staff had no it experience and had been placed in the department to keep them from causing trouble under my management the department transformed i put in place loads of efficiency changes to get the department doing things right simple things like wds to deploy pc images and wsus for patches i got the department new servers and got the systems to be almost automated to the point where the it department mostly did document management first line support and development we got to participate in an office move a seemingly normal thing for most it departments but in our case it was a minefield especially given that we were being given one month to do it in including fibre runs for internet month lead time from openreach in the uk so we get the move done in weeks on the day the new office opened we had one call about a printer not working i sent an email stating to our absent boss that it had gone well i got an email back stating that it was disappointing that the printer issue hadnt been identified in advance i was gobsmacked i had been having discussions with a recruiter who was headhunting for a huge once in a lifetime role and id been putting him off for a week because i wasnt confident about one particular area they kept going back to i called and said id go for it so the interview went well i had a good chat with the potential new boss and waited the next day i had a sit down with my firstliner gtfl hi ap i need to let you know i am moving out of the area im going to be handing in my notice im going to use the relocation as a early retirement gtme wow that is really good for you obviously i am really sad that you will be leaving but i hope you enjoy the new home and the retirement gtfl thanks i wanted you to know before i sent the letter to hr so the hr dept is notified and later that day my boss has a brief exchange with her gtboss i hear youre leaving us fl gtfl yes ive bought a new house and am going to do it as an early retirement gtboss well good luck we all wish you the best fl leaves shortly after for the day and i stay behind to discuss the future it first line support gtme fl retiring is a bit of a shock gtboss yes but its a good thing shes a troublemaker and always has been it will be good to see her go gtme slightly taken aback ok so should i get on to the agencies in the morning and put out a vacancy gtboss lets not i want to assess how the department copes without one more troublemaker at this point my brain is screaming i was already working weekends on supporting the remote sites and was trying to get things running properly i was close but needed the extra person i thought about how i could really change everything with a new hire that would be on board with me i went home and lamented my situation the offer from the interview hadnt materialised i spent the next few days contemplating my future and dealing with a rapidly overheating server room then i got a call gtagent they want a second interview with you itll be with the md and the department director gtme when are they thinking gtagent two days from today gtme its short notice but i will be there the interview goes really well i get the job offer on the train after leaving the interview i recall reaching home and crying in front of my wife in pure elation and the letter comes through i have a chat with my team and tell them i will be leaving at this point the second line tech states he has taken an offer as well i realise the enormity of the situation i go back to my desk and fire off my email to hr the pa to the boss pulls me aside gtpa what the bloody hell is going on gtme excuse me gtpa have you been planning this gtme dont be ridiculous gtpa ok then where is your offer from gtme big company the salary is x i would be mad not to take it gtpa what about tech where is he going gtme i dont know with that the department was left with only the developerprogrammer she quit the next day we had a meeting as a team with the boss who essentially said he wanted us to keep it to ourselves and not share the knowledge with the other departments before he could announce what the plan was basically it was outsourced i sat with the company selected and handed everything over and they complimented me on a good setup saying they had never taken over the it with such ease this didnt make an impact on my boss though his pa was instructing hr to advise that i was taking unauthorised breaks and spending too long making phone calls on my mobile i politely stated that the calls i made were for company support issues and that the breaks were legally protected in a manner which said f off you are trying to be silly now i asked read begged to be let go early to which my boss wrote back its my decision ill decide when you go and if you ask again it will be the full months i rang the new boss and asked if a shitty reference was a show stopper explaining that the situation was souring rapidly and he confirmed a reference was not a condition of the offer i went and made a coffee in the break room with my staff i said my goodbyes wished them luck and got hugs from the female staff i told them to follow procedure immediately disable my account and packed my company assets into a envelope which i placed on the hr managers desk i then got up swiped out leaving my pass on the hr desk afterward and went for a final permanent lunch break
as ive posted earlier i work tech support for a major american airline but we also have a lot of international service as well being based in the states our default language is english and most of our international callers have a pretty good command of english others have dedicated language lines they can all for support as well but some people fall just in between enough of a command of english to get by day to day but when talking over an often grainy connection and using precise technical terms there are often barriers this came about during an attempt to start a remote session they are calling from somewhere east of the iron curtain and communicating is not very easy im spelling out the url for him to enter and like a good airline employee using the nato phonetic alphabet that pilots use in order to spell it out after a few failed attempts to navigate to the url i try to hold his hand and slowly walk him thru the process i shall name the caller boris meokay thats r as in romeo e as in echo m as in mike o as in oscar boris why is name so long romeoechomikeoscartangoechoairline namecom could be much shorter of course boris was writing out the full names of phonetic alphabet i advise him of this mesir im just using the nato phonetic alphabet that pilots use dont actually type those words borisnato i dont want nato spy tools in my internet get it out i dont need any of your bull boris is of course fluent at swearing in english mesir its just an alphabet not anything else borisyou insult my smarts and my country i hang up now figure it out on my own and he hung up leaving me to explain to a supervisor the next week why i was being offensive against his nationality i explained the details and we had a laugh and now i just tell people that its the pilot alphabet tldr in soviet russia url types you 
i spent at least half an hour trouble shooting a customers email address over the phone it was so perplexing there was no reason that it shouldnt be working this guy was in his s so i mistakenly gave him the benefit of the doubt and began looking into more complicated issues everything checked out so i finally got him to spell letter for letter what he was entering as his username only to find out that he was spelling at instead of using how does one function in todays society having never used an email address

last year a coworkerfriend died in a horrific car accident his wife and children were in the car with him when it happened we everyone here at the office promised to support the wife and children in any way we could and i promised free tech support any time she needed it she brought her macbook in for work shortly after the accident for support i cleaned it up and sent her off with a spare external drive so she could do time machine backups of the macbook year later two wednesdays ago i received an email from the wife lets call her sadwife she explained to me that the family imac had stopped working and asked if i could take a look i thought back to the macbook and figured she was just mistakenly calling it an imac so i told her to bring it on in she brought it in it was not the macbook it was an imac and it was ancient late model she then explained that it had the entire collection of family pictures all of her husbands photography projects their legal documents their bills their family video files etc anything and everything that had to do with her now dead husband was on this machine irreplaceable stuff and no backups i plugged the sad white teletubby in and turned it on and right away got the logo i pressed my ear to the machine and heard the drive chip chip chipchip chip chip chip chiiiiip not wanting to freak sadwife out i told her to leave it with me for a day or two and i would do what i could smiling until she left my office as soon as the door shut the smile disappeared i shut the machine off and pulled the drive docked it to a macbook i had on my shelf and to my relief the drive appeared then to my chagrin the drive disappeared freezer trick failed the drive spun up with no problem and then just chip chip chipped away not a damaging sound but like the arm wasnt receiving instructions from the controller upon examining the controller i found lots of oxidization there were still signs of life since it actually tried to appear when i docked it to the macbook on my desk so i was hopeful i put on my reading glasses and carefully scraped the contacts clean revealing shiny new copper underneath the thin film of rust plugged in powered on it appears then disappears crud hopeful that i could still save it i started digging through spare machines hoping to find a matching gb wd drive with the same controller about machines in i found one that looked identical but it was an gb model the contacts on this one were also oxidized but not nearly as much and the gb drive worked fine hope i took out the soldering iron and moved the ic chip but noticed there were other components which differed between the two so i moved those as well plugged in turned on spun up nothing gtdamn it i turned it off and left early for the day as i had to take a day trip out of town the next day while gone i decided that if needed i would just send the thing of for data recovery i even got approval for the cost from itdir friday morning came and i arrived at the office sadwife had emailed the day before asking if i had any luck i bought some time by telling her i was out of the office and still had more work to do walking into my office which at this point looked like a transformer the robot kind had exploded in it i looked at the drive in its dock i figured why not so i clicked the power button on the dock the thing came to life and started giving healthy drive activity sounds it appeared on the desktop of the macbook and this time it stayed there gtholy crap i have a drive duplicator but i didnt dare power it off to disconnect it from the mac so i copied all of her documents videos pictures etc into a folder on the macbook then since it was still alive i grabbed the nearest drive and did a block copy i put the cloned drive in the imac put it back together and powered it up perfect i called sadwife to tell her the news gthi sadwife this is azonic you can come get your imac i have a spare external drive for you to run time machine backups as well gtsadwife how did it go was it too much trouble gtme no no trouble at all tldr the husband died but i resurrected his data edit about spelling and grammar mistakes yesterday was a hour day shut up edit gold god i love the people in this sub edit i love how mod made the front page quote ask a question that is answered by the title just below it thanks umagicbigfoot you just made my day
this is my first tfts post so forgive any errors i frequent a small coffee shop on my lunch hour and have helped the owners out a few times with small computer stuff mostly in exchange for the cinnamon bun with the extra icing when i go there haha anyway i was there today and there was one guy who was watching videos on his iphone which is fine its open internet and a public coffee house except when the owner caught my attention when i was headed to the washroom she made the psst come here nod and i obliged she whispered to me asking if theres some way to get this guy off the internet because his videos were crazy loud there were a few kids there and he was asked before to use headphones or at least turn it down below the level of the speaker music he did for a while but i guess just decided fuck the world so i said sure ill handle it i use the washroom and return to my seat sipping on my coffee i head to the router page which was a default login of course and find a ip address and mac address with the name roysphone attached to it sure enough it was the only phone other than a few androids so i restrict it for a minute and see what happens like magic his videos stops after s tap tap tap nothing he looks around while im buried in my coffee and he tries a few more taps he checks the wifi password theres a card on each table with it and nothing haha he left shortly after once his car pulled out i removed the mac restriction so if he comes back hes ok she compd my coffee and thanked me this is the closest ive been to a superhero

i work for a small university as a computer tech and at the start of each semester of what i do is reset passwords resetting a password is a relatively painless process so long as the student cooperates of course this wouldnt be much of a story had there not been one to do otherwise the day started off well though i hadnt the chance to eat breakfast that morning so before the hordes of students arrived i managed to grab a yogurt from the break room and eat it at my desk the student horde began shortly after and about or students in line was constant at about mid day my day stopped going so well a student arived shouting and pushing her way through the line all the way to my desk she continued shouting at me demanding to know why her login wasnt working apparently she needed into her account asap and it was more importantant than the password problems of all other students in line including the one i had been currently working with rather than escalate the situation i calmly asked her to test her login on my computer before resetting it she looked infuriated that i would dare not take her word for it though thankfully she calmed down a little and proceeded to type in her credentials while typing she growled if this works im going to flip a lid she hits enter and it logs in stunned she went quiet staring at the screen in disbelief in order to quickly escalate the situation without saying a word i slide towards her the lid from my yogurt
screechy and i waited for over an hour the wait was bad i thought about if id get paid for this if found guilty probably not i eventually mustered enough courage to get some more coffee screechy followed me over to the tea room gtscreechy so you think anyone else will talk to us the entire of hr was treating us as if we had the plague it was rather nice gtme haha probably not still would you talk to the pair who potentially put a bar through a air conditioner gtscreechy i mean could be a good story i looked down at my coffee it was free worked paid for this was it my last i took a sip the head of hr walked into the break room as she looked at us her face changed to surprise gtheadhr oh youre still here gtme yep i didnt know what to say coffee wasnt giving me any guidance either gtheadhr arnt you meant to be getting the server back up you know so work can happen gtme no no the vp has banned us from the office he told us to wait up here gtheadhr oh you havent heard gtme heard gtheadhr well i cant officially say anything since im head of hr but you can definitely go back to work now gtme no wait what gtheadhr hurry downstairs and fix these computers thats all can officially say as i headed downstairs i wondered what had just happened my coffee wasnt giving anything away upon reaching the it floor i notice techs madly working to get the servers up again colourblind sees me walk in and rushes over gtcolourblind airz thank goodness weve restored almost all the services but salesmanager keeps ringing up and saying how slow everything is can you deal with it gtme no problem i walked into my office and picked up the phone to call the sales manager gtme hey its airz down in it it was at that point that the vp arrived at my office i just pressed the hangup button he looked at me rather sheepishly gtvp sorry i was confused it had been a whirlwind morning i may have also wanted to milk it gtme for gtvp for misreading a few things gtme you mean accusing me of sabotage type things gtvp we had a er misunderstanding for that i apologize he looked defeated it was glorious my coffee was empty but i was happy gtvp in compensation for your stressful morning i think perhaps we should cancel the audit the department is stressed enough gtme two auditors in two days i really know how to get rid of them gtvp errr yes also youll probably need a bigger budget to cover all the lost equipment gtme we did lose quite a bit gtvp yes i think ill just get out of your way over the next day we brought more of the equipment from the heated room online most of it was working however the budget situation had gone from one extreme to the other so most of the equipment needed upgrading the office rumor mill was running in overtime about what had happened however no one would speak to me about it until finally i caught youngsec alone gtme so youngsec do you know what happened to the air conditioner gtyoungsec you didnt hear after you and screechy disappeared the police arrived and one of the office workers from the building opposite the fan confessed gtme did he say why he did it gtyoungsec apparently when the silver fan is moving at speed the reflection from the sun was flashing and hitting him in the eyes as he worked gtme so he decided to destroy it gtyoungsec no no he didnt think it would break the thing just tried to get it to stop flashing kinda of like when you turn off the fan in the car the air conditioner still cools just doesnt push it out as much gtme air conditioners need fans gtyoungsec are you sure after id found out what had really happened i was quite pleased i sat down at my computer and picked up my coffee time to check some emails gtnew message gtcan we get some more keyboards on level two were running really low again gtsales manager i looked down at my coffee i took a sip tastes the same the battle was over the vp settled down for a few months after that a few minor fights but nothing really kicked off again until the new security head finally arrived thank you all for reading this is the end of the first vp war i didnt skip too much outside of the occasional story that violated rules or 
a friend of mine has also been working in it and just got hired to do soul crushing data entry im a big security buff so i asked him if his company ever had a security audit done and if not he should let his boss know i can do it his boss gave me a call and we couldnt settle on price my friend let me know later that day that on the weekend a different company is coming in for physical security it coworkers of my friend and myself are invited to watch the process from security cameras and being the security buff that i am i decided to come in and watch on saturday around noon i showed up to find my friend in the security room with the guards for the company watching the cameras gtme where is everyone i thought this was going to be a big deal you dont get to watch pros break in to companies every day gtfriend ya i brought beer though were not sure what time theyre coming in its supposed to be a surprise i think gt guards turns around raises glass of beer turns back to monitor after chatting for about an hour we notice a homeless man hanging around the back door asking for change and getting in to peoples faces as they leave the building we dont think much of it at the time to spoil the surprise hes stealing rfid information from employees cards were distracted by a well dressed person at the side door that keeps juggling his phone starbucks mcdonalds bag and keyring at one of our doors he keeps bending down to put things on the ground mixes the order of how hes holding things then stands back up in front of the lock this starts my friend and i talking about what he could be doing why they chose that get up why theyre pretending to be on the phone etc at about the homeless man and the well dressed man both leave and get out of view of the cameras we keep talking and expect a long wait before something else happens but at about the well dressed man comes back to the door he was fiddling with before and takes out a key he slips it in to the lock and unlocks the door security at this point is absolutely floored to again spoil the surprise he was doing an attack since it and security and myself were in on the test were not allowed to interfere we keep our eyes on the monitor and watch that man casually walk to the server room and lift his mcdonalds bag in front of the scanner the light turns green and he walks past the authorized zones the guards are totally speechless and my friend and i are absolutely amazed hes one more set of doors away from a million dollar server room he lifts his mcdonalds bag in front of the scanner for the last set but the light turns red undisturbed he bends down and turns on the light on his smartphone and points it under the door then he stands back up and literally starts pissing in between the doors gtguard a he did not just do that gtfriend did he just break in to our servers by potentially causing millions of dollars in water damage the doors open due to the sensors on the other side picking up either the weight or the movement he casually picks up his phone and walks into the server room he picks up the phone calls the boss and lets him know the penetration test was successful i guess this is why some auditors want to get paid before they do the test next time though i hope they go with the more expensive security auditors they might not get their servers water damaged tldr multimillion dollar security doors that conveniently let people walk out by automatically opening from inside movement can be opened by literally pissing through the crack between the doors

so some things are too good not to share some things are too good not to share immediately my colleague just spoke to a user who as the main part of her job scans passports and other documents to put on file in a database simple enough right wrong she had called up because in the past she had been scanning in doucments at our mfd printers opening the resulting pdf on her computer and printing it with cutepdf to save it where she wanted it to go however the version we have licensed is a bit out of date and following an update to acrobat she is no longer able to do this my colleague had to spend minutes explaining that you dont need to convert a file to a pdf when its already a pdf she eventually got it and said she panicked because she had already shredded the paper copies gt colleague you shred the passports gt user no the photocopies she had been photocopying documents scanning the photocopies at the same machine once they came out opening the scanned document a pdf and then converting it to a pdf in a different location after my colleague finished his explanation i think he actually halved her working day edit formatting

warning the word cpu will be used theres a doctor who must have the best of the best i feel like sometimes he scours the net reads what folks just bought and goes dammit i want that shit too my hospital at the time barely had windows images it wasnt a priority and you had to justify needing plus key software that the doctors used were only capable wxp in our environment as the hospital was holding off from buying packages that supported this great doctor who understood everything but didnt care once asked me about upgrading his computer i informed himyour os is xp so youre capped realistically when it comes to ram the system wont recognize it and your programs arent resource heavy for a win machine wmore ram he went over my head and demanded from my super that he has a machine that has gb of ram no he wanted he was on the warpath of obtaining it too even going as high up as the vp of is my supervisor ever so crabby about this told us all to avoid the doctor for a week if possible and said shed handle this she pulled a desktop off the shelf that was already imaged and walked it over to him and installed it for him a week later the doctor sees me and hes overjoyed the new cpu he said its fast really fast since he was nearby it he showed me the specs in the system properties the ram installed was gb he was reading this as he thought my supervisor must have put in a robust gb of ram and the video card was reducing the ram nobody ever told him about what was really under that chassis and he never asked my supervisor for anything computer related as long as i was in hardware support im guessing he finally figured out exactly what happened and his pride prevented him from being angered to note there was a hardware support position that was available where you gotta be a paid mule for the doctors and adminand strong rumor is that the doctor demanded it be created because he wanted someone to build him a computer while he was at home so he could do his work on it i bet he finally got that gb of ram so he could dictate on patients
disclaimer im new to this job so some information might be faulty everything in this post really happened though i work for one of the biggest healthcare software providers in our country i work at the ndrd line service center a few weeks ago we get an email from one of our bigger customers our online client dossier system isnt working please fix our team gets on it as far as i understand it clearing the cache on their server fixed the problem temporarily the following days we get the same call every day we try something new every day but end up clearing the cache again and again until at some point we get a call again we will send over a manager put together a team and lets fix this shizzle once and for all so my colleague whos the escalation manager and in charge of communication with the team and with the customer puts together a headed team mind you these people cost an hour for our customer the manager arrives and they get to work they spend the entire afternoon am pm trying to fix this issue clearing the cache changing settings every time after about minutes the system crashes again at some point more developers join the fun in total these people spent hours on this issue at the end of the day they give up and try one last resort lets just reset the server and guess what the service is working like a charm and no issues ever since when i heard my colleagues story i facepalmed and asked why did they not do this first and thn looked at other solutions he replied in hindsight that may have been a smart move yes we had a good laugh tldr people spent hours to basically turn it off and back on again edit for some faq no the customer did not get charged the full amount they have a service level agreement that says they have a right to a certain amount of service in certain situations yes there is an underlying problem that needs to be solved and that they are looking at now but at least the server seems to be stable now note that the system is hosted on our customers servers not our own the fault most likely lies in their server not in our service though nothing conclusive has come from any of the tests yet most of our customers make use of this service and none of them have experienced any issue like this in the past years no i do not work for epic no im not going to tell you where i do work

started a job at help desk a few years ago i was new so i expected them to have me do something dumb at first to trick me boss calls me in his office he is a bit serious and very business man like can you please order us a left handed keyboard me uhm haha no him uh yeah i need one for another user me yeah im not an idiot im not gonna fall for that one him looks confused i never said you were an idiot and fall for what i just need you to order us one please me hah yeah okay a week goes by my boss calls me in again and is wondering where the key board is i told him im not an idiot there is no such thing as a left handed keyboard he holds up his key board the number pad was on the opposite side it was a fucking left handed keyboard i was embarrassed ordered it and ended up leaving short afterwards edit edited grammar also edited out gender pronouns that reveal my gender because i guess it upsets people since its unnecessary
 way back when i was a l for this soul crushing payday loan corp but whatever i took their money i was helpdesk its aint glamourous and it aint pretty but its a good start i get a call islandlucky helpdesk yah im a customer whut we dont get customer calls ever theres a different number and department for that sort of thing were the people that you call when the stores server goes down when the internet isnt working the few the brave the helpdesk we dont talk to customers iluhh ok cust yah i need to talk to your manager or ceo il may i askwhy custyah i want to talk with them about setting up a new program a program for silver or gold members that dont have to have their cheques vetted il okay thats a great idea but that is never going to happen cust what why the customer is always right il probably your idea is gold but this isnt me you called the tech support line i fix monitors i fix computers i dont do operations or ideas its like asking a car mechanic to do you taxes a favourite simile of mine cust well then i want to speak with your manager il thats never going to happen if i put you through to my boss im going to get yelled at your not a store or an employee your not tech support if i escalated this as a ticket the lady who i assume was nice enough to give you this number is going to get yelled at probably fired youre not supposed to have this number this is for evilcompanystaff tech problems cust oh il if you really like your idea and it seems like an alright idea but again i dont know good ideas from the bad you go back to the store and you ask to speak with the district manager thats a different kettle of fish and they like ideas like yours cust ok ill try that i never got in trouble for that call that idea never came about what i did do was call that same district manager and let them know a csr gave out the helpdesk number i never said which csr or even their store and that maybe the dm should handle this internally 
a couple of weeks ago a friend of mine dual booted windows on his macbook about a week later he called me to say that it was running slowly and even though ive been using linux for the past two years i agreed to take a look at it an inspection revealed quite a bit of adware but nothing serious not wanting to make any modifications without his permission i had the following conversation with him gtme so theres a bunch of adware on your computer but i can clean it up gthim what macs dont get adware spyware or viruses gtme its true that macs are less susceptible to viruses than windows pcs but the fact that you dual booted with windows means gthim cuts me off macs dont get viruses what the hell man i thought you were good with computers the conversation continued in this manner for quite a while when i realised that it was like banging my head against a brick wall i left and returned to the safe world of linux edit fixed an indentation
so i work at a public library as tech support im currently setting up databases and stuff for them because they are mainly paper based but i digress this old guy called the front desk for tech support at around am i had just got in and said that his mouse wasnt working so i went all the way up to the third floor and the guy was on the floor using the mouse on the carpet he didnt understand that you just need to lift the mouse and place it at the centre of the mouse mat to have room to manoeuvre so he just kept going off the desk until he was on the floor i didnt laugh because he was clearly very new to computers but it was pretty hilarious i had to sit down with him for a few minutes to explain how it worked and to help him send an email i found the whole thing pretty heartwarming as cheesy as that sounds
context i work for a manufacturer booking in engineer visits we recently released a product recall and a dedicated phone line to help those customers unfortunately that line is currently at maximum saturation and we have overspill customers calling customer service late in the afternoon during a rather busy spell i get this call gt me good afternoon chargeable repairs how can i help gt customer hello ive pressed the wrong option on the phone because i cant get through to ongoing repairs gt me okay im sorry you cant get through but we dont deal with ongoing calls in this department we deal with paid for repairs so i will have to try and transfer you gt customer thats ridiculous how come the other line is so busy gt me because people who cant get through to the recall line are pressing the wrong option to get through to someone gt customer why are they doing that they shouldnt be doing that gt me isnt that what youve just done gt customer hangs up i get many calls where they say theyve pressed the wrong option but never had someone who thinks its okay for them but not for anyone else 
this tale isnt really about tech support in the computer sense its more about engineering support and a very expensive mistake i hope it fits in this subreddit im sure someone will let me know if it doesnt i work on a ship we travel around the world doing things that a ship does in order to make money for the owner normally we can expect to be at sea for at least a month at a time before calling into a port which is nice actually being out at sea miles from anywhere is quite an experience ive lost track of the number of times ive crossed the equator or circled the globe anyhow one of the bits of kit that we have on board which is very important for the operation of the vessel is the water maker im sure you can imagine fresh water is important at sea for such essential things as drinking showering laundry cooking and of course technical water to keep the engines topped off and other such requirements our water maker is known as a reverse osmosis device it works by using a high pressure pump to force sea water through a membrane with holes in it that are too small for the salt molecules to pass through with enough pressure you get fresh water coming out the other side the problem is these membranes are somewhat expensive for our plant which is quite small at about tonnehour you wouldnt see much change from the membranes are somewhat finicky and never identical either one set will operate at a slightly different pressure to another set and the pressure will vary throughout their lifetime too so you need to vary the pressure in operation to get the right flow rate they also have a very short shelf life so cannot be stored on board waiting to be fitted they must be ordered fresh from the manufacturer my boss the chief engineer is a complete douche canoe to borrow a term from reddit how he got to his position is a complete mystery endless stupid mistakes unable to add up simple numbers and a complete lack of knowledge for his chosen profession it really is a testament to the rest of the crew that we were able to run the ship quite so effectively while he was in charge anyhow one set of these membranes reached the end of their useful working life a new set was ordered arrived on board and was fitted they worked for about a week before the fresh water rate dropped off to near zero douche canoe contacts the office and informs them that the new set of membranes are defective a bit of back and forth with the office and the manufacturer who wont accept them back as theyve been used and the office eventually very relucantly agree to buy a new set of course this new set is now on a rush order so not only has the price gone up but theyre also being flown on a charter plane to meet the ship at the next port were up to over k here this has all happened whilst im off the ship on leave and coincidentally i join the ship at the next port im caught up on the saga of the membranes and i ask the simple question gthave you tried increasing the pressure i bring your attention back to the operating condition of these membranes it changes in service you need to increase the pressure through the service life to keep the fresh water flowing gtdc no why would i do that the old ones worked perfectly well at this pressure along with another crew member i go and look at this plant the pressure hasnt been increased from the previous membranes setting it even states in the manual that the pressure settings will vary between sets of membranes im sure you can see where this is going by now i tweak the pressure knob about half a turn clockwise the pressure rises from to bar and sweet fresh water starts to flow just as the new set of membranes arrives on board so these brand new membranes go on the shelf never to be used after a few months we confirm that theyve gone bad and go in the skip
i worked in a small it company of people which ironically there was techs one which is the boss who thinks he knows all but is a dangerous user at best myself the sucker and for some reason i have never worked out office girls which all did individual jobs as for some reason one person answering the phone doing payroll and making sure invoices are correct and sent out is two difficult for one monkey sorry semi intelligent person to perform ampnbsp i should also mention we are in a very small town of people max and live about an hour from a town of any decent size and shops with equipment when needed ampnbsp lets start this fun story ampnbsp it had been a quite week and i had been able to catch up on all my paperwork couriers had been and had got the last few jobs out the door and was looking at the clock imagining all the things the weekend might hold when i was interrupted by the boss ampnbsp boss i need you to pop over to our biggest customers location and run a few network cables and when you have finished you can start your weekend ampnbsp early finish on a friday before a lovely sunny weekend this is gonna be awesome but then my logical side of my brain kicks in ahh crap whats the catch or what have i not been told about ampnbsp me sure thing i will just grab my tools and head over do i need to take anything with me cables etc boss no no they have everything txt us when your done and see you monday me so with a hop in my step and a grin on my face out the door i go for a i thought simple job before relaxing weekend ampnbsp should be about here you can all see a ahh crap moment coming ampnbsp so i arrive at customers location all of k down the road sign in and make my way to owner ampnbsp me i hear you have some network cables to run and you have everything owner yes well are you going to do the other things as well or just run the cables ampnbsp at this point the hop in my step had gone and a very bad sinking feeling was in the pit of my stomach ampnbsp me what other things hoping for a very simple answer owner well you know how we asked you last year how we want to expand our business and build a new building ampnbsp i now felt sick inside and could start seeing this as not a simple job ampnbsp me well yes i heard it mentioned but nothing since owner oohh really we have been discussing this with your boss since then and we have built the new building and want the new server installed new work stations phone system network etc all connected installed and working for monday when we have our grand opening and he said you can do this weekend ampnbsp im sure at this point my heart had stopped and i was standing there with the deer in headlights look on my face ampnbsp me can you say that again im just a bit confused as to what you mean how do you say you have been discussing this for a year this is first ive heard about it this is not a simple hour job in one weekend to get done but a few weeks or months of planning setting up pcs configuring server etc etc ampnbsp at this stage i could see the owner confused and a bit worried ampnbsp owner hang on so your telling me you have not been involved in any of this and have no clue your boss has been emailing us with the last email at am this morning saying youre all set and will be done by sunday night so we can test before we reopen for business monday morning here look at the emails ampnbsp im sure at this point a part of me died inside i know if you were to check my blood pressure it would kill the machine ampnbsp me i quickly read the months of email and sure enough there are questions in there and replies of yes i asked sucker me and he says nothing needs be done before weekend and he has no issues doing in two days ampnbsp for those of you who have done this you can imagine the amount of work to get this up and going those who havent imagine running cables terminating to hours setting up server hours to install and configure setting up work stations hours each thing you can see where this is going ampnbsp me may i use your phone i just need to call boss and get him to come down owner you ok you dont look to happy me im not sure have known the owner for years and am on first name basis but could tell she was worried me boss the simple network job you told me about is nothing to what the emails you have been talking to them about boss they mentioned expanding building and they would arrange the hardware and we just go down and set it up i dont see the issue should only take you a day to plug everything in me most polite language and tone i could manage can you please get yourself down here now and discuss this with us ampnbsp mins pass and boss walks in with coffee in hand and not a care in the world ampnbsp me so i came here to install network cables as per your request at lunch and arrived here to find a completely different job is required and that you knew about this for a year and signed off on me doing it at am this morning boss ahh is that this weekend yes well it shouldnt take you long to connect the computers and get everything up and going at this point i was trying to think if murder or manslaughter would be a lighter sentence than this hell hole hes landed me in me you have know about this been in discussion with them for months and have told them what machines to order and what they need and have said you asked me and i agreed with the selection of equipment boss yes well everything i told them to get you have sold to home users and they are reliable and havent had issues ampnbsp whos alarms are going off at this stage ampnbsp me yes to home users single pc who check email surf the net not in a work environment boss does that matter me well i bet you got the stock standard machines please say he changed the os boss yes i just used the previous order and got of the computers me well did you atleast change from windows xp home to professional for the operating system boss no i told the supplier that we didnt need os and we would just use a licence from one of the pcs already here ampnbsp now im thinking murder is the best choice ever ampnbsp me do you know how illegal that is and the issues it would cause for them on so many levels and for us when microsoft ever did spot inspection boss well i did it to there office home and student and installed on all the pcs and just rang microsoft to activate when the automated activation failed me so you installed a home version not designed for business in any form on plus computers using the same licence key boss yes me to owner how much did he charge you she had worried look on face owner he charged us while looking at invoice when he had only supplied one key for a version that couldnt be used legally in a business me well owner there needs to be a huge change and unfortunately i do not think i can do this for you in the time frame i have been given with the equipment i have been given boss i dont see what the issue is you do what i tell you and i want you to do it now me well if that is your stand i dont think i want to work for you any more especially with the illegal activity you are doing and putting my name on it without my knowledge but still gives me the same issue with microsoft for any legal lawsuits and i will not stand or be thrown under the buss for you i quit boss standing in silence looks at owner i will do your computers this weekend for you and get you working ampnbsp owner who had been standing there watching all this unfold realising how screwed over they have been and all the good money they paid out for the illegal work to be carried out speaks up ampnbsp owner boss you are to leave here give us all your information software and any confidential documents you have your services to our company are now terminated and you will be hearing from our lawyers boss shocked look on face about to scream at me for causing a huge loss to him ampnbsp im there listening to this all unfold packing up my gear ampnbsp owner to me now that you dont work for dumbass boss we still need all this done and all the other issues in our system done to get us legal do you want a job ampnbsp needless to say i spent the next few months getting the new gear installed all there illegal software removed which ended up in reloading every pc they had as both windows and office was the same licence on each machine and getting them all running ampnbsp and that is how i started a true reliable computer support business that i am not ashamed to say i work for i should also mention a fun fact if you are to try activate the same licence key for the same product way too many times microsoft system flags it and you get a site audit done in my time that i rebuilt the whole system from scratch i registered company with the volume licence program microsoft supplies microsoft came and did their audit and explained what the situation was and why they had the flag and who to go see which i know for a fact they did and it ended in a huge lawsuit which my former company lost for obvious reasons sometimes things happen for a reason and that friday was a very good day now i look back on it hope you all enjoyed ampnbsp edit for all those who notice the bad writting grammer etc please read the following ampnbsp i was when i could read without sounding out the words and writing started about the same time without doing one letter at a time i was born with some issues and had speech impediments and dyslexic so learning how to read and write was a mission and i didnt have anyone who was able to teach me i am trying to get better but obviously whats in my head that makes sense dosnt on paper so i will focus better on future posts and do better for you guys

new hip itdevdepartment we have quite a big office in one of the old warehouses imagine it like a hip tech startup office we got a slide fitness equipment gaming couche mostly for smash pullup bars in the elevator for a future story there are also a couple of big k monitors mounted on in the wall in a wide x high setup this displays a map with all the retail locations on it where you can see some basic info like if the main and backup connections are working if there has been a error with one of the pin terminals or cash registers if the local database is in sync with the main server how many wifibluetooth devices are in the store i have no idea how these beacons exactly work we just use that info because it looks cool the local setup in the stores is as followed you have the cash registers which communicate with a local server which synchronizes all the purchases with the main server this is done because if a location lost connection to the main server all the cash registers couldnt be used anymore now the local server just keeps track of the transactions and syncs it when to location comes back online later the software running on the cash registers is not made by use and all the cash registers are not managed by us this is done by the company who makes the cash register software in this lovely scenario the cash register software needs its own cash register server which all it does is acts as a translator between their own protocol and the database cashregistersoftwarecompany informs us that they are going to push a update to us on the th of march annoyingly this new version has some dependencies on packages on the server that are not available for this version of the distro the best point would be to resetup all the servers however due to time constraints its decided that we are going to do a distro update sadly when testing the distro update on one of the test machines same image we notice that it hangs on certain parts of the distro update so i was tasked with writing a script which would fix all these issues it hangs on i was making some good progress when i push the latest version of the script to our git system it clearly has in the description of the branch that the script is not finished not working and should not be used yet then i left for holiday after enjoying my holiday for days my phone starts blowing up warning location a has closed the vpn connection and hasnt reconnected warning location a is not responding on the main connection warning location a is not responding on the backup connection warning location a hasnt checked in for a sync in min i start getting these messages from about locations my phone is lagging like crazy then i get a panic call telling me that all the local servers are offline and in about hour its going to be the busiest moment in all the stores for the week my coworkers are panicking about the potential loss of profit and im somewhere on top of a mountain wearing full ski gear to make things worse the it department is running on a skeleton crew because most of us are away for the holiday the first thing i ask if that its maybe a issue with our status system or the connection in our office they do not know and will call me back in the meantime im skiing down the mountain like a maniac who wants to test if he can break the world record on skies i jump in my car and rush to the hotel as fast as possible when im almost there i get scared by a bright flash i got flashed by a speed cameraspeed cameras in my home country dont flash anymore im pretty sure this is going to be a lovely picture when i finally make it to my hotel i grab my macbook and run to the hotel lobbyonly place to get wifi i log in and try to ssh into any of the local servers but all of them accept the connection but they they cant get past the login its just hanging on a black screen i try to access the status page of the beacons where i get a page that returns null in that moment it dawned on me all the servers were stuck somewhere in cognito someone ran the distro update at this point i get called back by a somewhat less stressed coworker this coworker told me that all the cash registers are still working fine but all the servers are still not working i tell him i suspect that someone ran the distro update my coworker added our contact at cashregistersoftwarecompany to our phone call our contact person told us that they had some time left and decided to force push a update to all our devices running software from cashregistersoftwarecompany we tell them they broke all the local servers and our contact at cashregistersoftwarecompany started to worry so he added a tech from cashregistersoftwarecompany that pushed the update to all our machines this tech told us that it could in no way be the fault of cashregistersoftwarecompany because they followed all the instructions they even ran the latest version of my script to run the distro update at this point im getting really pissed i ask him if he even read what the title of the repo said cashregistersoftwarecompany tech said that he got the script from his boss so cashregistersoftwarecompany techs boss gets added to the conference call all he says it that its not his fault and we should have made sure our script worked before they ran the update which was planned for the th of march and he hangs up at this point cashregistersoftwarecompany is pointing the blame at us and are saying they cant do anything about it anymore followed by them hanging up the phone we were lucky that the all the stores were still working locally it only major inconvenience for our customers was that the stores could not check the stock on other locations and they could only swap or get a refund at the location they bought it at at this point another coworker noticed that the server are still checking for new promo media this is being displayed in store on the tvs or discounts that are being broadcasted on the audio system this runs twice every day before store opening and closing lukly the way its setup is that all the new promo media that gets downloaded is being placed in a bash script that gets run so we start working on trying to finish the update script at this point a lot of other people start getting back at the hotel and the internet connections start randomly losing the connection closing my vpn and vnc sessions so i decide to continue to work using my hotspot on my work phone the way mobile providers work in europe is that as soon as you leave your home country you start roaming and roaming is expensive as hell cent mb so after about an hour my g connection drops i receive i reached the european safeguard of euro data roaming bill and in order to continue data roaming i need to login into my telcobussnisssite and flip the switch the only people with access to telcobussnisssite are on the billing department and all of them are already gone to home the hotel wifi has died and is unusable under all the children watching reaction videos and vlogs on youtube i know that bottom and the top of the mountain there is pritty good wifi so i drive back there wifi is working good there but in order to keep my car warm i need to keep the engine running and after about an hour a cop shows up at my car asking what the hell im doing in my best german i try to explain that im using the wifi but my german is probably way too bad for him to understand it i try to explain it in english but he doesnt understand a word im saying fortunately his colleague was speaking good english and he and his colleague were laughing at my when he was explaining his colleague in german so after about another hour the script seems to work on our test setup so i whent back for the hotel while my colleague back at the office was replacing the media update script with this hacking barely functioning script the next day i get out of bed early in my pyjamas i go to the hotel lobby opened my laptop order some overpriced coffee and waited staring at the web version of our status wall after about min after the media updater supposedly had been download the first location comes back online followed by all other locations where the last location came back online after about hours there is a big meeting scheduled with cashregistersoftwarecompany about canceling our service with them sorry for some grammer errors english is not my native language 
so a few years back ish my sister decided that she wanted a dvdrom drive in her computer so she went and bought one and installed it herself then i get the call sis hey i bought a dvd drive for my pc ive got it installed but i cant read any discs with it me in my head you installed it um ok tell me what you did she proceeds to tell me how she disconnected the old cdrom and reconnected the new dvdrom and was having trouble since then i get this sis i see in the instructions it says something about jumper settings do you think that could be it me mayyybeee take the drive out and tell me what the jumper settings are per the instructions sis well it looks like theyre in the right position what the manual says is ma me blown away at this point since she properly connected an ide cable move the jumper to sl and see if it works couple of minutes later she tells me it works now shag me with a pitchfork my techilliterate sister installed a new optical drive and the only thing she got wrong was not setting the maslcs jumpers correctly she actually read the fucking manual edit some background info she took advantage of a program where she works whereby employees can receive training in a subject that can be applied in the office she ended up taking an introduction to computers maintenance and repair she and her husband are very money conscious having raised a large family and thus when they could fix something themselves they would this is the one sister who never calls for tech help the rest of my siblings are no better than simple when it comes to tech now stop asking if shes single you sad desperate users 
disclaimer sadly im unfamiliar with how the company to store process takes place or who are the people my boss talks on the phone with but the most notorious being mrred again forgive me if im making mistakes regarding who is my boss contacting amd i love them and this shows how this person was completely in no way someone capable of representing them remember how i mention a while ago that my boss doesnt get along with an amd sales representative i only met them once but mrred doesnt seem like the best kind of person in a couple of occasions the processor shipment has gotten damaged on the way and mrred certainly wasnt the kindest person all arround but he got the job done until we got the parts shipment today in the morning quick before signing my coworker verified the contents of the shipment they had sent us the wrong shipment not the series we have to get back in stock my boss pick up the phone and head to his desk picking up the phone and calling amds office or similar to complain about the error again he put the loudspeaker since the store was empty and as usual my boss set up the call recorder gtmrred hello mister elboss how may i attend you today gtelboss red the shipment you send its not correct you send me again the wrong oder gtmrred thats not possible i place the right shipments where they are supposed to go gtelboss red this is the third time this happens since you got in charge of this state whats going on you know what let me talk to your boss gtmrred it wont be necessary ill just send the right one after you bring me back the shipment i sent gtelboss que no the conversation got heated and a minute later gtelboss just get me tu boss gtmrred you know what you can go yourself madref i do my job our jaws dropped including a client that just came in there was an awkward silence then we heard mrred hang up the phone minutes later we got another call loudspeaker on gtredlady good evening mr eljefe we are from amd we deeply apologize for everything that redguy caused he is no longer working with us were assigning someone new soon to your distribution zone they were taking for a while all relaxed and nice hurray good tldr mrred almost make us go green
hi tfts my tale begins with a small law firm that we found had a dead hdd in their server as we all know hdds die sometimes and this is why we use raid we go ahead and purchase a new one for them and go install it it begins rebuilding the raid and seeing that it will take several hours i head back to my office to monitor it remotely after about mins i notice the server go offline i think to myself that cant be good and give them a call the receptionist answers and the following occurs me me r receptionist gtme hi i was just in doing some work on your server but it appears to be offline can you please check that the status lights on the front of it for me gtr it is off it was making too much noise so i powered it down moment of stunned silence gtme you turned it off gtr yes we cant have it making too much noise in the office we have clients here gtme and you did not think to call me to let me know it was making lots of noise so that i could fix it never mind i am coming over now so i quickly ilo into the server to see if i can get it back online before i head over and i see that it is not detecting a hdd i grabbed my kit and went on site after a quick inspections my fears were confirmed the raid was dead they were down for a whole day after that while re rebuilt their raid and recovered from backup the worst part is that the receptionist tried to blame it on us i still dont know ifwhy the server was making more noise and will all the logs gone there is no way for me to find out tldr receptionist hard shut down the server while the raid was rebuilding because it was making too much noise killed the raid addendum to eliminate any confusion as to why she could get into the server room i will clarify she was the staff member who was selected by the boss there to change the backup tapes because of this she had keys to the server room
monday morning finally arrived i slightly congratulated myself that i managed to get through the entire weekend without wasting a single further thought on angie with no letup in the weather the early shift seemed to be of little comfort with the snow beating down as hard as it could i was however brandishing a new set of gloves and a can of ice dissolving fluid surprisingly the day went off without a hitch the snowy weather had landed most of the team off with colds and notably angie hadnt made it in myself and mafg managed to pile through a bunch of tickets when balding head of it came in he asked me if i could attend a meeting later which i obliged fairly sure this was the meeting i began to mentally prepare my defense i was again pleasantly surprised that this meeting was not one in which my ass would be summarily served but rather a meeting of several heads brandishing a new project it seemed that there was to be a conference in the not too distant future and the marketing sales and product reps had worked hard to secure a vendor for a new medical crm product to replace the aging creaky filemaker based system they also wanted to work in a complete laptop refresher programme replacing any laptop over years old bhit made particular mention of a desktop rollout i performed last year it was actually my initial months contract but as id proven myself worthy was taken on full time my job was to be responsible for managing the physical delivery of the new hardwaresoftware as appropriate i set to work on the task with glee querying active directory for a list of machines users and specs one thing i always made sure of was to carry on my predecessors good work in maintaining a superclean active directory a place for everything and everything in its place every audit we had although occasionally revealing some discrepancies everything was up to date and reports were reliable after collating my results i determined that odd laptops would require replacement and approximately builds would need to go on across three different hardware types two already in use in the field and could continue and one for the new laptop specs as soon as i could get the final signed off software from the vendor i could go about getting images prepared qad and rope in some of my friendlier reps to pilot the new builds before the big day my analysis done and sent to bhit i wrapped up for the day all thoughts of that coffee swilling stick insect were thoroughly out of mind my smile was demolished tuesday morning angie had made it in and was busy setting about the task of undoing anything that looked like progress the instant i appeared she demanded my attention in the dungeon sure enough this was it she now required a full explanation as to my actions the previous friday i say explanation after my defense of our security access to the it cupboard had been withdrawn was thrown straight back at me for failing to understand proper protocol she just ripped into yet another starbucks lattefueled tirade about leaving a vip high and dry for an hour while i blithered about she then also ripped me a new one asking what i was doing taking apart a pc in the middle of the office it seemed that some of the fat finance wenches had ratted me out as well and claimed id caused such a loud commotion they were prevented from working i wonder if its the same finance hag that is in her coffee group this dressing down seemed to last forever and it did this was a good minuter dressing down fully received i decided to retaliate once more i mailed our bhit and ccd the rest of support questioning why we were no longer permitted access to the it cupboard for equipment where we should go if angie is not around to give her approval to retrieve gear from the cupboard and most importantly where are we supposed to work on machines or hardware these were things which worked perfectly fine a few weeks ago were now suddenly were not fine the reply from bhit was as usual fairly impotent and full of noncommittal statements his response that he was unaware the it cupboard was being used as a build area for hardware came as a shock to us all particularly as he was the one who got the ghost server off the rd line team in the first place he concluded by requesting that we should seek clarification of suitable build areas from our manager angie i could see we were going to get nowhere on this path the water deepened i held my breath cited odd tickets in my queue which would require extensive dismantling and imaging time none of which could occur at my desk and none of which could even happen as the build server with all our images had been thrown in a riser room which of course none of us could now access anymore added to that with the conference project looming exactly where were we meant to image these machines and how would i be able to access our build server for the task at hand my nightly whatsalive script reporting it as the only machine missing in action as a demonstration of the extent of his ineptitude instead of formulating a reply he simply replied to all and inserted angies email at the top with the words angie can you please direct jon appropriately thanks you can guess the next conversation what conference is this and what makes you think you have anything to do with it angie demanded as bhit had truly dumped me in it i had to relay all about my task for the conference she would find out anyway the train was in motion of course this was now something new she could micromanage to the nth degree but not without a scolding first she first demanded to know why she was never informed i responded bhit had been present in the meeting too given my handling of the xp rollout and desktop replacement project last year this is why bhit and several heads asked for me by name that said as its a major project i find it difficult to believe that you were not in the loop with this one already whoa saucer of milk meeting room could it be score to jon in reality i already knew that angie was already plotting if i was a betting man id have said the plan was already made in her mind she was too sharp to not have planned all the fine details already all she needed was the time to put it into effect what the plan was i have no idea only the future will tell but i did know at that moment that this process wont go well it will either be mired in micromanagementism or i just wont do it at all so i managed to get my digs in that one time but i now have a fight on my hands on the one hand ive made enough of an impression by some heads to have been asked for by name to drive this forward on the other hand i had the bitch manager from hell bent on thrusting her dagger of incompetence into the beating heart of anything resembling efficiency and there was still no response about where hardwarebuilds should be taking place one thing i was sure of if were going to play this game let the games begin previous 
this happened a year ago right after i started my job at big nameless corporate hospital i am one of the sysadmins but i am basically the goto girl for random tasks such as web development no one else in the it department knows how build a website or write code so it defaults to me normally i work to support our users and our clients but in this situation i was the client trying to purchase software from a vendor my boss had given me the task of upgrading the design of our intranet website the website allows all the doctors and nurses to log in and view their departmental policies and other workrelated information but it is very basic my boss decided that we would contract externally with a vendor to set up a company wide pto calendar because he did not want me wasting man hours coding a pto calendar when we could just buy one i set up a meeting with the vendor and booked a nice conference room so that we could hook up our laptops i had to fight with one of the nurses over which conference room i was allowed to use but i was victorious the day of the meeting rolled around and i headed to the conference room early to set up i turned on one of our ancient projectors and went to make a pot of coffee in the lobby while the projector warmed up it was unseasonably warm so i took some time to appreciate how god awful hot it was outside while i waited for the vendor and my boss to show a knock on the lobby door signaled the early arrival of the vendor i opened the door to greet him and to my surprise he pushed me aside and sat down in the lobby the vendor was an older gentleman grey haired and in his s a typical southern gentleman so i figured that he just didnt notice me and i walked over to introduce myself hello my name is tinyneko and i am the sweetie would you fetch me a cup of coffee excuse me would you mind grabbing me a cup of coffee im waiting for the web developer to show up for our meeting its at pm absolutely but i am shhhhh i wont be able to hear him arriving if you arent quiet just be a dear and fetch me the coffee i didnt know what to say but i decided to just remain quiet and fetch the coffee there are certain battles that we pick in life and i wasnt in the mood to fight i had made the coffee for the meeting so why not just give him a cup of coffee i poured him a cup of coffee and handed it to him do you have any sugar who drinks coffee without sugar i didnt respond verbally but i nodded and went to fetch the vendor some sugar from the cafeteria when i got back the vendor was missing and the door to the conference room was closed i figured he had gone to the restroom so i sat down and waited for him to return fifteen minutes passed and it was pm no sign of the vendor or my boss i send my boss an email from my phone asking where he is another fifteen minutes pass and its now pm im pissed off and the vendor is no where to be found my phone beeps and its a message from my boss saying that both he and the vendor are already in the conference room i knock on the conference room door and the vendor and my boss are standing around chatting tinyneko where have you been we were waiting for you steve have you met our web developer tinyneko well i was setting up for the meeting but then i was informed that the vendor was waiting for the web developer to arrive since im obviously not the web developer i was locked out of the conference room silly me it wouldnt have happened if i just had the coffee supplies prepared my boss was confused for a moment but i watched as he understood his web developer who was stretched so thin on man hours that we have to contract externally was told to get coffee and an hour of her work hours wasted his demeanor turned icy and he told the vendor that we would have to reschedule if you cant guess how this ends we never signed the contract and i ended up writing the pto calendar anyway
first post in the sub here goes nothing im a specialized sysadmin at a medical school at the time of this story weve recently switched to a new website for online learning the old one is in the last stages of its use for the current semester but despite our best efforts professors seem to ignore every memoannouncementemailbroadcast informing them of the move i get this call gt prof i cant see any of my courses for next semester on the site gt me are you looking on the new website at new site gt prof yes im on there grading students right now i groan inwardly knowing that students arent on the new site yet gt me thats the old one please go to new site gt prof i just told you im already there gt me what does your browser show in the address bar gt prof old site gt me then youre on the old site you have to go to new site for future semesters gt prof why wasnt i told gt me its been communicated many times through announcements on old site gt prof oh i dont read those gt me there have also been emails to all faculty about it from several different departments gt prof you cant just assume that i pay attention to all my emails you should have called she didnt understand why we couldnt possibly call every single professor and inform them of the change this happened several times over the next few weeks to reiterate i work at a medical school these are the people training our future doctors do they just ignore their patients charts too edit formatting
i work for a small software developer as a female system support technician ive worked here for about months but i have many years support experience in various fields the call which i am about to record took place this morning gtme smallsoftwaredeveloper this is vedagock speaking how may i help you gtmanlydude hi vedagock this is manlydude from itcompany one of our customers is reporting a problem with your software and i would like to speak to malecolleague gtme unfortunately malecolleague has gone back to school and only works mondays now i am his replacement though may i help you instead gtmanlydude hmm no can i talk to a man instead gtis this guy for real please let this be a misunderstanding gtme excuse me i am unfortunately the only support staff available at the moment please tell me what the issue is and i will take a look at it gtmanlydude just have one of your male colleagues call me when theyre available ok gtwhat the actual shit i cant even i proceeded to take his name and number and leave a note for one of my colleagues to call him i wish i could have thought of something smart to say but i am still in shock this is the first time in all my support years that this has ever happened to me and i needed to vent i just really hope that this guy doesnt have any female colleagues edit formatting also the reason is hopefully not porn our software is installed on servers in the healthcare sector manlyguy being hired for the day to day it operations would have way bigger problems than me being nonmale if porn was the case
about a decade ago i worked on the supportside of things in the medical software field one saturday morning my phone started ringing at the ungodly hour of am it was my boss and he stayed on the line just long enough to say these seven magical words data corruption outdated backups get here now oncall for disaster recovery was something i frequently helped out with so i cruised on in to the office only to find that it was no ordinary data restorerebuild job my entire group had been called away from their weekend plans as the hospital in question was one of the largest hospitals we supported hospital somehow the header structure for every single active patient account had been completely corrupted over accounts and this had a wonderful cascadeofcorruption down into the lowerlevel structures as well just to make things simpler for us their most recent backups were almost sixteen hours out of date way too old for us to just restore everything from hospital was completely unable to load any of the corrupted accounts with doctors amp nurses having to rely on handwritten paper files for everything cue many frantic profanityfilled and desperationfueled hours of us restoring patient information from the outdated backups then manually rebuilding as much of the missing information as we can from various other sourcesindexesanything we could find dozens of new build data x off of indexes y and z scripts were created that day some of which are actually still in use to this day closing on a full hours after the corruption initially hit and we finally have hospital back up and running with almost all of the patient data rebuilt data integrity routines are now coming up clean but we still have no idea what in the name of dread cthulhu caused the corruption in the first place hardware guys are reporting every diagnostic tool they have is showing perfect disk health so its probably not their fault all of our attempts to reproduce the corruption in any way possible have come up empty so its probably not our fault either were completely stumped tired and just want to go home and salvage whats left of our weekend at this point so we leave various traponaccountdatawrite scripts running and tell hospital that well carefully monitor them over the rest of the weekend but cant do a proper review until regular staff is back in during normal business hours we all head home at this point and i spend a while decompressing with my good friend johnnie walker before calling it a night cue the next morning and im suddenly blasted awake by my phone ringing yet again at am the seven magic words my boss utters this time are holy shit it happened again were doomed so nursing a lovely hangover and muttering threats of death against both bright lights and loud noises i head in yet again thankfully the backups this time were only about an hour old and wed already written all of the needed datarebuild scripts less than a day ago the restore and rebuild goes much quicker this time hindered only by the fact that hospital is quite literally screaming at us threatening lawsuits re patient care and safety etc anything involving lawyers was and thankfully still is outside my pay grade so company executives on our end are being summoned away from their sunday golf brunch or whatever it is they do on weekends and have started arriving in the office purplefaced with rage meanwhile we lowly programmers have been given explicit orders to figure out what in the seven hells is going on and this time nobody gets to go home until we have a cause found and solution in place theres just one catch none of our traponwrite code is showing data writes from our end hardware is still reporting allgreen so were just as stumped as before except now we have angry executives breathing down our necks at this point six hours into day two of corruption hell i noticed a pair of tickets from hospital sitting out there with several requests for updates of course one for saturday and one for sunday both saying hey we havent had the daily charges files post for our accounts today wed just been ignoring them as there was a minor apocalypse taking our attention but suddenly the lowwatt light bulb over my head finally clicked on hospital didnt just use my companys software they also used othervendor to compile a daily file of recurring charges for active accounts which would then be posted to our system via an interface my company provides an interface that othervendors programmers were notorious for complaining about saying it was too slow i run a quick check and sure enough the othervendorgtus daily active account charges files exist all the way up until friday morning there are no files for saturday and sunday daily charge files from othervendor would be filed to every active account check time the files are scheduled to post to our system am this was more than enough evidence for us to completely turn off the interface plus blacklist othervendors machines from connecting to our data servers at all monday morning rolls around and all is quiet no am emergency call bliss i hear my boss give our othervendor counterparts a call later that morning and this was the point at which the dinosaursized shit truly hit the industrialscale fan he speaks to them calmly for a few minutes then puts them on hold makes a second call and sits there barely more than a minute later three of our execs arrive at a dead sprint close his office door take othervendor off hold and the volume of the call rapidly increases until they couldve woken the dead it took a few days for everything to completely shake out most of which i wasnt directly involved in because company lawyers were it turned out that a programmer at othercompany with extreme delusions of grandeur decided our interface was just too slow and came up with their own code to try and write their data directly to our data structures our encrypted data structures the structures they explicitly can only interact with via our interface and if all of this werent already bad enough he actually sent his code directly from othervendors inhouse system to the hospitals production environment because it worked fine on his system when he was using a completely different data model shockingly enough othervendor programmer was immediately terminated possibly literally as nobody i know heard of him again there was a quite successful lawsuit by hospital against othervendor and i took myself off the disaster recovery oncall list as quickly as i could
while working in it in iraq in i was taken hostage see iama while i was a hostage one of the militia came in and asked if i could sort out his commanders laptop as it was running slow and he could not install the cracked game he had just purchased from the market not feeling in a particularly helpful frame of mind what with being chained up and fearing death and all that i spent a few minutes looking over it and concluded that i could not help about minutes later the guy returned and asked if i could try again as his commander was giving him some verbal over it i spent the next hour uninstalling adware and stopping programs from running when windows booted and did a general cleanup also managed to get his cracked copy of medal of honour working which seemed to make everyone happier feeling somewhat pleased with my achievements in what only can be described as extreme circumstances i returned the laptop the commander left and his subordinate came in to see me he smacked me over the head with a pistol causing my head to bleed explaining that next time he asked me to do something i was to do it the first time around years months and day later or days i got released never had a bad day at the office since

several years ago i was helping a client set up and install new workstations as the old ones were obsolete and in dire need of an upgrade it was my very first job and i was expected to answer basic support questions when i met with the user and swapped out their old pc for a brand spanking new one i was in the middle of hooking up the monitor when another user approached me regarding an odd email he and his coworkers had received only minutes ago this is pretty much what it looked like gtimportant gtplease do not shut down your computer today as it will not boot back up again if you do gt it it so happened to be april and neither i or my coworkers had heard anything about this since there was very little information in the email everyone naturally thought it was a joke but then people around us started to yell how their computers actually would not boot oops turns out the antivirus software had received an update over the night which caused it to flag some system files as malicious and then removed them it was fixed later the same day but i cant help but feel that more workstations could have been saved if they had only been more informative or bothered to write this is not a joke somewhere in the initial email
this was a fun one an exclient of ours we ended up firing them as a client is a health center that was very difficult to deal with for several reasons most of which had to deal with failure to comply to our requests and challenging most every decision we made for their companys it needs constant fighting over money did not help either one of the requests that was made by our customer was to provide them with a free printer for signing a contract with my company we felt that the business that we would gain from a contract would be worth the expense of a new printer for their office so we complied we were told that it would need to be color and have the ability to fax and copy we ended up purchasing a midrange hp laserjet allinone printer for their office and i was tasked with going onsite to set it up upon arrival and showing our customer the printer i was scolded and informed that was not what they asked for wait what they specifically asked for a color printer that could make copies and send faxes this was exactly that how could it be so wrong what our customer was expecting was a professional corporate copier such as a ricoh mp c this would be the first of many miscommunications with this customer but i learned from an early stage that sometimes it is absolutely necessary to say no to customers and to explain why a free copier was not going to happen edit a word
so another story from my recently last workplace this was when i was on leave for studies and i had agreed to come in and help during weekends for some extra cash customer majorisp had a planned power outtage for rebuilding their power mains during a weekend being a data and comms center they of course had two separate power sources with ups so work was being done one side at a time i told my supervisor that id be glad to help but that id need some prep work with insuring that all servers we were entrusted with were connected to power outlets on the b side got a mail from my coworker saying that everything was prepped and fine come work night i arrive head up to the office take a quick look around and see that all our servers are indeed connected up to b side i grab a coffee and wait for the other departments and the electricians when they arrive we make a check list for the activities and the electricians are let into the mains room while i stay up in the noc with the other two department techs about minutes after work start we hear an omnious wooooooooouuuuuffffhhhhh turning into silence from inside the server room we rush to the door only to find that the card reader is dead it apparently ran on a side power luckily someone had physical keys to the door so we could get in anyway inside i find to my relief that only one half rack of my servers are down due to a mislabeled outlet however the other techs seem to have failed prep work so pretty much all the core switches and routers are down a sudden gut feeling tells me to look on twitter yup soccer night customers cable boxes are down rage ensuing we try to get a hold of the electricians but there is no answer about two or three attempted calls later the door to the noc room opens and two rather heavy set police officers enter and start asking us for ids and what the hell we think were doing turns out since the isp offers phone subscriptions through their cable boxes this was classed as disruption of vital comminuty services given that nobody could now dial emergency lines we explain whats going on and the officers demand to take us down to the electricians when we arrive we find that a the door to the mains room is locked with a card reader that runs on a side power and they didnt have keys b theres no phone reception in the basement c the electricians had forgotten some tools needed for the work in their truck and once they had cut power and started splicing the cables they had no way to connect it back letting them out to get their tools power was back up within ten minutes since my servers had survived the ordeal i could go home but i found out some days later that the other techs had spent four hours getting all the customers cable boxes to sync up i guess what i learned and hopefully them too is that prep work is vital tldr customer does power outtage brings down vital community services police arrives edit wow top of the page thanks guys 
last week i went to my boss whose last name is dotson to ask for a small raise basically what i was asking was for my yearly raise just early about months before annual reviews my company never gives raises but my wife and i needed to make a little extra to make ends meet so i thought it wouldnt hurt to ask in the meeting my boss was very gracious but basically said im sorry but we might not be even be able to give raises at all this year to which i basically said thanks anyway on the way out in a stroke of sheer brilliance i stuck my head back in his office and said just dont get cheap on me dotson that was hammonds mistake i have never seen him laugh that hard he then told me hed see what he could do about a raise apparently the cfo who my boss reports to is a huge jurassic park fan like he has signed scripts autographed posters etc i had no idea but he thought that was great and was slightly upset he hadnt made some sort of dodgson reference earlier in the past week ive overheard him say dotson we have dotson over here times anyways i was given a raise and i have lunch with the cfo next week i work in it but i understand this is a fairly generic story hopefully this fits in the unsolvable problems cracked by sheer genius category
ok this story happened a few years back im a sysadmin for a big german company my wife who is a tech illiterate is working for a tour operator and has to do product presentations in her customers offices quite often one day after one of these presentations she tells me that she thinks something is wrong with her laptop frequent bluescreens slower than usual etc gtwifedo you think this could be a virus gtme hm hard to say could be possible but since i dont have any administrative rights on your laptop theres not much i can do go to your admin next thing tomorrow and let him take care of it next day in the office i receive a call gtwife honey i went to ltadmingt just like you said and he said that it is most probably a virus but im not sure about one detail he mentioned gtme ok what is it gtwife he said since i never was online in the customers network and out network is secured i might have caught the infection over the vga connection to the projector is that even possible gtme sweetie ill put you on speaker could you please repeat what he was saying my colleagues have to hear this since that time im sure as long as guys like ltadmingt exist i will be able to find a job
at the time i was a project manager in the it department for one of the most prestigious medical school and hospital in the world we were in the middle of an month project commonly known as the project from hell by everyone in the department if you are familiar with the health care world you are aware of seriously they take privacy and encryption the scope of the project was encrypt and install central management on cell phones tablets laptops and desktops that belonged to students doctors researchers etc and they were also scattered across several locations around the city i was given temporary techs to complete this daunting tasks of the were constantly unmotivated calling out sick and at times prolonging on the project on purpose because they knew once the project was over they would be out of work however one tech lets call him paul had an amazing work ethic and was a natural leader of the group he would double even triple the daily quota on a regular basis so when he did not show up to work one day unannounced i knew something was wrong we later found out he had a medical emergency but would be back in the office in a week or two i welcomed paul back and asked if he was okay he talked about his emergency with little detail and made it seem like it was nothing more severe than a common cold it was only a few weeks later that i found out from his direct supervisor that he was placed in the hospital after a heart complication due to him not taking his medication i decided to take him out to lunch so i could speak to him on a more personal level and during that lunch he saw me as a friend which i already considered him to be and opened up about how he cant afford his medication or to go to the doctor while dealing with several health issues all relating to his heart because not only does he not have health care but is also supporting his sisters kids the kids father was no where to be found and his sister was in and out of rehab so the kids were left to him wow i can never complain about my struggles ever again fast forward a month later it is time to encrypt a high profile doctors iphone so of course i send paul our best technician from what i heard from paul later this doctor was a usual he did not understand why we needed to encrypt the phone why we need to install central management and why we needed to spy on him although i was not there we did not get any complaints so i am sure paul handled the situation with great customer service as he usually does fast forward weeks that very same doctor loses his phone in the back of a taxi calls it we were able to wipe the phone within minutes by the way when patient data is compromised the organization can be fined million dollars per patient and the doctor can lose all their license to practice medicine fast forward month paul misses his end of day check in i just assume hes working late and i will just speak to him in the morning get to work the next morning he is no where to be found when i spoke to his direct supervisor i find out he had a stroke while he was at work and his in a recovering in a room in that very building i instantly think about how he has no healthcare and also since he was a temp he will not be getting paid while in the hospital how was he going to take care of him self and those kids a couple days go by pauls supervisor come running to my desk with a huge smile on his face turns out the doctor who paul helped a few months ago was one of the best heart surgeons in the world and as soon as he saw pauls name he insisted on performing the surgery and overseeing his recovery personally when he found out about his lack of health insurance the doctor covered all the costs made a few calls and had paul hired as a full time employee this instantly gave him the health insurance he needed and disability pay to help support his niece and nephew its been over a year and i am at a new job now but i still think about paul everyday whenever i have to deal with a less than ideal client or coworker i think what would paul do or you never know i might need this person to help me out one day edit all this took place a little over a year ago paul is alive and well today he still works there and has even been recently promoted

last month i told a customer she needs to pay for accountingsoftware tech support before we can transfer her accountingsoftware onto a different pc the backup wasnt restoring correctly and googlefu is pretty sparse for this program she complained that the boss thought it wasnt worth paying to extend support for another year and let it expire then said she would speak to their accountant who also uses accountingsoftware to ask if they could fnagle support through them called them today about another issue she asked when she could move onto the other pc i explained were still waiting for them to get accountingsoftware support gt nobody told me we needed that haha yes we did twice in person and by email playing ignorant might work against a big company but not when theres only two of us and weve both told you the same thing
when working as a understaffed small managed service provider there are a few key rules that you need to follow in order to keep the business running the large companies are the backbone of your business do anything you can not to lose them try to take only business related jobs personal jobs normally involve endless hours of virus removal with little customer satisfaction when they receive the bill ring ring i look at the caller id its larry the boss of a major client hes scarily aggressive when he needs something done but generally hes pretty laid back a bit of a jekyll and hyde gt me hello this is friendlysorceror gt larry hey man im giving my old iphone to my daughter alarm bells ring in my head i want her to be on a separate account to the business and i want her to be able to manage it herself also i want her to have her own email address and apple thingo instead of using mine i think to myself you have a daughter ive probably had phone calls with him and not once has he mentioned his family which is where my surprise came from its a good thing for a year old to learn independence and moneyresource management gt me sure i can do that ill need you to go to the shop and get a sim gt larry goes shopping and calls back a few hours later gt me ok so we will need to activ gt larry ill put her on gt me no that wont be necess too late larry has no time for the struggles of sim activation i hear him talking to his daughter ld to follow the nice it guys instructions gt phone crackle followed by silence gt me hello this is friendlysorcerer how are you gt ld good as soon as she speaks i realize that im talking to someone who isnt a teenager or maybe she is and she just sounds really young i give her the benefit of the doubt gt me can i get you to go to a computer and open up an internet browser gt ld can i use my ipad gt me sure tap on safari then enter url to sim activation in the big white bar at the top of the screen gt ld minutes of slow tapping it dawns on me that im going to have to talk a childteen through activating a sim reading out a mac address joining it to the wifi creating an email account creating an apple id adding an email account and setting up icloud the alarm bells in my head have changed to evacuation sirens gt me umm could i speak to your dad gt ld ok background chatter daddy said he is very busy gt me alright can i speak to your mum then gt ld she is not home yet gt me are they are any adults at home that i can speak to gt ld just daddy gt me can you please ask him to call me back when he isnt busy click i hang up and thank my lucky stars that i managed to dodge that situation not even minute later ring ring larry on the caller id again gt me hello th gt larry i need this sim activated gt me ok well i need to go through the activation with an adult gt larry why she is perfectly capable of following instructions gt me she will need parental consent for a lot of the registration forms that well need to fill out gt larry you have my consent i try and reason with larry in a language he understands gt me well at this rate its going to take about hours with an adult i could do it in about minutes gt larry i dont care just get it done phone crackles as he passes it to his daughter great my job description is now managed daycare service provider this is where the real journey begins spending two hours on the phone giving instructions and asking details from a child is a real reminder for why we have rule i got her to read the information to me as i thought me filling out the form was easier than getting a child to scroll around an ipad screen excruciating minutes into activating the sim when i said gt me on this next box i will need to enter your date of birth gt ld gt me so you are years old gt ld thinking no i am background chatter twothousand and one obviously larry had told her that she needed to pretend to be rather than point the finger and go aha youre not and at the risk of being held liable for some fraudulent age thing backfiring on me i decided to just logout and walk her through logging in to finish the rest of the form on larrys laptop gt me where it says terms amp conditions you will need to click the small white circle next to yes then click next gt ld im clicking it but its not doing anything gt me try clicking in the middle of the circle gt ld random clicking its not working gt me put the sharp tip of the mouse pointer in the middle of the circle and click gt ld oh that worked i started to reminisce on the days when i was a computer nooblet navigating the world wide web for the first time sadly all i could recall was static html pages with dark redblue background colour and black text ive lost the memory of filling out html forms the first time but i knew that i too needed my hand held when filling out html registration forms id like to think that i would have intuitively known to click the next button once the form was complete or to click the circle next to yes instead of clicking the text but realistically its something that you learn then forget that you had to learn how to do it i realized something since im a trained it professional i am the most suited person to teach this kid about using the internet properly im not running a damn daycare i am going to run a school i start dropping some computer knowledge over the next minutes i teach her about what urluris are what a hyperlinks are and how to tell if a website it safe gt me can you please hover over next gt ld ok gt me now do you see the text starting with in the big white bar at the top gt ld yes gt me what is that text called gt ld umm a url gt me thats right now what is the text that youre hovering over called gt ld a hyperlink gt me great now is this hyperlink safe to click on gt ld yes because the stuff before the com matches gt me excellent what will it do when you click on it gt ld takes me to another web page gt me perfect go ahead and click i kept doing spot tests with her every minutes while we were filling out these forms when we get to google i teach her about the green ticks that the antivirus software puts next to some of the urls minutes and a few snack breaks go by and we are up to creating the apple id and thankfully larrys wife gets home and helps out with the account creation trying to remember all the little things you need to do when you create it from a parents account is a real struggle especially when you are doing the steps super slowly finally we are done and the phone is set up i say goodbye to the young lady gt ld thanks for helping me set up my phone gt me no problem remember to browse safely gt ld yep click i swivel around on my chair and grin at my boss who is busy juggling calls with multiple isps man i am having the best day tldr tried to avoid hours of account creation and configuration ended up giving a year old a lesson on using the internet edit to those first few who read this sorry for the typos extra thankyou for the

so this just happened i am eagerly anticipating the response however i feel compelled to share what has happened so far back story a couple weeks ago i was contacted by a friend of an acquaintance of mine who runs a very small business and wants to set up a web site where potential clients can see services prices contact information etc now i am a th year mechatronic eng student so although web site design is not my forte i do have a functional understanding of phpjavascripthtml and it is semester break so i agree to set this up i go to meet her she shows me some drawings of what she wants the site to look like and we agree on a price pretty sure that is a good deal to be payed now and upon completion fast forward to last friday im all finished website comes online i call the client and tell her its all up and running she checks it out loves it its exactly what she wants i give her my account number for her to transfer my payment she thanks me and the call ends now this morning one week later payment is still not in so i send an email to see whats going on the reply gti have not yet transferred funds and dont hold your breath i signed no written agreement and you have no proof that i aggreed to provide payment let this be a lesson to you gt thanks for the web site really took me a couple minutes to process what i had just read i should be mad but im not armed with a cheeky grin a chuckle and putty i ssh in scp r varwww hezltmy servers ipgthomehezcompanyname rm rv varwww on out first meeting she said she was getting business cards made up with the web site on it hopefully she doesnt notice for a while and hands out these cards that point nowhere p she seems like the kind of person that really wouldnt check you know the mentality of once its there its there for good if she doesnt get back to me in like a week i might redirect somewhere inappropriate tldr pay me by the way i do expect to be hit by all the reddit flak get it in writing well i will save you the trouble im an idiot i know its all that has been drilled into me for the last years so i should know better but she seemed so nice i really wasnt expecting it that and im really not too bothered i have been wanting to find an excuse to build a web page just to refresh my knowledge update so interesting morning am i just received a call quoting the call verbatim would mostly consist of expletive deleted for sfw reasons but the gist her your useless the site is down already lucky i didnt pay you i want my deposit back me im sorry but the site you saw was just a demo site to get your approval i took it down and it will remain down until i receive payment i was going to say until i receive full payment of the that we agreed upon but thats kind of extortion she can sink to the level of changing the deal but id prefer to take the high road her some horrible language that i dont have the patience to listen to im paying you this monthly charge to keep the site up now put it back up me im sorry but that monthly charge is for the web server which hosts the site i used a billboard analogy where you pay for the billboard for a period of time but its up to you what you want to put on there i think she got it in hindsight most billboard companies probably put up the add all in one package deal but most analogies fail bearing close examination me and even if that money was coming to me click a short time later i receive an email gtwhat is the login to the account that i am paying for you dont have the right to keep that from me becaus i am paying it gtmy son is doing computing at tafe and he copied the site before you took it down so he can rebuild it so there at this point im thinking whatever i have had enough i am compiling a credential inclusive smartass reply about how there is no way he has the serverside scripts that give most of the functionality when i get another call this time from her son he is so much more irate however i really cant hold that against him im sure that he has heard a biased version of the story and i can sympathize cross my mum and i will rip your head off and leave you in a shallow grave again summary of the call too many expletive deleted be readable him how dare you refuse to give us the access to a payed account i should ing come over there and kick your ng ass you me wow settle down i was just replying to the email with all the credentials you need to access the server she didnt pay me so i took the site down and it will stay that way him i do this stuff for a living i am the top of my python class you think you can keep the site down well i have news for you i copied the source before you took it down so i can just put it straight back on there i win er note i used no punctuation in that sentence because he didnt i could picture him turning blue on the other end of the line also add about expletives in there to get an idea of how long he was talking me look you do what you want i dont care i will send you the credentials and i dont want to hear from you again all emails will be forwarded to trash and please loose my numberclick ssh into root account rm f usrbinsudo rm f binsu find bin not name cd not name ls not name mount not name chmod type f exec chmod chmod binchmod passwd l root petty yes unprofessional yes but in the heat of the moment and after hearing what he intends to do or thinks he can do there is no professionalism left in this deal they can call the provider and have the os reinstalled after they figure out whats wrong they can even choose something easier than debian you know with one of those things desktops i think they are called and compile the email gtusername admin gtpassword admin gti have forwarded further emails from you to the bin folder i do not have a call blocking feature on my phone but i can install one with ease dont make me gtgoodluck goodbye and thats it will it be the end of the story i hope so notes no the password is not really admin for those who dont know what the commands do the two commands su and sudo allow non root accounts to run commands as root the highest admin the first two lines remove these from the system yes i could have done this more elegantly by changing sudoers but meh the third command finds all files in the bin directory aside from cd for changing directories and ls for viewing contents of a directory and mount for mounting drives and then execute the command chmod on each file this removes all read write execute permissions making them inaccessible maybe an expert can tell me if i chmod ed mount would that cause boot issues and the bin directory well lets just say the stuff in there is important the fourth command removes all permissions from the chmod command itself permissions are gone and arent coming back finally passwd l root deactivates the root account which itself is good practice in fact the only reason it was activated in the first place is so i could log into it and run these commands addendum i get so many comments saying why are you building websites for well the answer is because its not my business i wasnt out to make a profit someone contacted me and wanted some help building a a site i have the skills at my disposal along with some spare time so i agreed i was in it to learn and help someone out it was my intention to refresh my memory and get some experience in a skill remotely relating to my future profession because let be honest its a very useful skill to have as a skint student i just quoted twice my weekly budget seems fair to me we are both benefiting turns out i learnt another valuable lesson cant complain i got experience in what i planned to and some bonus experience its like when you finish a quest on some game and the reward is some experience a little money and a mystery treasure chest that when you open contains a little bit more experience crystals reddit umad me no

i work for a managed hosting company in the uk but we work across multiple regions thats not the focus of the story however so within company we have a prize a medal a badge of honour as such itsa rubber chicken a bit strange really ive been part of the company since mid november and am still learning how to do the jobmy first job in the industry along with the weird ceremonies and traditions that come with every workplace i learned the provenance of the chicken today company provides a managed hosting service where we install a rack into your building customers are then ordered not to touch it or face the wrath of a void warranty as we dont go out to the customer site to troubleshoot unless we really have to we cant tell if the customer has opened the rack or not not for maybe months on end anyway what we do or maybe did is place a rubber chicken in the rack strapped to the door if a customer were to open the rack a rather confused call to the service desk asking why that particular piece of hardware had been installed would follow company used a rubber chicken as a warranty test the rubber chicken is now a sign of intelligence integrity respect perseverance and humour in a sometimes stressful workplace and i won one edit a lot of people telling me better ways to test for an opened rack the chicken was discontinued as a reliable source a couple years ago it was only ever used as an inside joke as it were edit to win said chicken i demonstrated one of the principles above and was recognised by the manglement

you do this stuff for long enough you run into situations like this one i dealt with friday and today im an it consultant that means im good with computers how good well for instance i installed a phone recently in just under four hours how did i do it so quickly so glad you asked here is my tale of woe unbox two new follycom speakerphones hook them up they get an ip web interface comes up look up default password and enter it it does not work try the default sip password for this environment in case it pulled itself a config somehow does not work try previous firmware version default passwords does not work try accessing the advanced config of the phone directly rather than through web interface does not work hook up second phone with the included poe injector so it wont connect to the network attempt to log in with default password does not work no other random hail mary passwords work look up password reset procedure which suggests two different key combinations to hold during boot to initiate reset try to find out which combo one applies to this phone one person says combo a try combo a get to a screen that reads reset phone configuration and asks for password which should be the mac address of the phone this phone has a key numberpad so to enter letters you need to tap the numbers multiple times to cycle through the letters like an old flip phone best part is that for security the characters are shown as asterisks so you are cycling through the letters but cannot see them manual says to enter the letters in lowercase not capital finish entering mac address invalid password get frustrated and leave for the day return today notice there is an additional follycom phone speakerphone installed previously that is working normally this is unusual because the other phones here are a different brand look at its configuration it is apparently accessing a completely different config server than the one used at this location no one knows who set it up become very confused attempt to log into this phone with the default password does not work try sip password does not work try sip username and password does not work try multiple combinations of the above does not work attempt to login to the config server it is apparently connecting to invalid password no idea what the correct one is partner in crime shows up finds a completely random phone password somewhere on the server that neither of us have heard of which matches a sticker i never noticed on the back of the phone log into this phone successfully and change the password still cannot log into the new phones try the other key combination combo b that was suggested during boot to see what it does end up at a different looking screen that also says reset configuration and prompts for password enter mac address it neither accepts nor rejects the password just goes to the main menu attempt to log in to advanced config on the phone does not work attempt to log in with mac address does not work provision a sip extension associated with the mac address of this phone and restart it try logging in with sip password does not work not really surprised because i wasnt able to configure it to point it to the sip server find random blog dude online that drove himself nuts because of this exact problem on this exact phone see that he mentions that it only reset for him when he did the configuration reset with capital letters when entering the mac address even though as he reminds the reader all follycom documentation indicates that it should be done with lowercase letters reboot the phone holding combo b again and enter the mac address with capital letters still no acceptance or rejection of the password try to log in with web interface invalid password partner in crime points out that a commenter on aforementioned random blog said that the reset keypad combo only worked for him when he pressed the cancel button halfway through boot process of the phone then held down the combo during the second countdown shown before it autoreboots begin performing this procedure but the auto reboot has already begun when partner in crime finishes explaining it restart the phone press cancel halfway hold down key combo a this time enter mac address in the interface using capital letters when prompted not lowercase accepts password phone reboots enter default admin password in web interface password is accepted wife picks me up asks me what i did at work today have no idea how to respond
another story from my magical job at that now closed dialup company i had been at the company now for a year and a half or so was there slightly over years and had become good friends with some of our regulars aka repeat callers if you have ever worked at a small company and have regulars you know how it goes you see their phone number on the caller id and you know who it is and what the problem is before picking up the receiver some of the regulars were not so nice and were not friends they were more like enemies to be treated politely so as to get them off the phone as fast as possible with as little stress as possible one of these repeat enemies errrr callers claimed to be a professor at a local college in its engineering department and all the time talked about the boost in spending after it got paired with a much larger college near the northern panhandle if you are from wv you already know which college it is he was very snooty and because he was so smart had a doctorate and taught a real discipline not a fake industry like it that he was better than me and all the other techs you could hear the disdain in his voice everytime he called you could tell he thought we were beneath him and should service his every whim well after dealing with him for months and his disdain over everything even calling me a liar when i explained to him how noise on the phoneline interfered with the signal i finally got the shocker of a call from him as an explanation of the lie about noise on the lines being an engineer he was too smart to fall for the lies of interference and instead kept telling me how noise on the line wasnt possible because it was against electrical physics properties or some such thing anyway he calls in one day and claims to have a bought a new computer and wants us to walk him through setting up the connection aka the only useful damn thing you retards can do that is an exact quote from that call after doing the usual steps and being ready to get him off the phone i tell him he will have to hang up to then dialin and try the service but wait my friends he is an engineer he thought ahead he was on his brand new portable mobility enhancement device crying inwardly i went into robot mode and waited as he tried to dial up x x x by the th attempt it was obvious he was getting no dialtone i asked him to double check to make sure the phone cord was connected at the wall and at the computer he got mad and cussed at me but then confirmed it was i even had him unplugreplug both ends until he heard the click just to make sure it was firmly seated after he tried again still no dialtone i concluded his pc had a bad modem from the factory it happens modems were throwaway devices and had terrible failure rates and as i was starting to suggest this he cut me off and stated the following gem of wisdom i dont need a modem this new pc has a universal serial bus port i just flattened the end of the phone line with a pair of pliers and jammed it into that port it is universal so that means it will fit and use anything i was stunned beyond stunned he was a self proclaimed engineer and useful member of society and i was a useless it retard yet to hear him admit to purposely mangling and misusing a phone jack and usb port i have no idea how he fit it in there even squished with a pair of pliers just floored me at this point i just started laughing it was all i could do i laughed hard and long the more he got mad and yelled and cussed at me the more i laughed after a few minutes i calmed down enough to tell him to take his brand new computer to his it department on campus and have them explain to him why what he did wouldnt work later that month he sent a strongly worded letter to us asking us to disconnect him from the service because our dialup did not work with universal sandwiches yes a direct quote from his letter tldr usb will work with anything even if it doesnt fit edit to the detractors i cant count that high so i cant keep track of the upvotes for everyone else thank you for the hilarious stories that are similar to this one
so i volunteer at the local senior center computer lab today a lady came in asking for help with her new cell phone she says that she can call people just fine but when other people call her it doesnt come through first step is obviously to verify the problem i ask her what her cell phone number is and then call it from my own cell phone sure enough her phone doesnt ring vibrate or in any way indicate that theres a problem second step is to make sure that i have the right number so i call my own cell phone from hers a different number pops up which i show her lady oh thats my cell phone number me then what number was i just calling lady my home phone number do i need to give people my cell phone number instead me yes your cell phone uses your cell phone number
promotions to technical support senior staff at my telco my job requires both a certain seniority and the ability to pass different exams each of them is overkill and you need on each precisely to reduce the impact of seniority in the process we want to make sure every employee in the department has broad skills i sometimes grade these exams but not always besides that potentials are normally offered to do the job temporarily at reduced pay sadly a kink in the work contract officially its so they can get a feel for the job and make sure it suits them unofficially its so the rest of the team makes sure theyre a good fit that day theres a prospect named justin sitting right next to me and im eavesdropping on his calls a bit obviously im only hearing one side of the conversation im not tapped into his line gt justin no no he tested with two different computers theres no way were telling the customer to see a computer technician until we confirmed the problem is not on our end that happens way too much i wont ok it if need be well send a road tech with a clean laptop to replicate gt justin no its not bull use the diag tools three levels down under internet youll find a logging tool more people should use yeah that one everytime a new mac is plugged in we have records customers cant lie about their tests theres three in the last hour in his log just like he said his router and two separate computers plugged in straight none of the three was granted a valid public ip gt justin no thats just not possible these are network logs entirely on our end the only way i could see what im looking at and the datas wrong is if the customer spoofed macs but thats not the case because the data usage logging tool shows his issue is real look at the history over hours we dont even have handshakes from the modem ill edit your ticket and escalate to networks you need to tell the customer theres a real problem on our end gt justin yes i know you already told him it was on his end but you were wrong mistakes happen but its no reason to just send him into a dead end humility is part of the job description im also putting him on the recall list hell have a follow up about this soon i was pretty impressed new guys typically roll over or fail to counter properly in cases like this where their frontline tech is clearly pushing them to a course of action often to avoid losing face he stood up like the best of us do understood every aspect of the problem explained why thoroughly taught his agent about tools he should have used and was more diplomatic than i would have been about the whole thing i wanted him in i waited till his ticket was escalated to networks the problem was related to the and they solved it in short order the customer had been offline for nearly three days and it was his third call to technical support so i went to see the guy in charge of grading justins exams to ask how well he did gt stephan eh not so bad but he failed one on hardlines did rate over on internet and mobile that means he cant have the job gotta have on all five gt bytewave turned in to management and the union already gt stephan no gt bytewave grade it again gt stephan i do like him too you sure gt bytewave yes justin is the newest employee promoted to tsss looks like he actually got on hardlines all of bytewaves tales on 
the year was and the details are a little fuzzy but i walked into the math office at the college i was attending and their student employee was screaming at the computer which was beeping back at her what i eventually determined was this she was using word perfect word perfect honored typeahead where you could type keys while the computer was busy and it would hold them for you and apply them when it was ready she had gotten herself into some corner and couldnt get out of it she hit the escape key the escape key beeped and printed some kind of error message on the screen delete something you typed or something like that for one second she did not read the message and hit esc beep one second esc esc esc esc esc beep one second beep one second esc esc esc esc esc beep one second beep one second esc esc esc esc esc beep one second beep one second me having read the error message can you please stop doing that her but i need it to stop esc esc esc esc esc beep one second beep one second me can you please just stop so i can look at the computer her but i need it to stop esc esc esc esc esc beep one second beep one second esc esc esc esc esc beep one second beep one second i walked out the secretary asked if i fixed it because the beeping is driving her crazy i told the secretary that if the girl would just stop hitting esc then sooner or later it will stop beeping then she should read the error message and do what it says but i told her i cant get her to stop hitting esc i wished her good luck and went on my way

first post lurker blah blah blah details have been changed to protect my job background i work for a three letter agency as a contractor i am one of several sys admins working in the operations center network operations center we build all the networks servers are responsible for all hardwaresoftware maintain everything and do everythingexcept for it security it security is run by another contracting firm that builds snicker maintains bwaahahahaha and is responsible for all the security monitoring av servers etc on our networks it is important to note that we have zero access to their servers security tools logs etc needless to say we dont get along recently it has gotten worse as the head of it security just came back from what he calls an eliteselecthigh endblahblah security conference and has received many demo programs that will greatly increase our security the last security program he put on the network declared our exchange server a mass mailing bot but i digress starts out as a typical day checking up on our servers doing tickets shooting the shit amongst ourselves and generally just having a good time ding email from it security weve been hacked emergency critical many viruses have been detected on the network da fuck we are of course scratching our heads note that we built the network and it is about as flimsy as a brick shithouse we hardened the ever living hell outa it the chances of someone hacking in are astronomically small we send an email to it security and cc our teams and the fed managers asking for more details eg what has been hackedinfected where did this occur etc you know common sense stuff ding email from it security weve been hacked emergency critical many viruses have been detected in multiple locations many systems infected breach breach breach sigh apparently details are a foreign concept at this point my manager is on the phone with different feds who are all screaming and waving their hands around demanding to know how we allowed a breach what we are doing to fix it etc my manager calmly explains that we are looking into it but need all the records it security has on the incident so we can actually have a starting point feds grumble agree and apparently send a peon to the it security room instructing them to send us all the records they dont want to stop berating my manager apparently and simply sending an email was for some reason not fast enough minutes pass ding email from it security ccing well pretty much every manager in the entire agency it security will be taking the lead on this ops does not have the tools true experience wut or knowledge lmao to handle a security event of this magnitude after hours of back and forth btw us it security and what had to be feds up to and including the head of the agency we get screen shots from it security which they say is all the records they have at the time we thought they were just holding out on us and playing politics but what the hell at least we have something to frigging work on first thing i notice is that only computer a desktop is listed as being infected and the path of the infected files are on the e which is the bloody cdrom drive wondering who the doofus this computer is assigned to i check the logs find the entry and just stare stunned at the screen for seconds i start to laugh my manager runs over and furiously asks me whats so funny i cant stop laughing and just point to the logs my manager glances at the logs does a double take checks the screenshot from it security and starts laughing hilarity ensues as one by one other admins come and look at what ive found the sound attracts one of our main fed managers who storms in demanding to know what exactly we find funny about the current situation we explain that according to what was sent to us from it security there is only computer reporting as infected that the infected files seem to be on a cdrom and that the desktop current assigned user is the head of it security apparently at the security conference cds with tools and demos of products were handed out to all attendees one of the tool cds included examples of virus coding not the viruses themselves as well as some useful networking and security tools this cd is clearly labeled with warning not to be placed on a production network this of course was the cd he put into his production desktop right before leaving the room so he missed all the popups warning a virus had been found when the alerts started appearing he bypassed his desk and went to hover mode behind his minions and never noticed it was his desktop that had hacked and infected the network needless to say their company is currently in the process of being replaced edit grammar spelling wow thanks for all the up votes and comments 
my friend tried to host some minecraft servers on the various computers in his house and his network stopped working he told me he had set static ips on his computers which is fine i spent an hour investigating and couldnt find anything wrong i eventually checked the ipv addresses of the computers and found out he had set them all to the same address tldr people in a group with the same name gets confusing

now that were in the last few weeks leading up to the new semester were getting a lot of calls from new students trying to get all of their accounts set up unfortunately were also getting a lot of calls from their overbearing mothers this is one of those older sounding person on the phone i cant get logged in the account name is username bring up account with a date of birth in and is this your personal account no its my daughters obviously oh i see unfortunately due to security policy we have to speak to the user whose name is on the account so shell need to call but im her mother i understand but i cant verify that and even if i could i still would not be able to talk to you about her account thats just stupid you just dont want to have to do any work obviously im her mother she gave me her password now just fix it so i can log in again i apologize that theres not more that i can do for you but security policy at the university restricts me from resetting her password for someone else technically just the suggestion that shes given out her password to other people and the fact that an unknown person is trying to access her account is reason enough for me to lock the account and make her come in and reset it in person but id rather not do that to i dont care why are you making this so difficult you could have reset it by now just do your damn job already sigh ok maam one moment ticka ticka ticka ok its done whats done youre reset the password no maam ive followed our procedure for dealing with possible third party intruders and locked the users account ive also put a note on it that shell need to come in in person to reset it so we can verify her youve done what after that the rest of the call was mostly a lot of colorful swearing edit to save future commenters time ferpa the us federal regulation that applies here has been mentioned and explained about a dozen times below thats probably plenty anticlimactic update she came in why was my account locked someone was trying to access your account so we locked it for your security yeah that was my mom but we have no way to verify that oh ok well thanks sorry folks they cant all be winners
i used to work at a college as a unix adminweb developer one winter i was bored and took a paper process teachers were using and put it on the web this process used to take weeks t collate and now had the potential to be automated to a large extent and completed in days it still required the teachers to log in and verify information the teachers were not happy about this because they hate change and made up excuses why they couldnt complete it then i started to get the calls about issues my favorite was nonexistent errors that went something like this teacher i tried to login but it said i am not authorized to log in me what was the exact error message teacher you are not allowed to use this system me it does not say that please tell me exactly what the error you are looking at says teacher it does say that how could you possibly know what my screen says this system is broken and i cant complete my work me i know this because in addition to coding this systemi also coded all the error messages and that is not something i coded teacher silence me would you like to actually try loging in and let me know if there are any problems teacher hangs up edit want to thank everyone for the upvotes far an away the most popular post i have made to reddit so glad everyone enjoyed it i will share some more of my tech support stories thank you all and have a great day 
user can i also have the locking locking station so i can secure it at my desk me by locking locking station did you mean locking docking station user yes me i have heard of laptop locks and laptop docks so a locking dock for docking locking laptops probably exists but i doubt a locking docking laptop with lock is in stock so they may have to order it which will take extra days i will include the request for this in your order user great
friday afternoon is a fickle beast it oozes the promise of the weekend and the only good kind of downtime on the other hand it also carries a subtle aura of danger everyone knows any time you touch anything on a friday you drastically increase your chances of having a bad time i didnt touch anything that friday i dont know what i did to the gods of networking but i suppose i missed one of the mandatory chicken sacrifices that were all so fond of aside from the mess nothing gets chicken out no matter where you file it the call came in from a friend of a friend the operator of an online store who had a dns server that was misbehaving it was on my way home so i figured what the hell ill help him out i left work at on the dot and drove to their site if id have known what i was about to walk into i would have never taken the call by the time i got there the two engineers were frantic i couldnt get anyones attention at first but when one of them realised who i was and why i was there his eyes widened and he stormed towards me expecting a blast of abuse of some kind i braced for impact then his voice cracked gt server tech oh god thank god youre here fuck everything is fucked shit fuck his voice trailed off into a whirlwind oblivion of cursing and muttering when his boss took over the conversation realising his subordinate was not coping with the situation gt chhopsky whats going on gt boss im not going to lie to you its bad real bad at first we thought it was just the dns server but more of them have been dropping offline we dont know whats going on and we dont know how to fix it gt chhopsky okay cool ill take a look when i started to look into it i became confused the dns servers were definitely all gone and the monitoring showed more and more of them going offline by the time i started to suspect some sort of switch malfunction and put a console on some of the networking gear it was already too late i just didnt know it yet the switch was functioning perfectly and while i was throwing show commands at it it rebooted from underneath me what the hell confused i moved over to the routers they too were working perfectly and then they too rebooted out from under me was my serial cable overvolting the console port was i causing these reboots or were the reboots causing intermittent faults was it bad power that intermittently killed every network device in some way it could explain a lot undeterred i moved onto the firewalls by the time i got to them they were already rebooting id missed it again and i didnt have any debugs on but what was causing it i decided to let it reboot and watch it come back up when i saw something that no engineer wants to see gt would you like to enter the initial configuration prompt yesno my heart sank what the hell how could it lose its config the startup configuration was blank and its highavailability cluster partner too which was feasible if it syncd a blank config so i moved back down the chain the routers were blank too gt chhopsky no no no no no no no no no the switches were blank the load balancers were blank everything was blank the entire network had been factory defaulted but how could this happen fortunately there was a logging server for the network which amongst other things captured every command that was run on every device i got server tech to find it for me and put a keyboard and monitor on it gt user brad has authenticated with plaintextpassword gt user brad executed command enable gt user brad executed command write erase gt user brad executed command reload gt user brad has disconnected oh oh dear thats how one deletes the saved configuration of a device and reboots it factory defaulting it gt chhopsky who is brad gt server tech he was our last network engineer we fired him last week why do you ask gt chhopsky did you disable his vpn access if he wasnt pale enough already he was mighty pale now it turned out theyd had concerns about some of brads lessthanethical behaviour after one too many incidents he was let go i guess he was one of those guys that just has trouble letting go i stared blankly at two racks full of equipment and surveyed the damage the servers still had their os intact but hed deleted everything he had access to which was a lot databases were gone and the network equipment configuration backups were stored in his user account we had nothing but the machines and their operating systems and a large stack of equipment fortunately they had backups at their other site which was minutes drive away i made the call the boss was going to the other office to get the backups and i was going to rebuild the rest from scratch server tech hosed the servers with clean installs while i set to work on the floor of the datacentre figuring out what they had and what i could possibly use it for by the time the boss returned from the drive id knocked out a plan and server tech had reinstalled all the oss and the services they needed backups in hand server tech reloaded the databases and web content while i recabled and rebuilt the network from our design document that we came up with on the back of a piece of scrap paper i set the firewalls routers and switches up again and configured up haproxy on a pair of new boxes for load balancers as the old ones were dead with some sort of firmware issue most likely bradrelated it was am when i finished the network server tech had finished his part too but it still wasnt working there was one final piece of the puzzle missing the databases we were all tired but we pushed through red bull was deployed server tech had ceased to function in the one lucky break wed caught all night server tech had forgotten to edit pghbaconf on the postgres databases leaving them unconfigured and not functioning a few minutes later we were back online it was am id been there for hours and at work for i got a taxi home cursing the name brad to the gods of networking i prayed to them that brad would pay for his crimes that somehow some day he too would find his fate in the hands of someone else who was not kind to his plans fortunately he did and by a complete and utter twist of miraculous fate that person was 
so i had a customer today that we shall call betty betty is very nice but also very not good with tech in that something year old who decided to buy a laptop last year kind of way i do my usual greeting and ask her what she needs help with she tells me that her laptop has a virus now understand that the specific brand of laptop that i work on is very resistant to viruses however many folks especially older folks confuse any and all issues with having a virus so i ask her why she thinks she has s virus and she says because the computer told her it did someone had shown her out to take a screenshot if she ever got a message she didnt understand and she showed it to me yep it was an adware pop up seems betty had been in some video site that said she needed flash so she googled it like a good user but hit the first link which was an adware infested site she got one of those fake tech support messages when i asked what she did she told me that she called and they tried to talk her through giving them access to clean up the computer but she couldnt understand the instructions so she said shed just go to the store and hung up when i told her what they were really up to she said she was never so happy to be stupid 
i work as a field service and installation technician for a fairly large but not top us mso this story takes place over a year ago at a call about bandwidth usage complaints after reading the work order comments seeing that the customer has gone over their bandwidth cap for several months in a row and that they believe the usage problem is our fault i decided to call her nothing about bandwidth overages is ever the isps fault well except maybe the limit itself xd gtme hello this is xlogisticsx with cablecompany i am calling about the trouble call we have scheduled for you today do you have a moment to answer a few questions gtcust no i dont have time i am very busy i just want a tech to come here and fix my problem gtme thats fine just to verify your problem is that you keep going over your bandwidth correct gtcust yes and im not the one doing it gtme ok maam for excessive bandwidth usage there are only three things or a combination thereof that will cause it first someone could have obtained your wireless password in some fashion and is using your bandwidth next you could have some malicious software on your computer that is using the bandwidth lastly someone behind your modem is legitimately using that much data and is just unaware gtcust i have not used that much data my computer is fine and no one has my wireless password gtme if someone wants it bad enough its not impossible to obtain a wireless password without consent this is especially true if a password is not very secure gtcust i dont have time for this right now just send the damn technician click i sit there for a few moments in anger while i was only minute away in a parking lot i figured it would be best to sit and calm down for a moment after regaining my composure i roll to the house and greet the customer i enter the home without saying anything unnecessary and proceed to gather my evidence that nothing on our end is wrong at some point when i spoke i believe the customer realized that i was the damn technician she started to bark up about her issue and how nothing could be her or her equipments problem to avoid any conflict i just say neutral statements and confirm or deny nothing this seemed to anger the customer as she felt the need to tell me that she was recording our conversation and would report me to my supervisor after i run my tests and get my evidence and logical arguments in order i start to explain to the customer that there is no way that someone can tap in to her internet by splicing in to the line outside the issue has to be one of the ones i told her earlier over the phone the customer then yells at me more telling me that she works in the it department for hospital and that i dont need to patronize her with this information i dont know how i am going to win this battle well i started to speak with the customer about things other than the issue while i was running more tests she was resistant at first but eventually started talking and sounding happier i slowly get back to the issue and she surprisingly doesnt rip my head off i explain to her that while i dont know the true cause of her issue it has to be one of the things i told her before i then mention that she has the ability to track her bandwidth usage with our online account tools when we delve in to it we see that every month she only used about gb of data or less until three months prior right when her new neighbors moved in i help her deduce that they could have sniffed out her password as she was still using the default wep password i advised she change her password and then monitor her usage via the online tool turns out one being happy makes them more receptive to ideas they dont like edit formating

so in the past years ive been aggressively trying to get myself in the it industry i went back to college full time in a great networking technologies program but then the wife at the time hung divorce over my head dropped out of out college to work on relationship still ended up getting divorced i felt like my chance at having a professional job in the it industry was gone i used to day dream about having the chance of being that guy where the boss called you of a critical issue and needed you in asap itnetworking has always been a passion for me and i was dedicated to having a job where i wake up and look forward to work fast forward years those day dreams became a reality two months ago i was very fortunate to have landed a data center admin position even though i was not able to finish my degree in networking i was able to some how make the cut out of the applicants who probably had better credentials than myself last weekend was when the day dreaming became real i was at a friends house bbqing and it was around pm that night when i got the call boss says hey quantumanomaly is there anyway you can come to the data center i know youre bbqing but weve had servers go down since am were not understanding what the network engineers in corporate are asking and we need your help i immediately accept and head into the dc wearing shorts and a tee along with beers in the belly i got on the phone conference and got the low down of the issue in the hours that i worked that evening i was able to resolve the issue and bring the servers back online that were down since am i went back to the bbq after that late night it encounter and finished my pack of warsteiner dunkel turns out that my bosssboss was on the conference call and i scored some hardcore brownie points the whole team thanked me up and down for helping them restore the servers on a short notice i left the office that night with a massive smile and a feeling of accomplishment i got a little tearyeyed too because i was once told by the exwifes parents that i would never be successful in obtaining a professional it career dont ever let someone or an event prevent you from doing what you love doing my fear after the divorce was that i would become a depressed old man by not living a wholesomelyfulfilled life and i refused to let that happen tldr exwife wanted a divorce while in college for it career so i dropped out wife still left and i still landed the it career i always wanted even though her parents stated that i would never obtain my dream job
this just happened within the past week and im still a little bit in disbelief im not going to embellish this one as i think its ridiculousness speaks for itself in this one there is only me user and the users boss manager i get a ticket from the help desk for a manager requesting a replacement mouse for a specific employee user the email reads as follows gt manager good morning we are need of a mouse for user in the xxxx department thank you so much to me that sounds like she just wants a new mouse not that there is an issue however i dont like to assume too much so i respond with gt shelbon hi manager what is wrong with her current mouse i figured shed respond with either that she wants a newbetter one or that its not working at least that way id have a better idea of what were talking about gt manger user stated that its all over the place at times now thats still pretty vague but at least now i know its an actual technical issue i replied to just let her know to have her employees call the help desk themselves in the future because ive had problems with that since i started working here user leaves at pm and i stay well past that usually so i waited for her to leave and went and tested the mouse but saw nothing wrong i sat at her desk and moved the mouse around for about minutes just staring at the cursor move around there was nothing wrong i even checked the optical sensor on the bottom to see of a hair or something was stuck there but nope nothing so i send her this email gt shelbon i went by your desk and i played around with the mouse but saw nothing wrong sometimes small debris or hair can get into the optical sensor on the bottom and cause the issues you described thinking that she would check again and see that the issue was not happening still and probably say something a long the lines of thanks or probably just never hear about it again but i was wrong here is the email i got from her gt user i need the mouse replaced you playing with it after i left yesterday doesnt compare to using it for hours at a time it sticks and slows my work flow down this has been happening on and off for a while now but really caused me problems yesterday i need to simply have it replaced or switched out now if youre thinking that email sounds a little aggressive youre not alone in that response she also copied her bosses boss and the director of our office they decided to inform her that her response was not professional and from what i could tell she would get a talking to she then replies all which again includes upper management gt user i wasnt trying to be rude nor do i have an attitude i was simply being direct about the situation could you please replace my mouse so that i dont keep experiencing these issues wooooow i just wow now i should mention that i was not bothered by her at any point during this i just find it hard to believe that shes so bold in emails with upper management copied on them so anyway i go over to her desk and ask her to show me what its doing but she could not replicate the issue she gave me some more information though that made it seem like its not an issue with the mouse at all mostly because it seems to happen only in specific programs according to her i ask her to just come get when it happens again so i can see the problem and explain that ill probably know what the issue is as soon as i see it occur now you may be wondering why i didnt just replace the mouse first to see if that was the issue normally i would but i have a few reasons this person has been notorious for requesting replacement equipment in the past when it wasnt necessary im trying to prove a point i actually only have a few extra mice in stock so i dont want a habit to start where end users thinking they can get replacement mice every time something happens with theirs she seems to understand what i tell her and she agrees to come get me ifwhen it happens again that was first thing thursday morning i dont hear anything the rest of the day or on friday either so about midday on monday i send her this email gt shelbon when we last spoke i requested you come get me if the issue with your mouse happens again that was thursday morning and i still have not heard back from you which to me means the issue has not been occurring is that correct her response gt user no the issue is on going it does it all day everyday when maneuvering throughout software i would be coming to you every single time i tried to do something different in software which is every few minutes i have spoken with manger and she told me to go ahead email you or call every single time it does that but again that would literally be all day at that rate i literally cant do my job gt shelbon per our prior conversation i need to see it when it happens that is where we left it please come get me the next time its happening so i can see the issue gt user you are welcome to come whenever you are available as i said its ongoing sigh okay so i walk over to her desk when i have a few free minutes and of course its not happening i start to explain the same thing again but then it happened i was able to see what she was talking about basically she was using a program not supported by me or my company it has its own vendor support that theyre supposed to call because its citrix based and we dont have access to that citrix environment the issue was that in one specific program with a very specific window open within it the cursor would shoot the bottom of the screen if it was moved above that window but it only happens in that one program and only with that specific window open clearly not a mouse issue and clearly not something i support i show her what the issue by being able to reproduce the issue i then explain that she needs to contact their support she doesnt seem to get it though so i just walk away document everything in the ticket and then close it i also made a point of explaining to her that this is why i dont just replace equipment without first verifying that it needs to be replaced to which she rolled her eyes
a pristine office is the sign that youve conquered all your work at least thats what my mother had told me when i was younger as if in protest of that fact my office looked messy not dumping grounds messy but at least forgot to do the dishes messy so it was with some surprise that i found myself facing an immaculately dressed woman in some distress gtpristine my phones got a virus pristines head whipped around my office in a frenzy her eyes widened with her increasing gaze she eventually reached into her handbag and produced a plastic lock bag it contained a mobile phone gtme i see gtpristine im very worried about it i need my phone im expecting a very important call pristine dropped the plastic bags onto my desk she refused to take a seat looking down at it with suspicion i bundled up the bag from the desk noting the triple layers of bag used i opened the first bag gtpristine what are you doing gtme getting the phone pristine eyes were wide her mouth scrambled words gtpristine but the virus itll spread gtme im not entirely sure plastic protects against viruses pulling the first bag free i wondered what error this lady was convinced was a virus perhaps it was a general system message or an application was trying to install either way i doubted she couldve contracted a real phone virus not on a phone so old i couldnt wait to send this lady on her way and go back to avoiding cleaning gtpristine but thats what they do in hospitals gtme im not sure hospitals deal with many phones opening the second bag i pulled out the final third bag one last piece of plastic between the phone and freedom a strange substance seemed to be in the bag as well it stuck to all the surfaces of the bag like a fine mist pristine shrieked with shock when she saw it gtpristine so as you can see my son coughed all over my mobile hes quite sick i dropped the bag down in milliseconds it clattered to my desk with a thunk gtme clean your phone grabbing a pencil i pushed the package back towards pristine who seemed to recoil away from it gtpristine do you have any special cleaning solution gtme no just antibacterial wipes ill get you some if you like before i could launch myself away from the bagged infection pristine had already produced two packets of wipes from her bag she placed them on the table carefully gtpristine the problem is look at the fine print i picked up one of the wipes and inspected the package carefully it was just an average packet of wipes it had the usual warnings and information gtpristine see it says itll get rid of of germs gtme ahh yes gtpristine well my son is quite sick i just dont want to take that chance if my head could have hit the desk it would have however the plastic bag containing the phone effectively repelled my instincts i pushed the wipes back towards pristine gtpristine i rang the help line on the back they couldnt guarantee it would be effective they said i should speak to a professional so here i am gtme i think they meant medical professional gtpristine like you said what would they know about phones it was too much my head hit the desk 
back when i was in high school i was heavily involved with the technical side of theatre i did lights though ive yet to make sense of the audio side anyways halfway through rehearsals of our production of almost maine great oneact our theatre tech teachertechnical director got word that some of the freqs we were using for wireless mics had been changed by the fcc a couple of weeks back i happened to be in the audio booth when he broke the news the conversation went as follows td technical director us us gttd hey guys the fcc changed some stuff so we have to use other freqs for our mics gtus cool what happened to the freqs we were using gttd theyre being used for other things now gtus such as gttd dod missile control he handed us the printed email to show us that he wasnt bullshitting turns out that for the couple of weeks we were unaware of the change we had been using for our wireless mics some of the same frequencies that were now being used for defense missile control when the power went out in the school later that day we joked that perhaps we had launched a missile at a ga power plant the funniest part is that as almost maine is set in well maine all of the crew had to dress for winter weather watching our td come out to the audience in character to explain that the power and ac were out was hilarious he was pretending to shiver in a very thick coat on a very hot georgia summer day priceless
i just had a guy come in the door with his desktop six months he said i have to come here every six monthsit was working fine i had no problems at allthen suddenly last nightit went back to the old internet it went back to the icons are all big everything is gone ive learned by now to not even try to make sense out of what people are saying about their computers ok lemme check it out amp ill call you a few minutes ago i booted it up and it was a plain vanilla installation of windows hmmmits activated as well lets go exploring i found a windowsold folder on his drive containing all his documentspicsgarbage did hedid he omgdid i i press the eject button on the cdrom and out slides my copy of windows not a bootleg mind you so this dude sat through six months of press any key to boot from cd for six months until that fateful moment last night when he hit that key now i can understand accidentally pressing the wrong key but going through with a full reinstallation of the operating system is a bit more in depth than just an idle keystroke at no point during this procedure did his brain ever register hey this doesnt seem right maybe i shouldnt continue nor did this hour amp then some long process weigh enough on his mind to where he would mention it to me yes i left the cd in the drive oops

tuesday am switcher was a complicated employee hed been flung between different departments often no manager seemed to be able to keep him as he kept requesting to be transfered this caused him to be a semi regular down in it sorting out which account of his needed to be activated gtswitcher hey i need my password reset its not working gtme again id started to become suspicious of switchers ability to remember any passwords normally id try to hammer the issue home but we had to deal with switcher so often he felt oddly like family gtswitcher i dunno what keeps happening gtme okay ill reset it just try to make an easy to remember password this time normally i wouldnt give out such terrible advice but having reset his password everyday for a week i was growing tired of our daily interactions gtswitcher i always make my password the same i dunno whats happening gtme ill pretend i didnt hear that my laziness on password security had been worn down i sent off the reset and quickly hung up the phone hating myself for having my standards lowered so much tuesday pm it was a long day most of which i spent lamenting its poor security standards i vowed to myself that id hammer the next breach in security i saw if only to feel better about letting the last one go the phone rang gtme hello gt hello err my account isnt accepting my password gtme youll need a password reset perfect my mind thought as i prepared myself for the it security lecture of a lifetime i just waited for the inevitable i always use the same password or why doesnt xyz work as a password gtme whats your name gt switcher gtme youre up late wait this doesnt sound like switcher an impostor oh i could really scream at someone like that i opened the thesaurus of insults in my head gt you dont sound like the normal it guy some of the night it guys had started to arrive at work upon seeing my office light on they entered gtnightowl oh airz do i hear switcher on the phone ive been meaning to email you about that ive changed his password every day for a week something is wrong with his account i mouthed this isnt the real switcher at nightowl gtnightowl yes its is all us night guys hang out ive known the guy for years gtme wait what it was the next day that the truth finally arose switcher and switcher had the same name unfortunately when the switcher i knew who kept hopping between departments got put into his current team another employee already had an identical account name instead of creating a new account i had assumed the active account of the server as actually his it was not id been giving an account to someone who didnt own it 
i work as a customer facing programmer most of my communication with customers is through email when the phone rings that usually means someone either didnt see my email or something fairly complicated is going on the phone rang today i recognized the number i swore under my breath gtme companyname this is wishful gtcustomer hey wishful this is customerman yeah im still having that issue with the custom project you sent me it still pops up that message when i tried to send an email gtme i sent you an email on the th with an updated file did you install that gtcustomer yeah i saw that i didnt read it there were too many words and i get leery when i see that gtme okay ill take over at least he was honest 
i was working in a call center tech support for one of those extended warranties and we got a really odd call seems that this lady had put her sub sandwich on top of her computer which warmed it up and the sandwich went bad this customer called up demanding a replacement of course a computer warranty would never cover something like this so naturally we resisted the issue escalated nastily it turns out however the store that sold her the computer also sold refrigerators and the warranty paperwork they gave her was for such an appliance and did cover food spoilage we did end up replacing her lunch but she wont be getting any help with her computer so she spent over to get a sandwich replaced tddr it doesnt pay to be nasty edit just to clarify a few points based on the discussion the was my estimate for the cost of the warranty the store in question did have separate warranties for the appliances and computers the computer warranty was very specific as to what waswas not covered
first of all mods i want to give you my most sincere apologies for yesterdays post i was in a rant for what happened im terribly sorry it was a normal day for the most part at the store easter holidays so im working fulltime to earn a bit more cash we were attending people as usual when a guy in his late s came in and ask us to check why his laptop wouldnt turn on i had to handle it since my coworker was busy he places it on the counter and i take a look at it check the battery first and remove it to make sure the connectors and battery are not damaged nothing unusual i open the lid and i felt a weird smell like cleaning products the keyboard and screen look somewhat dirt like if they had spilled soda all over it and cleaned it with some products gtme excuse me sir have you by any chance spilled liquid on it or have you used any cleaning products gtguy uh huh i clean it often but not so well it seems i do the normal tests it wouldnt turn on i used my charger to give it power i have the same model and as i try to operate it the keys feel a bit sticky like plays the psycho theme i pay closer attention to the dirt spots they look like glue and the screen has drip marks just like if someone i realize why it was dirty and i completely lost it insults and more came out of me my boss came in to see why i was yelling like that i show him my horrible discover after some nasty words exchange the guy leaves with his laptop i head to the restroom spending little over minutes washing my hands and arms and my coworker cleaning the counter we closed the store as usual and i head home my boss was kind enough to allow me come in a bit late and relax

 years ago i was hired at my current position to help bring the financial institution into the st century my first step was getting them a mobile platform check my second was to take them from paper loan files to paperless i implemented the product one year after being hired and to this day people still dont use it correctly they use the old way and then scan the paper into the system which is the hardest way because you can send everything directly into the system without ever printing a piece of paper but you know people have to hold their paper i have given each of the loan officers single page scanners for items that our members bring in but they use those single page scanners to scan whole entire loan documents so for the last years the loan officers have been complaining about how slow the paperless process is and how much faster the older process is my response has always been do it correctly and it will be faster i have showed them and showed them and showed them how to do it without printing and scanning and they have all responded for the last years that their way is quicker and that i am not a loan officer so i dont understand and i cant tell them how to do their job so comes today i made a deal with them i would take on their fastest loan officer and that person could do it their way and i would take a loan and do it my way if i finished first they have to learn the way i want them to do it if their loan officer finishes first i will never again bring it up and i will get each branch a big multipage scanner they picked the person who complains the most the person who gives me the hardest time about how fast she is with the old way and how my scanning paperless is causing more headaches than it is worth we sat down and they started the clock i am sure they thought that with me not actually being a loan officer i didnt have the experience the goal was to get everything into the system and the person who got it done first would win it started out as a small competition everyone was watching she got off to a fast start because she knows the boxes she can type without even reading what is coming up i was still busy typing in the data into the system as she started to print i was just finishing up entry of the information when she started to scan i hit my button to send everything over into the system and there was stunned silence when i said done and she was in the process of scanning pages still they didnt believe me at first they all said i probably didnt do it correctly because she was way ahead of me in the process i showed them my completed loan in the system and they all went over it with a finetoothed comb looking for a mistake telling her to keep going that if i made a mistake she could still win i had made no mistake i just didnt have to spend minutes scanning single pages of stuff just to scan it they can now all shutup and learn the system like i have been begging them to do for years because i beat their best and i dont even know their job
weekly staff meetings always seemed so pointless except around budget time when money was discussed everyone paid attention gtaccounting manager so airz it says here on your budget allocation form that the amount you want is more then last year gtme that sounds about right a few of the managers gave incredulous looks to each other gtaccounting manager usually departments give a specific figure gtme oh were doing that again this year every year i calculate how much it needs and every year i end up with exactly the same amount regardless of what i calculate i thought maybe it was some weird prank the incredulous looks now shifted to ones of wide eyed shock gtaccounting manager i assure you we look at the numbers we are given very carefully gtme do you i mean last year we had a plan to upgrade every department to a new operating system our budget came back with zero extra funds gtaccounting manager clearly youre upset about this but unfortunately we do not have unlimited funds now can you please just give me the specific number that youre requesting i took a pen out of my pocket and wrote out the number that i was normally allocated i added a few zeros for good measure i folded this piece of paper in half and pretended to discreetly slide it over the table towards the accounting manager the accounting manager unfolded the piece of paper and almost baulked gtaccounting manager outrageous airz please submit something a little more reasonable i took back the scrap of paper and wrote down the same amount i received every year then added a single dollar the accounting manager smiled gtaccounting manager now this is a number i can work with i sat back in my chair knowing the meeting was now over for me i didnt even bother requesting additional funds to upgrade our crumbling equipment unlike every other department id completely lost faith in the allocation system after last year seeing the sales department get funding for its third bathroombreak room redesign in four years was the nail in the coffin for me i arrived back in my office with an email already waiting for me after carefully looking at your records the budget allocation for it this year will be i looked at the figure it was the same amount i received every year they didnt even add the dollar i decided to type up an email company wide due to lack of funds it can no longer support any company telephones this bill will now need to be covered by individual departments this change will come into effect the email was rather boring and very formal it outlined why and how the responsibility changed from the it budget to the budgets of individual departments it was fun to write within seconds my office phone began to ring gtaccounting manager airz whats is this i read about shifting costs on to the departments for company phones this wasnt in any of your budget reports gtme oh i know it was in last years costings when i requested more funds to keep paying the contracts last year you sent an email that said wed get the funds this year we did not i assumed that meant you wanted us to shift those cost onwards gtaccounting manager but what why cant we just leave it how weve always done it youve the same amount of money i pretended to ponder this for a second gtme i cant my costings this year didnt include the company telephones and my costings have already been approved by your department after careful examination the accounting manager sounded stumped on the phone i could hear him clearly rifling through the forms trying to find any evidence that i was mistaken gtaccounting manager this is just a small oversight you should still pay the company phones as normal gtme oversight couldnt be didnt you say you carefully went through all the numbers gtaccounting manager if the vp was here gtme but he isnt so youve a choice either i get extra funding to pay for all these phones or everyone is going to have to hand in new expenses reports he hung up after much deliberation i got the extra funds apparently admitting they didnt actually check my budget forms was too much instead they bought me off i was happy coincidentally this all happened the same week it found the funds to upgrade its own break room new coffee machine and all 
this ones pretty long if it starts to feel like a bit of a shaggy dog story i apologize but it felt that way to me too and it starts the way many stories in here do i acquired a new client recently they werent satisified with their current it vendor the company was growing they wanted to check out their options etc a common enough story i asked them about their specific needs and problems and they told me about backup paranoia the server getting overloaded and crappy email service natch so i did a site survey ah the old buzzword bingo virtualization scenario i see the server was a windows r host running a single windows r guest under hyperv no snapshots no image based backup no replication so its a bare metal server but the old it vendor just ran it virtualized so it isnt technically a bare metal server and they didnt look like a scrub as far as they knew gotcha their backup paranoia was definitely justified there was an el cheapo homegrade nas plugged into the back of the server by way of usb and a scheduled task in the vm set to run windows backup once daily it hadnt produced an actual backup in over months there isnt really much more to say about that just drink the ad interface was visibly slow and the isp was hosting their email just opening windows on the servers desktop was pokey so that explained the overloaded thing trying to run hyperv guests on a couple of mediocreatbest conventional disks isnt likely to impress anybody for performance and they were running isphosted email so yep thats gonna suck all right so i ask one more question are you concerned about offsite backup yes they say absolutely thats mandatory going forward ok site survey is done ive got this at no point did anybody say anything about a printer remember that please its important anyway i write up a proposal and come back onsite to talk to them about it office for the email problem solved there i told them about and how it could solve their remote backup problem as well as their performance issues and they were on board contingent on me doing a good job with their office transition their o migration goes swimmingly so now were golden to proceed i give them a goodbetterbest and they unhesitatingly shoot for best sweet i get to set this up right so three new sanoid boxes with fully solid state storage were going to have a production vm host an onsite hourlyreplicated hotspare host and an offsite dailyreplicated dr host n hours to migrate all their apps and data from the old hardware to the new do any handholding etc a week or so later i bring in the new hardware and start setting things up new domain controller guest on production new appserver guest on production hourly replication to the hotspare daily replication to the offsite robocopy all of their data from the old server to the new one get rid of the shitty batch file in netlogon that was inconsistently mapping their drives and frequently conflicting with memory card readers lenovo recovery partitions and god knows what else replace it with some proper gpo to map their drives consistently install their industry niche apps punch holes in the windows firewall that those apps installers either failed to punch or failed to punch correctly looking at you sage get it all in one sock ok tested ran through workstation setups fixed a few local issues on workstations problems as they were flushed got a new industry niche app installed and im almost ready to call it a day everythings up users are happy new servers are smoking fast and eliciting happy comments from the users and owners life is good suddenly an anguished cry from down the hall dammit the printer still doesnt work so i head on down to the print room where a canon ir copier and a user both stare balefully at me the user demonstrates scanning a document to the network which should work just fine the user who is quite technically competent had already updated the address book to point to the new vm and in fact it does work just fine the user frustrated says well of course it works with you standing here i grab a piece of paper out of the tray sketch a hasty smileyface on both sides and scan again it works again but its a bit weirdly hitchy and slow the users frustration increases but im pretty sure i know whats up now i scan my doublesided smileyface again and this time i get a complete failure to connect to the server and the user says see but the new server was supposed to fix this wait what ok what is this things ip address that one stumps the user so i do my best nick burns your companys computer guy imitation gently shoulder her aside and rummage through the canons blecherous local interface for myself i knew exactly what i was going to find the copier tech dhcped the copier to get an ip address then immediately staticed it to the address shed gotten by dhcp the damn copier techs always do this and it works fine until after the copier tech has left the scene of the crime but then the dhcp lease expires and the router marks that address available again now the next time some other devices lease expires while its powered off the router hands it the address the copier is squatting on when it powers back on and requests a new one now you have a copier that randomly works and doesnt work and a random device elsewhere in the office that also randomly works and doesnt work sure enough the clients dhcp range starts at and the damn copier is staticed to so i run to a workstation ping arp confirm that nothings on and run back and restatic the copier to and of course it all works every time and without weird hitchiness or slowness either go umercenarysysadmin it hero savior of the print room and whatever poor random user keeps drawing the loaded chamber in the daily game of dhcp roulette too the final task left that day is setting up a new workstation for the same user who flushed the copier problem that went without incident and she was super happy about her new ssdanddualmonitorequipped machine so yay after that was done before heading out for the day i spend a few minutes talking to her and to the internal semiunofficial it czar who is my main point of contact for the company and they let drop that the entire reason i was brought in which i had never heard of until that day was the mysteriously and randomly nonfunctional copier the copier vendor had told them their network was overloaded their old it vendor pointed fingers back at the copier people but couldnt actually figure out what the problem was so i got brought in to replace the old it vendor and here we were i was stunned they literally just spent grand to change an ip address dont get me wrong obviously they got a hell of a lot more out of the deal than that but the ip address was what they actually wanted fixed in the first place i hesitantly pointed that out to them but happily they had no regrets nah your name is going to be golden here for the next few months at least cause the copier actually works besides all that other stuff really needed doing anyway and it did it really really did i could talk for hours about how much better off they are now but damn
this dear reddit is is a story of justice a tale of evil clients and knights in shining qa departments ampnbsp the setting our company runs a set of databases with a light website for managing reports on data all of which is used as a customer management system for a large number of large clients that want to host websites but dont want to manage a database to sit behind it the heroes i work as a lowly qa tech in a qa department of about ive been working in this place for about years now and im frequently asked to sit in on calls with clients they trust me enough now to leave me to get on with things and communicate with the client directly if theres anything i want to ask about my boss is a certified legend with a degree from the college of how to earn respect the guy lets me get on with my work and takes care of all the business side and interdepartmental politics great boss my good friend who well call greg works as a fairly senior member of the customer support department gregs got my back and ive got his if he has something come through that he needs help with or looks serious then ill help him out the villain the clients project manager who well imaginatively call douche was tasked with being the gateway for all communication with us and was either extremely vague or mathematically incompetent whenever he discussed the requirements for what would be delivered when paired together these things often mean that bad things will happen to make things worse this guy was intentionally insulting because he could get away with it after all he is a paying customer the pledge the client paid us for a piece of work where we made a custom api which we expose on our soap interface it was a good feature and one which our sales representatives had probably been told to try and get a client to fund for quite some time implementing it was a nightmare because they had added some complex functionality in their requirements document just before they signed it off all my best attempts to try to resolve inconsistencies and make it work logically fell on deaf ears and eyes that refuse to read emails one exchange with douche on this topic went thus gtme hi douche its derp at ltcompanygt just calling abou gtdouche oh hi yeah the slacker at ltcompanygt hows it going it should be pointed out that we were slightly behind schedule because there were a number of outstanding issues in the database procedure behind the call hence why this was obviously my fault gtme biting my tongue im im ok thanks just calling about your requirements on the api which you sent throu gtdouche oh this again havent you finished that yet gtme well no youll remember that weve delayed it due to some issues with the procedure which youve been infor gtdouche oh for the love of why is it taking so long gtme thats what i wanted to ask about requirement says its supposed to calculate x but lower down it states the maths you want it to use the problem is that this equation doesnt actually represent that val gtdouche look youre supposed to follow the specification ive written so just do it i dont want to hear about this again until its done the next day my boss tells me that douche complained about me to his account manager saying that i was being offensive and was questioning his competency he can read minds i then completed this piece of work ensuring that his specification was followed to every exact instruction the turn after the best part of months and the client is about to go live with their site theyve been trying to sort out their own internal testing teams and third parties for such a long time that we ended up completing the work a full months before they were even able to test it and at this point they were going live in days because thats when their marketing campaign said it would because of these tight deadlines they signed it off in our acceptance testing sandbox and we considered the work to be complete i had all but forgotten that previous conversation with douche about pm friday afternoon greg from cs calls me up says hes got an issue with douche greg now knows first hand how douchy douche can be this is because after our work was completed and promoted to our live system any issues they had integrating were not development issues but customer support issues i make my way over to cs land and this is where things get fun gtme sup greg sipping my coffee because these usually involve a long conversation about the functionality of features gtgreg hey derpyou ever worked on this new api that went up for ltclientnamegt gtme yeah i did the verification process on it what do you want to know gtgreg the client seems to think it doesnt work gtme it was implemented to the letter plus other clients have been picking it up and using it since it went out havent they gtgreg yeah thats what i thought when i read the documentation ok leave it with me and ill let douche know i head back to my desk and start pulling out all the documentation i have on this feature because i know exactly whats coming next after not too long steve the account manager for douche storms into qa and straight into boss office theres a lot of shouting and raised voices and eventually im called in gtsteve would you care to explain this steve points at an email on boss screen i go in for a closer inspection and its an email from douche claiming that their launch is probably going to be a disaster because the api has obviously not been tested at all im surprised steve believes this because he knows me and ive worked on various projects for him in the past gtme i was firmly told my mr douche that i was to implement it to the specification gtsteve but the reporting section of the response that comes out is utter nonsense it doesnt make sense gtboss derp what did the specification say about this gtme i can grab the documentation from my desk if you like gtboss i think that would be a good idea i go and fetch the documents and all the eyes in the department are on me wanting to know whats going on on the way back i see boss trying to calm steve down gtme here it is i slide it across the desk and take a seat steve and boss scan through it and find where it talks about these reporting figures and wait to be spoken to steve turns a little pale and boss smiles gtsteve but that makes no sense gtme i know gtsteve why didnt you raise this with the client gtme i did i then was accused of insulting the clients project manager and calling him incompetent gtboss who wrote this specification gtme douche over on their side did im pretty sure you two would have been ccd on the email when it came across gtsteve well what are we going to do we have to fix this before they go live on sunday its now friday afternoon gtboss no chance we only release new code on monday or tuesday unless its a priority issue even then this is an api that multiple clients are now using and well have to be careful not to break their integrations gtme steve you might want to look at section on that document steve quickly flicks to this section of the documentation where the final clause states how any modifications to this constitute as a change request and chargeable work steve is much more calm because he knows his ass is covered that and ive made him some serious commission from clauses like that in the past gtsteve ok wait there steve now stands a chance to make a considerable amount of commission the client wrote the requirements signed off the requirements signed off the work in acceptance testing and have only hours before they launch they will be willing to pay a significant sum to fund the overtime required from personnel to get this straight the prestige its and i am considering what ill spend my weekend doing boss walks out of his office and comes over to me gtboss can you just join me on a conference call gtme if its quick gtboss thats up to you really intrigued i follow him into his office where i can hear a much more humble sounding douche on the phone explaining to steve what needs to be done gtboss steve i have derp here do you want to explain what the plan is gtsteve derp we really need to get this sorted you worked on the original feature so youll know the best way to test this were still working on getting someone to develop the change but well be willing to pay you triple time this evening and tomorrow to work on this for sunday we reckon we can do this patch without any impact to our other clients gtdouche i really need you to help me out here mate otherwise itll really hit the fan over here i pause and enjoy this brief moment of pure justice gtme ive already made plans for this weekend and gtdouche derp seriously you have to help me out here gtme i dont really feel like it gtdouche well someone needs to fix this gtboss its pm on a friday most staff are on their way home or out the door sorry steve but it looks like itll have to wait until next week douche rages down the phone and once this torrent of abuse subsides steve lets me go back to my desk im packing up for the end of the day and my phone rings gtme ltcompanygt derp spea gtdouche please i need you to do this gtme you need to sort this out and calling me wont help you gtdouche please im sorry just help me out gtme you have been extremely rude to me and insulted me whenever weve spoken your failure to listen to me is the sole reason youre here right now i did exactly what you asked and you have treated me with contempt every step of the way i am not helping you gtdouche please hes actually crying you can hear it in the way his voice is all shaky so i hang up and leave for my weekend the reveal monday rolls around and steve introduces me to a new project manager for the client whos organising the fix to the api gtsteve so derp this is herp another project manager for ltclientnamegt gtme is douche not working on this project gtherp douche no longer works here tldr douche pm for client writes spec for api sproc logic makes no sense pm thinks hes infallible qa tech questions logic gets reported for being insulting client doesnt test the api signs it off anyway it hits the fan release date is ruined pm is in deep and pleads for help qa tech hangs up and enjoys weekend even more

i am a semi retired semi burnt out old tech spending my declining years in a small rural town i service a mixed bag of farmers small business and domestic clients the work is varied the clients are generally pleasant there are exceptions a solicitor ran a small legal office just him and a part time secretary shared a single computer it died and naturally there was no backup when i opened it up it was filthy it had overheated and was shutting down randomly and half the caps where bulging i replaced the motherboard dropped in a bigger hard drive upgraded from xp and recovered his data from the old drive i even set up a simple backup using a couple external drives the solicitor was happy i had saved his data and set him up with a much better computer i invoiced him and thats when the trouble started he just didnt pay no complaints from him he just ignored the bill i tried gentle reminders i tried appealing to his sense of fairness i tried letters demanding payment nothing eight months later the solicitor called frantic he had tried to update practice management software he used and had failed he couldnt tell who owed him and wouldnt you know i was the only tech within a kilometer radius with any experience with this software i agreed to help him provided he settle the outstanding invoice in cash before i started working when i arrived at his office he offered a cheque i politely declined the offer and waited on his doorstep as went to the bank to withdraw the cash when he returned i told him that the work would take around two hours to complete and sent him back to the bank to get the payment before i would start work the actual job was simple i rolled the database back to the previous day upgraded it to the current release and then the program upgraded without a hitch the best part was that the process took just over two and a half hours so at precisely two hours in i stopped work and asked for prepayment for another hour the solicitor had enough cash on hand to avoid a third trip to the bank i finished the job thanked him for the work and wished him a cheerful good day tldr solicitor doesnt pay long outstanding bill but his own incompetence forces him to pay the account 
not tech support but i do assist people with logging on to their internet accounts generally this can be fairly straight forward but it always depends on the user at the other end received a call from a lady born in the s so pushing she was having trouble logging onto her out website she had recently purchased a new computer everything else was set up correctly except for the issue of logging in when you click login the login screen appears in a popup but nothing was showing on her screen she was unable to advise me what browser she was using so i had her described her toolbars etc turns out she was using chrome finally get her through the process enable popup etc and she is able to log in she told me at the end of the call that she had sought assistance from her son who had given up in frustration been to our retail store who were unable to help it took me over minutes to get her there she didnt lose patience or get stressed and we kept battling away it was nice to assist someone that appreciated rather than the majority of callers who dont listen to what you say tldr chromed an old lady with a popup
so a few days ago i get a call from a client who is hysterical she immediately starts with ive really screwed up whats the problem i ask i accidentally emailed my computer to a client at this point im just thinking ohhoney no but i match her level of urgency and get her to remote me in and explain what is happening after i get connected she shows me the email she sent and it had a zip file attached i just wanted to send one file but when i open it up my whole computer is in there she claims she proceeds to double click on the zip file which opens in explorer and of course shows her disk drives and network shares on the side i double checked and forwarded it to someone else here and they saw my whole computer too well of course they saw the same thing everyone has a c drive and they all have the same network folders i figured out who she forwarded it to so i could explain how wrong they both were and closed the ticket tldr woman emails zip file thinks whole computer got emailed because zip files open in explorer and her sidebar is in explorer

analog cable is dying all over allowing our cable telco to use the broad spectrum range that once had to be dedicated to uncompressed video feeds to better use one of the cooler ways were putting all this substantial bandwidth capacity to use was actually suggested by my better half who pushed to set up a test node where wed dedicate all freed up bandwidth exclusively to expand our internet multiband capabilities it required new multiband modems able to handle a lot more qams than those we used for years but we might now actually hold a record on downstream speeds over copper wire thanks to that its still just tests and as marketing has other ideas about how to use some of the freedup qams its likely that the new plans well ultimately offer wont get as many bands nor reach the same speeds as were currently testing but still its cool to reach downstream speeds normally available only with fiber over plain old cable as usual i ended up on the readiness test taskforce for that project ive learned long ago that whenever youre assigned to any sort of special team for something new and even if its as simple as doing something we already offer on a greater scale you get carte blanche on almost everything and given a wide berth by management so im always the first volunteer this was one of my first calls on the dedicated line set up for issues about it gt bytewave hyperwideband project you have tsss bytewave gt jack hey this is jack road tech hwp install i have insane packet loss on this install need your eyes probably radio frequency issue but my meter isnt being helpful its like the line is dead but the modem actually hooks up fine despite the packet loss gt bytewave sure just a sec gt bytewave got it the traditional wideband range is all clear which is why youre technically online but every and each exanalog frequency is red the most logical explanation would be that gt jack goddammit i already checked the panel for this gimme a minute ill find the damn thing and he puts me on hold without me even having to explain i literally had a sigh of contentment thats another perk of project taskforces they actually put good techs on them he instantly knew what i was gonna say i scoured the customers file trying to find any evidence that an analog passive filter is installed on grounds but found none long ago when analog piracy was rampant and hilariously easy install a splitter get your neighbors cable the best way the telco had to limit it was to install analog filters whenever techs noticed such setups normally theyd be pretty easy to find and documented but many years before i started here documentation standards were less than stellar andor confined to a system that long went out of production so we lost track of some furthermore though they were designed to be difficult to remove some crafty noncustomers found ways around these to keep pirating cable so oldschool techs used to hide the analog filters creatively in certain cases such as if they believed the customer had tempered with one or bypassed it minutes later gt jack im not even mad this is amazing the drop coming in here goes through the gutter and this customers analog filter was hidden in there rustiest one ive ever seen wish i knew if he lived here back when this was installed obviously by scrambling the frequencies once used for analog this was the cause of the massive packet loss on hyperwideband gt bytewave lemme just log on recoveries tools annddd thats a yes weve had the person living there as a paying customer for years but theres a note about the potential from years ago about analog piracy naming the resident by name and its a match but we wont be able to actually gt jack yeah i know the drill we gotta pretend we dont know anyhow now we have pl ms full hyperspeed thanks for the assist im out all of bytewaves tales on 
not much of a story but i recently started a job as the technology guy at a school this is okay but for some reason we allow teachers and other staff to set priority on tickets themselves this naturally leads to practically every ticket being marked as high or urgent above that are emergency and critical which they apparently cant see or no doubt id be deluged with emergency and critical tickets about coming down to change printer ink cartridges or something in any case i take enormous satisfaction in reassigning most tickets to low or medium
it was a typical spring day in britain unnaturally cold yet the sun shone with retinapiercing rays it was the kind of weather where you need a few layers of clothing but with sunglasses as well in fact it was on this day i pondered when people are cold they wear shirts jumpers cardigans jackets why never anything on the legs why has nobody invented jumpers for legs this eureka moment kept me company all the way to the office that morning pondering this conundrum a week had elapsed since the jon vs angie showdown we were playing angies bluff abiding her new court rules to the letter and sought permission for every single visit to the it cupboard sometimes it was a stern and sharp no other times it was a reluctant yes but only after waving a ticket number in front of her face such a cupboardbound session would always be followed up with her dropping in at intervals which appeared to be so very desperately random the mindset was obvious we were obviously skiving shirking responsibilities and up to no good her grand entrances into the cupboard where the handle was turned even before her security card had finished triggering was as if to catch us in some red act that she could grow fat on for me given my near permanent residence there i devised a rather fun game trying to estimate when these visits would occur if i could time it right i would make a visit to users deskside machineontrolley just in time to pass her in the corridor on her way to the it cupboard so i could nonchalantly whistle a happy tune just going about my business i managed to pull this off a few times she would have her stinking coffee in one hand handbag poised for another session of studying me as i worked reprimanding anything she felt like only to be caught out because i was on my way out those few times id pass her in the corridor like this her soulless grey eyes would stare straight ahead shrouded by her forehead wrinkled after many years of just abjectly hating everything just as if i just didnt exist this eventually stopped being fun as i would often find she would just sit and wait for my return to the it cupboard her presence just a grim spectral shadow in the background like a precariously balanced rock perched on a cliffside as in those cartoons she would come and go as she pleased seemingly annoyed in my indifference occasionally bursting into fits of sharp conceit where i couldnt do right for doing wrong the sad reality is it wasnt all fun and games angies frequent verbal attacks accusatory questioning tactics and consistent throwing of spanners in the works made for a very stressful working environment for everyone in the team there were many occasions where her actions and whims would cause a ticket to go wrong in some fashion leaving the team to try to pick up the pieces in one incident qbg had a traveling sales rep due to see her about a usb hard disk he was having trouble with she had correctly diagnosed most likely a failure of the actual hard disk and had requested a new usb disk to await his arrival where she would transfer any data he needed however one of my tickets was a simple request for a new usb hard disk which i had duly placed on the purchase order list angie knowing that qbg had the last usb drive in stock had mafg complete my ticket using the same usb drive qbg had waiting in her desk drawer mafg was unaware of qbgs ticket i was aware of qbgs ticket but not that mafg had been told to go and action mine using qbgs hard disk when qbg found out the rep was already at her desk waiting to pick up his new drive little things like that seemed all too commonplace now even though angie had caused it it would just look like our own incompetence orchestrated by this total bitch i was particularly reminded of the omen soundbyte turning man against his brother until man exists no more i think what irritated angie was that in the face of this deviousness i always stood up and appeased customers in the above case qbg was close to tears with an angry rep on her hands this had been agreed between them for at least a week angie sat happily clicking around touchpaper while the rep blew up i waded straight in and simply took liability claiming an administrative oversight qbg and several others on the team were juniors they looked to me for mentoring advice who was i to leave them in the lurch i managed to appease this rep by offering to run out to the local pc world and grab one up for him just one of the many incidents angie seemed to orchestrate added to that my heldtogetherwithtape nokia was suffering frequent call drops i missed my blackberry tuesday came our string epic induction session arrived fresh from birmingham mafg and i stood by the training room windows as hoards of lads and lasses from oop north stepped off the coach we knew full well that they would be in no mood for sitting straight down for a stuffy it session it appears that my inspiration to order fresh tea coffee and bacon rolls for their arrival was a good one as the delegates stormed the sanctity of the training rooms armed with smiles and northern accents galore all lunged hungrily at our offering of breakfast there was much joy to be had i couldnt help but notice angies indomitable presence at the back of the room as she sat piercingeyed and miserable waiting for us to start one of the new ladies quipped at me in her birmingham accent whos that sourpuss at the back after explaining she was my manager she instantly empathized with a cheerful laugh and blimey ya poor sod mafg and i split the groups into two manageable pieces i thought that this may throw angie the dilemma of having to balance her disapproving looks between two rooms closely monitoring and judging our every moves it seemed however she was perfectly happy to sit motionless at the back of my session at every moment fixating her eyes on me she would ensure her comments were delivered at every coffee break which seemed like orders and reprimands over every minor detail her opportunity for managerial admonishment was stolen from her again one of the delegates new laptop had suddenly failed at the start of the session angie motioned about to take control and give me a solid dressing down until she was stopped in her tracks when i produced one of the three spare laptops always prepared in advance just in case such a circumstance ever happened i swapped the machine over had the delegate log in and noted the new asset number for changing on ad later angies fingers were red as they clutched her coffee cup she was almost pissed that i hadnt slipped up yet again there was no hope of lunch as angie ordered me to go and see hr tank with her slow pc again it turned out hrt had simply decided waiting seconds for a newly inserted cdrom to spin up was far too slow and was causing her severe heartache nothing to do with all that cholesterol then after pulling several late nights the week previous to get laptops finished phone contracts organised and hardware charged the whole session went off without a hitch of course there were the usual attacks of angies bitter comments through it all i did my best to ignore her and instead maintained a flirtatious joviality with my inductees about pm angie skulked out of the room she looked past me as she walked out as if she had gathered everything she needed to know and was off to put some other part of her devious plan into operation her departure sparked a brief conversation about what a sour old woman she was and how they could never work for such a wench i resisted the temptation to spill my guts break down and tell this group of happy individuals what hell we were going through i simply chose to leave it as yes she is very difficult the afternoon ticked by to its conclusion eventually the last delegate left the training room armed with laptop off to make their way in the world mafg and i sat drinking the last few drops of weak tepid coffee from the cafetiere looking out of the same window where we first saw the delegates arrive we could see their coach driver perched on one of the front seats reading a newspaper and drinking from a thermos flask looking totally relaxed in the world we sat quietly comparing observations on the delegates we had just met congratulating ourselves on a job well done i had left the door open neither mafg or i noticed angies skeletal figure appear in the doorway our discreet musings of the day were cut short with her vociferous shriek exactly what is the meaning of this who gave you permission to sit around what is this a playground we both startled upright her voice almost shattered the glass as we began clearing up equipment powering down projectors and clearing desks of discarded wrappers angie unleashed a full force critique of the day i dont see why this whole process had to take so long maybe if youd had stopped chinwagging talking rubbish and making jokes this whole thing could have been a lot quicker we knew that no comebacks would have worked with angie she continued to berate us for another minutes as we cleared the room down just as we were ready to close up we couldnt help but notice that another figure had appeared in the room she was about outfitted in a dresstoimpress suit and couldnt help but exude the fact that she was new to the company she stood with trepidation and meekly knocked on the door excuse me she said is mafg in here after acknowledging his presence she gingerly pirouetted up to mafg and handed him an official looking envelope his name and address on the front she left the room just as abruptly as she had arrived making sure not to make eye contact with anyone not even to the nearapproving look from angie mafg and i with a box of bits and projectors in hand looked perplexed at what had just happened angie left with the snipe i want you both back downstairs in minutes after youve put that stuff away and i want all your tickets reviewed by the end of the day we made our way to the sanctuary of the it cupboard and returned the gear to its rightful shelving space mafg opened the letter reading it aloud as his eyes sunk into his cheekbones there it was the letter was from hr garbed with every official looking signature and stamp that you could possibly throw onto such a document it stated he was to attend a meeting tomorrow with hr angie and bhit it also stated you may choose to have a representative accompany you this was it angie had made her first move in her new game and it certainly seemed that the first casualty would be one of my closest allies mafg this terrible moment was mocked at the sight of the delegates reboarding their homewardbound bus they were escaping the brutality of this situation off to their lives of freedom and futures to look forward to a clear contrast to ours mired in the darkness of some hateful hag who it seemed had only just started mafg didnt return to its that day i agreed to do his late shift for him allowing his escape at pm to go collect his thoughts angie had just upped the game and we felt powerless to do anything about it previous pt a new world pt safety pt the it induction from pt pt how to make friends pt marking pt one friday to rue them pt best laid pt its one step for pt and one step back for pt bring home the pt who needs minor pt dawn of a new 
rolands amalgamation to nd line was arduous his physique just as pious and wretched as angies slithered over mafgs old desk space in exultance his mannerisms and movements unnervingly similar to his mothers his keyboard and mouse glistened as though he would secrete some sort of mucus as he worked as if to chemically claim permanent ownership rolands voice though weedy and undeveloped bore all the same neurosis and vile overtones which angie would spit out on a daily basis his eyes almost serpent like as if they would pierce the skin if he stared long enough i had just spent a glorious week on annual leave putting finishing touches to my bands album the ugly situation at work had been far from my mind as i enjoyed every minute of my creative freedoms sunday marked the penultimate day of my freedom by bringing with it the feeling of impending doom by monday morning my commute to work seemed ghostly as my attention was constantly attracted to the clock in my car it ticked by the minutes towards am and my arrival back in this gloomy pit where angie stood lord and master my foot barely wanted to touch the accelerator pedal these thoughts did something to my subconscious which i felt forced to fight my entrance into its was barely noted by the inhabitants whose faces seemed fixated on their own screens as if to break for a moment would feel the wrath of some frosty dominator rolands bleak personality radiated throughout the small department like a bad smell only amplified by angie who sat mere meters away fighting through this black air i sat at my desk as outlook churned into life the email traffic of the previous week waterfalled down my unread pane the main view providing snippets of what had transpired my absence the hard disk ticked and tocked the led flashing in sympathy in its race to return to life after a week starved of power the unmistakable apprehensive walk of the balding head of it came into view as he arrived at my desk desperately maintaining as dominant a pose as he could muster despite his triviality he voiced his usual brand of pleasantries as our exchange turned to the important business of the rollout project all appeared to be well in bhits world the machines from dell were on order to be delivered in batches the pilot group had been well informed the software vendor was communicative and the relevant sales managers seemed to enthusiastically thumbsup all round his every action i started discussing finer details i want to get at least one of the builds done today as a first draft its better to get it done early so theres more time to rectify issues and build machines bhits expression altered as if to purposely show confusion oh he mused i was under the impression the first draft build was done i hadnt heard the shrill of angies voice in a while but its tone was just as familiar as if i had endured it all my life without even turning around in her chair to face us her words showered us with all the same bitterness the first build is done someone else did it while you werent here angies tone was mired in the suggestion that my wellearned week off had proven me negligent another spit in the face from this diseased rat roland took his cue as if they were both reading from some psychic score yes i did it it wasnt that hard really just install everything and domain register it his simplistic insight into my carefully honed art was if to mock all that i had worked for and write it off as if he had found it unchallenging and inconsequential theres far more than that i disputed you need to add the office wifi vpn antivirus etc angies retort was sudden and venomous its been dealt with roland is doing the builds you would know that if you had read the revised project plan in your email you said yourself that junior members need to have training as part of the project he will consult you as needed it seemed roland had been furtively promoted again this time within the echelons of his own team i was now rolands bitch bhit seemed as if he would have done anything at that moment to disappear into a cloud of smoke as the rest of its still sat motionless with their eyes cemented into their pc screens pretending not to hear this firework going off around them my hint at checking rolands work was again sharply rebutted angie this time turned her chair to face me her eyes like stilettos garnished with her downturned drawnon eyebrows her skeletal pointy chin moved in harmony with her bark as she added finality to this conversation you have other things to be getting on with read the project plan and get back to work roland will consult you when he needs you knowing there was no win here i returned to my screen outlook waiting like an obedient dog with unread emails i looked at bhit with a silent sigh expecting him to interject in some way instead he just shuffled away obviously completely illequipped to properly deal with what had just happened he uttered some empty promise of catching up with me later but this was drowned out by the sifting sound his suit made as it transported him away angie had been busy in my absence an email forwarded to all the major players in this assignment was emblazoned with a send date of pm sunday evening two days after i was last in the office as if to prove angies socalled dedication to the cause it was a carboncopy of my wellthoughtout and scrupulous project plan except my involvement in almost every developmental stage had been written out like a poorly written character in some novelists prose rolands new found solecommand of the technicalities seemed all too purposeful angie had painstakingly placed me in the backend of the entire rollout promoting our newest arrival her son into the most delicate of tasks the rat had risen to a position of power i hated what had become of the project my considerable and enumerated planning had been cast aside like a cheap newspaper as angie lay claim to its proficiencies in her bid to establish herself at the top of the food chain ensuring that any credit traveling up would end with her in a last ditch attempt to fight back i emailed my concerns to bhit the time scales of the project and angies apparent and purposeful transference of my responsibilities meant that the rollout was now very susceptible to failure i finetuned my words for nearly an hour striking a fine balance of concern without appearing confrontational finally after much deliberation i took an all or nothing stance i added a personal addendum in which i vented about angies disruptive nature within support her constant criticisms and micromanagement her fork tongue and angry terminal attitude bhit needed to get involved now and reign this beast back in i couldnt help but notice roland fawning over one of the new dell laptops his prize that accompanied his birth right no expense had been spared on these machines attested to by the fresh sleek black appearance it was now being painted with rolands clammy greasy hands the slimy fingerprints unnaturally obvious underneath the incandescent office lighting i felt a sense of jealousy like my obvious experience had been made irrelevant against this vassal creatures ignorance silence followed as the email disappeared from my outbox the feeling i had was that this had either sealed my fate or marked a major turning point for the better ten minutes went by still no response from bhit i sat eagerly awaiting the outlook balloon which would at least acknowledge bhits reading of my plea instead came the unmistakable sound of bhit timidly rising from his chair the rustle of his suit seemed signatory as it served to fanfare his escape out of the office towards the main stairs i was alone in hell with angie her spawn and several demoralized broken and burned out its engineers previous pt a new world pt safety pt the it induction from pt pt how to make friends pt marking pt one friday to rue them pt best laid pt its one step for pt and one step back for pt bring home the pt who needs minor pt dawn of a new pt rules of pt bring out your pt the greatest trick the devil ever 
this happened two years ago but i will never forget this it was quite a memorable call for accuracy this caller was a middle aged filipino woman from toronto background i did tier tech support for isp tier plus direct access to scheduling and talking to the technicians in canada this is around pm this woman calls very upset her internet hasnt been working properly for months and she was getting silly issues all the departments would give her the runaround nobody would actually sit there solve the issue the call gets escalated to me and i see the list of tickets and her issue was clear her profile was set too high and the modem was just not able to hit those frequencies and would constantly drop dsl she also seemed to have a bad filter no biggie really now to make this clear this is the th call she puts in to us and months that shes getting frequent disconnects and constant slow downs so i get this call going through the regular process making sure that everything has been checked before continuing with the fix procedure and i could hear the tv and her year old in the back playing she told me her yo daughter was there and after minutes i hear the woman say spit it out spit it out i asked if everything was ok and she said not to worry i continue minutes later i hear the little girl say momy my stomach and throat are burning my mouth feels strange too again i was a little worried at this point as the woman was already emotional with this ordeal of not fixing she pressed for me to continue with the fix but this time i asked what happened as her daughter was clearly in trouble and she said i shit you not she drank some of the bleach i had in a cup over there then proceeds to tell her daughter to go and try and throw up me having done whmis the week before and having a little common sense knew that that was not the right thing to do tell the woman no call poison control you cant make her throw up youre just going to make it worst so she tells her to go drink lots of water at this point im ready to shit myself this woman stressed out cause she kept getting the run around finally found somebody that seems like he can solve her problem tried to press forward at this point i stressed again call poison control call an ambulance this is your child and then she said this is saturday night btw were going to church tomorrow morning god will take care of her i fucking lost it having all her info i tell her i must terminate the call i hung up already having googled poison control for the area run to the staff room and call poison control the guy on the other end thought it was a joke some dude from tech support calling from km away is freaking out telling him that a customers child just injested bleach i give him my name and all her details phone number address at this point i was stressed out bummed a smoke from a coworker i dont smoke but boys that was a fucking amazing cigarette and afterwards went back inside and called the woman again shes hysterical crying freaking out she thought it was the emergency services again but no it was the internet tech support guy the guy who made the woman realize that she could of lost her daughter she thanked me and hung up as she was waiting on the ambulance the following thursday i call the woman back her internet still not working started crying and telling me how great it was for me to care so much in a time where her thoughts were shadowed by her problems her daughter ended up being fine and needed her stomach flushed and stayed in the hospital for a few days as she digested a bit i solved her problem and that was that that there is my most memorable call tldr called poison control for small child that drank bleach because her mother was too worried about getting her internet finally working again after months of issues later on ill post about my second most memorable call if you guys want internet tech support aka suicide prevention line edit wow thanks for all the great comments guys i really didnt think it was a big deal i just did what i felt was right as my parents taught me if you want to thank somebody thank my parents for giving me good values and common sense edit as promised here is the long story about the suicide prevention tech support call i had a few months before this warning wall of text edit thanks to whoever gave me reddit gold i appreciate it and thank you everybody i didnt know this would make the top like that

i experienced first hand almost word for word guiding my mother through some fairly complex ideas regarding ocr of some pdfs of scanned text shes proofreading and correcting basically she has scans of books which the ocr has totally failed to read properly because all ocr sucks and then she corrects the text it produces or adjusts the formatting in word so far so good shes been working with computers at home and at work for gt years so this isnt beyond her capacity i ask her what sort of file size the pdfs are in case its feasible to bulk copy a large number of them to my laptop and maybe do some cleanup of the scans so the ocr has more of a chance of not sucking this is the good bit she opens a pdf in word using the previous documents menu opens the insert image menu navigates to where she keeps the pdfs within her folder structure right clicks a pdf properties and reads me the file size im not sure whether to be shocked or surprised laughing or cringing shes using the file select menus in word as a file browser my mother has used the windows operating system since early win era and has no idea what explorer is for on further questioning she refused to accept that her method isnt just as valid as my idea of opening a folder using a program specifically designed for the task and was pretty certain that using menus in word was actually better as it doesnt involve navigating to another program so this method is much faster whats worse is that she may be right
so ive just taken a call regarding poor wireless signal from a customer gtme so what seems to be the problem with your wireless gtuser well it works when were in the same room as the router but as soon as we go outside it drops what are you going to do about it your router is faulty gtme ok as its wireless there are a lot of factors that can cause issues with the signal could you describe the room that your router is kept in please gtuser well were in a converted bank the computer stuff is kept in the vault gtme well thats probably the issue the walls are most likely reinforced and are so thick that you cant get a signal through them gtuser after a minor bout of swearing at me well what are you going to do about it i want to cancel since you cant provide a service etc etc she eventually hung up on me still not believing that foot thick steel reinforced concrete walls may be the problem tldr wireless wont work in a with a router in a bank vault also editformatting

monday came to see the fruition of my power move facilities were present and correct at the it cupboard busy fitting brand new desks and trunking on completion mafg and i replaced the ghost server in its rightful setting on top of a u comms cabinet as though a rightful leader was being returned to the throne there wasnt much time for moonlighting as there was a massive backlog of builds to get through and only a week left until possibly the largest induction session id ever run our birmingham satellite office had a recruitment drive and were busing down delegates the following monday for new gear and it training it felt good like we were back in business i expected some sort of a backlash from angie obviously i had caught her offguard and she needed time to regroup and plan her strategy all i could do was wait for the strike but for now we all reveled in our little victory several laptops were busy building on the build desk as i clicked away making some new ad accounts for my incoming party of inductees having received signoff previously from bhit to replace the missing desktops facilities managed to lose with brand new machines i had them all loaded on a trolley ready to roll them out mafg was busying himself with an inventory of mini keyboards and mice taking stock for an urgent purchase order we chatted casually as he made his way up and down the isles it was a fullon powerhouse of progress our shortlived freedoms stopped dead like a body dropping in the middle of a busy street the electronic lock trigged and the door opened angies familiar musk of coffee and old woman perfume festooned her appearance in the doorway her scowling face writing a thousand words of bitterness as she surveyed our veritable cave of tech she said nothing averting my eyes as i looked expectantly for a few seconds as i greeted her with a good morning expecting some request after a few seconds of uncomfortable silence i ignored her again and placed my tickets sheet on top of the trolley and started to wheel out just a minute she said extending a single boney finger in my direction her tongue whipping against the top of her dry mouth what are you up to in here now a rather curious question i would wager one which i would have thought obvious after explaining the current goings on little did i know i was jumping headfirst into her trap it had been barely a morning gone when she had already planned her counteroffensive to the letter this was the scouting mission this is where she would sew the roots of her plot she came straight out with it where are the tickets for these laptops youre supposedly building supposedly building tickets for induction users never heard of such a thing mafg appeared from behind the racking as if to leap to my defense we generally dont log them for inductions we usually get a fair number of requests for new machines so we just use an ad container to build the machine and move them to live when were rolling them out shit mafg really knows how to put his foot in it sometimes what is ad angie demanded i could feel the life force draining out of me as angie realized yet another scope for micromanagement why dont i have access to it her stern face looking like we had cheated her out of some mythical prize the lines on her forehead scrunched together realizing his mistake mafg kept quiet as i tried to work around it we dont generally hand out that sort of access out if someone didnt know what they were doing they could cause a lot of damage and the potential mess that can occur only mafg and i have access to it in nd line as were the only ones who administer accounts ok it wasnt the best workaround i could have said but there its been said now angie threw around some more micromanagerial criticisms before taking her leave she also left me in no uncertain terms that she expected to see active tickets for each and every machine i was building for inductees before the end of the day an hour out of my life for no purpose sigh angies final email that day made her feelings on the it cupboard clear no engineer was to be in the cupboard without a ticket evidencing their need to be in there and not without the express permission of angie first another typifying trait of angies hardline stance against ingenuity control a persons ability to conduct themselves and create the illusion of importance by demanding constant permission seeking the clever bitch had laid the foundations for her new play there was a new ball to throw out on to the court tickets for every machine permission from angie to use the it cupboard and what would she do with her newfound knowledge of ads existence i contemplated these things as i drove home sat in the traffic jam from hell as i drew up on the accident the gaggle of other motorists gawping at the overturned x which littered the inside lane of the motorway seemed to exemplify the futility of each days passing as firefighters scuttled around the wreckage feverishly confronting the mass of metal as if finally overpowering a once vastlystronger enemy as i passed the scene sure enough the traffic started moving at its prescribed mph over the speed limit it was as if we had all just escaped some fatal consequence and were now running away for dear life for me tomorrow was another day another opportunity to dance in this fascicle struggle conceived and birthed through the actions of this shriveled character whose aroma seemed to besmirch even the most jovial memory previous pt a new world pt safety pt the it induction from pt pt how to make friends pt marking pt one friday to rue them pt best laid pt its one step for pt and one step back for pt bring home the pt who needs minor 
 drip drip drip i contemplated what id done in life to deserve this on the one hand i was soaking wet and getting cold in an office with everyone too busy to talk to me on the other hand i was getting paid stupid money for literally no work my mind ran in circles debating whether this place was a curse or a blessing carefree eventually saw me shivering in clothes that couldnt be more wet gtcarefree airz i got you this carefree held up a jumpsuit it was bright orange he handed it to me i put on the jumpsuit and smiled to myself without the cold and with someone at least partially talking to me this place wasnt too bad i left the bathroom and found carefree waiting for me gtcarefree oh orange doesnt really suit you he smiled at me i looked down at the jumpsuit then smiled back gtme its dry thats all that matters gtcarefree now youre wearing clothes that can get a little dirty could you do me a favor gtme haha sending me to do your dirty work i was bored enough id literally jump at an opportunity to do something gtcarefree haha okay weve got the network cupboard right we walked over to the network cupboard i was expecting carnage it was unexpectedly really tidy gtcarefree see this switch well i want to know where these wires connect too gtme sure thing i followed the switch cords they all lead to the patch panel above the patch panel had labels empty labels gtme errr okay it seems someone hasnt filled in the labels when they installed the patch panel gtcarefree yeah so how do you work out where they go i looked at the back of the patch panel all the cords went straight into the roof gtme simple just find all the ports on walls in the office then unplug everything one by one process of elimination really gtcarefree sorry you misunderstand there are these ten cables in this switch that go into the roof and end near rooms but never got put into actual points i want to know where in the wall those cords are so we can cut into the wall and put in the wall plate thingy i realized pretty soon that he wanted me to go into the roof cavity and chase cords gtme haha its probably quicker to just unplug them and lay new cords gtcarefree mmm theyre already up there though just gotta find about where in the walls i looked up at the roof tiles i decided i should at least look at the roof cavity i pushed up one of the roof tiles each of the roof tiles was held up by a metal structure that was tied to the cement slab above the cavity was actually quite big about a meter and a half tall gtme mmm i cant actually see where those cords go specially carefree said hed leave me too it i went to the nearest phone and called the tech that was on vacation gttech hey airz did you get the isp to come and fix the internet i realized i never updated him on that situation didnt matter gtme oh yeah hey off topic the cat that goes into the roof any chance you know where those cords go gttech hahaha carefree wants to put in the ports for the wall huh gtme yeah something like that gttech has he tried to get you to wear the orange jumpsuit yet i looked down at my orange garments did he plan this gtme actually im already wearing them gttech haha rookie error hed never make you actually go into the roof in you own clothes now youll have to go into the roof gtme that metal frame holding up the roof tiles will never support my weight gttech oh what ever you do dont step on the roof tiles just walk on tops of the walls ive been up there a few times the walls can support you gtme errr gttech just remember dont step on the roof tiles they cant take any weight at all i hung up the phone resigned myself to my fate of climbing in the roof i thought about being bored this was the opposite of that i didnt know which was better at least i was warm i set a ladder against the wall next to the switch i grabbed some masking tape a marker pen some paper and prepared myself carefree caught me half way up the ladder as i was marking in the roof which cords needed to be found i put a little masking tape tag on the ones that i needed to follow gtcarefree all ready to go up i just got a call from our tech he said to remember just walk on the walls gtme yep i better get started i got myself into the roof cavity and balanced myself on the wall below me i started following cables first cable i followed dropped down between two walls i realized i had no idea where i was i cracked open a roof tile next to me and looked down at the office below it was one of the meeting rooms i figured id have to get fairly close to the cable to find it in the cavity so i opened up the roof tile some more and places some tape on the wall exactly where the cable dropped down second cable i followed it ended in an office its occupant looked rather confused about a man in the roof marking the wall with masking tape oddly he still didnt say a single thing about it third cable i followed it opened up the tile in the roof and looked down at the room below the red haired lady looked up from her desk straight at me i realized at this point i was in the roof opening a tile into a room id just been expressly told to go away from i waited for the scream 
hello tfts it has been a while since i posted i hope this new tale from the backwoods tech will entertain you all there i was minding my own business when i got the call gtcx hello is this tollhouse gtme yes whats up gtcx my laptop caught fire when i was trying to overclock the bluray player can you recover my files mind explodes at this point gtme wait what say that again i wanted to make sure i wasnt mishearing what was being said gtcx my bluray player was skipping and lagging so i tried to overclock it gtme sigh ok wait a moment before we even get to file recovery i just have to know how gtcx i looked up a pinout guide on google and found where the power leads on my bluray drive in my laptop were because i remembered that you told me that it takes a little extra power when overclocking to make things faster so i carefully soldered in extra power from an old poweradapter i had laying around that wasnt being used gtme wait wait wait you did what you said it caught fire how did it catch fire gtcx well i was watching a movie when it started stuttering and slowing down again i plugged in the poweradapter while the movie was running thinking it would speed it up and boy did it it sounded like a little drill and then i heard a pop sound and started smelling smoke i opened up the drive and my disc had shattered and smoke started pouring out it got really hot then i saw a small flame coming out from my keyboard i unplugged it really fast and then dumped it in the bathtub to put it out at this point all i could do was sit there listening over the phone to this description get worse and worse i truly knew that nothing i would do could fix this situation as i expected the hdd in the laptop to be ruined after getting the details and getting the laptop delivered it was even worse than expected there was a wire hanging out from the bluray drive thus confirming at least that part of the story there were still pieces of glittery bluray plastic here and there the keyboard was burned but not completely melted through i managed to get into the laptop without destroying things worse and found what i thought though not quite the way i thought it i called up the customer to give them the bad news gtme sorry to let you know but i cant recover anything if there was sensitive information that you truly need you can take the drive to a datarecovery site but it will be pretty expensive gtcx why cant you get it you got it before when the drive wouldnt even spin gtme that is because there is a time trick you can use to make a locked up drive spin again until you turn it off it wont ever work after that i cant fix this this is beyond sticking a hard drive in a freezer for a couple of hours your drive connector melted off i cant connect it to any of my equipment so i cant retrieve the data overclocking your bluray drive destroyed your harddrive im sorry gtcx oh well nothing too important was on that drive guess next time ill ask for help before overclocking the drive maybe you could overclock it properly next time mental facepalm
my first job was at a momandpop style not really it had employees but it was run that badly coding body shop people brought ideas and money to us and wed turn them into programs or websites or theyd bring us the code that some other company or relative had hacked together excreted and wed try to make it actually work i spent years there which in retrospect was about years too many heres one of the first experiences that shouldve been my cue to leave this particular story occurs months after i began working there even though i was a newbie id proven i knew what i was doing so i got moved onto a more challenging project challenging is probably not the right way to describe it a horrible mess would be more accurate this was a delphi application that had been cobbled together by various companies before us that should have been the first warning the end result was that something which should have been simple like adding a toplevel menu no functionality to the main window took an entire day the ide crashed a lot because of the weird things the project was doing but i wouldve been fine if it werent for the client this client was very focused on his applications success he was convinced that the issues hed had with previous companies were entirely their fault to ensure that his barelythere specifications were implemented to his satisfaction he would come and sit with us devs while we coded the feature as in he would watch us and tell us what we were doing wrong and complain we were being slow and talk on his cellphone and type on his laptop basically our office was his office and our management were okay with this because he was paying had signed a contract saying he would pay a lot of money of course us devs didnt have any say in this matter but we eventually adjusted to the new normal now my standard morning routine is probably very similar to yours in that i dont start work the moment i walk in the door i spend my first minutes to an hour checking my email and some websites news and webcomics there was a prohibition from management not to use the internet too much because we had a data cap another story for another time but generally just after youd arrived or just before you were gonna leave was seen as okay on one particular morning this client arrived early while i was still reading webcomics i didnt know he was there because i was listening to music and i didnt know he had sat in silence watching me read webcomics for maybe minutes before he went to complain to management the first i knew about it was when i was called into the financial managers office and chewed out for wasting the clients time and being dishonest the reason for this was the fact that clients were billed not hourly but in minute intervals every day us devs were expected to capture our working time accurately and precisely into an application that was used to bill the customers at the end of the month that took all the responsibility for billing off management and placed it on the devs it also meant that clients could see a detailed breakdown of what us devs had allegedly been doing this client made the accusation that because i wasnt working for minutes i was obviously billing him for the time and therefore the company was in breach of contract the financial manager who chewed me out for this without asking me for the facts beforehand was one of the most useless ststains ive ever had the displeasure of working with he was also a batfk crazy hollow moon lizard people conspiracy theorist this may or may not have something to do with the fact that the company was rarely more than barely profitable he consistently took clients sides against us devs because he couldnt say no to the guys paying the bills he wanted to fire me for upsetting the client and lying but fortunately calmer heads prevailed and i was kept on although quickly transferred to another project this incident was a tipping point in the companys relationship with this client there were a lot of other things going on behind the scenes that i had no knowledge of the end result was that a decision was taken to fire the client but before this could be done he sued my employer they settled out of court for what i later found out was about years worth of my salary at the time what did the client do next found another unsuspecting software company ended up suing them for a far larger amount and won we later found out that suing was this clients modus operandi he would pick a small software company promise them buckets of cash get them to sign a very specific contract dump his crappy code on them then interfere to ensure that they breached their contract and get his money back and more it seems that in my case he decided that sooner was better than later which was fortunate because if he had waited until we inevitably missed a deadline he wouldve been able to sue for a far larger amount than my employer have been able to afford and he almost certainly wouldve won because i reside in a country where at the time laws still had to be written to cater for software tldr i got my employer sued by pissing off a client turned out that i actually helped the company dodge a much larger lawsuit hence the company survived
my attempts at garnering moral support from my girlfriend had failed after recounting the days events she thought my overreaction was simply the male chauvinist in me speaking out against a woman who was just struggling in a mans world and in her eyes doing it well arriving for work i had three video conferences to get set up planned for exactly the same start times after working diligently to get them set up i finally set off for the ground floor the home of it support this time having grown smart of angies disposition for anyone drinking coffee i swung by the kitchen first oh yes angies still on form today i sit at my desk and fire up my machine angie glares at me whatever im learning to ignore it anything to say she sniped ok i wasnt quite expecting it to be that openended no came my reply accompanied with my best whats going on ere then look off we go to her meeting room which appears to have become her favorite place to dress down her troops half expecting an array of torture weapons to now adorn the walls she slammed the door behind us why were you late she demanded confused i informed her i wasnt late i was in fact minutes early i had arrived at to get the video conferences set up for despite the fact that my shift wasnt actually due to start till anyway however due to a slight technical issue whereby sound from the american side of the video conference had failed i was working with a counterpart to resolve the issue thus arriving at my desk at im sure you can imagine how well my explanation was received i may as well have made up a story about having to perform a few impromptu acts of lion taming after some had escaped from the zoo and found their way into the building trapping me for minutes it would have been just as well listened to she then proceeded to have me calculate with her on the white board that if i was minutes late every day how much i would effectively cost the company over the course of a year which worked out to approximately working days she then demanded to know why i felt it was ok to cost the company days and what was i going to do to make amends despite offering to refer her to ticket numbers requesting video conference set up evidence of my keycard accessing the building minutes before my shift the end result was i was minutes late for work itd be added on at the end of the day and that was the end of it she then demanded i called your work mobile why do you not have your work mobile aha one i can win you had me give it away to a new starter in mondays it induction angie demanded to know why i hadnt ordered another one from vodafone sadly vodafone have already distributed our contracted quota of blackberry smartphones the nokias we have are basically junk and dont integrate with email kinda crucial for our work and until the new starter feels like swapping back my blackberry for a rubbish nokia i would be without not a very likely scenario as you can imagine sadly no i didnt win ordered to retrieve an old nokia and new sim card she demanded to know if other members of nd line were also similarly furnished i knew where this was headed no more blackberries for anyone wed all be on the rubbish partsbin nokias by the end of the day this made me wonder about the subject of the rat on the one hand given i had now inadvertently ratted my team twice now frogmarched into culdesacs of inevitable verbal doom by her spitefully clever wordplay i just wondered if the rat was indeed all of us who at various times had fallen foul of her twisted bent nature but no someone showed her how to use a printer someone retrieved ticket logs from touchpaper someone put her onto the it cupboard the thought bothered me an urgent call awaited my attention when i got back coffee now cold and bitter to the taste it seemed a pa had a nonfunctioning pc rushing up to the scene it seemed that someone had attempted to help the pa out prior to her calling support the year old work experience kid they had up there diagnosed a ram problem and tried to reseat it however this had failed to do the job and the pa remained with a beeping machine after trying a few rudimentary things it was apparent that there was no quick fix i unplugged and picked it up promising to return moments later with one of our spare stock machines by way of a temporary fix not ideal but at least she could get to her profile data we used roaming profiles and use standard services a bline made for the it cupboard i found my card failed to open the door i tried again no luck defeated i made my way back to the desk pas machine in hand i returned with mafg whose card also failed to unlock the door the reason became clear upon our return to its one of our number who had hit a similar problem had found out that angie had also demanded our access be removed from the it cupboard from now on access was to be via facilities and only after her approval great especially useful as angie had already left the office with her drinking group to experiment with yet another of starbucks many offerings running around like a madman trying to find anyone from facilities who wasnt already changing a light bulb or driving a forklift and was willing to bend the rules slightly a few rd liners tried their access cards to find that they too were now ostracized from our precious bounty our actions were similarly stunted when pleading our case towards balding it head who simply responded that he supported angies decision and that undeployed hardware was technically responsibility of facilities ok maybe technically but this is stupid minutes later still no angie still no facilities the pas umpteenth attempt to get news on her machine came through from helpdesk closely followed by a call from he dept head demanding to know why we were stopping his pa from working ok nothing for it lets see what we can do with her machine already receiving glares from three fat finance ladies as i begin tearing the side off her machine we set to work after various tests mafg and i agree that the power supply sounds like the culprit kicking my machine off as theyre the same model i can only think to try mine minutes later armed only with a knife stained with old jam which had been liberated from the canteen at some point and found in someones drawer i managed to remove psu screws from my machines psu and the pas machine a quick hodgepodge to exchange the pas psu we hastily hook back up the cables a quick power on test reveals the glorious windows xp boot screen problem solved we shut it down carefully reattach the bits and pieces and i make for the elevator leaving my own machine stranded on my desk like a recentlysacrificed chicken the murder weapon with most of the jam scraped left adjacent ive reattached pa ladys machine but its all too late her boss is chewing me out over there now being an hour lost of her time despite my best attempts to calm the situation down citing a problem with security access he vows to email my manager immediately going so far as to demand names pa lady thanks me anyway for my efforts in as an apologetic way as she can the day plays itself out to conclusion it takes me until the afternoon to find anyone from facilities to let me into the it cupboard i retrieve a power supply for my own machine and reattach it in the same caveman like style as it had been withdrawn angie passes my desk as i finish up pointed at the knife and demanded what is that i got rd of the way into the first sentence of explaining its role in reattaching a new power supply when she snapped take it back to the canteen right now i spent the rest of the day on desk visits guiding users around various windows issues doing a desk move and i finish the day up with mentoring a guy on the virtues of active directory i knew i had an angie moan coming i was expecting it at any minute but to my surprise angie left for the day what no come back no dragging into the meeting room of doom for another lesson in stupid that pas boss was very definite about laying the smackdown where is it driving home it bothered me that angie had said nothing about this complaint had she realized she was wrong no i dismissed that very quickly total bitches like that are never wrong in their eyes it usually means that people like me failed to understand properly and need a shouting at to get it through my thick skull but where was the backlash i was stopped at lights watching a mother scold her child as they crossed the road this made me realize it was all just another spiteful orchestration by angie she knew that i knew there was a complaint she knew id be expecting her to smack me down over it but what she knew and what i didnt think of until now was that there was no sense on doing this on a friday its the weekend after all she wants this exact situation she wants me wondering what sort of smackdown awaits me monday morning and she wants me to think about this all weekend just anything to make sure the stress builds up oh angie clever very clever previous entries 
note this is my first tfts story i am not too great with formatting so please do forgive me if it looks awful and it is an eyesore so a little bit of backround i am a year old kid who is fairly decent with computers unfortunately my mother thinks it is okay to tell everyone and their mother about this so of course she brings home computers every week for me to fix for free as a favor to her friends i have asked her multiple times to not do this but she shrugs it off i dont really mind that much but it is still a little annoying anyways about days ago she came home with this windows xp machine with matching monitor mouse and keyboard and a phone i am kinda confused why the she put a office phone in there but whatever my mom says to call her friend to ask her what she wants me to do with it i call her and she says she just wants some important medical documents off the computer and to put it on her flash drive i tell her that i can do that and i will call her when i am finished now this came off a little odd to me because i wondered why she couldnt just simply copy and paste these files herself i shrug it off and boot the machine when i see what is on the login screen i literally say out loud what the fuck on the login screen there is a cisco anyconnect vpn and a domain login for a very large medical insurance company also in the corner a little box saying it is completely unlawful to login without being a member of this company etc etc now i am pretty sure it is completely illegal to even try to login in to this thing without violating hippa laws so i call her anonher me me gt mehey i was just wondering why it is asking for login credentials for a vpn and insert large medical insurance company here domain gt anon oh that it is jus gt me is this your computer gt anon umm kind of i work for this company and i just wanted some copies of the medical documents for insert some persons name here gt me umm i am pretty sure what youre asking me to do is completely illegal if you didnt already know even copying these files for personal use goes against hippa laws also it is completely illegal for me to even try and log on to this computer please come pick it up and bring it back to your office she then says very fast and worried okay okay okay i will come right now to pick it up sorry for bothering you right now i am extremely confused as to why she wanted me to do something like that and also why she sent me this computer in the first place she could have done this by herself she is lucky i didnt try to contact the company about this i am trying to figure out what she was up to

 i looked down at the laptop on the ground i pinched my nose and tried not to scream gtme so tell me again how did this happen gtdefiant this lady here was carrying the personal computer from its position on the desk to a place closer to the physical connection for the internet which while in transit the device became dislodged from her grip said device then came upon the influence of gravity and accelerated downwards upon connection with the ground the momentum of the device had its energy dissipated into the device itself which has alas led to the current situation the lady in question looked furious at that response her eyes were wild she was angry gtfury it did not become dislodged you pushed me gtdefiant we had no contact i was all the way over here how could i have even touched you my eyes fell fixed on the laptop on the ground its screen was defiantly broken a crack across palm rest spoke of even more damage i picked it up off the floor gtme so i spoke slowly and stared down at the boy and angry lady in front of me i tried to draw out my words gtme between the two of you youve smashed up a laptop gtfury it wasnt i held up my hand for silence and continued slowly gtme then after completely destroying the device youve had a shouting match for five minutes leaving the computer on the floor gtdefiant i dont think this is a fair representation of my stare honed in on defiant until his mouth stopped moving gtme and finally instead of apologising sincerely to the person that now has to clean up this whole mess you attempt to start a second shouting match is that a fair representation i waited for the apologies to come streaming in my ears eagerly anticipating im sorry gtfury he pushed me fury looked angrily at defiant i started to wonder who was really the child here gtdefiant i did n i mean im sorry airz i shouldnt have been shouting gtme get this computer down to it defiant and you fury get back to work fury seemed incensed gtfury he pushed me so i broke my computer and youre not even going to punish him i smiled and walked away back in it defiant held the broken computer in one hand a fearful look in his eyes gtdefiant sorry again that was unprofessional i was honestly surprised it was the first time hed not used long winded ways of saying things gtme as punishment fix that computer in your hand gtdefiant with what parts i pointed to the scraps bin where computers went to die gtdefiant but none of them are even the same model i smiled at him gtme youll make it work its a challenge a few hours later i checked up on defiant hed managed to find a screen to retro fit into the computer gtme how did you go defiant held up a working computer he looked exhausted gtdefiant its all blurry on startup but it works when you hit the desktop gtme good enough did you have fun defiant eyes glazed over in a slightly sinister way gtdefiant that was hell literally hell i smiled at defiant as i threw the laptop hed handed me into the scraps bin gtme welcome to it 
 i had been called up to to the executive floor to drop off a list for the company lawyer on the it loses incurred from the destruction of the air conditioner lawyers come in two categories good and dangerous i wondered which type of lawyer our company would use as i arrived at the meeting room i was surprised to also see the vp sitting at the table next to a well dressed man gtvp airz come in gtme yes im just here to drop off this list of equipment the vp took a look at this list i passed across the table the list wasnt very long gtvp sit down lets get you some coffee the vp summoned a secretary to get me a coffee gtvp now this list it isnt everything you replaced is it gtme what do you mean a coffee arrived gtvp in the last few months much more equipment was replaced then just these items the vp gestured down to the list gtme for upgrades and general maintenance sure gtvp wouldnt you say those items needed replacing sooner as a direct result of damage they sustained from the event i looked over at the lawyer he was staring out the window gtme no equipment just needs replacing occasionally gtvp see the longer this list is airz the better it would be for everyone gtme hahaha i for one am glad he didnt destroy any more equipment the lawyer finally decided to join in the conversation gtlaw maybe you should take a long think about this gtairz sorry gtlaw well a few months is a long time perhaps you missed some items off this list gtairz no i think i got everything law sits back in his chair and gives a nod to the vp gtvp airz no one would know if you did accidentally er forget some things gtlaw yes no one would know if forgotten items where added now gtme forgotten items i looked down at my coffee real coffee doesnt do perjury this was real coffee gtvp anything you can think of i sat back in my chair i smiled gtme no no that list is complete gtlaw ahh well i think that concludes this meeting gtvp no no i dont think hes gotten the message airz if you just gtlaw im going to stop you there vp gtvp wha the lawyer gave me a quick look up and down gtlaw trust me this one he isnt a follower the vp looked livid he stared at me coffee told me not to blink when the vp spoke his voice was filled with rage gtvp everyone here everyone is a follower the room just went silent after that i took a sip of my coffee it urged me to break the silence gtme not the big boss though right i looked down at my coffee mistake 
i walked into the office tuesday morning brandishing a starbucks latte with a ginger shot it was my little way of celebrating my minor victory of no customers waiting to tear my face off for lack of machines ok there was a little part of me happy about getting just a little win over angie my mind was already on the task of prepping up some laptops for the next round of inductees due in a few weeks at this rate i may even get time to reimage my own machine as it badly needed it into the office i go exchanging light pleasantries with the security guards now im not sure why i didnt expect it i thought the battle was won this round was done and dusted and more importantly the meeting room booked for the week mafg looked at me in sympathy as a crowd rallied around meeting room bhit with two facilities guys and several third line guys were gathered in what seemed to be some sort of epic teardown akin to one of those american cop shows exercising a search warrant i walked straight up to own my actions nonchalantly still brandishing my victory coffee bhit seemed to ignore me at first issuing orders to some of the third liners unplugging my gear turning his attentions to me his usually weak and ineffectual voice had now transformed into an authoritative bark as he demanded i dont know what youre playing it but this is not on you cannot turn a meeting room into a comms room add in more bleating with health and safety concerns my explanation of complete lack of build space and subsequent apathy by both him and angie was why i took matters into my own hands rather than annoy several customers still waiting on machines i was ordered back to my desk the thirdline monkeys tore down my mancave which i had lovingly pieced together in as temporary and easily mobile a fashion i could the familiar green tshirt clad facilities guys wheeled away my contraband as i watched the rest of my now tepid coffee disappearing down my throat as evocatively as my victory as it would seem this would eventually serve to complicate matters wholly as the customer machines which had been imaged or were waiting for imaging were taken off to some mystical thirdline hole where i was unable to get at them in fact as it would later transpire i would never see those desktops ever again all the while angie sat with her back to me presumably trying to get to grips with touchpaper i knew she was everything to do with it but at the same time it was only bhit and facilities people up there my answers were provided moments later when bhit came for another chat telling me in no uncertain terms that booking a meeting room to perform it work was totally out of bounds right at that moment fat finance bint appeared by his side she was aching to get her say in too suddenly this was making sense in her finely tuned ultramoralistic vocal tone that could have only been honed over an extensive career of patronizing anyone who crossed her path she pleaded with me that my actions were selfish and wrong you cant just take over meeting rooms we need those rooms all the time for legal purposes you cant just take one they arent there for you to just use as you please her rising inflection that completed every sentence drove through my skull like rusty nails on a blackboard amazing in the time ive been there i dont think ive ever seen finance use one of the meeting rooms once in fact there were eight of them and two were used as archive storage and not locked either most of the rooms sat unused day in day out but now i see the path of treachery angie didnt like the fact shed lost fat finance bint complained on her behalf to her manager he called his people they called their people they eventually called bhit who immediately agreed with his higher ups i threw down the gauntlet we used to build all the time in the it cupboard that was suddenly disallowed we cannot build at our desks we cannot use any of the server rooms as theres no space and now when i book a meeting room through the proper channels to get some work done this is suddenly out of bounds exactly how are we supposed to do our jobs i followed this up by fervently clicking through several open tickets pointing out several tickets requiring build time bhit stood mute as impotent as ever he didnt have the answers or the means to get them he just simply retorted well this is the first ive heard of any problems you need to communicate with your manager more how can it be this difficult to just do your damned job that day i happened to lunch with one of the third line guys i relayed to him our tales of woe following angies arrival he was almost stunned he did mention how hes been unable to access the it cupboard for a while but when he was nd line the it cupboard was always the build area nevertheless i had to admit defeat id already made so many positive impressions up the ladder being cited as a troublemaker was not something that would have been useful i returned to my desk to the first of many emails from a customer dutifully ccing their managers in a typical passiveaggressive style where is my machine you took it three days ago and im still having to use the spare laptop you gave me it seemed i was now more behind work was piling up interteam tensions were getting high and all the while angie sat and clicked around various tickets not saying a word fearing a further reprisal i took finger to keyboard and again demanded angie and bhit work out where our build areas should be as the afternoon grew darker i carried on desk visits refusing to take any more machines away angie rose from her desk at pm and in an unnatural tone just said night all she had managed to win the entire battle without lifting a finger nearly vindicated in her arrogant yet chanty swansong clearly this beast of hell was more learned than me in the art of war and it seemed she held all the cards too was there to be no retribution for this previous pt a new world pt safety pt the it induction from pt pt how to make friends pt marking pt one friday to rue them pt best laid pt its one step for man 
so got a call this morning from a family member i never ever hear from im not even sure how she got my number probably passed on by someone else gt fm hey scott i think i got a virus on my computer since i kept getting popups about tojan this tojan that i click ignored on the popups since i didnt know if i should guarantee them or delete them im pretty sure the guarantee on this computer has expired gt me ok well trojan definitely sounds like a virus but that could have been internet popups are you sure it came from your antivirus gt fm well i dont know what antivirus is but these are given to us by the company so i dont know anything about them gt me wait wait are you calling from work gt fm well yes our home computer is working fine gt me have you called your it department they really should be the one looking at this gt fm no arent you family cant you just get on my computer and clean it out for me gt me maybe i could but its really not for me to put my hands in the it department should really look at it they will know what to do and can likely give you a replacement if it needs to be completely cleaned out it would be risky and likely against policy for me to do any work on them i also dont think the it department would appreciate me invoicing them for it gt fm invoicing but your family it only takes a minute of your time i thought you would be willing to help out i heard so many good things about you i guess they were wrong gt me listen like anyone else i cant spend my days fixing everyones work problems especially if they have it people fully capable of doing the work which theyre paid to do if it was your home computer maybe but this is really not something im comfortable working on gt fm you should have just told me you didnt know how to fix it instead of making up excuses im just going to call other family member good with computers and hell fix it gt me thats not what i gt fm click you just cant get through some of them 
so this is probably going to be a long one twss so to set the stage i inherited my environment from the previous it that left without so much as even the wifi password so theres settings that i didnt set or check as i believed he was a strong administrator so we have a user lets call him bob i havent liked bob since the day that i started working at my job as a sysadmin he hovers around peoples desk waiting for them to say something first even if he has something to say sometimes for up to minutes if you simply ignore him we have quite a lot running on a single server with the unfortunate bit of it controlling printing file management our day to day programs on the network our documentation and for the most part its pretty accessible to most users to be able to modify documents since they need to be able to create work instructions and whatnot so bob is one of my people i support that is a problem person to begin with his outlook somehow magically breaks he is required by his manager to be able to install programs for his job and with that comes your casual spyware and whatnot that i constantly have to wipe his butt about this later will haunt me so monday i am sitting at my desk and one of the managers tells me that the president of the company cant access his files this is a very big deal so it takes top priority i go to his files to see that all of his files are ending in micro for the file extensions so say a spreadsheet was spreadsheetxlsmicro now i didnt know much about why it happened so simply renaming the file to remove the added extension showed a garbled mess this is when i realized that the files are being encrypted i checked out his pc and its entirely clean not even the simplest issue with his pc for what i can find as im checking this pc more people are reporting the issue i send out an immediate email saying that they need to save any files locally as im pulling the plug on the server to start checking things out and with a huge outcry from users i assure them this is a last resort option the server like the presidents computer was absolutely clean but tons of the files were encrypted we take a look at the timestamp for when the first file became encrypted and started getting the dhcp timestamps for who got a new ip at this time in case it was a rogue computer that was connected to our network that was causing the issues and it just so happened that we had a list of or so pcs that grabbed a new ip during a minute period my supervisor and i start checking every last pc on the list and a lot of them showed no issue and a handful of them showed encrypted files i start checking for malware and happened to miss the one that had the malware on it so we start disconnecting all pcs on the list to stop the bleeding and start copying my backup to the drives effected by the encryption we spend about hours after this point after already working roughly hours that day getting things back to normal and notice that another drive was being encrypted on top of the ones we had fixed and its a department drive we see who all has access to both drives and then start checking pcs the next day with our server pulled back off the network and low and behold bob is on the list bob comes to my desk first thing in the morning complaining that his piece of junk computer thinkpad from doesnt boot anymore we also noticed that whatever pc was doing the encryption has stopped red flag mind you this user tried blaming me for his pc issues after working on his pc as if i dont know what im doing i try to start his laptop up and the thing wont even act like its loading windows just splash screen black screen splash screen etc i take out his hdd and toss it onto a dock and i immediately get a call from my hq saying that my protection software is lighting up like a christmas tree this is our guy hes complaining about not having the ability to do his work and im working with hq to get things back online before i reimage the machine though they wanted a full log of all the bad things from his hdd scan and it was quite a bit essentially his pc was so bad that it encrypted everything but the os and something else came in and destroyed the boot loader we are now finally back to normal with tons of permissions redone properly this time and backing up everything again like a madman we are going to be discussing his fate with my supervisor manager him and his manager today also his laptop feels like the back was sanded with a high grit sandpaper now given everything through the time ive been here i wanted it to not be him i was hoping for the one redeeming factor of believing it was him and seeing someone else fall but it had to be bob tldr user who is bad with computers encrypts nearly my entire server taking most of our company offline for the entire duration it took from pulling the plug to getting the server back online where users can work probably going to use this as the final excuse of why we need a redundant server edit one detail i forgot to put in is that he installed a trial mcafee because he believed it was going to be better than our installed protection which caused our protection to go dormant as he defaulted it to the expired av from over a year ago 
ok so years ago i used to work for a company made business software the software we created made a ridiculously complex task merely complex and companies all over the world use it to save them big bucks in the cost of doing business i was the qa test lead for the as platform in addition to our other platforms on our flagship product we covered a wide variety of platforms but the as was our largest base and the assignment to that platform demanded zero mistakes so we had just completed testing and shipping a software update that was not only sorely needed for the fixes in it but also for the mandatory compliance updates it held without which the clients would figuratively be dead in the water after the deadline the day before the deadline i get a call from one of my friends who is a platform programmer for this product on the as bgg we have a client that cant install addon to flagshipware did you test it of course i tested it my job depended on that getting rolled out and ready to go user says it installs everything but the addon and he is dead in the water can you check it out customer service is trying to fix it with him on the phone this is not a new user either this is their senior operator for our product and he knows shit from shinola im screwed now my office was on the nd floor and the server room is on the th since i had to manually load the cds in the optical drive and initiate the install from the terminal emulator at my desk i ended up running up and down the stairs numerous times to run a clean install of the product which meant one trip for the main program and one trip for each of the addons i wiped the machine reinstalled the product addon and addon with no problem in between runs upstairs frantic runs i might add as i pondered what i would be carrying my things out in when they fired me cs and the platform specialists blew up my phone with questions i did this times running up and down the stairs completely soaked in sweat and regretting how long it had been since i had done any real cardio on my last trip up as i shot through the hallway on the th floor to the server room to try and break it again my best buddy dave the platform specialist is standing in the hallway with cup of coffee in hand laughing his ass off at me with actual tears streaming down his face this isnt funny asshole im going to lose my job if i cant figure this out its hilarious says dave cs just called me and they figured out what the problem was my god what was it i cant recreate it cs happened to dig around in their account while they were trying to solve it client couldnt install it because they didnt purchase addon theyve never had it and had no reason to install it fortunately the client was on the west coast and we were on the east or id be writing this story from prison as a convicted murderer right now edited punctuation error
i have a feeling way too many of us have experienced this situation corporate policy dictates that users cannot get upgraded hardware replacements are same as common sense does not apply one site that i was supporting made the decision to upgrade from xp to user calls with a complaint of a poor performing pc apps were taking forever to load other apps were crashing randomly the best course of action was clearly to re image the device after i brought the machine to our cave i looked at the specs it was a dell optiplex with mb ram i brought it to the attention of the team lead who instantly screams at me how many times do i have to tell you no upgrades thatll run fine on mb uh rodent win s minimum spec calls for at least gb in fact it recommends just re image it as is so i do what i am told to do and naturally the customer is upset because of how slow the machine is running but there is nothing i can do the customer rightfully so starts making a stink about his new issues next thing i know im being called into the office why did you re image his machine with windows i was doing what you told me to do dont tell me what i told you to do i dont work there any more
 frozen i waited like the last biscuit in a packet knowing my fate i was about to be assaulted by the mouth of a human and i couldnt do anything about it i knew it was coming i waited the red haired lady looked up at me our eyes locked this is it her mouth opened i waited for the crushing gtredcheer airz i was just about to come get you perfect timing always know where youre wanted aye gtme i wha i slowly came to the realization that i wasnt actually a biscuit i was escaping the trap fate had laid out for me no screaming for me today gtredcheer so i finished installing windows and i copied all my files over to this computer redcheer then turned the screen around so i could see it from my position lying in the roof the computer however was off so my diagnostic talents were slightly lacking gtme okay gtredcheer but none of the programs are working properly so i looked it up on the internet i looked down at the computer it hit me that i was doing tech support from the ceiling it was oddly fun gtme thatll be the registry probably gtredcheer thats what the internet said too they said i need a registry editor uh oh gtredcheer but the internet said it should only be used by people who knew what they where doing gtme huh gtredcheer so i was about to come get you you can show me how you guys get these registries from working properly gtme well to be honest we actually have a disk image that your normal tech made before he left i looked over at the red haired lady she threw me a confused face i finally figured out she didnt know what i was talking about shed made me think she was another tech talking about registry editors who does that but techs gtme oh er an image is like a clone of the old drive gtredcheer so all this was useless she looked over at her computer shed just spent an age installing windows on she seemed pretty sad gtme er no its not useless not if you learnt something and you learn by doing remember the red haired lady looked down at her computer a moment longer then suddenly looked up she was beaming with happiness again gtredcheer youre in the roof gtme haha yeah gtredcheer thats so cool i looked about it really wasnt cool gtme actually its pretty awful its dusty cramped and you cant stand up gtredcheer so cool though gtme are you even listening to me she wasnt in fact shed already left the room i was hanging from the ceiling in about thirty seconds later i heard banging on the ladder it was almost on the other side of the building as i thought about how quickly she got over the other side of the office and found the ladder i heard a loud bang a loud bang followed closely by ahhhhhhhhh oh the scream found me eventually so i am a biscuit 
i originally posted this but either deleted it or didnt submit it as part of government service i was supposed to take a training course each year my boss decided that he would send me on an exchange course which wasnt strictly my job area but parts overlapped a week later he stopped by my desk gtboss dpg i need you to work on something for us our service desk software already automates emails but if anyone emails our public folder it needs to acknowledge that we must respond to them within hours gtme surely an automated response doesnt count and they want something more personal such as a phone call or a personalised email gtboss not at this time its purely a receipt email gtme then just turn on read receipts for the mail domain case closed gtboss not everyone emails from inside the organisation especially if their email is faulty or theyre a school gtme i suppose we could put an autoresponder on it it would be quickanddirty but we could put images and other stuff on it gtboss write a proposal and you can run it by the change advisory group report written i head to the cag meeting on friday and we discuss it gtcag brilliant idea how do you want to implement it gtme i was going to leave that to the servers team gtcag ok well approve the change on the provision that servers make the change for about six months we used this without incident send us an email and you get a message back to say thank you and that the call will be looked at within your sla a link to the sla and the latest news item were also included then we consulted with a different team and set theirs up before we knew it eighteen seperate teams within the council had this and the it departments of partner organisations nhs and the local hospital the nhs it department sent us an advisory on the issue of new smartcard readers our email received it and pinged back a response their email responded to ours and their response generated a response from our server this kicked off at on a day when i wasnt due in till by the time i got in everyone was in a state of panic our mail queue had around a thousand messages in it and no email was going out the server was so overloaded that the remote management software wouldnt connect the server team arrived five minutes after me coffees in hands and after a thirty minute meeting went to the server room and disconnected the ethernet cable from the rear of the exchange servers they then removed the responder restarted the servers and reconnected gthead of it this mail flood we had was your fault dpg its cost us who knows how much money in wasted time to fix i hate it when government or similar services attempt to monetize their losses or the work they do they never lose money on anything as they dont sell goods or services gtme my report did state that two autoresponders could cause a flood like this its in the appendix under potential errors gthead of it nonchalant wave of his hand i never read the appendix on any report gtme im sure the server team looked at it gtserver team leader we did but we were overruled
as i closed the door on my cozy warm house on a bitterly frosty thursday morning clutching my car keys in one hand and a small plastic scraper in the other i immediately regretted my decision of not purchasing gloves the previous night while shopping my car bellowed smoke as it churned into life as my red cracking knuckles powered the scraper into the solid ice on the car windows the fact i had purchased a ford for its clever quickclear windscreen technology just seemed to mock me more as the damned thing was had failed to operate at all over the last few days i made it to work and felt rather disappointed with the turnout of animal rights protesters the promise of an impending and very visual protest outside the gates of the center as emailed by hr seemed rather overkill as i spied a single figure waving a poorly legible placard from near the gate being carefully watched by two security guards it seemed a rather poor effort i duly parked my car in the usual spot next to a brand new looking jaguar i admired its sleek lines and somewhere in the back of my head thought that one of these days all this toil will be worth it exchanging early morning pleasantries with various security guards i arrived at my desk and removing my jacket the cold radiating outward i couldnt help but notice a familiar stern sniff jesus angie was here before me there i was hoping for at least an hour or two of recovery from this mornings voyage before having her in my face mere moments had i sat down to get my machine warmed i reached into my drawer for my coffee cup only to find angie standing right next to me her stature akin to that of a hitchcock serial killer armed with her coffee cup she placed it on my desk dragged over a nearby chair and sat with notebook in hand can i help i politely inquired i want to see what you get up to in the morning i motioned towards my empty coffee cup but she meant business you can get your tea later i want to see what youre going to do first open the paper program she meant touchpaper the next two hours was like being dragged over icy knives naked i had started the day with eleven open tickets six of which i knew were long ones and had already made appointments to service that day the other five i could knock out easily while waiting for builds to finish thus leaving plenty time free to pick up anything new that came in angies plan was for me to pretty much assign myself almost every open ticket even those not to do with nd line support my colleagues started to arrive one by one and on seeing this spectacle shrunk into their seats trying to root out any ticket which would mean escaping their desks and the vicinity of angie by oclock my queue looked like a ticketbomb had gone off open tickets crikey what was i meant to be doing this morning angie had retreated back to her lair as middleaged family guy sent me a quick communicator message do you want me to have a look at some of those cases for you i duly replied whatever he fancied doing go for it after taking a couple of password resets angies snarl came from her desk jon i did not tell you to make others do your work for you mafg if you have nothing to do i am more than happy to give you something to do mafg quickly retreated back to his own call list without saying a word motionless minutes elapsed until angie walked up to mafg and ordered him to accompany her they disappeared into the murky depths of the corridor swallowed by the blackness to some horrible fate i decided to keep to my plan that day i retrieved five machines from leavers desks and made for the it cupboard to get them reimaged for some imminent arrivals and replacements i sat in the dimly lit room as the unattended scripts did their bit i had a reps laptop in several bits to replace a faulty screen before he would leave for a flight the sound of the security badge failing in the electronic lock followed by the sincere knock on the door thrice performed meant it could only have been one person up until now although she knew it existed angie had no idea how to get to this place much less have access to it putting on my proface i duly opened the door immediately angie went for the neck a starbucks tall firmly clasped in her bony fingers eyes like a spear what are you doing in here why arent you at your desk what is going on in here i politely showed her around the it cupboard though what i really wanted to do was batter her with bits of dell laptop and bury her somewhere in with the junk p viglens kept only for laboratories and their outdated gear the prospect of me attempting to fit her bitter bony body into a fullsize tower also crossed my mind not happy with my explanation theres a surprise she ordered me back to desk despite my protests that the rep was expecting their laptop back before leaving today for his flight to whereeverthehell and the fact that the machines i was imaging needed to be on desks by close of business planted at my desk she left me there with a now get on with your work and dont let me catch you again i felt impotent time for a reaction i figured if the above work doesnt happen im in it with several department heads if i go back im in it with angie so i fired an email to balding it head ccing in angie asking for direction it read i have work going on in the it cupboard which requires resolution angie has made it clear that i am not to return to the it cupboard can you please provide direction as to how this work should be completed mere seconds after i signed my fate angie frogmarched me and some spotty helpdesk kid back to the it cupboard she ordered us complete the work as she watched and verified every step of course spotty helpdesk kid had no idea what any of these nd line processes were about and questioned nearly every stage an hour later we were finished and went our seperate ways to redeploy our efforts as i walked away with two machines and a laptop bag slung she said i want you back at your desk in ten minutes dont let me come looking for you that afternoon angie sent us all an email we couldnt help but imagine it read aloud by her razor sharp tongue each paragraph almost lyrical in its context her order was that the it cupboard is no longer to be used for any sort of maintenance or work it is for storage of computing equipment only having recently learned that her circle of bitter women in positions of power that drink too much starbucks coffee also included some oversized tank of a hr administrator the icing to the cake was present and correct citing health and safety violations and that any further activities would be referred to management for disciplinary a few of us held vigil over our lost it cupboard as we watched several burly men from facilities tear down our nest the glorious ghost server which held all our builds slammed onto a trolley ready for its trip back to the server room our beautifully installed network cabling and network switch was unceremoniously ripped from the wall and tossed into a rubbish old box our carefully ordered and neatly packed away toolkits were also in a box it seemed that they had been claimed in the name of facilities our electric kettle together with a tin containing our hotel and restaurant liberated packs of tea bags coffee sugar and dairy creamers were tossed into a black bag headed for the skip we discussed the predicament in depth how would we image machines with a threeitem limit on our desks where would we go to dismantle machines to replace or upgrade hardware these sentiments were later echoed when one of the server admins asked i notice the ghost server is on a trolley in one of the network riser rooms i thought you guys needed that for building machines yeah we did too my shift ended and i made for the sanctuary of my car again a thick layer of ice and snow serving to only impede my progress i again noticed the brand new jaguar which had miraculously seemed immune from the effects of this brutal british summer you can all predict who was behind the wheel angie glanced as she noticed me approach over her black leather steering wheel no smile or acknowledgement she reversed out of her space as her shining black jag powered her away from my presence her work for the day was done thorougly deflated i clicked my ford mondeos remote key strange the remote wouldnt work i put the key into the lock and the central locking groaned into life sitting into my ice pit realizing the water that had leaked from the roof onto my seat had now frozen a quick turn of the key also revealed that it also wouldnt start a few more tries and there could only be one culprit my reward from the days toil was one flat battery and an hour waiting for the rac recovery person to arrive and give me a jump start bang goes my early leaving time what a day 
 ive got a few weeks off between jobs i had originally decided to go for a week road trip to fund the trip i had agreed to do some short term work with a friend of mine a part of it was to create a phishing awareness presentation for a small financial services firm fancyfirm i had put in financial services specific content talking about how the group had tricked high ranking users into going to sites with fake owa login pages to steal email credentials the fin phish was really nice it was an email from a client of the firm claiming that an employee is disclosing sensitive data at this discussion thread i may pull my business with a link to a faked discussion board with fake owa authentication popups i gave an example of the phish as well as sending around the fireeye report to fancyfirms it director they were happy enough to pay me a few weeks later im taking a break from my road trip at a gas station in a rural area looking for cold seltzer water and having to settle for perrier i check my phone and notice multiple texts and phone calls from fancyfunds head of accounting seems theres an emergency i call the head of accounting head of accountingthat thing happened meuh which thing head of accountingthat phishing thing meok so youre getting similar phishes just delete them and remind people not to click on the links head of accountinghow do i make it stop mei made some recommendations to the director of it but nothings going to completely eliminate these head of accountingunacceptable i entered my username and password but it keeps popping back up i want to see who is posting sensitive information meoh i didnt understand before i cant help you you need to call your director of it and he needs to call my friend you all have to do a password party head of accountingyou need to help us now mei tried to help you when i told you about this scam i must not have been helpful call my friend instead 
this sounds unbelievable because honestly who is this stupid but i swear to god this really happened today and only you guys will understand so im helping a customer reset their password running through the usual rigmarole heres exactly how it went me your password has to be at least characters long with an uppercase and lowercase letter and a number in it customer so it has to be characters me yes or more it just has to be at least characters customer can it be characters me brain explodes if it wasnt for their completely vacant stare i wouldve assumed they were totally fcking with me but no just stupid 
im not it officially yet let me know if this story doesnt belong here i guess it does thank you all im a designer in a small company our it guy left the country a few months ago and since im technically inclined ive somehow been turned into the inoffice it guy i can imagine thats a story youve heard before being a small company its a very casual setting lots of grumpy brits that swear frequently and punish their hardware when stuff goes wrong i tried telling them to be nice to their computers otherwise they wont listen to you and so it has become sort of a running joke that i can talk to the computers since of their issues are very simple fixes which brings me to today ive been very busy the last week so i had not had a chance to look at a computer that everyone just told me had gone to shit i turned it on an sure enough it was completely messed up i wish i had taken a picture but there was a lot of random shapes and colour and noise all over the screen i sat there for a moment another seemingly impossible situation that ive never been in before i just stared at the screen while weighing my options is it a hardware fault should i take the hd out has the video card failed im not trained in it but im a pretty good problem solver so i was taking pretty wild guesses i moved the mouse around a little bit and noticed some of the pixels changed accordingly eventually i noticed distorted letters scattered around the screen and a blue bar around the top i realized there was a window there but it was impossible to make anything of it i managed to grab hold of it i started moving it around and saw about of the pixels on the screen were displaying correctly moving the windows through one of these readable blocks made it possible to read the letters one buy one i was able to make out the words do you want to restore it sounded promising so i found the ok button and clicked it twice computer restarted and was fine i turned the monitor towards my coworkers with a huge grin on my face id like to say that the office erupted in applause but that wouldnt be true some lighthearted clapping was heard though one of them had a face that looked confused and horrified im scared of you man but i cant say im surprised he said edit thanks for the gold and the warm welcome to the subreddit i have some others stories that i will be sure to share with you on a later date
we have a helpdesk app which has an agent that launches the helpdesk portal on our users computers the agent is javabased and it collects data and allows remote connections etc however most of what the user ever sees is if i press f the helpdesk opens well the agent configuration was messed up on a users machine if he hit f it popped up a window that said choose the program you would like to open this file javaexe then showed a list of programs to choose from when i saw this i wasnt paying close enough attention so my brain said helpdesk open in browser i click browser and i selected internet explorer windows said ok put an entry in the registry from now on all exe files will open in internet explorer at once every icon on his desktop changed to an internet explorer icon i checked default programs first maybe i could just reset the association unfortunately there is no entry to set a default for exe files because who in their right mind would set a exe file association alright looks like i have to do this manually lets open regedit start gt run gt regedit internet explorer pops open would you like to run or save regeditexe i click run internet explorer pops open would you like to run or save regeditexe alllllright maybe i can do this as another user start gt run gt cmd internet explorer pops open would you like to run or save cmdexe right cmd is an executable ok so lets try just doing runas from the run dialog because at least the run dialog works start gt run gt runas userdomainadminaccount cmd internet explorer pops open would you like to run or save runasexe this user is on a thin client connecting to a vm in a pool of possible vms so i said well this machine is hosed no big i will log him off and put him on a new machine then well just recompose the old vm so i logged him off and logged him back on to another machine except the user preferences for file associations is in hkeycurrentuser which is part of the roaming profile which syncs with every machine you log into finally i went back to my pc and created a fixmereg file with the following contents windows registry editor version hkeycurrentusersoftwaremicrosoftwindowscurrentversionexplorerfileextsexeuserchoice i went back to the target computer and merged the reg file and that fixed it

short one which happened not minutes ago those of you that work on helpdesks andor operations can most likely relate to this one users have a tendency to call for issues with their accounts when they inevitably enter the wrong password one too many times when their password expires and anything else they can come up with theyre pretty inventive so here i am sitting at my desk when the phone rings caller id is a lady from eastern europe lets call her lee and she has trouble with her account normally speaking during the day this is a job for the helpdesk but its been a pretty slow day and im strangely enough in a good mood gt me hello this is it how may i help you today gt lee i think my account is locked out gt me ok could you provide me your account ill take a look gt lee its userlee goes to look up user account no issues found except the password being past the required changing date bingo gt me alright i see here that your account is not locked nor is it expired however i see here that your password needs to be changed could you check this please gt lee no thats not right thats not what the error message says gt me could you please read me the error message gt lee the password of your account has expired and must be chan thank you click penny dropped
 as i looked down at the busted remains of a screen i thought about just revoking computer rights coffee in hand i was hoping for a firing the sales representative whose computer it was looked up at me he was wearing dark sunglasses inside he was weird gtsun its broken gtme yep the screen an lcd had its glass cracked some words where showing on some of the shards most where black gtme so what happened to it sun looked up at me the glasses made his expression unreadable gtsun errr dont worry i think i know whats wrong with it gtme oh the screen a clearly broken screen and the gentleman with sunglasses knows whats wrong brilliant i took a sip of coffee gtsun it needs degaussing my coffee almost spurt out of my mouth only years of coffee experience kept it in gtme sorry what the sales floor manager walked over and looked down at the screen unimpressed good gtsun i looked it up my monitor was a bit fuzzy so i followed the instructions gtme sorry your lcd needed degaussing so you followed some online instructions gtsun it said to look for a degauss button but since you guys probably bought the cheapest model it didnt have one i looked over at the manager hopefully im not the only one enjoy this comedy of errors the sales manager looked confused more for me then gtsun but the internet said magnets sometimes both caused and could fix the problem i took a sip of my coffee tasted like an idiot gtme so you got the magnet and it made it worse gtsun i think i swirled the wrong way or something because now my screens black sales manager looked up at me and decided shed seen enough gtsales we should probably get this working now gtme its a broken monitor itll need replacing just as i was about to launch into my speech about how this user should be separated from technology i was interrupted by the sunglass wearing idiot gtsun oh my its an epidemic he pointed over at his colleagues computer the oldest worker at sales hed turned on magnifier to look at some things gtsun thats what mine was doing see the blurriness gtme magnification gtsun how can he work like that gtme hey errrrr i tapped the older gentleman on the shoulder did you use sunglasses computer recently gtold oh yes mine didnt have a keyboard and i needed to look something up real quick gtme see sunglasses your magnification was turned on your monitor didnt need degaussing the sales manager looked like shed had enough gtsales okay sun you didnt need to use the magnet just go swirl the magnet the other way to make it go back then turn off magnification gtme that wont gtsales shhhh sales had a smile on her face the smile was wide sunglasses was swirling the magnet over the screen clockwise gtsales you better be sure thats the right way gtsun it is it is gtsales keep swirling i want this monitor working again fast i couldnt believe sales manager was having fun with this we walked away from sunglasses who was swirling away gtsales hahaha that was fun gtme you know thatll never work though right gtsales do you think im a moron eventually hell just go replace it no work for you gtme saving me work how nice i took a sip of my coffee tasted weird gtsales vps secretary sent me an email saying not to mess up it so much tasted really weird gtme whaaaaa gtsales i think theyre trying to pull down your budget or something gtme did they say that gtsales well no but why else would they tell everyone not to mess with it everyone knows vp doesnt like you too much maybe hes trying to cut your budget by making it look like you dont spend it all gtme huh gtsales so with that line of thinking i took another sip of my coffee here it comes gtsales could we get another box of keyboards this time my years of coffee experience couldnt keep the coffee down coffee rained over everything

at the telco i work for there iswas a policy for call centers whenever a customer acted irrationally no matter how bad it got everyone from sales to techs was supposed to politely explain that unless they calm down we would terminate the conversation after three warnings in case of repeat offenses service could be terminated whole thing was meant to give frontline a way to cleanly terminate calls from abusive customers once attempts to calm them down failed but intent doesnt always translate to documentation part of the procedure after terminating a call this way is to send up a ticket with a short explanation of what happened for possible review usually thats documentation for its own sake as tech senior staff i get alerts on a ton of things i am not really expected to take action on including flags that tickets have been filed in accordance to this policy commonly called icbp tickets few months ago i got one i actually wanted to investigate the incident description read icbp customer wouldnt stop crying despite the three warnings had to terminate call as per policy wat so i logged into the call monitoring software found the call an unreasonably arduous process really the tools suck and listened the customer was indeed panicking and crying but certainly not in a threatening or aggressive way sending emergency help would have been more appropriate than terminating the call more importantly it was entirely our fault her ticket history showed she called us several times for help with a stillunresolved ingress issue and that she still had severe packet loss by the letter of the policy and considering how its explained in basic training i couldnt truly fault the frontline tech for terminating this call though i certainly faulted his common sense and the policy itself intermittent electrical noise issues are notoriously hard to fix and there are sometimes long delays but in her case it was downright ridiculous she had called us every two weeks for over six months without a fix nor even a single escalation to senior staff she endured a randomly utterly useless internet connection packet loss about a third of the time she eventually stopped paying her bill after telling us in writing shed pay up everything once it was fixed instead of helping it got her file sent to recoveries the department tasked with recovering debts from nonpaying customers acting in bad faith they have leeway to negotiate depending on the situation but somehow the person handling her case skipped the formalities and went nuclear right out of the gate threatening her with escalating her non payment to all major credit rating agencies thats usually a lastditch effort before they resort to nuking the account which means reporting the black mark to cras and selling the bad debt to an external recovery agency either of which means your life will likely suck so im just sitting there looking at one screen showing in real time that she has packet loss on the second a huge list of unresolved tech support tickets and on the third that shes flagged terminal by recoveries for not paying for nine weeks even though it usually takes a year for legitimate nonpayers to earn this status all while listening to the call where we hung up on her for crying after she had just been threatened with wrecking her life some panic was warranted recoveries was basically saying she would not be able to renew her mortgage at market rates because we spent months not providing the service she paid for i first called fellow senior staff over at recoveries gt bytewave hey bytewave from tech supports senior staff im calling to have your recoveries file closed for account all procedures to be suspended gt recoveries huh we do have a file open for this account but its not in the red theres actually a positive credit of several hundred bucks no debt wait there was just a huge credit applied by gt bytewave yes thats me just applied full credit for over half a year to this customers account dating back to the first time she contacted us about an ongoing technical issue as per policy tsss is allowed to grant credit for any issue we deem major if it persists past hours after initial report from a customer also just added a note to the account for documentation gt recoveries huh i dont get that everyday over six months really closing our file just now what the hell happened gt bytewave on the tech side of things ill handle it on yours i have no idea how this got escalated so quickly to cra threats can you look into it and have someone who is allowed to leave a brief message explaining that all is well billingwise gt recoveries on it thanks for the heads up senior staff arent allowed to talk directly to customers as per union rules as direct contact is frontlines job description i never got the skinny on why they basically went nuclear almost immediately but a few minutes later i saw through the hardline troubleshooting tools that there was an apologetic voicemail explaining that the account was in the black from one of their guys then i got to networks senior staff the department in charge of making sure ingress issues dont last for over half a year gt bytewave hey bit of a situation in node nt ongoing for over half a year i looked at the network tickets and all i see are excuses and delays all written from numbered accounts what the hell is happening there numbered accounts internal employees write tickets under their own names you can tell instantly who did what contractors accounts however use numbered accounts that are hard but not impossible to trace back to the tech who actually did the job gt networks oh that we dont have anyone in that node its all handled by our favorite network contractor according to everything i have despite sixteen attempts they were never able to replicate the issue while on site or pinpoint cause but youre right that has been ongoing way too long gt bytewave so send one of our guys to confirm and verify closest depot is less than a hundred miles out but given how gt networks yeah thats not so easy nowadays boss dont like approving offregion work the union benefits for offregion are too generous or something we can lean on the contractors though gt bytewave were well past that ill send your boss the audio recording of this conversation if you want where im hereby stating that i just applied a credit to a single customers account for gross failure of service over the last months and that tsss will do the same for everyone with similar ongoing ingress issues in this node were talking several dozens all of which well file under the major network failure code the guy chuckled and soon after union network techs went out there credits filed for major network failure go back to their budget if they cant reasonably explain it wasnt their fault after a sla is busted and it was by literally over months it took networks two trips out there to pinpoint and fix the source of ingress because of the intermittent nature of the issue but somehow i doubt that explains why the previous contractor attempts yielded zero results this left open the issue of the actual ticket in front of me where a tech legitimately hung up on a customer because she was crying sadly and common sense aside it was literally what he was taught to do in basic training gt bytewave boss i need to add something to varia for the next tsss meeting a couple weeks later at the tsss meeting we had to debate my motion to edit the blanket irrational customer behavior policy so it would apply only to customers who are unreasonably angry or threatening frontline shouldnt be allowed nor required to hang up on someone just desperate for help duh but instilling common sense is never easy after a short discussion tsss agreed that it should change but the process for editing interdepartment policies is slow right now tech support is allowed to take context into account while sales and recoveries are still supposed to hang up on you for crying after three warnings all of bytewaves tales on 
the week came to its natural conclusion over several bottles of spilt milk and the mandated amount of crying several more instances of angies managerial style being put into action came and went however i still had tickets building up which needed build area time realising bhit was ineffective in offering a solution i tried and failed to sweettalk third line into segregating some of their server room space for machine builds i turned my attention to our sofar more than amenable postroom guys but it seems i was slightly pushing it at the prospect of wheeling our server in there the request was met with more displeasure at our storing new laptops and bags in there already the answer flooded towards me one day when angie fat finance wench unnaturally skinny finance wench and the hr tank took off for their near twice daily trip to starbucks i heard them gossiping about their new coffee related discovery on their way out see they have to take baby steps otherwise hr tank will break out in tonnes of sweat but so i hear ginger shots in lattes are simply gorgeous angies seemless change in personality between her dealings with us and her friends still resonated around the team with astonishment it was just odd to hear this scorpion do nothing but treat us like shit all day but then with friends actually smile and be human but my time came to put my diabolical fuck you plan into action like batman with a purpose i ran round the office building like a thing possessed i had a third liner retrieve our imprisoned ghost server from the network riser room and patched up some network ports i finished phase of my mission with an email to angie requesting several parts from the it cupboard just as she returned stinking of coffee and biscotti she accepted my request with a disinterested but reassuredly managerial style monday morning car defrosted its time to get the hammers on im at work early for phase quiet blonde girl qbg always seemed to fly under angies radar i did initially suspect her to be our rat as she has a tendancy to be popular with higher up types though i would say a lot of that would be hormonal her arrival in helpdesk was a little perplexing as nobody not even the helpdesk manager had even interviewed her similarly her record quick transfer to nd line was equally enigmatic i think we were just lucky that qbg was actually a decent worker and learned quickly underhandedness personally i think more cleavagerelated all suspicions of her being a mole were slightly dispelled one lunch hour when she launched into a seething verbal attack about angie the sort of stuff that had it ever been heard by anyone with power would have definitely landed qbg with her p the sack however monday was to be her day she had done some extraordinarily terrible thing and it was time for her to feel angies wrath and female to good looking female angie was in no way going to let her off lightly but i was ready and waiting for angie angie with qbg in tow opened door to her dungeon of dispair with an angered and authoritative fling she stood in the doorway sideways motioning for qbg to enter her attention was soon diverted there was i several machines imaging on top of the file cabinets two further machines lay dissected on the table and a studious and official amount of paperwork lay with my blue ballpoint nestled neatly on top i said with a slightly officialised and victorious tone can i help you at all angies face turned red as a small vein on the side of her temple bulged leaving qbg outside she closed the door and turned her attention to me her sharpness was echoed in the warming meeting room amidst the blur of machines who gave you permission to do this my short simple reply amounted to nobody i used my initiative we have no build areas anymore customers are waiting on their machines knowing that there was nothing she could do she left the room with ill be checking on you later as the door closed it was obvious qbg had returned to her desk assuming she had escaped capture no such luck angies venomous streak played out as she called across to her in a way one would talk to a year old with a simple hey you here as her bony finger pointed downwards qbg obliged with this demand as angie simply stated this one is taken come with me the door closed completely leaving only me and my machines i felt like some sort of mad professor finally alone in my domain angie was usurped i relaxed in my new mancave all manner of industriousness going on mafg even swung by minutes later for a victorious highfive the smiles from other team members shining through the open door like lighthouses i think i just further angered angie more when i came out to the team that the room has been booked all week but theres plenty space feel free to use it back to business as usual i think it was the last part angies hand froze as she amateurishly moved the mouse around the screen in her attempts to find the outlook icon again in a way i did sort of feel sorry for angie my girlfriends hypothesis of a lone female trying to make it in mans world resonated a little that was until she turned around and demanded we kept the noise down people are trying to work her snap only reaffirmed her brittleness though something told me that i hadnt heard the last of this one thing you will learn too about women in positions of power who arent cut out for the job they always win no matter how much you think youve had the upper hand they still win i returned to my desk to reply to some emails leaving my machines image in my cave claimed in the name of man i couldnt help bu wonder if this would eventually be qbgs fate socially promoted as guys in positions of power like the eye candy until she gets to a stage where she is truly out of her depth only able to rely on her position of authority to motivate her staff as it happens i was dead right my moment of victory was surprisingly cut short previous 
in my job i support servers the typical client that i talk to over the phone is an sa with several years of industry experience and multiple certifications in short i dont have the privilege of dealing with stupid users very often tfts being my favorite subreddit ive always wanted the opportunity to have a story worth telling here and recently like manna from heaven that opportunity presented itself the call went something like this me thank you for calling company how can i help her i just changed my isp and now my workstations wont connect to the internet me im sorry to hear that maam youve actually reached server support but if youll hold for a minute ill get you down to our workstation guys her no this is obviously a server problem something is wrong with my domain controller and now my workstations cant connect to the internet at this point i decided what the hell it was a slow day might as well dig into this and once we prove it isnt the server maybe we can figure out what the problem is i check out the server and everything looks fine i then turn my attention to the workstations me ok maam i want to walk you through checking a few basic things on your workstation provided instructions on checking her ipv settings can you tell me what the settings are her the ip address is xxxxxxxxxxxx etc etc the preferred dns server is me puzzled you said the dns is that doesnt sound right to me her well yeah this is workstation me so what is the preferred dns for workstation her shouldnt you know this me maam it doesnt really work that way we need to reconfigure these her that cant be right workstation works just fine it was very very difficult for me not to laugh we got her straightened out but this was quite possibly the funniest call ive had in years

 as i sat down at my desk i felt sympathy for the teachers of the world marking was horrible everyone complains when you do it and you never get a compliment for a good job just universal disdain i sat down to a coffee in my office delicious coffee keeping me sane a knock at the door woke me from my daydream solitaire entered the office gtsol i just wanted to have a chat about how much some things are worth gtme oh for goodness sake gtsol oh no wasnt a complaint just wanted to know why youve set password resets at ten minutes my coffee demanded to be thrown at solitaire i decided against it gtme how long should they take gtsol is there a zero option i looked down at the drop down menu it didnt have a zero option gtme sadly not solitaire looked at me his eyes slowly working up the courage to continue gtsol as you know its a four way tie between itsec colourblind hockey and myself i looked down at the current number sheet he was right all four where pretty close and far ahead i was almost dead last mostly because choosing times for these tickets was eating time gtme sooo gtsol well were all camping out on the ticket box waiting for the next ticket to come in and instantly taking it i took another sip of my coffee i couldnt bring myself to care gtsol but since youre grading them in batches hockey has setup a packet sniffer in the comms room so he knows exactly when youre marking some my coffee decided it was time to wake up and start caring gtme so hes going through all my traffic solitaire gave me a sheepish look gtsol i just want everything to be fair gtme sol take the afternoon off go enjoy yourself solitaire looked down at his watch it was early very early gtsol but i gtme no no i insist a paid afternoon off what could be better gtsol uhhh the look in his eyes said he wanted to argue more but a free afternoon off was slowly changing his mind i decided to walk solitaire out of my office and went to go have a chat with hockey i sipped my coffee en route hockey was sitting at his desk staring at his many posters surrounding his work space gthoc airz hey just waiting on some more tickets he gave me a smile coffee was telling me to remember he was a good employee gtme i hear youve been sniffing through my packets hockeys smile slid off his face he had an attempt at a contrite face gthoc sorry but gtme you know i should fire you like right now gthoc in my defense i can hardly get any tickets colourblind has set up a script to pull tickets as soon as they come up it checks every seconds the only way i could compete is because his box would fill up with five i was getting the left overs gtme so your answer was to go through potentially confidential traffic gthoc huh gtme arnt you packet sniffing my computer gthoc no ive a sniffer on the ticketing server telling me when you login so i know about when new tickets will be marked gtme thats all you got gthoc ill show you after looking through his setup i realized he was just looking for my login coffee told me to let this one go gthoc im sorry but im just trying to make everything fair i cant compete otherwise gtme you seem pretty stressed about it gthoc i am colourblind has a huge advantage you should tell him to cut it out at least my way only tells me when youve posted more his just takes everything gtme you should take the afternoon off so you can de stress gthoc but i gtme no no i insist a paid afternoon off what could be better gthoc uhhh gtme or we could spend the afternoon going through every security breach youve committed in detail gthoc bye i took a sip of coffee too easy almost toooo easy time to see colourblind 
many many years ago i helped run a support line for these custom medical testing work stations our company assembled these particular devices were used to test memory and part of those tests required an auditory component one day i got a rather irate call from a client saying something like gt the machine is producing no sound this is unacceptable i have the patient waiting here and we have wasted almost an hour already with your system if you cant resolve these issues we will be forced to consider legal action find a new vendor so i personally had worked on building these machines and knew most of their quirks a completely working system sans the sound made absolutely no sense i spent about minutes running through some basic diagnostics asking the user about the speaker power cable speaker audio cable volume levels etc the user was getting very annoyed at me for asking such basic questions apparently i had insulted them they were an important doctor after all the issue was definitely with our system why was i not believing him frustrated myself i asked for the third or fourth time gt me are you sure the volume knob on the speaker is all the way up gt user of course the volume is up i know how to use a computer with no obvious solutions i grasp at a straw and say gt me okay well what happens if you turn the volume all the way down at this point i can hear the background test audio for our application blast over the phone i hear a bit of a kerfuffle from the other side of the line and the sound quickly goes dead again gt user hey hold on a minute a few moments pass gt user listen something just came up here and i have to go if we cant get this fixed in the next day ill call you back never heard from them again 
reminded me of a time i did a bit of showing off im a seagoing engineer on big ships i love it the work is incredibly varied and i get to travel around the world but this tale isnt about how wonderful the job is its normal for us to have a cadet or two on board these guys are training to become officers generally years old pretty green as youd expect and to begin with at least very much like a fish out of water one of the tasks that were required to be able to do is bring a generator online and connect it to the ships switchboard with modern tech its perfectly possible to just press a button and the computer will do it for you but we need to be able to do it by hand in case it goes wrong the switchboards are all phase ac so in order to connect a generator you need to start it synchronise the waveforms of the switchboard and incoming generator and then connect the breaker once connected you need to balance the load so all machines are taking proportionally the same its not that straightforward but given a bit of practice its easy enough we were talking the cadets through doing this one of them was particularly nervous after all if you screw it up then the lights go out and i said as an off the cuff remark something along the lines of gtits easy i could do it blindfolded to which the immediate answer is gtgo on then so i did with a rag tied over my eyes and standing in front of the switchboard i started synchronised connected and load balanced a generator the other engineer and the cadets were dumfounded as to how id managed it because on the face of it you have to be able to see all the lightssynchroscope and power meters to be able to do it even if you could find all the buttons so how did i manage it simply the engineers secret weapon by listening carefully the switchboard was right above the generators so once theyre running you can hear the difference in running speeds as beats a phenomenon of alternating destructiveconstructive wave interference that got the incoming machine close in frequency listen for the click of the synchronisation check relay thats the one that prevents you connecting them when theyre out of sync when it clicks you know its safe to connect hit the button load balance by listening carefully to the noise from the turbos a turbos speed is proportional to engine load when the whistle is about the same theyre both loaded equally of course i didnt tell them this i just grinned and said gtim that good now your turn
 we have a unique to our industry software product that shaves a lot of time for our users buying a certain market product and our product makes it easier to buy that product at auctions our software wraps around rd party native websites to add additional functionality and a dashboard layout for fast data aggregation from multiple data points well my tale starts years ago with a guy that signed up for our software we went above and beyond to train this guy late at nite a couple hours after normal business hours our account managers and support staff spent hours with this guy trying to teach him its not rocket science its actually pretty easy to use the software and best practices to get him drilled in quickly one day he emails me complaining how he hates certain functionality on one of the client sites we wrap around i explained in a very business professional email that those functions are native site functionality that we do not control those are elements native to the website and he should contact that company to express any changes he would like made he then replies back and ccs the entire executive staff at the other company screaming in all caps i have complained about these issues for years and no one listens to me so he tried to busroll me because of other staff abuse and him just not getting it i was able to get him cut loose and banned the only user i have ever banned in my itsupport career it was that bad we put notes in our crm to never call the guy again and dont let him sign back up fast forward to yesterday we just launched a new product at a recent trade show event and guess who signed up new sales staff and a recent merger or our crm software converged into them not knowing and they signed him yesterday as soon as we found out we let the new account manager know the fine details of the situation so he is prepared for the shitstorm this user may bring last night the emails begin from the account manager i have a situation on my hands within a couple hours the guy was blowing up my ams phoneemail with complaints and abuse st email from the manager cut him loose we knew this would happen and he isnt worth the time and effort user banned again seriously made my night love it when a company has your back and wont put up with bullshit abuse 
this was a little while back now working one of my first jobs in it it was a laptop repair place that mainly did toshiba warranty repairs now let me just give you some background info this place was fairly dodgy they would claim all sorts of parts from toshiba even if it wasnt a warranty job screens were a great one as at that time they could cost upwards of just for the screen replacement they would also charge customers ridiculous labour hours as they claimed they had to test the laptops thoroughly before giving it back when in reality we never did any testing other than checking if the problem was fixed then moved on to the next one this one model of toshiba forget which one exactly would always come in with the same issue the screen connectors would come loose and cause the screen to display incorrectly showing different colours lines across the screen etc a few months into the job a customer comes in with this exact issue by then id done enough of them to spot the problem right away the customer stated in a nice way that he was in a rush as he needed to get to work and needed the laptop as he was polite about it i thought hell ill fix it right here and now i knew what the problem was so i quickly pulled the screen apart cleaned the monitor cable connections plugged it all back in and put it back together fired it up and sure enough screen was displaying correctly only took me a few minutes the customer stood there in awe as if to say how the hell did you just do that he was happy to pay the bill and was on his way thanking me for fixing it so quickly a couple of days later the manager approaches me for a chat he goes on to tell me that i should never fix anything on the spot as we could have kept it for a day or two and charged the customer a lot more for it i defended myself by saying that customer probably left there and would have been so happy he would have told his friends about it and given us more business through word of mouth referrals but he wouldnt have any of it thats not how this company operated they would rather rip people off he then gave me options either i play their dodgy game or leave i got fired friday that week
the inevitable consequence of heading to bed the second you get home is that the morning tends to come quicker than you expected i arrived bleary eyed not truly knowing what fresh hell angie was about to concoct that day my fate was postponed as angie was busy providing a critique of every detail as quietblondegirl rearranged her desk to angies preference it became apparent that angie had taken issue to some typical girlie deskwear and was ordering it be suitably secreted in desk drawers or disposed of a grim reminder of another of yesterdays ordeals came in the shape of an email from hr tank demanding to know when her new faster computer would be delivered not only was hrts computer perfectly fine it was only months old and not due for replacement for two years this i knew was an argument i would have to save for later i logged a ticket and moved on bhit arrived in just after me and made a pitstop at my desk he must have felt it his duty to appear interested over my late night last night his pale head seemed to silhouette against the dimly lit office lighting i grabbed the opportunity like a child with a new toy and demanded that we resolve this build area problem immediately with angie trapped in her reprimand of qbg i knew i was stealing her thunder this is getting just stupid now customers are complaining about us doing hardware replacements and rebuilds at the desk side whats more theyre taking longer as weve had to use usb hard disks for builds since the ghost server went missing we have six machines now that nobody knows where they are the networking gear has also gone missing what annoys me is that all this was working perfectly fine while we had our build area so the fact remains you need to sort this out now we have a major rollout project coming up sort it out my concern echoed with my vocal severity bhit was well and truly put in his place i could feel angie wincing as i had beaten her to the punch bhits bald head nodded as he claimed he understood with every nod a ceiling light just slightly came into view as he stood over my desk almost cowering behind the green partition it was about damn time he took this on board bhit walked away with the weight of the world on his shoulders he knew i was right he knew he had to step in i sat at my desk uncomfortably the newly recovered bleachsmelling ghost server had found temporary shelter home under my desk where my legs should go the psu fan blew hot air almost providing some relief from the cold a small yet powerful offering from the inanimate object almost thanking me for its rescue the prize was doubly exciting as for first time in many weeks my overnight whatsalive script proudly showed ghost server as now being rejoined to the network like a soldiers homecoming its location switch b port area its i busied myself that morning by staying rooted to my desk firing out responses to some of my tickets in part i wanted to make sure bhit was doing his job but i also wanted to see how angie would react to having the rug pulled out from under her again an hour rolled by and angie was still busy reprimanding the team she had worked out or been shown how to properly use touchpaper and its accompanying stats screens the evidence of an interteam rat was all too clear as angie who could barely use outlook could never have worked out touchpaper to this degree nevertheless this rat would have to be discovered at a later date tea in hand i rolled up to bhits desk for progress finally he had some news i was to report to facilities so they could show me some rooms i picked up my napalm death fleece to embark on my fantastic voyage but the familiar loud rattle of angies keys disappearing into her small leather handbag accompanied her bony figure as it stood up to place a black and grey shawl around her veiny neck right lets go she proclaimed as if to usurp leadership of my mission bhit cowered behind his computer screen rather than face confrontation what could i say i felt the next hour of efficient decision making suddenly hampered as angie set off to facilities as if dragging me by my ear like a scolded schoolboy after the facilities manager had led us to our third room visit it soon became clear what angie thought constituted a suitable room she wanted something near to the main office so she could check up on us regularly difficult to work in and not much space ironically the meeting room would have fit angies specifications exactly i wanted something near the it cupboard for supplies access was another battle i was soon to wage plenty space and somewhere away from the freezing cold aircon vents we finally came upon angies ideal the only access was a flight of stairs just short enough in number to appear inconsequential yet just ever so slightly add enough inconvenience to keep this bitter woman happy add to the annoyance of not being able to get a trolley up them they were just narrow enough to ensure scraped knuckles in the event of anything bulky this would be enough for angie to know that this place would be a last resort no longer a fort of solitude when the outside world became too much the room itself was just about big enough for a couple of desks and right above the door hummed the icy cold draft of the aircon vent this is totally unsuitable any one of the first few rooms would be fine i protested angie completely ignored me as her bitter face spat out this will do the facilities manager looked perplexed at angies decision rather than argue it he just agreed and muttered something about arranging access and desks i knew this would happen i relayed our adventure to its as angie disappeared off for another starbucks run with her menopause group their faces looked angry calls of out of all the rooms you just saw angie picked some shithole thats basically gone unused for years rather than offer an explanation i merely motioned in the direction of bhit still cowering behind his monitor i could see none of my colleagues were going to speak up itd have to be me again fine bhit i started he almost winced behind his monitor he knew what was coming can you come and join us for a second after regaling yet again what had just transpired bhit seemed like he was mustering all the courage that he could as i continued let loose on what a stupid decision angie had made together with her obvious attempts to prevent the team actually working he dug deep one last time with a quivering yet determined voice he said i thought i told you to get a new build room sorted out well which one do you want i looked back at my crew and just said well actually the it cupboard was perfect its got a window its worked fine for years theres plenty storage in fact its only called a cupboard because theres racking and shelving in there i also have an email you sent to fat tony from rd line when he was on nd authorizing the use of the cupboard and having facilities convert part of it for workspace sometimes the odd swift half after work with monkeys in other teams can pay dividends leave it with me said bhit as he made for the doorway its smiled at me but deep down i shat a brick ive really done it now if i wind up getting bhit to relinquish the chains on our beloved cupboard i can only imagine what sort of games angie will play with that one but i was pleased for once i was up where she didnt know i was up she was out with a bunch of menopausal women blissfully unaware sipping her insipid starbucks coffee somehow providing life support for her

this tale harks back a few years when we were in the midst of replacing the menagerie of thinkpads in the wild with a fleet of dell laptops luckily we had hardworker contracting for us at the time he powered through almost all of these while i was busy doing other things we started on the sales reps as they were a logistically the most challenging and b not generally known for their fastidious treatment of laptops so some machines were running on borrowed time to address the geographical challenges we bought or so gb flash drives and bundled them with the new laptops along with a sheet of basic information about how to set the new machine up and the major differences between windows xp and we also included a note asking them to call hardworker so that he could log in remotely and finish their email setup install their home office printer and walk them through transferring their data one overcast friday afternoon my phone rang i reluctantly put aside my ohsogood chicken schnitzel burger gtme company it this is moufassa gtremotesalesrep oh hi moufassa its rsr here gtrsr was only a couple of years off retirement at the time and a selfconfessed computer knownothing but a very pleasant guy to deal with he also lives around km from the nearest regional centre so we had his type in mind when we devised the flash drive plan gtrsr i received a new computer from you a few weeks ago and its working really well now i just need your help getting crmapp working gtme sure i can hel hang on its working well now was it not working properly before gtrsr well it didnt have any of my stuff on it and i couldnt print so i transferred my stuff and installed the printer software gtme oh so you talked to hardworker gtrsr no i didnt call anyone i did it all myself gtme y you did it yourself transferred all your data from your old laptop to the new one gtrsr yep and yep thats what that usb drive you included is for isnt it gtme gobsmacked well yeah but were here to help you do it gtrsr i nearly threw it out the window a few times but i didnt want to bother you lets just say i know a lot more about how google works i quickly sorted his crm issue out and then checked out his handiwork all his photos outlook archives documents desktop files everything was in its place rsr retired last year but he will forever remain the user that could tldr user interrupts consumption of a chicken schnitzel burger wins place in moufassas heart edit hey qotd sweet edit teh second lots of people have asked for details on the chicken schitzel burger ive described it in the comments enjoy but dont blame me for the resultant hunger pangs 
im on the senior helpdesk team for a hospital system in my area we have a secure messaging system that has both desktop and mobile phone interfaces that nurses will page doctors with this system is entirely independent of our ad domain but uses our exchange email addresses to create user accounts a call was forwarded to me for assistance with a user who couldnt log in methepaintsaint nursetechnologically inept nurse nmnurses manager gtme information systems this is thepaintsaint gtnm hello this is nm i need to get one of my nurses logged into the secure message system weve called a few times and placed several tickets yet shes still unable to get logged in gtme sure let me pull up the console who are we talking about gtnm nurse shes gone through the setup via email invite and she logged on once but she can no longer remember her username to log in gtme ok let me bring her account up uh i havent seen this before let me make sure its right the username is a userdefined field when setting up the account most people use the first part of their username ie if my email address is thepaintsaintdomainorg id use thepaintsaint as my username but this user was special gtme yeah this is odd but i guess it works her username is domainorg gtnm you mean like our website gtme yeah nurses username is our website address never seen someone do that but since the system is entirely different than the rest of our network it could be happyanimals or domainorg or anything really that they want to put in there have her try that and give us a call if you need further help tldr user uses our domain name as her username it works
a teacher at my school sent email to the it department asking where her students could get copies of ms powerpoint from she said her students would need it during the year when doing project presentations for her class we emailed back telling her that powerpoint was available in office which all of the students can get for free it is a part of our site licensing program they just needed to log into their student accounts to get the details at the end of the day we get another email from the instructor asking which building office was in she couldnt find it when she walked around looking for it tldr manager wont let us make fake signs leading to the fire escape 
so i came into work today and i had an email marked urgent in outlook it seems that the end of fiscal year inventory is due at the end of this week and they need some information we use ibm tivoli endpoint manager purchased from a company called bigfix for our inventory stuff and patching etc so i ask what information they need gt we just need all the boxes that run websphere and their versions well that information isnt just sitting in a text file on the servers a batch file on each box will output the information for us and we can just pipe it into a text file but that would require us to touch each box or push out a fixlet to do it we obviously decided to do the latter after that text file is generated we can parse the information from the text file and put it in web reports another ibm purchase from bigfix it should be easy i never should have said that i tell them that this wont be a problem it will take me an hour or two to set up the fixlet and the analysis for web reports but it will probably take a day for tivoli to gather all the relevant boxes another day to push the action to them we have k endpoints and then at least hours for the analysis to parse the text files and pull the version information well this is unacceptable their part of the report is due by end of day and they only need some quick and simple information i inform them that there really isnt a way to push it any faster even if i babysit it and i do not have access to these boxes so i cant just run the batch files manually well at this point they decide to have a chat with my boss and it precipitates a meeting were all sitting around the table and they tell my boss gt craysh has been willfully unhelpful in helping us get some easily accessed information he gave us an eta of days before he could even get to it and this is important he asked me what was going on and being familiar with tivoli himself as well as our environment he understood exactly what would take so long he turned to the inventory group and said gt this is how long it will take to get this information parsed out hes not stringing you along its just how our infrastructure will work once its in place it will take at most hours between updating the versioning information and it will be available to you any time you need it they respond gt that is totally unacceptable we need this information in be the end of the day my boss responded gt your lack of planning does not constitute an emergency on our part i got chills 
okay im going to start by saying this did not happen recently it was probably around october time basically i worked on a it helpdesk for an outsourcing company who was contracted at the time to a large transport company in the uk i was working nights as cover for a colleague who was off sick this is the story of my worst user ever at am lets call him s and me l gtl how can i help you sir gts i logged a call with you guys earlier as my pc will not turn on at all i went through the diagnostics with a colleague of yours who advised me i will need an replacement machine gtl okay yeah i can see on our systems an engineer is scheduled for later today between ampm to replace your pc gts thats no good i am unable to get any files off my pc at the moment so i cant continue to work i want an engineer out right now gtl sir the oncall field services engineer is only available for high priority incidents that are affecting multiple users unfortunately this does not justify a callout gts this pc should of been replaced years ago it is very old and you are only replacing it now that it has broken this is pathetic gtl apologies sir but all pcs on the estate are issued at the same time and only replaced when there is a irreparable issue with one of them gts i dont care if this i do not have an engineer here in minutes i will be going to my manager and handing in my notice as i can not work under these conditions gtl unfortunately i can do nothing to get the engineer to you as it would be against all of our policies for an issue of this sort gts whatever half an hour or i will be leaving phone hangs up a few days later i was doing some account admin work during quiet spells on the phones and a request comes through for me to delete ss account turns out he did actually hand over in his notice over a broken pc the even funnier thing was i looked into his incident history and this was the first issue we had on record for him he had never before had a pc issue at work since we upgraded the entire estate years prior tldr guy has a broken pc demands fs at am i decline he quits his job

weve all been there before theres a conference room full of field reps sales reps and the like in town for training its day two of the training and after yesterdays treat of plugging speakers into a laptop i thought all the high level work had been done boy was i wrong today we had a crisis not seen in the it world since stuxnet or the michelangelo virus my manager tasked me with resolving a problem that brought the conference room to its knees it seems the projector wasnt displaying any video like at all like it was as if there were no projector at all the regional manager had the vga plug connected to his laptop just as i had directed him to do from yesterday he even had the laptop turned on but lo no video of any kind was being displayed drawing on my years of system administration and tier ii level deskside technician experience i did something crazy most technicians would cringe at the mere suggestion of this practice i picked up the remote control for the projector sitting next to the laptop was it that simple i pressed the button that says on i held my breath at first the image was faint like a unpreserved medieval fresco painting then in vivid technicolor the same display from the laptop appeared on the screen i nearly passed out from the excitement few exceptional techs can realize the genuine high you get when fixing a problem of that magnitude that quickly
i left a job a few years ago today they called me back to solve a problem with their website that my replacement couldnt handle i decided to skim through their tickets with their web host so i could see what had already been tried in the process i found this gem written by my replacement gtwe are installing new software and we need access to the main router i think its a asus router do you know where i can find it i have the password lets forget for a moment that you dont need physical access to your router to install software he is somehow under the impression that the support rep at his web host who lives in another city and has never even been to his building can tell him physically where in the office his router is

if youre not familiar with it the cryptolocker virus encrypts your files and shreds them if you dont pay them or so this accounting firm got it got the threatening letter wiped their server because they knew they had a good backup via carbonite the tech decided to use a privately managed key instead of letting carbonite manage it presumably for extra security he cant remember the password the number of ways he fucked up is truly astounding the owner has been blowing up my phone desperately hoping theres some way to crack the bit encryption all i can suggest is that she tell the nsa that edward snowden sent her these files and ask what should she do with them edit omg ok so i got some more information right when it happened the owner asked the tech if it would be a good idea to clone the drive then pay the money and that way the person who would supposedly log in and decrypt the files not sure if thats how it works but thats what she said wouldnt have access to the server he the tech said it wasnt worth it right after it happened they started to restore files from the carbonite backup one by one it was taking so long that the tech said it was inefficient thats why he wiped the server to get the full backup he has apparently spent the last hour or so trying every password he could remember with no luck im going to try to throw hashcat at it and see what happens i have a couple of gtxs so hey maybe well get lucky i dont actually know how to do it yet but im researching like a fiend i dont need to crack the key i just need to get his password from it this might be a total deadend but jesus i feel like i need to do something this company does my companys payroll i feel like i should throw that out there just because it makes the situation so much funnier or not i wish i could tell you the name of the company i really do the irony is so thick i could cut it with a banana anyway im off for the night i can only take so much of this in one day so im going to head out and drink myself into a stupor with a good buddy oh and last but not least i posted here that i liked getting snapchats of random things from random people and holy fuckballs my phone exploded i got snaps from all over the world with the strangest oddest most bizarre shit and its great one guy had a chicken hat on and sent a snapvideo of himself nodding to the chicken dance i even got an epic set of boobs and a few from women too so with that in mind if youre bored add warlizard and snap me stupid shit im a snapping fiend nothing of real interest but i like taking pics and sending them out to the world laterz shit i forgot one thing i said to the owner well it sucks but at least you can go to your email and get the files im sure your outlook pst wasnt encryped i dont send anything through email because its not secure i had to mute the phone ok last edit from my computer i may update as i get more lit as the night progresses ill update as this progresses but the funny thing is ive only been back doing the store stuff for month three times in one month ive seen something that in years of it ive never experienced so while i have great sympathy for this owner and the firm omg there isnt enough butter for the popcorn edit someone snuck in last night shit in my mouth and put little socks over all my teeth hungover edit im really enjoying the snaps whats really amazing is how good looking the people are who are snapping me maybe its a selfselecting pool but the stereotype of the nerdy neckbeard is not being supported here

this reminded me of one of my own i worked frontline for a mass retailer with thousands of stores all around the country every week we had critical applications that crashed and hundred of people calling us to check if it was down when itd be back up and so on so of course we set up automated recordings answering all these questions but there were always a lot of idiots who kept waiting because they were to stupid to listen so one time i pick up the phone and there isnt anybody on the line but i can hear people talking in the background so after raising my voice a bit and trying to get their attention for a minute a woman picks up the receiver i tell her that she shouldnt do that because when that happens we usually end up dropping the call after seconds then she starts getting all annoyed yeah but i was on hold and i was busy working on something else its your fault for taking so much time answering which i know is bullshit she was talking about clothes with her coworker while i was trying to get her attention of course shes calling about the outage so i tell i tell her all the answers to your questions were in the automated recording that was looping during the minutes you spent on hold yeah i dont listen to these when i dont immediately have a technician i just put the phone on speaker and do something else i was pretty pissed at that point so i tell her in a really nice voice ok no problem ill just put you back on the queue so you can listen to the messages again then i dropped her on the queue before she had the time to answer

 run a computer repair shop in a small mountain town and i get some real gems in here today i got yelled at by a customer for quite some time yesterday this customer brought me this beige gateway windows me computer because the drive was clicking no problem cloned the drive popped in the new one and it booted right up charged them for the service they stop by i show them it works and they go on their way then i get a call at the end of the day it doesnt work were bringing it back tomorrow huff puff huff huff so they stop in today the customer is fuming red in the face fists shaking they looked like they were going to smash my display cases they begin to scream you fucked up my computer ten years and not a single issue and you broke it so i calmly inquire what the nature of the issue is and i got a surprising response ill save you the capital letters assume screaming you broke the damn thing i brought it home and hooked it all up right and dont tell me i didnt because i labeled every cable before unhooking it i plugged it in and nothing happened i unplugged it and plugged it back in a dozen times and nothing happened okay maybe a power supply issue lets see i toss it up on my bench and plug it into the kvm and press the power button and it turns on all hell breaks loose what was that you pressed a button to turn it on i never had to do that before what the fuck did you do to my computer you ruined it that things been running fine for years and i never had to press a button you screwed up the whole thing i want my money back and a new computer im astounded at this point i didnt know what to say they had this computer installed by some guy years ago and never turned it off they lacked such basic electronics knowledge that they had no idea what a power button was i did my best to explain you see this is the power button you have to press it to turn it on but ive never done that before did you ever turn your computer off before no thats an issue in itself normally folks shut down their computers when theyre not using them why in the fuck would i do that to make it last longer hard discs are only good for about years or so and capacitors dont last forever but it never failed before why would i turn it off regardless this is how a computer works you turn it off and press a button to turn it back on no its not you broke it fuck you give it back ill see you in court ive never had to press a button before this is un fucking believable so im going to court apparently they called the police and reported me got that call a minute ago im not sure if i should laugh or cry edit tldr customer thinks i broke their computer because they have apparently never pushed a power button before edit yes i know how insane the idea of a computer being on for years sounds thats their story not mine ubobnojio brought up the very valid point that the cmos could have been set to power on ac failure to solve their issue im starting the hypothesize that maybe it was already set that way and i may have cleared the cmos somehow but i dont think so my feeling is the woman is just a total bitch and didnt want to admit she was wrong when faced with something so obvious as a power button so she raged and followed through with her accusation edit february th pm pst her husband called today he says i can avoid court by giving them a new computer and refunding their bucks i lost my temper edit on monday march rd i received a call from a lawyer who represents ms herpderp who said they want to settle outside of court to save us both some time and money i told him i am not willing to refund any money as the computer worked and that i dont believe that he is a lawyer i explained that the amount they would receive back is nothing compared to what it must cost to pay a lawyer to start a case i probed him and have a suspicion they are the couples son or something he said well well have to settle in court then to which i replied in small claims court im not sure you know how that works bring it bitch the next day i noticed a terrible review on yelp and im more upset about my fivestar rating being in jeopardy than anything else the whole ordeal is going nowhere fast im starting to hope i get served soon so i can just get this all over with edit on thursday march th i got served imgur of proof of sonovabitch son ova bitch edit i get a lot of messages regarding another update court is on the t of april no new news until then edit the final update ive just returned from court i arrived there at for my appointment after grabbing a quick taco bell breakfast this was my first mistake the judge didnt enter the courtroom until and by then i had already begun to realize the problem i had created for myself when the woman next to me commented on my belly rumbling man did i need to pass gas but not here not now not like this the judge sits down we rise i cringe the judge sent the first four or five cases out for mediation as is the normal practice now im waiting for an unknowable amount of time but i knew what i had to do i excused myself and wrecked the stairwell with a certain amount of selfsatisfaction i returned to court and fidgeted for the next hour waiting for my case another problem brewing finally we are sent out for mediation at we climb a few flights of stairs to the mediators office and start the discussion immediately the feller starts ranting about this and that how i broke their computer how we had a verbal agreement that i would replace the computer we didnt and how their son was a certified in but with no point to follow that they kept going for quite some time i dont believe they know what a mediator is for they were acting like he was the judge throwing accusations finally i couldnt take it anymore the gas not the unintelligent rants im used to those i interrupt with look youre claiming worth of damages and i dont believe you deserve a single penny of that your computer works plain and simple yelling and ranting is what i get back at this point i begin to realize im arguing with apes and decide to get out of there the mediator is resting his face in his hands hes tired of this too myself i could be making a couple grand this morning or be here battling a combination of idiots and flatulence i needed to call this a loss and get out of here open my store i make them an offer ill give you a reconditioned laptop and were even can we agree to that oh wow really mister thatd sure be swell its funny how people change when theyre starting to get what they want sure a windows laptop why not its almost new they accept we write out the agreement and i make sure to have a clause put in there plaintiff will verify functionality of the defendants provided laptop on site and once it leaves there will be no support for it sweet they signed it they try to make small talk with me so thats your bike nice day for a ride etc etc my mind screams insults while i smile and agree so we go back to court have the case dismissed and i head back to the shop i walk into the storage closet take a glance at the three giant racks with around laptops on them grab the first one i see a toshiba cds machine i bought for bucks from a tweaker who probably stole it i boot it up it works factory reset it hellish on windows if you dont have the password and give them a call im waiting for them to arrive now while i write this in conclusion i lost on this one but i keep telling myself that i made the conscious choice to lose in order to reapply my efforts and make more money than i lost on that machine the entire ordeal has really made me rethink my career in consumer product repairs consumer electronic repairs has done little for me but turn me bitter and resentful towards the endusers of a technology i find rather beautiful so im looking to hire somebody who loves computers to work full time in my place with options for room and board at the shops apartment upstairs ive been looking for anybody for a month now and so far im realizing that mountain towns dont have much to offer in the way of computer techs who have any sort of background in repairs myself i plan to move on to create shitty ios and android games that generate s in ad revenue daily to fund misadventures in hardware development tldr i felt flatulent so i rushed through things and gave them a windows toshiba during mediation to stop the ranting and get back to work total loss and hours of my time thank you for the gold kind stranger

so this happened during my apprenticeship as an it tech with a german it serviceorganization taking care of small businesses and schools roughly years ago we had one special client funny job blasted old industry buildings and quarries who had permanent issues with his online banking remember this was y ago when hbci banking was still done with the rsa keys on disks regular procedure in case something went wrong with the key disk was to call the issuing bank to send the customer a new disk we did this game several times including some test transfers on the customers computer the tests went fine but within a week the customer complained again about the messy online banking so after another reissued rsa disk i decided to stay a bit longer after the tests were done and suddenly i got an reveiling insight on the issue as the label on the disk clearly stated keep in a safe place in german the customer used a fridge magnet to safely store the disk on the side of the pc casing after a short discourse on magnetic storages we were able to focus on real issues edit formatting edit as multiply requested tldr formatting
there was a lot of interest in this part and part thankyou for the gold and stuff one of the questions asked struck me and i thought i should answer it in a new thread q so what was my last day like shortly before leaving i received a sizeable payout over a significant injury i had suffered a few years earlier management found out about this and tried to guilt trip me with you have a lot of money now and you dont need money from us then the issue of not buying the bosses car surfaced again i was criticised continuously for driving a suzuki sierra samari or jimmy to the rest of the world the boss started to insist again that i should buy his small car as it was a much nicer vehicle my refusal not to buy his car with the reason i like my car more was taken very personally we had agreed on two weeks notice i did not want to drag it out and they didnt want to accumulate more debt to me so i did my time and built up a last vital patch to the software on the second last day the patch was ready and all that was needed was to commit the code and do a final build as i left that night something odd happened i was cornered by management and asked to give up my office key i saw no reason not to so i did i asked why they said they felt i would try and steal computers to recover unpaid wages i basically said ffs when the morning of my last day rocked round i was feeling jubilant i was flush with insurance money a great new job lined up and my life was set for a brand new course as i prepared to leave home a call came gtboss dont come in we will do your last day another time gtme ok stupid me over the next two weeks a new date for the last day was set and repostponed often eventually a last day actually happened i was instructed to turn up at a half hour after opening so i turned up to work as agreed all the doors were dead locked all staff were actually locked in the building i knocked on the door and was escorted into the meeting room by my boss some new faces were present everyone was in suits and the room was given an intimidating youre outnumbered feel a contract was placed in front of me it basically stated that i verified the software was bug free and i would fix any bugs found at any time in the future for free i would to this immediately and without limit for time required to do so this agreement would be binding without time limit i was told this was my exit contract and i had to sign it i declined instead in this adverse environment i renegotiated a consultant fee for any further work and a minimum days a year availability against future requirements i signed the new contract they signed it and then backdated it to when i first joined wtaf i was then escorted to my office while i was away they had been busy the room had been turned upside down and my filing cabinet emptied my computer had been reformatted and all software reinstalled fresh my computer had also been disconnected from the network and i was informed that all passwords had been changed so i could no longer log into anything they informed me that when they rebuilt the machine apparently one piece of software failed to reinstall i was accused of doing something that prevented this and blamed i could not assist them the software key was on my company email account no longer available to me they suddenly nervous and refused to let me access my email account for the key in a brief moment of privacy i discovered something from a friend actually a massive network outage was in effect because a certain manager had taken it upon herself to rearrange the stack of network routers as a security precaution against me making an imminent cyber attack on the company now a familiar consultant joined us his job was to read the code i was going to commit and ensure it was not malicious and verify the final build of the software still functioned the consultant felt very awkward about this he knew i would do no such thing but he wasnt going to turn down work the management was suspicious that the consultant trusted me so they supervised the consultant so there i sat for an hour as three people looked over every move i made management questioning every second action as i built the final release of the software i then spent another hour in a random code audit the consultant was to sift through the code looking for anything malicious i was on hand to answer any questions he had i was then promptly escorted out of the company i never looked back edit i have finished the account here

i just discovered this sub so i thought i would share early one saturday morning am my oncall cell rings i answer the phone and a coworker who works on the storage team tells me the datacenter just went dark i tell him just because a server loses connection to a network drive doesnt mean the server went down since i was a windows admin at the time my team was responsible for all the server hardware so i was the point of contact for emergencies that weekend no the datacenter went down he replied irritated but i still didnt believe him its am in the morning and im not thinking clearly when he finally says im in the server room and all the power is off every server is off long story short i get dressed and make the long drive into corporate headquarters while calling other senior members on my team about the outage since this is a all hands on desk moment everyone arrives in sweats and we sit in the war room while senior managers explain something triggered the smoke detectors so power was immediately cut we walked though the data center and there was nothing visibly showing a fire no smoke no scorch marks the it director in his wisdom issued a decree we will station admins at the end of every server and router row with fireextinguishers and then turn on the power well see where the smoke is coming from and if a fire breaks out we can put it out we all stared at the director and reminded him of the following we have liquid extinguishers you want us to spray electrical equipment with liquid the datacenter systems will automatically lock the doors then start vacuuming out the oxygen so to be clear you want us to electrocute ourselves while simultaneously suffocating the it director was walked out fired weeks later cause of smoke one of the four huge airconditioning units began dripping oil the oil hit an electrical outlet below the raised floor and the resulting sparks caused smoke not a fire this was finally discovered via security recordings of the datacenter that happened to catch the rising smoke simply turned off the effect ac unit and fired everything back up slowly was a long day and lots of pizza

previous tales from dishonest used car dealershipusersubmitted this is it folks the last part of the last story from my days at dishonest used car dealership its been a hell of a ride and i want to thank each and every one of you from the bottom of my cold black heart for coming along with me laughing at my dumb jokes and commiserating about the dark times when i started posting back in february i thought it would just be a fun thing to write up a story or two while i was sitting on my tail waiting for a job interview and never expected anything approaching the kind of response i have received and here we are at the beginning of october stories across posts more than words later it has been a profound honor to get to share these little snippets of my life with you all but rest assured the ducd saga may be at an end but after much cajoling ive decided to drop at least a story or two from the places i worked after i cant promise quite as much drama but we did get up to some nonsense and thank you all so very much for all the kind words as i have shared these stories with you i appreciate it more than you know i do have one brief bit of business if you will permit after many extremely kind requests to put my stories from ducd into a more permanent form i am actually getting off my lazy backside and doing something about it i have gone and edited these stories into something a little more booklike and as soon as i am happy with the manuscript i will be selfpublishing them in paperback and ebook formats ill have more news about that very soon anyway i now present the conclusion of the dishonest used car dealership saga in the fray at dishonest used car dealership surrounding the departure of the diplomat and the necessity of the owners filling in for our nowmissing sales staff the one critical thing we absolutely required to do business had not gotten paid our insurance i can get cars fixed without running water or electricity god knows i can do it without garbage pickup since we hadnt seen a garbage truck in weeks but insurance we had to have we also now had a major cashflow situation as well with lady applebees having cost the company a good on her car switcharoo my former romantic prospects medical bills to pay not to mention replacement shoes to buy and a onceshowquality mercedes that we were going to have to buy outofpocket we had a lot of money about to head out the door we also had no sales staff other than rom and the amazon filling in and were short two technicians felonious monk should have been out of police custody already but he wasnt the police wouldnt tell us much but the rumor around the shop was that he had failed a drug test while in custody and we would not be seeing him for some time as with all rumors it was impossible to know whether it was true or not especially considering felonious monk always seemed pretty skittish when drugs would be found in customers cars at the same time he was also impulsive and didnt think very far ahead so who knows in any case we were going to be very far into the red with no real way to make it up any time soon that monday morning rom and the amazon called an emergency allhands meeting we piled into the conference room not really sure what to expect it certainly wasnt going to be anything pleasant thats for sure we all sat down and the amazon broke the silence gtta good morning everyone i think we all are well aware of the events that have transpired recently and so i dont think we need to rehash the unpleasantness of the last few weeks but as you are undoubtedly aware whether by accident or malice or incompetence the last few weeks have been extremely costly however what most of you are unaware of is that our insurance company has terminated our policy which means the costs of these incidents will likely have to come out of our budget there was a murmur among the technicians and miami vice gtta we are currently in talks with our attorney as to whether something can be done about this situation but in the meantime we are going to have to tighten the belt considerably to survive lord salisbury spoke up gtls what precisely does that entail gtta im glad you asked colossal redneck rom and i have been discussing this situation over the weekend and we all agree that sacrifices will have to be made in order to keep this ship afloat most of these sacrifices will be minimal to save some electricity were going to unplug the refrigerator in the shop and were going to ask that the technicians refrain from using the welders the tube bender or anything that runs off the phase converter were also going to take a brief hiatus from restocking things like office supplies well just have to use what weve got until we run out were also going to clear out our used car inventory and not purchase any more cars at auction for a while so most of the changes are going to be minimal and shouldnt significantly affect the course of business gtls that all sounds very good except except theres a word in there you keep using that makes me nervous gtta and whats that gtls most you keep saying most of the sacrifices will be minimal its that most thats bothering me gtta yes well as i said we are all going to have to make sacrifices if we want to stay afloat lord salisbury was beginning to look irritated mr sarcastic spoke up in his place gtms are you going to continue farting around and avoiding whatever it is youre trying to say or are you going to get to the point gtta fine in order to ensure the companys solvency commissioned employees are going to have their commissions suspended until this crisis is over you will still receive your base pay hourly employees i guess thats just miami vice will receive minimum wage the technicians leaned back in their chairs and shook their heads i was completely taken aback the entire pay cut plan had certainly not crossed my desk and in my surprise i spoke up gtme youve got to be fcking kidding me this is the plan you came up with that is not a small pay cut youre talking about here it would be one thing to have some furlough days or for us not to work overtime but thats half my paycheck and its more like of the techs pay youre taking away not one of us had a damn thing to do with everything thats gone down in the last weeks and it is ridiculous and entirely unfair to dock our pay to cover other peoples fckups gtta well you were driving the when it burned that girl gtme yeah and when you can articulate how her getting hurt was my doing let me know gtta i think you are failing to comprehend the magnitude of this situation gtme okay then if the cash flow issue is that big tell me are you pursuing a business loan to hold us over or perhaps you could sell or mortgage or rent out one of the three houses you two own or perhaps rom could sell that tacky gold rolex on his wrist or maybe you could flip some of our inventory at cost just to get some cash in hand there are a thousand ways to solve this problem but what youve done is push the responsibility and the pain onto everyone but yourselves gtta now that is completely unfair all of us are having to make sacrifices gtme really so what kind of pay cut will the two of you be taking gtta i can assure you rom and i will be taking significant pay cuts as well gtme yeah im sure you will lord salisbury chimed in once again gtls well ive heard about enough of this what about you mr sarcastic gtms yeah im with you this is bullsht lord salisbury reached into his pocket and fished out his keychain he unthreaded the shop key from the ring and thunked it on the table mr sarcastic followed suit lord salisbury turned to colossal redneck gtls post me my check colossal redneck stood from the table gtcr now wait jes a minute fellas lord salisbury stood from the table and faced down colossal redneck gtls post me my check rom seeing this jumped from the table and blocked the door with his body gtrom none of you are going anywhere lord salisbury whipped around to face him gtls move now rom braced his hands against the door frame gtrom no one is leaving without my approval in all the time i had worked with lord salisbury i had never once seen him angry never once heard him raise his voice he was the textbook definition of the charming english gentleman all of the sudden the lord salisbury i knew vanished from the room replaced by some sort of lesser demon absolute fury washed over his face and his body tensed in a flash he reached out with his hand and grabbed rom by the neck and squeezed roms eyes betrayed his terror and he tried to scream but lord salisburys hand crushed in around his neck rom released his grip on the door frame and lord salisbury tossed him aside into a heap on the floor the amazon shot up from the table but lord salisbury stopped her cold with a glare his voice dropped into a deep hissing snarl gtls sit the fck down she immediately retreated to her chair and lord salisbury stared her down for a moment he turned and disappeared out toward the shop mr sarcastic in tow the room was in stunned silence rom gradually crawled back onto his feet and we sat for a moment i finally threw my hands up in disgust at the whole thing and went back to my office it was two hours later and i was in my office polishing off a letter of resignation i had already packed my things into a box taken down the paintings off the wall and deleted anything good off my computer i heard a knock on the door and miami vice slipped into my office gtmv look uh i dont know how to say this gtme i think i know what youve got on your mind but shoot gtmv well ive been thinking about it and its the pay thing i cant live on minimum wage gtme i understand do you have something else lined up gtmv i just called a friend of mine he works at a bar up at the top of the lake i guess theyre looking for someone to help in the kitchen i stood up and reached out a hand gtme youve been a terrific employee im sorry it came to this let me know if theres ever anything i can do for you he shook my hand gtmv its been wild it really has i walked with him out through the bay and he disappeared beyond the sandwich shop toward the bus stop a minute later two flatbed tow trucks rolled into the parking lot and idled up next to the shops bay door mr sarcastic and lord salisbury slowly rolled their enormous tool chests out toward the trucks the tow truck drivers grabbed their winch cables and pulled the tool chests onto the trucks the drivers strapped down their loads and the trucks pulled out of the parking lot toward their respective destinations i ran into the shop grabbed three beers and intercepted the technicians we cracked our beers and shared a toast gtme gentlemen its been an honor working with you i just want you to know if you ever need a reference if you ever need someone to vouch for your skills you have my number we chugged our beers and threw the cans into the back of colossal rednecks pickup and the two of them got in their cars and drove out of the parking lot for the last time i went back inside and printed my letter of resignation i folded it in thirds and walked over to colossal rednecks office gtcr this here has been quite a day hasnt it gtme it has this is for you i handed him the letter he read it over gtcr you too huh i nodded gtcr i woulda thought of everyone on the staff you woulda been the loyal one gtme well i have a sneaking suspicion that im never going to see a paycheck from here again so gtcr what if i went an got you yer paycheck right now whatevers outstanding would that up an change yer mind any gtme i gotta be honest you and i know that its just going to bounce plus i aint gonna try and live off just my base pay from here on out gtcr you and me we kin sort out yer pay rate as fer now ill betcha theres enough money in onea the accounts ta cover what yer owed gimme a minute colossal redneck disappeared down the street to the bank and came back a few minutes later with an envelope full of cash he handed it to me gtcr that oughta cover ya up to friday hows that sound i fanned out the cash on the table and counted it it was all there more or less colossal redneck handed me back my letter of resignation gtcr i dont suppose ill be needin this then i flicked it back on his desk gtme no im afraid you still do gtcr what cmon man ya cant quit ya got yer money gtme look around you man weve got no technicians weve got no sales people its just you and me now i dont know what things look like from your vantage point but this sure looks like a sinking ship from where im standing you and i are clinging onto the top of the fcking mast and youre trying to tell me that because our feet arent wet yet that theres nothing to worry about well im sorry but thats bullsht there was a time when i worked here because i thought we were doing something special that we were selling really cool cars that were going to help save the environment that this was an upandcoming business where i could build a career but those days are so far behind me theyre on the other side of the horizon if i cant even rely on my paychecks coming in then im not real sure what point there is to being here how much more money is there to just up and hand out come payday enough for a month two weeks gtcr sometimes we all gotta make some sacrifices though i mean yall havent been the easiest employee and it seems like ya oughta show some loyalty ya know gtme if you think youve got to do the honorable thing and ride this ship all the way to the bottom you go and do that but im not about to sacrifice even one second of my life on some madeup principle for two people who dont have the slightest inkling of what the words honor or loyalty mean every fcking day here has been a fight you and i have never received the slightest bit of respect and ill be damned if im going to sit here and have you try and tell me that i owe you or them or this fcking company a goddamned thing colossal redneck looked down at my letter of resignation he paused and then stood from his desk gtcr alright he held out his hand gtcr its been terrible havin yall as an employee i shook his hand gtme youve been a horrible boss he saluted me and i grabbed my box of things and walked out the big bay door for the last time epilogue it was a month after i left ducd a drizzly cold friday afternoon and i was loading the last of my possessions into a big box truck on a lark i had applied at a job in a city about three hours away and strangely enough they had offered me a position the pay wasnt quite as good but it was a chance for something new somewhere new where i could clear my head and just start over i had given notice to my landlord that i was leaving given away the things i didnt need said goodbye to the few friends i had left and sold the jeep as a final fck you to the dealership i had also dropped a dime to the county about the illegal dumping going on behind the shop the pile had gotten bad enough that we had started calling it the trasherhorn and between that and the dozens of gallons of old coolant and used motor oil the technicians had dumped on the ground back there the county had told me that they were very interested in conducting an investigation on the way out of town i made one last swing past the dealership just to see what had become of the place i pulled off to the far side of the road and idled for a moment the lot was very empty rom and the amazons car was there but no others i recognized not even colossal rednecks they had little inventory on display and even fewer cars that appeared to belong to customers the service bay was shut tight and the lights were off inside the service office as i idled rom and the amazon appeared from the sales office shouting at each other the amazon got in roms face and screamed something then turned and marched back inside rom stood for a moment and then started kicking a honda over and over again until there was a big dent in the back door he stopped and stood there alone shoulders drooped in the rain i put the box truck into gear and pulled away i turned onto the highway pointing the truck toward the edge of town i switched on the radio and turned it to max slid the transmission into overdrive and put the pedal to the floor i drove south far beyond the horizon away from it all many months later i came back north with a girl i was dating to show her the city that had defined so much of my adulthood a city that has so indelibly dyed the very fabric of who i am that all these many years later i still dream of warm summer nights windows down driving on the bridge across the lake that the smell of food still transports me back to the little ramen bar just south of downtown the one i never knew the name of because the sign was in japanese windows fogged from the warm soup and the cold rain and to this day when i drive through the big city to the north i choke up and my voice catches because when i came the city broke me and molded me and made me new and when i left i left so much of me there most of me still stands there on the pale sands on the shore feeling the wind just this side of cold looking out across the water to the islands beyond and watching the boats come in for the night as the sky turns orange then red then blue then black standing there waiting for the rest of me to come home i turned off the highway in the big dodge i now drove and pulled into the dealerships parking lot it was empty save for an abandoned oldsmobile decaying silently in a corner the windows to the offices were hastily boarded up and graffiti covered the bay doors the sign for the dealership was dingy from the rain and moss was beginning to grow over the letters i drove around back and we hopped out of the truck the empty lot behind the service bay had been mostly cleaned up the girl looked around and turned to me gtwhat is this place gtit was a car dealership i used to work here gtit looks awful i gave the place one last look as i climbed back into the truck gtit was it really was
it is the year we have refurbished our boardroom and installed a lot of new gear including screens the largest we could fit in the space a hub of sorts in the table that handles almost every type of connection one may need and a spiffing switching system that allows us to display any source on either screen via a nice touchscreen remote control this remote control is quite intuitive the home screen has buttons for the left screen and the right screen and pressing one or the other brings up the sources you can display as part of the project i had to write an instruction manual for the new kit i set this out in a taskbased format eg preparing for a presentation using the boardroom laptop this took the better part of months to get right and it had to be right given senior management would be referring to it when setting up the room or so we hoped in the nearly three years since i have received many many urgent summonses to the boardroom because someone has a meeting in there in minutes and they want to share their or someone elses laptop display on a screen noone ever opened the instruction manual to my knowledge cut to today i am eyeing my ticket queue with some suspicion when exec darkens my doorway he informs me that he will be conducting a demo of system to a whole bunch of people in the boardroom and will need his ultrabook laptop to display system on the screen system is networkonly and quite chatty and these ultrabooks dont have builtin network or vga ports so i hand him a usbtoethernet adapter and tell him where the boardrooms minidisplayporttovga adapter is kept he leaves my office saying that hell come up again when his laptop is in the room so that i can set up the equipment about minutes later i realise that his meeting will start shortly so i saunter down to the room a screen is on there is a laptop screen on it and it matches whats on execs laptop screen gtexec hey yeah im all good i read the instructions gtme y wha which instructions those ones there points to the instruction manual gtexec yeah worked well never before have i had to physically restrain myself from throwing my arms around another man tldr some users actually rtfm
im on my way into the office yesterday at my phone rings its userb gtuserb hey sparkstalker weve got an issue over here at office useras signature pad isnt working do you have a new one to replace it me ok so this is the one she emailed me about on friday night the email i replied to telling her i would call her as soon as i could on monday morning right gtuserb yeah so how soon before you can bring a new one over me well im actually still on the way in hence why i havent called yet but lets try some troubleshooting before we start swapping out hardware i can walk you through a few steps before i get there first things first was anything changed or done on friday before this happened gtuserb nope nothing at all it just stopped working friday me ok so whats it doing gtuserb well it lights up and you see the signature on the pad but nothing shows up on the pc me ok try moving to a different usb port gtuserb we did we put it in another one in the docking station and also in the laptop it still didnt work me ltsighgtltsighgt alright try switching it with yours im almost at my office so ill walk across the parking lot to yours once i drop my stuff off give me about minutes naturally its about f and its a half mile walk across the completely full parking lots nonetheless i hike over while dodging the maniacs that seem to think a hospital parking lot is their personal indianapolis once inside i start talking to usera we run down all the normal things did anything change of course not did you restart the machine of course did you swap out the pad like i asked of course well did the swapped out pad work on userbs pc i dont know why would we try that his doesnt have the problem mine does ltsighgtltsighgt i should mention that at this point usera lets slip that userc aka the third stooge downloaded and renistalled the software so much for nothing had changed alright lets check the setup sure enough the wrong stile pad is selected i change it but still no luck not knowing what version userc downloaded and installed i set about removing and reinstalling with the correct settings all with no success so the process of elimination begins again first things first move the usb plug to the laptop directly instead of the docking station gtoh we already tried that it didnt work exclaims usera funny because now the signature pad works flawlessly im guessing if they did test it they only did it after userc decided to fuck around and remember i asked them to switch the pad yeah somehow in their panicked state im sure they remembered to ziptie the new pad down nice and neat im sure they did why would they lie but at least were getting somewhere i move the usb to another one on the docking station gtusera why are you doing that just leave it in the other one since it works me well we want to isolate the actual issue i need to know if the one usb is faulty or if its the whole docking station gtusera well it seems like a waste of time since we know it works now as i ignore her and continue testing i see that her scanner is plugged in to the docking station also naturally i inquire about its functionality gtusera oh its working fine the problem is with the signature pad the scanners perfect uh huh sure it does as the signature pad fails in another usb on the docking station so for giggles i try the scanner its a no go of course gtusera funny it worked fine on friday amazing just like the signature pad so now i start to dig deeper for the root cause everything else on the docking station is functional ethernet video etc just the usbs i scour my memory banks power ive seen before where a docking station will drop usb performance if there isnt enough power i look at the power brick its the correct one for the docking station it should be providing enough juiceunlessi trace the cord back to the power strip and it looks a bit weird weird because theres a heavy duty extension cord plugged into it that runs behind a cabinet i follow it around the wall and there on the end of this heavy ass extension cord is a refrigeratorltfacepalmgtltfacepalmgt me so has this been here long gtusera oh no we just added it on friday i wait probably too long for usera to connect the dots apparently thats still beyond the capacity of her brain functionality so i finally explain to all three stooges that a refrigerator draws quite a lot of current and that by plugging it in to the power strip not only were they depriving the docking station of the power they needed but were also creating a major fire hazard the dull glassy look in their eyes told me that i would be better off explaining it to the furniture i told them they needed to move the fridge and check with facilities before they plug it in to see if their area even would support a small appliance and begin the game of frogger back over to the safety and warmth behind my office door tldr its like a screwdriver just because it fits doesnt mean you should stick it in there

i am not the hero of this story that honour goes to uhaakon my partner in crime and more crime have you ever been on call and had a fault come in and thought oh god i really cannot deal with this right now ive been that guy today im that guy id recently said fuck you to working for other people and started my own business uhaakon and i had been idly discussing ventures we might like to undertake for about years when it happened i went out on my own at first and when we were making enough money he quit his job also and we went to work but before that happened he helped out on nights and weekends wherever he could it was tough going for both of us at first but it was worth it when i started out i contacted all the companies id done contract work for in the past and offered them support contracts one in particular who ill call server tech did web hosting server rental and colocation theyd been keen to support my venture but declined to move forward saying theyd call when they needed something and deal with the cost later we both knew they would when an emergency came such was the manner of our existing arrangement we just didnt know how big so when i found a missed call from server tech on a saturday morning and i was km away setting up my tent at a camp site ready for a weekend off i called uhaakon and asked him if he could call them to see what they wanted i then promptly went back to my tentbeer and proceeded to have a lovely weekend in the mountains on sunday evening when i got back i thought id ping him to see what they wanted and how it went i couldve guessed any number of reasons theyd call hell i could have sat there guessing for a whole week and not gotten it server techs building had been bought by a rd party who had agreed verbally to let them renew their lease the actual lease agreement however had not been signed so when the day of the lease end rolled around noone expected anything to change they certainly didnt expect the new owner to cut all power and fibre to the building unbeknownst to server tech the new owner was planning on using his new acquisition to start a competing business using not only their floor but the entire building and in one fell swoop hed managed to knock their business entirely off the air now weve had some pretty tough jobs in our time but this one this takes the cake while i was off soaking up the forest air uhaakon and the customer had located a suitable building for the new datacentre site agreed to lease it connected a wireless microwave link from a nearby highrise to the new building rented the largest generator ive ever seen and more portable airconditioners than an airconditioning convention organised cablers to cable up the new site organised electricians to power up the new site moved every single server network device and rack reconfigured them and finally got everyone back online it was the end of sunday and theyd just finished working but they were online the customer base wasnt happy but the story was so catastrophic that some of them just straight up didnt believe them turning up to the old site to complain to find it empty the generator powered the site for over a month being refuelled every day until enough highvoltage power cabling could be run from the grid into the building to power up the upss and finally have a completed site i was stunned server tech had managed to run up a bill close to of afterhours support time in one weekend but their business was alive and kicking so they paid it happily ive never been so glad to miss a phone call in all my life and to this day i look back at uhaakons dedication for inspiration because that motherfucker went back to his day job the next day if im tech support macguver then hes the terminator usual plug for rchhopsky for other nontfts good times fortunately nothing like this nothing like this ever again please compulsory thanks for the gold edit

 first thing monday morning i found myself underneath the desk of an employee gtme youve a lot of stuff plugged in under here my face was inches away from three power strips all daisy chained together every port was filled with various chargers printers and screens i wriggled myself out from under the desk and quickly snatched up my monday morning coffee the employee looked expectantly at me he wasnt happy i looked around the office and saw the grumpy employees manager he was struggling carrying a few boxes it wasnt the right time to call him over yet gtmondaygrump so mr expert why why is my computer occasionally shutting off gtme youre overloading the power strips probably drawing too much power through the first one tripping it i looked around his desk at the various chargers and devices none seemed particularly power hungry gtmondaygrump you say that with such certainly like i said before however i cant be overloading them ive calculated mondaygrump pushed a piece of paper towards me it was filled with various numbers with addition and subtractions i opened my mouth to explain for the fourth time that perhaps plugging the computer directly into the wall and seeing if that would work is perhaps a good idea the words however would not come out i had tried too many times already i looked around for the manager i caught sight of him in the break room making coffee it would be too mean to call him over mid coffee i thought as i sipped my own brew gtme i can see youve put a lot of effort into your sums i caught sight of one of the numbers i stopped talking instantly gtestimated power draw for coworker w gtmondaygrump well if you cant even argue with the numbers like a professional gtme wait whats this estimation mondaygrump pointed me to the first power strip first plug i followed that plug it went to another power strip gtme oh come on gtmondaygrump whats wrong i looked at the pyramid of daisy chained power strips underneath his coworkers desk gtme shes drawing well over watts gtmondaygrump is she his face was gleeful i was taken aback at how happy he seemed he dove underneath the table with me and started chasing wires and counting wattages gtme err i stood up from underneath the desk i decided to wait this one out eventually mondaygrump crawled out from underneath the desk he looked at me with a smile gtmondaygrump nope nice try though combined were still under gtme cant we just try plugging the computer straight into the wall mondaygrump shook his head gtmondaygrump we need to solve this mystery where is your sense of duty i looked up for his manager this time i caught sight of him he was oddly mid embrace with another employee i decided not to call him over mid hug gtme its monday morning i tried to stifle a yawn by drinking some coffee at that time mondaygrumps co worker turned up she was wearing a very long dress she sat down at her desk and turned on her computer gtlongdress hey what cha all doing gtmondaygrump nothing just power stuff you know men talk mondaygrump was smiling at longdress who was contently smiling back i got a sexist vibe that i didnt care for gtlongdress well dont mind me longdress proceeded to duck underneath the desk for a second then popped back up gtmondaygrump so whats wrong with it gtme youre overloading the power longdress looked up from her desk gtlongdress oh no he cant be ive checked that she rummaged around in her desk for a moment and pulled out a piece of paper it had a bunch of numbers with plus signs etc gtme you two are longdress reached down between her legs and suddenly the computers all turned off gtgrumpymonday see theyre always turning off just like this gtme wait what did you just do i stared at longdress gtlongdress turned up the heater a tad gtgrumpymonday heater since when did you have a heater i smiled and wrote heater w at the bottom of the page job done gtlongdress i hide it under my dress so i can get warm air youre always making a fuss about peak power usage i just want to be warm gtgrumpymonday those things are huge loads theyre ineffic gtme sorry to interrupt but im gonna go as i turned around the manager of the department was standing behind me gtmanager everything fixed i looked at the two people fighting behind me gtme yep kinda mostly gtmanager twenty years of marriage will do that to you they should probably hug it out thats what i did whenever i had an office argument with my wife oh theyre married right gtmanager almost a shame we dont work together anymore office hugs are fun the manager looked happy however i was too busy trying to work out who he was hugging before gtme im just gonna go i drunk my coffee as i left the department and tried to remove the bad taste that place left in my mouth 
i keep telling myself i have to post more of my stories but ive had a lousy day so im going to cheer myself up by posting an old problem this is from about years ago and as for the background i had been doing tech support for end users with printers for about a year or so customer calls up gives me his details and i start generating a case i got a bad feeling about this a few minutes in where he cuts me off while im talking to tell me you have to speak up im at a train station great so hes nowhere near the machine if we need to check anything plus i cant compete with the noise of a train so while i do speak up im not shouting like he would like i get round to what the problem is i bought printer x a few weeks ago to print out notes for my university course im studying law it says on the box the toner in it lasts for pages as a rough memory i cant recall the numbers exactly ive done about pages of printing because i need notes im studying law so they are quite important anyway the machine tells me the toner has run out but ive only done half a ream of paper so i know its cant be true this is not a shocking question as people have got this before but times the speed of it being used is surprising seeing its a cheap desktop black and white machine that will often not get much use i start to ask questions regarding the usage that expected toner life is based on constant printing and more importantly only covering of a page i remember a flat mates law notes and ask how much he is printing on the page theyre law notes im studying law so i have a lot of notes to review ive got reasonable eyesight so to save carting around heaps of paper i cram it all onto a page at about point font so if you hold a page at page at arms length it probably looks like a patchy black colour all over the page right due to all the text sound of rustling paper yeah pretty much its law notes so its all very important i go on to explain how usage like that is going to drain the toner quicker than expected hes not happy and wants to check the numbers as well as what i am saying about the usage i direct him on where to get the coverage information from the machine and where in the manual it explains the link between coverage and the toner life he goes quiet and makes notes through this confirming page numbers and a few other things he starts talking about what im telling him cant be legal he knows these things apparently i explain that if he has numbers that dont match what i said to let me know and we can look into it further hes not happy but ends the call i note it in the system and go on with my day two days later customer calls back again from a train station he starts ranting immediately and i end up not being able to get any details out of him but dig up the customer notes in the system when i realise its the same guy he has checked the numbers and hes been doing coverage or something like that the machine has printed something just above pages at a glance these numbers seem right to me but he wants free stuff ive wasted a lot of time finding this out and still cant print you need to send me toner to fix this fault its not a fault he used the toner a lot and got his usage from it more to the point i find he actually has a small amount of toner left and the machine is just giving him a low toner message i explain the maths and he insists that even though the matches works someone at the store should have warned him law notes use a lot more toner than other subjects because he told them several times he was using it for notes i explain that unless he showed them what he was printing they may not have realised what he was going to use it for but he told them several times he was studying law really so they should be prepared for this at this point i know im in the right so tell him he isnt getting free stuff he has to buy new toner and at his current usage a replacement toner will last him x number of pages he doesnt like this and hangs up i check his details find which distributor sent the machine out originally and forward some notes to our sales rep for that group just in case it comes up sales rep in question is pretty good with usage and things like that and he basically replies that he doubts he will hear about it but will keep it in mind about an hour later he comes and sees me a store just called to report this guy called them trying to make a complaint then threaten legal action for misrepresenting the product the store had told him he wasnt getting free stuff either so he hung up and they called the sales rep to ask if they were going to get in trouble from this guy no we have notes already he threatened legal action did you know hes a lawyer i grumble and add some more notes to the system i dont hear anything for the rest of the week until monday morning first call of the day a coworker answersand we can all hear shouting the moment he picks up he tries for a few moments then spins around in his chair its for you i get a call transferred to me and behold its the law student now arguing that the toners dont fill properly weve already guessed that he didnt buy a new toner so im trying to get him to tell me how he refilled it because at this point i suspect he has either got a non genuine item not supported or possibly even refilled with inkjet ink its happened in the past and sooooo not supported its not refilling with paper ash wait what i spent two hours on the weekend sending through blank pages for it to burn with the laser and fill the cartridge again its not burning the paper and its not refilling the toner at this point i stand up so my supervisor can see me over the partition and hear me the co worker from earlier looks up as well to see whats happening i want to make sure i have witnesses to this so youre telling me that in order to refill the toner cartridge youve been sending through blank paper under the impression that toner is paper ash and doing so will let the machine burn the paper and create a new source of toner for you depositing it back into the cartridge and letting you keep printing customer sounds smug yes i did my research i know what im doing i found out how these things work i make eye contact with everyone who i can see as they are mainly trying to hold back laughter no thats not how it works at all i suggest you buy a new toner and install it when prompted this machine will not create new toner for you you cant tell me that im going to be a lawyer ill take you to court over this in which case i will repeat what i have told you the last few days in front of everyone assembled that is not how the machine works you have used your toner and need more customer grunts and ends the call to this day i have not been asked to appear in court for this 
a few months ago i got an emergency call from a customer because the core switch cisco at a school was down symptoms switch would boot up experience a crash then reboot over and over and over again after some troubleshooting its obvious that the problem is bigger than just corrupt firmware the supervisor is damaged and possibly even the backplane gtme so what happened gt networktech power outage gt me i thought all of the core network gear was on ups gt nt well there was a ups but they unplugged it gt me who unplugged it gt nt the principal it started beeping last year so they unplugged everything from the ups and powered it off gt me facepalm so someone whose networking knowledge barely covers the configuration of a residential wireless router took it upon themselves to disconnect a switch from the only thing keeping it safe from texas summer power fluctuations this resulted in the school being down for a day and a half while it tracked down new equipment because years ago someone else decided to save money by not renewing maintenance contracts of course the school blames it because they should have just known that the ups was bad and they should have fixed the switch faster tldr its easier to buy a new car than it is to change the oil
today at the helpdesk i was helping get an old professor set up on his new computer after a complete data transfer he opened it up logged on and immediately brought up finder and started frantically searching for a file i noticed he was holding his breath then he located a particular video and let it out with a long sigh pressing play and entering full screen it was an old woman wired up to a host of machines breathing heavily looking right at the camera the professor turned to me and said this is the only file i wanted its my last conversation with my wife before she passed away from cancer after he left i had to take a few minutes to compose myself gosh edit wow i didnt expect this response at all im glad you all like happy stories i think that everyone who works tech support agrees that its what keeps us going if anyone wants to read something from the complete opposite end of the spectrum i also just wrote this up shamelessselfpromotion
any telco has lots of people manning phones in a myriad of departments sometimes things are busier than usual on key lines ranging from sales to tech support thats when hrlogistics where i work start handing down orders to cut corners to save seconds in every way possible at tech support high call volume is common for front line staff when we have sudden unforeseen technical problems spikes in calls waiting and the tickets front line file about them is key for senior staff to rapidly identify the problems and get the ball rolling on a fix we also use unofficial scripts that check frontlines logged tickets every couple minutes and report unusual volumes in any ticket subcategory selecting categories is one of the first things done during a call so we often pick up on a new problem within minutes thanks to this used to be that during a spike in calls hrlogistics would only send people in call centers emails asking to avoid doing anything but taking calls until further notice use cold transfers inbetween departments instead of politely conferencing offer unlimited overtime to everyone who is in a position to take it if their shift is about to end and other reasonably sane things like that but the special efficiency measures as they call them got worse and worse floor managers were to ask politely if youd agree to delay your lunchbreaks till later if lines were deep red they cant order you to according to the work contract but they tried asking then they started offering to pay overtime to people willing to forgo their lunch break altogether they started scrutinizing bathroom breaks while deep red to make sure they werent situationally abused then they told front line to ask customers whether we could have a specialist call them back in a couple hours if their issue was clearly going to take a long time to fix then they finally went a bridge too far adding to their orders gt due to high call volume stop logging tickets immediately until further notice tsss was dumbfounded when we read that on one hand this was hr implicitly acknowledging our ticket system is slow and inefficient its always been awhile back they spent a few millions trying to improve it and it somehow got worse some statscrunching suit up in his ivory tower figured out we could shave a minute off wrapup time anytime we dont file tickets about why customers called us it might even kind of make sense in some other departments but not at tech support we rely on that data to pinpoint issues and outages and keep track of repeat callers its invaluable data not only would this hurt troubleshooting it really wouldnt improve their holy average handling time front line techs during outages hate the speed at which theyre expected to take calls and if they have an extra wrapup minute here and there to use while staying within expected metrics they spend it cooling down not taking an extra call since this crazy directive came up from on high i first sent up the food chain a lengthy polite explanation of why we need the tickets at all times how not having them hurt our ability to efficiently solve the issue and why this was a particularly bad way to save time hrlogistics immediately reacted by editing their special efficiency measures template gt due to high call volume stop logging tickets immediately until further notice unless specifically instructed to by your departments senior staff or your immediate manager which not only did not in any way solve the issue or respond to any of my points it in fact made things worse as we started getting escalation calls from techs who wanted to ask us permission to file a ticket for issues midcrisis the next time we got a temporary order to stop logging tickets i immediately sent a reply to every group working at tech support omitting all departments not under our purview and hrlogistics using tsss groupwide emergency procedures email this meant about a thousand people including contractors and the departments lower and middlemanagement would see it gt tsss in compliance with the special efficiency measures tsss instructs that everyone at tech support under our purview keeps logging tickets for every single call failure to do so would unacceptably hinder our ability to address current issues in a timely fashion and would negatively impact our overall customer experience and satisfaction if youre likely going to piss off management in writing throw in a couple buzzwords it makes the pill much easier to swallow for them i thought i was basically taunting them over this nonsense i figured it would make enough waves that theyd have no choice but debate it and likely review their procedure though it could put me in a little bit of trouble to practically just replyall plz ignore hr union job security affords me enough leeway to poke anyone in the eye if need be but i was definitely expecting some minor fallout i was ready for pretty much any scenario aside from everything going well i was expecting to be told this isnt what was meant you cant just tell everyone to just ignore the directive and yet stuff around here works in mysterious ways not only did no one question my email everybody complied and all went well and at the next tsss meeting gt frank so that email bytewave sent during the last outage it helped tremendously were utterly fed if we dont get tickets during outages i suggest we add procedures for whoever is handling the tickets to send the same email should this directive be sent to tech supports frontline again in the future gt my boss yes as long as hrs email has the language saying senior staff can grant instructions on the matter i expect a copy of that email to go out within minutes tops every time we get this set of special efficiency measures we really need the tickets its a core business intelligence priority but im told the order not to file tickets will stay in their template no more information available everybody nodded or shrugged and that was it i tried not to seem too surprised whenever tech support is swamped and they hand down emergency orders to temporarily cut corners its now on the books policy for tsss to reply asap and tell frontline to ignore the part about not filing tickets on our own say so and everybody is fine with that yet we cant get hr to not ask in the first place kafkaesque all of bytewaves tales on 
using longtimelurker using firsttimeposter hello tfts im a software developer currently working in london but for several years i worked in another more sunny country this tale dates back to that time i was employed by a biggermanengineeringcompany at the time being such a big company the management section of our headquarters had more people than the actual engineering section or the marketing section or any other section you can think of and rumors were that it was because any highlevel manager would hire friends and family giving them a role in management even when the company was cutting down on new hires what they did in that section consisted basically of glorified bookkeeping filling out excel spreadsheets for every single task from keeping track of expenses to tracking down how many plastic cups were in each coffee machine every friday no im not kidding all the developers including me have been called more than once to design a new spreadsheet for x task i usually did that without thinking about it too much it didnt happen often i could wait until i had finished whatever more important project i was working on at that moment and usually never took more than minutes to prepare the spreadsheets with the correct formulas they could probably do it themselves if they spent a bit of time googling beginner guides to excel but i figured it wasnt really an issue to help the coffee machine was placed right beside the door to the management offices so whenever i was on a coffee break i could actually see and hear what was going on in that office there was this one time when i overheard the following conversation going on between a guy and a girl in management she was sitting at the pc typing and the guy was standing beside her desk with papers in his hands telling her what to write gt guy on b its gt girl types gt guy on b its gt girl types hmm hmm gt guy on b its gt girl types ok repeat for another cells all on column b gt guy and on b its gt girl types done now the total gt guy pulls out a desk calculator and starts typing yeah let me just make the sum and ill tell you what to type on b edit formatting i fail at it
i work at a large tech company and was just taking some typical tier calls when suddenly ring me hello this is me how can i help you today customer what the hell did you guys do to my mozilla me what seems to be the issue customer every time i open mozilla it just goes to companyhomepage i want you to remote in now and fix it i tried to explain to the man that mozilla is a company and that firefox is a web browser and that it was perfectly normal for him to be seeing web pages while opening this application customer well i never asked for firefox to be installed on here where is my mozilla i was in shock i kept trying to explain the idea behind a web browser but he was not having it i finally got into his computer and saw that indeed firefox was working as advertised but this was unacceptable to him finally he demanded that i bring back mozilla i navigated to the mozilla homepage and made it his homepage and he was delighted that i had fixed his issue he even called me a miracle worker i sometimes get frustrated with every day users and then i realize that it can always be worse 
i did this call about ten years ago the complaint was the printer would not continue printing while the secretary went for lunch and that even if she stayed on her station during her lunch break it still refused to print until her lunch period ended i arrived early because they had other problems in different parts of the company to work on i first checked out the secretarys printer it was a light gray hp model i cant remember the model number and it was printing fine the secretary then joked that i should come back just before noon and the printer would stop working just like the janitorial staff would do at noon i came back just before noon and did a test print it worked ok i then spent some time checking that the computers printer settings were correct they were then tried test printing again there was no printing coming out there also were no error messages just a nonprinting printer tested it again and then after checking the computer found the print jobs were still in the print spooler i looked at the printer the blinding white printer the blinding white printer i looked up to see a skylight directly overhead the printer i then just held a file folder over the printer and it started printing right away it did not take much checking but it seemed the bright sunlight entered thru the cooling slots on top of the printer and tripped so many of the sensors inside that printer did not even produce an error message once i showed the secretary how to block the light entering the slots so she could print but also explained why she could not just leave the folder over the cooling slots her problems were solved ps this problem only occurred in summer for just a few weeks then the sun had shifted enough that the printer could once again work all day 
i do onsite tech support for a large bank my coworker well call him bob and i cover an area that includes locations some are really close some are about hours away the rest are in between one sunday a really bad thunderstorm rolled through our coverage area a few of our locations lost power so bob and i were expecting a fair amount of calls on monday we get to the office monday morning and over the course of the day we end up with about calls in four separate branches for equipment that got fried by the power outages we spend the entire day loading software on pcs unboxing displays and local printers and calling our various branches to let them know that we would be out on tuesday tuesday morning rolls around and we meet at the office and load up our cars with equipment for the day we leave going in the same direction after about miles he was going to go south and get of the branches and i was going to go north and get the other about minutes after leaving the office bob calls me trrwilson meet me at that gas station up the road we meet and he tells me that he has to go hours in the opposite direction to replace a down switch tickets like those take priority over any others we transfer his equipment into my car i wish him luck and we part ways while he was on the road he called his branches and let them know what was going on and that i would be out in the afternoon i get to my first branches and things go ok i head south to go to the branches bob was supposed to visit i get to the first one and it was a mess one of the replacement pcs wouldnt come up so i had to frankenstein a working replacement from all the bad ones we picked up i finish up and realize that im not going to get to my last stop before they close not a huge problem since i have after hours access i call them up and tell them whats going on and theyre cool with it then i ask them if they can mark the bad equipment for me so that i dont have to stumble around in the dark trying to figure out what i have to replace again no problem theyll have them marked when i get there i arrive at the branch about minutes after the last person has left i carry my equipment into the foyer and then i see it there is a fun size candy bar laying on the floor of the foyer i figure someone had just dropped it as they were leaving i go through the doors into the branch lobby and then see another tiny candy bar right inside the lobby i look down and see that the users had made a candy trail leading from the front door into the offices with damaged equipment i follow the trail into the first office taped to the monitor is a picture of the user fakepunching the monitor i pull out my copy of the ticket and check the asset tag that is listed and sure enough the monitor was called in so i replace her monitor i follow the trail further and the next office has a picture of the user fakestomping on their pc i take the hint and replace his pc the last stop on the trail had a picture of the user fakekicking his printer so it gets replaced before i left i took a picture of me giving a cheesy grin and a thumbs up and taped them to each replacement the next morning when i got to the shop and checked my email i found that each user had send me a picture of them hugging their new equipment they really managed to brighten up a long and annoying day 
i just had an issue that i couldnt resolve locally it was for a printer that wasnt printing it worked fine from our test utility but wouldnt work from the users application with issues like this we always escalate it to the company that hosts the application and theyll do some magic on their end reset a bad address update a config etc to get it working again usually its a minute fix so i emailed them the details of the issue the exchange was something like this gt me hi were having issues with application not printing it works from our test utility but not from application so i imagine it just needs an address resetting on your end gt host thanks for letting us know could you please give the location so we can send an engineer i thought it was strange theyd send an engineer for an issue like this they usually just reset it remotely gt me location details are you going to send out an engineer usually you guys would just reset it remotely from your end gt them ive logged this as ticket reference and the engineer will be arriving soon i figure whatever its their application they know what theyre doing if they think they need an engineer on site then they probably do i leave the issue while i wait to hear back from them minutes later i get a call from my helpdesk gt hi haddock weve just logged a ticket for aforementioned issue from application host apparently im the engineer they were going to send out to look into the issue that i just escalated to them i dont think this is going to end well tldr thanks for reporting the issue well send you out to fix it shortly
i did it support for two years before moving onto a software engineer role and i can say the level of incompetence was astounding but this was by far the best story i have one day me and my fellow it team were chilling in our office waiting for the day to be over when our manager gets a phone call our boss fuming over how someone stole his hdd generally we never get a call from the boss so we all take this very seriously me and my manager along with another tech leave to check out the situation upon entering the office we find our boss using his computer im a bit hesitant so i let my manager do the talking he asks what computer had the hdd stolen as it obviously couldnt be the one hes using but our boss was adamant it was he asks us to come look at the computer and points to a hole on the tower an empty bay where a cdrom should be and starts fuming about how his hdd is completely gone i get red in the face and the other tech is pointing at the obviously working computer our manager explains what hes missing and how his computer does in fact have a hdd the boss is completely dumbfounded by this revelation he calmly sits back down and this is where he tries to save face states it was a test to see how responsive we were and how we could leave the office now thats when i knew it support that directly dealt with customers wasnt for me
hello tfts long time reader first time poster i used to manage desktops and do general troubleshooting at a university that had an aviation department ironically my actual degree not computeranything with an airport campus id make weekly trips to the airport to fix whatever might be broken set up new desktops figure out why their file server wasnt working etc these folks were definitely my favorites to help were rarely demanding would usually only call well after theyd already covered all of the basic troubleshooting steps and were very outofthebox thinkers when it came to computers sometimes a good thing and as youre about to see sometimes a very bad thing so on one of these visits i was tasked with installing some software on one of the mechanics computers when i got to their office they werent there which was to be expected unlocked their office and discovered their computer was awake and logged in this was not to be expected our lockout policy put the computers to sleep and locked them after minutes sit down to figure out what was keeping it awake and imagine my surprise when i moved the mouse and found they had carved a hole in the desk and installed a small cessna clock in the desk as in a clock pulled from a cessna instrument panel every time the minute hand moved the mouse registered it as movement and kept the computer awake to quote the great ron burgundy im not even mad thats amazing told my supervisor dont know if anything was done i was too impressed to care tldr cessna manufactures mechanical mouse jigglers
this was at a previous job after years of people coming into my office to ask me if the server was down which of course would be followed by a game of questions keep in mind we had servers and numourous little systems all over the place i decided to have some fun with it i found a decomissioned dell desktop wrote the server on the side of it in sharpy and put it up against the wall behind my chair for the next several months only with coworkers who i knew and knew that they knew my sense of humor whenever someone would come in and ask is the server down i would respond by looking at the desktop on the floor and reply with looks good to me one time one of the users said but it doesnt have any cables connected to it shouldnt there be cables nope its wireless ok good then walked out turns out their issue was trying to connect to an external webpage with a broken link

 monday morning i felt refreshed after a whole weekend off the office looked less depressing after a good sleep i did however feel that something was missing from the office it then dawned on me that defiant wasnt coming in anymore me ahhh darn it i decided the best way to get over it was to throw myself into tickets gtnew email theyve finally confirmed it mac has been hacked you need to disable all macs from the network headsec a helpful email attachment was included a word document inside which contained a single hyperlink to a news website announcing the confirmation of the first mac malware as soon as id read the article my phone started to ring gtme hello gtheadsec airz youre in already good have you checked your email gtme yeah actually next time you want to link something just post the address in the email dont attach a word document with the link inside headsec didnt sound like he was listening through the phone gtheadsec you gotta disable the macs man theyve been hacked gtme weve known about that vulnerable for a while it made world news how are you only hearing about this now gtheadsec are you disabling the macs gtme no my simple statement send headsec into overdrive gtheadsec but theyre vulnerable gtme weve known about the problem for a while luckily weve been spared infection gtheadsec we cant risk it i sighed first thing monday morning and someone already wants to disable an entire segment of our users machines gtme just calm down if were infected applications stop working it even says so in your article gtheadsec no no wait ill get the vp on the line hell sort this out the head of security proceeded to conference call the vp gtheadsec vp the macs are infected did you read the article i emailed you gtme they arent infected weve known about this bug for a while the vp was slow to respond it sounded like he was chatting to someone else in the background i thought i heard giggling must have been my imagination gtvp mmmm yes ive read the article i think i saw it on the news a while ago gtheadsec we should disable all macs gtme were not infected so no gtheadsec im hired as the security expert the secure thing to do is disable all the macs the vp took a while to respond this time he sounded like he was deciding gtvp were not infected gtme no gtvp but we could be gtheadsec yep the vp paused for a second gtvp well the answer is obvious then another pause this time for even longer gtvp pdas cant get infected f me 
journeying to work that day i knew there was to be plenty bad noise despite this feeling of ensuing doom it was an oddly upbeat kind of day the morning sun was subdued as it accompanied the first warm day of the year and seemed to fill the office with naturally warming uv light news of our remarkable failure flurried around the office as eyes stalked my path from the lobby to my desk as my outlook churned into gear it presented several new emails to look at i was only waiting for one the ominous calendar entry from our eminent sales director was present as expected decorated with the highimportance flag i spent the morning glancing through my tickets though i really had no intention of doing any of them angie appeared around her usual am her pace was rushed and the lack of her signatory starbucks cup distinguished angies obvious apprehension care to explain what happened yesterday her condescending vocal tone was different this time before harsh and snappy like a loathsome strict teacher a faint quiver existed somewhere in the background i dont know i responded for once i seemed to be in the power position i dont feel i was involved in this project she pressed for further information her voice taking on her signatory snarl and gripe hr tank accompanied by an anonymous administrative orderly unexpectedly appeared to relieve me of this interrogation she demanded the immediate presence of the entire its department in the nearest meeting room again our walking pace to the meeting room seemed exaggeratedly slow a homage to hr tanks slow purposeful walk i stood in the corner of the room only finally noticing the distinct lack of bhit hr tank began to speak through her reddened face fatigued from her trip her drained voice read her palpably preprepared and rubberstamped statement from a sheet which seemed to also serve as a barrier of defence it has been decided she began that due to incongruences that have arisen in the department of late that bhit is no longer able to fulfil his duty as head of it he will therefore not be returning to the business her statement droned on with all the officialdom you would expect from such a legally exacting statement her statement ended with i am authorized to answer any questions at this point the its team shuffled out dazed and wounded for his spinelessness bhit had evidently had all our backs somewhere along the line we took our seats like a pack of wounded animals returning from some failed hunt angie remained with hr tank discussing an imminent starbucks trip as roland stood guard in her absence we all sat still and silent in one way to mark the demise of bhit and in the other we felt that the slightest motion would be recorded and later used against us as evidence the fact that bhit had evidently taken the fall for the whole thing just seemed unreal angies consistent belittling and hateful nature just seemed to be the only outlook we were shellshocked that she had apparently won the postrollout meeting time came up as angie roland and i made our way to the top floor in the elevator the air grew thick with scorn the silence bellowed like a thousand years of social indifference as if the slightest word could ignite the situation like a megaton bomb it seemed like ages until the lift doors finally opened angie and roland obnoxiously barged out of the lift though i had yielded to them anyway this was my first time in front of an official board the room layout had changed the sales and marketing managers sat in a row along the centre line of the arranged desk flanked by the conspicuous presence of hr tank and another woman who it seemed was there to take notes cantering the congregation was a man whose obverse mannerism exuded the confidence and exterior meant he was someone of importance angie roland and i took up position in front of this jury of vips our plastic chairs clanged and noisily bent into form to exemplify their cheapness an extreme contrast to the leatherbound pews claimed by the panel the central character who it soon became apparent was the division manager opened with a speech akin to that of some great dictator his appraisal of the utter failure intensified as his voice raised in volume yet remained controlled and collected it was like he needed to say everything he needed to say like some preinterrogation tactic the panel would interview us one at a time i remained sat outside the office with roland as angie pleaded her case as its manager memories of sitting outside the school principals office at school seemed came flooding back though i had never really been a bad kid i found myself winding up outside the heads office a few times a catholic warden clad in black whose manifestation was intended solely to scare straight roland sat with a smirk apparently unconcerned with these ongoing his motionless gaze made me think that this guy had far more experience explaining himself to school principals than me roland was up next angie sat in the seat roland vacated her arrogant indifference mirrored rolands posture with eerie exactness i began to grow worried angie was always one step ahead of any game currently in progress thoughts of explaining my job loss to my other half thoughts of having to jobhunt made me nervous after an hour of waiting patiently my time was finally up i sat central to the panel trying to remember every interview technique that had ever been drilled into me by any chance id previously had to take such advice on board i made sure to look at the person who was addressing me back straight shoulders back here we go the panel had their tactics down it seemed no one person would ask more than one question at a time the questions came slow strategically calm and collected the lady on the end of the panel appeared to note everything i said as the panel would wait for her silent ok to continue at this moment i was ready to hang angie and her bastard youth out to dry i just waited for my chance after the initial questions largely surrounding who planned what the director placed his pen in front of him he placed his elbows on the table as he leaned his hardened chin on his first and second fingers mirrored and extended to provide support as he leaned in he said tell us in your own words you account of what happened i relayed my entire saga from angies commandeering of the project plan rolands inauguration to being responsible for the images our flawed and hapless manner of couriering laptops instead delivering at the conference all of it i finished almost spitting out my words exercising this demon called angie one of the sales managers enquired why didnt you check anything before you built them i defended there was no time to do that they had been built and qad by roland who apparently knew what he was doing we had machines to build and no means to verify anything i couldnt tell if i had impressed with my answer or not the thick silence felt like a poorly performing job interview why did you believe roland fully equipped to manage this implementation the weightiness of their questioning became stronger i didnt responding inadvertently with a tone similar to angies impertinent and selfaggrandizing sneer i followed the direction of my management i was told to leave him alone i did the md passed me a copy of my rollout plan was this the rollout plan you followed i picked it up glancing through the already familiar pages i had spent several days perfecting reenumerating before my final presentation i looked up and said no angie altered the specification several times the final version was signed off i believe by everyone here i felt like i had delivered a blow to everyone in the room who could even slightly have been rooting for me as if id had twisted the knife in the very same way angie had done to claw her way to the top after minutes of grilling i left the room angie and roland had long vacated leaving the empty seats their emptiness like some satirical congratulatory prize hr tank had concluded the meeting thanking me for my time ordering me back to my duties its was silent for the remainer of the day juxtaposed against the now brilliant developing sun obviously out of place in britains spring but seemed to invite action and good times contrasting against our officeprisoner mood angie and roland were stealthy silent against the humanistic blur and shuffle of the its inhabitants as they adjusted their postures to comfort the only reprieve came from angies regular group ushering her to their second of their starbucks trips this time joined by roland the escape of my pm leaving time couldnt have come quickly enough i made for home wondering if i would ever set foot in its again the crystal clear night sky gave birth to another sunny day the grime and dirt that incrusted my car seemed to beg for a good washing and detailing session it was relieving to have at least one thing on my list to occupy my time on the end of a dole queue as i approached the car park gates of the pharmaceutical giant i wondered if security would deny access to their fortress i envisaged ramming the gate in some movielike attempt to exact my revenge to dance on angies decrepit corpse months of this woman was too much for anyone to deal with as i uneventfully descended the giant lobby stairs towards its i expected to be bundled to the floor at any moment by all manner of burly security guards to the approving look of angie i was convinced this woman was far too streetsmart to be outdone by anything almost disappointedly its remained unmolested in its usual groundfloor spot my windows login worked as i began to prepare for the days work i arrived back from lunch with several members of third line and our previously borrowed helpdesk guy still licking his wounds from the onslaught of sales reps qbg met us on our way down she smiled wryly excitedly yet softly declaring angies packing her desk shes history i didnt believe her i had to see this with my own eyes i sat down maintaining as detached an outlook as i could pretending not to notice as angie wrapped her scaly neck in the familiar black and grey shawl rolands desk surprisingly also lay vacated angie disregarded the looks from its as she picked up her leather clutch bag and made for the exit is she gone was she fired a fervour of questions engulfed our modest team as we excitedly theorized and conjectured we eventually realized that there were only questions no answers this tumultuous turn of events did nothing to allay my own fears i tied myself to my desk waiting for someone anyone to order me into a closed doors meeting but nobody came that day nor the next previous pt a new world pt safety pt the it induction from pt pt how to make friends pt marking pt one friday to rue them pt best laid pt its one step for pt and one step back for pt bring home the pt who needs minor pt dawn of a new pt

so im an intern for a fairly large organization and part of my day to day job is to help users with general work orders normally i deal with file share requests providing access to certain applications or general it related questions its rare but occasionally i need to provide access to servers and this is where our tale begins me me hu helpless user me gttech support this is taco how can i help you today hu gti need server access me gtcould i get the name of the server and your account information hu gives information me gtfor the changes to go into effect on your account youll need to do a quick relog ill stay on the line with you while you do this hu grumbling due to inconvenience a few moments later hu gtokay im going to try and log into the server now me gtthats fine ill stay here incase you have any problems a few more grumbles and moments later hu gtmy account cant log in i thought you said you gave me access me gtsometimes when logging in you need to specify the domain under username try typing in domainyouruserid hu gtfine i dont get why this needs to be this complicated excessive grumbling and a few more minutes hu gti still cant get in me gtare you getting any error messages hu gt i didnt read it cant you just remote in and help me gtsure no problem within seconds of remoting in i see the problem username domainyouruserid password the man didnt actually enter his id number he literally typed youruserid needless to say he was embarrassed and i was left with an amusing tale
so this conversation happened the other day gt mom why when friend sends me a text message i dont get it on my phone me what do you mean mom i dont know any other way to say it she sent a message and i didnt get it me so she told you she sent a message but you never got the message she said she sent mom nope i never got it me do you think maybe she didnt send it mom i can get message from friend but not friend me do both of these people have iphones mom yeah me then you should have gotten any message that sent its unlikely that imessage was turned off mom it was i had to turn it back on why did it get turned off did you touch my phone me im only here once a week and i never touched your phone mom then how did it get turned off me you probably did it by accident mom no i wouldnt have turned that off me thats why i said accident mom no son i know what im doing me then why was your imessages turned off who played with your phone mom scoffing no one im the only one who touches my phone me so you probably accidently turned off imessages and this prevents messages from coming in sometimes because the other iphone that is sending the message doesnt know to send it sms instead mom i didnt turn off imessages son me then your fucking phone is haunted smdh 
not exactly techsupport but i know weve all been down this road with someone we know im sitting at home in my pjs waiting to get ready for work when the home phone rings its my grandma me hey gram how are you her honey the tv isnt working oh goodone of these calls me ok did you press the big red power button her yes but its not working me ok did you take the batteries out of the remote again her clicking noises no theyre still in there me ok what are the letters on the bottom of the remote there should be big white letters under all the buttons her jvc i instantly knew the problem me ok gram what are the letters printer under the screen of the tv her lg me ok so that remote doesnt go with your tv throw it away you havent had a jvc tv in over years her what if i need the remote later me grams throw it away you dont need it i promise edit my first gold thanks everyone my grandma is pushing yrs of age so these calls dont bother me in the slightest i mostly laugh at them
 as i looked down at the mile of unfilled tickets getting older by the second i decided i needed the week off from this place i gathered the four best working techs into my office to explain how we as a team where going to solve this problem solitaire colorblind hockey where all assembled in the office with various states of nervousness gtme okay who doesnt know whats going on no one answered it seemed the news of the tickets stacking up in a silent account was already spread before solitaire worked up the bravery to come see me gtme were going to get through all these tickets in record time gtcolorblind looked up at me he wasnt happy gtcb sorry i cant help i gotta go audit every computer in the companyand clean out ever filter colourblind waited for a response gtme oh yes those tickets will now be taken out of your account gtcb thank you but i still dont see why we should race to solitaires aid just fire him now and we can spend a week or two fixing this i looked over at my coffee it said you cant fire someone for helping out another employee which is what the ghost account started off as even if it did backfire in everyones face gtme oh good plan solitaire gave me a worried look gtme and i suppose youre going to take over teaching itsec everything he needs to know gtcb we could just fire him too right gtme while im at it since im firing two people already i should really fire everyone who potentially messed with the competition and the ticket server in any way perhaps the increased load from a script checking the queue every seconds contributed in some way to the problem gtcb oh a knock at the door drew my attention a secretary with her hair in a twist walked into the office gttwist the vp wants to see you in his office now gtme he could have called gttwist the it systems seem to be breaking the vp didnt want the phone lines to also potentially mess up the message we gotta retest everything now so till its all retested were walking the important messages gtme whaaaa its only the ticketing service never mind coffee screamed at me to stay on task i turned back to the techs assembled in my office gtme okay team listen do your best pump out those tickets good luck time to see the vp fun 
a month had passed since mafgs passing morale was at a low point and apart from angies bipolar temper things seemed to slog along as they were each day proving to be more and more difficult to get through the it cupboard slowly relinquished its isolation as angie seemed to track our movements with animallike instinct imposing ridiculous policy after policy the battery indicator on mafgs mouse had at some point faded to nothingness having spent its remaining energies fruitlessly lamenting its masters disappearance mafg sacrifice was guarded in its reasoning many theorized the lost machines from the meeting room had made it to his car some theorized hed wronged some director in a drunken moment of sincerity there was even a rumour he had put angie in her place in some magnificent fit of comeuppance bathed in the flabbergasted stares of twenty faceless onlookers the reality was far more boring and told to me over a weekend pint of fine ale mafgs wife had previously worked with the company in their research division she had left under explosive circumstances for a competing pharmaceutical company management felt that mafgs continued employment was incongruous and had compelled him to take a pilon agreement to end his tenure it seemed odd that mafgs wife had left the company over six months ago we felt that this discrepancy stank of angies involvement for a while though a specific date had shone brightly in my outlook calendar it had acted as a target representing a reprieve from the mundane trivialities support had to offer i had prepared for it arrival with jubilation it finally arrived and my audience with several heads of salesmarketing bhit and the software vendor was mine to shine in the purpose was to set into motion the plans for their largescale laptop rollout armed with my carefully crafted numberwork dutifully outlined on several handouts i set off for the meeting three floors up in the swankier part of the building in my mind i was alexander the great sword raised in hand off to conquer in what seemed to be an inevitable foregone conclusion ok i dont know much about history but all i knew was my sword was huge and i was about to go kick some ass my arrival at the meeting was met with the usual pleasantries and shaking of hands the meeting room was perfectly air conditioned with several pieces of foliage standing elegantly in large ceramic plant pots the large window welcomed the sun in vast quantities into the fragrant room underneath the heated rays of light was the ominous shape of angie sat at the far end of the room away from all human contact the sunlight seemed to darken and blur angies outline like some satanic aura but her bent bitter frame was just too familiar and imposing to ignore the meeting began with the usual round of roundtable identification angies snarled introduction was only suffixed by the words i am in charge of support her declaration made an instant impression on everyone as they hastily moved on the software vendor rep was a techy through and through he stood for his presentation draped in what was obviously a brand new suit purchased for the occasion it seemed to contrive him as he awkwardly passed around his company endorsed paraphernalia pens cards product sheets there were logos on everything as if he was clearly instructed to embark on this endeavour but try to hide his obvious geekiness my segment came i eagerly handed out my carefully crafted mission statement adorned with pie charts gantt charts and technical jargon made just basic enough to empower even the most itilliterate of sales managers i explained my intentions with a wellrehearsed speech which lasted several minutes new laptops and to remain in the field across three hardware types several primary targets were to be used for pilot testing each user would receive an extra mb on home drives and be responsible for their own backups each reps laptop would be first imaged for any later data retrieval and each rep would be refurnished by the end of the day angies eyes remained focused on me throughout the session i felt odd as she hadnt interjected once our vendors rep nodded in anticipation as rep after rep smiled in anticipation they liked what they heard new toys for everyone and all they had to do was give the all ok my moment of triumph at an end angie finally spoke up what sort of manpower do we need for this her voice was rather different she spoke as if i were part of her menopause club all harshness had dissipated into a normalized vocal tone i retorted putting aside my stunned silence that i expected to prepare the images myself and builds would be used to train up some more junior members of staff in the absence of mafg she nodded in approval as she made notes her lack of typical angiestyle anger perturbed me nevertheless the meeting ended in what appeared to be a climactic sense of collaboration as the balding head of it smiled proudly sharing all manner of managerspeak with his congregation as the vendor techie and i exchanged pleasantries angie left anonymous in her wake without saying another word i knew this move by now her silent departure was signatory of her underhandedness she was up to something it distracted me momentarily as i asked the vendor guy to repeat what he had just said what was this devious cow up to i was not left in suspense for long that afternoon its were summoned to a meeting room where angie wanted to discuss the rollout i knew angie was cooking something and i knew it was a clear move to usurp my finely laid plans my only consolation was that i had the backing of bhit and several higherups what could she possibly do our entrance into angies meeting was made strange by the unexpected presence of a spotty urchin who had previously been chained to helpdesk his sharp eyes and pointed thin facial features seemed disturbingly familiar his unbranded shirt and pale jeans seemed to be a desperate attempt to look normal angie began the meeting by introducing the urchin returning to her familiar intense vocal tone this is roland he is joining nd line today she hissed as her eyes danced around the room as if to highlight her claim the meeting continued with angies voice droning my exact words complete with inaccuracies one could only attribute to someone whose obvious depth had longsince been surpassed i think at some point the only thing keeping us awake was angies voice shrill and bent in character she had finally finished when i decided to speak i knew my interjection would further madden the beast mainly as it would actually be of technical relevance and accuracy which angie could never possibly dream of but i had to stake my role in this project well have the majority of the machines built prior to the event so most will only need booting up and profiles loading there will also be a ghost server file server and well have a connection back to the office all outoffield laptops will be backed up later back at the office any laptops that are staying out will have to be backed up and loaded at the event in one hit well also keep ten spare new laptops just in case anything happens the its crew hung on every word as if i were mandating a life or death situation angie fired corrections in as much as she could though mired in technical incompetence you will have to back up everything you get her accusatory vocal sneer hinted that we may do anything different we had a mission we had our tasks i had a rollout to deliver it was getting towards the end of the day roland had picked his spot next to me taking mafgs spot he was not talkative he barely acknowledged anybodys presence a few banterlike quips intended to embroil him into our team didnt get so much as a raised eyebrow his body language was eerie in its familiarity brandishing my purchase order signed by bhit and bearing sales amp marketings stamp approving the project with every endorsement that one could ever hope to see on such a document i headed to the elevators to scale the heights to the procurement department i was joined in the elevator by qbg who seemed eager to have a word it seemed qbg had some sort of big secret she would have burst if she hadnt let out roland you know who he is dont you qbg spoke softly as if the lift were rigged with some manner of bugging equipment thats angies son her words were difficult to believe but rolands mannerisms posture familiar sharpness it all rang out clear as a bell the thought of this woman propagating seemed unnatural it conjured images of some monstrous carnal act between a musty stickinsect and some hapless male donor entangled in her web held prisoner for his seed but it all seemed too obvious now like a slow headon car accident everything started to make sense there had to be someone who had shown angie how to access touchpaper she was clearly still struggling with it a month on someone had to show angie how to use the printers someone had to have fed back to angie anything and everything wed complained about her someone had to have kept angie informed of our whereabouts how else could she track us with such animallike accuracy there he was in the background the whole time as enigmatic and as slimey as the bitch that spawned him that same spotty st liner who angie demanded i cleared down the it cupboard with so long ago the insignificant shadow which seemed to appear every so often as if every photographic memory which flashed into view had his image superimposed somewhere on it standing by a printer walking through the its area sitting nearby in the canteen her spy invisible to the naked eye as incredible as it seemed there it was our rat exposed far too late to be in any way wary he was now closer than we could have ever imagined we had allowed him to creep up on us like a ninja angies inside man previous pt a new world pt safety pt the it induction from pt pt how to make friends pt marking pt one friday to rue them pt best laid pt its one step for pt and one step back for pt bring home the pt who needs minor pt dawn of a new pt rules of pt bring out your 
so back when i was a teenager i worked in technology retail one day minutes before closing time a middle aged man came in saying that he was having volume problems i ask him what problem he has and says let me show you he pulls out his laptop and starts it of course it takes minutes to boot up so as it is doing that i ask him what problem he is having he tells me that the volume on youtube isnt working i ask him if he is able to hear audio from other things on his computer music other websites etc he says everything else is working so i tell him that if all sources of audio are working except for youtube then the first thing i would assume is that youtube is simply muted the man is insulted as if i am calling him a monkey i was merely thinking aloud but that was all i could immediately think of the manager walked by and the man started saying that i was being arrogant and insulting to him he says that this is why he never comes heredespite being here now so his computer is on i pick a youtube video of chers believe as that is my go to sample video no volume i tell him yeah the volume is off he then points at how the x to represent mute is not there i tell him yeah it isnt muted you just have the volume all the way down he appears visibly embarrassed which was fine i just wanted to go home he then proceeds to pack up quickly and leave without saying thank you 
man what a vacation america is weird but i like it thanks brooklyn youre my favourite thooklyn thanks utiminthetrees for the drinks and hangs back at the infamous datacentre from hell i formed good relationships with a few of the founding customers theyd ask for favours every now and then and id help out where i could sometimes this ended well for me contract work on the side other times it didnt helping out people who were either too smart for their own good or too dumb for life this is i dont know somewhere in the middle one of these customers had a couple of odd requests over the course of maybe a month buy a roll of rg cable and cores of it from his rack out to the plant room take delivery of a box of weirdlooking pci cards ive never seen before and leave them in the rack wat sure whatever tony i guess some other stuff happened while i was away or he got someone else in to do some things because a few months later he had an incredibly bizarre request i didnt know it yet but all these requests were linked gttony i need you to go across the street to the and buy me all the vodafone sim cards they have now i gotta say at this point i was confused goddamn confused this got no better when the next set of instructions came through a bit later gttony pull out every pci card in the servers and take the old sim cards out then put the new ones in afterwards he explained what was going on see when vodafone was hitting the market hard for prepaid phones in australia they did something pretty stupid there was a recharge that would give you of credit the only catch was that it had a day expiry who would do such a thing what person needs a month of phone credit but cant get on a plan someone who was terminating skypes voip calls in australia onto the mobile pstn network yeah i know by taking advantage of the ridiculous call value he was able to generate cell calls at a fraction of the cost of a pri in fact what hed done while i was away was to install massive antennas on the end of the cable and hang them out the window of the building hed generated so many calls that he crashed the local cell tower then crashed it again rinse repeat until vodafone upped the bandwidth to the site and finally could begin investigating how one small area could be saturating the mobile phone network so much it was breaking it it was then that they started realising this huge volume of calls was coming from very specific sims so they did what any carrier would do cut them off upon doing this his response was to just buy more sim cards so they were replaced and thus began an endless game of cat amp mouse as he varied the call timing allowed out on the channels to randomise them to look humanish as voda kept blocking his sims this continued until it became unworkable by which stage hed made so much money from it he had the capital to float more pops and move the calls around to different towers and became effectively untraceable well played tony well played stay tuned to rchhopsky for more hacks and fun that arent appropriate for tfts
its had a full compliment of staff the following morning there was work to do but nothing seemed important enough to leave desks for we were all were gathered for one purpose one of our soldiers was in trouble though we were powerless to do anything other than offer moral support we felt glued to our desks angie was palpably absent her familiar black and grey shawl being the only spectral reminder of her presence somewhere in the building mafg was quiet assurances of help to find other work and amending cvs came and went like splashes of water soon angie and hr tank arrived at mafgs deskside the scene brief as it was seemed as if they had taken him into custody short of only handcuffs they led him to angies special place of solitude situated somewhere far beyond the familiar dimly corridor just barely visible from its a bulb had gone in that corridor some time ago it just seemed that nobody had ever replaced it i had seen angie lead a few people down this corridor when they had hit the height of her displeasure today though they moved artificially slowly mafgs limbs moved uncomfortably as if to not let on their progress was impeded by hr tanks inability to keep up with normal walking pace a walk that angie had seemed to perfect as the figures shuffled around the corner at the end of the corridor the dim lighting served as a poignant landscape of some mysterious doom the shadow of angies tall thin figure casting on the yellowing walls like some fairytale ghost a few minutes of disbelief followed in its the team stared at various spots on the floor of our square work area trying to explain things in our own minds not even a breath was audible this two minutes silence was terminated only as mafgs monitor emblematically entered their sleep modes and faded to black as quickly as the images faded so did any sense of hope or morale we barely clung onto and so did our moment of stillness we promptly turned to our own desks to work angie and mafg returned two quick hours later accompanied by two security guards they stood sentinel to angies familiar sharp tongued leadership of the situation hr tank was nowhere around i could only presume that her weight disallowed her making the return journey mafg added personal items from his desk to a small cardboard box his lips dry from lack of saliva his throat obviously lumpy angies stern face stood expressionless the silence in its was broken only with angies snipes where is your usb disk you cant take that she barked mafg coiled the usb cable around his impeccably well taken care of freecom drive she snatched it as he offered it to her her eyes still now showing even a grain of benevolence we need your phone too her growl seemed to antagonize mafg but he couldnt react his slow purposeful movements were fighting every urge to succumb to the lump in his throat mafg duly handed her his trusty blackberry refusing to make eye contact it instantly brought back memories to me of when we had first been issued these phones mafg and i had spent a good week exploring their potential loading on useful utilities and configuring them for maximum it support effectiveness they had been the formation of a good workbased friendship it just seemed this memory was torn now trampled on by this monster angie took mafgs blackberry and extended her arm in my direction clad in a heavy black cardigan sleeve as if to contrast so heavily with her pale skin her emaciated hand ushered it in my direction as i took it from her it felt like i was taking a gift from some devil she said with a bitter tongue there now you have one i sat stunned as mafg looked at both me and angie the ordeal was nearly over but not quite mafg picked up his cardboard box of meager possessions old pay slips and desk candies he motioned his completion but angie again extended her hand to block his passage springing into life one of the security guards broke from his uncomfortably officiallooking stance and took the box from mafg he placed it back on his desk the guard started digging around in the box almost neanderthal in his movements his grey security shirt stretched over his fattened arms as he bent over for his task he removed several company branded pens and an unopened pack of mafgs business cards on their discovery each piece of contraband were cast onto the desk surface their respective rattles and thumps a soundtrack to whatever wrongdoing mafg had done to earn this punishment after nodding towards angie and refolding his arms the security guard took his rightful place next to his colleague both mustering as much energy as they could to maintain their stern postures beads of sweat ran down the guards face he was not used to standing this much the funeral march shuffled away towards the main staircase the procession led by angie mafg carrying his own cardboard coffin and the duo of security guard pallbearers seemed to have the attention of the entire floor the only evidence of mafgs existence was now reduced to four pens a pack of business cards and the wireless mouse whose flashing red battery symbol echoed the loss of its user the only noise was from finance

this is not a tale where i perform many heroics im mostly watching a friend tired of having to troubleshoot under the direst of circumstances at my telco were now an item and i essentially promised a tale about it was many years ago i had been promoted to senior staff she hadnt yet we had terrible equipment back then long resolved issue but back then it really bugged me after spending a couple years dealing with that after my promotion i had a nice brand computer and three screens all was well but underneath my halffloor a couple hundred frontline techs were still using clones and a single screen for many of them it was a old crt often kinda yellowish from back when you could smoke indoors when taking calls our hardware was simply atrocious i wanted to change that and leveraging my new position i was able to sit in a lower management meeting to pitch my point gt bytewave the terrible and disparate state of the current equipment means that most frontline on this floor has to reboot their computers midshift everyday if we average usually theres a customer on hold sometimes they have an escalation dept on line when their garbage fails either way were bleeding money everytime beyond chain delays nothing is uniform i could take any two stations on the lower floor and its basically lottery when it comes to hardware based on the tickets to systems i came up with this graph of stats that demonstrate we really ought to use the emergency funds to fix this we need a uniform and stable solution and itll save us tons in gt lower management theres just no budgets but we know its bad maybe in a few quarters we can look at it but keep in mind tech support is an expense not a revenue itll probably stay this way as long as its still working someone was in the room as i was told it couldnt happen shes now a colleague were closer than ever called amelia in my tales back then she was rather new as a very pretty young new thing on a technical support floor most of the guys were most interested in her looks rather than her mind she proved them all wrong the rest of this tale isnt about me the next day she told me in the break room that i made a strong argument and thanked me for trying her own clone and yellow crt monitor were probably some of the worst on the floor back then but she didnt say yet she planned to do something about it soon after as im walking past her desk i see her installing unusual software i cant recall the name but the thing harnessed your gpu to run some heavy calculations regarding human dna back then anyone could install whatever they wanted on their workstation it controls were minimal she happened to have a decent video card in her otherwise terrible clone even though those ran very hot i didnt immediately pick up on what she was doing obviously pushing a gpu to its limits means quite a bit of heat later that day looking down to the main floor i saw her flanked by two suits and a union rep walking into a managers office that union rep being one of my best friends i rapidly got a wordtoword copy of the conversation the union is pretty religious about writing down everything gt amelia oh its no big deal but they told us in basic training to report any injuries no matter how light something about insurance liabilities i just burned my hand on the computer there was something wrong with my mouse i tried to fix it but yeah im a klutz all i got to show for it is this burn gt lowermanagement err it doesnt look all that bad are you sure that its actually worth filing gt hr what the hell we dont secondguess injury claims we need them all reported we already have a problem where too many employees fail to report minor injuries insurance liabilities at stake gt union rep right very important to be thorough about this indeed always report any injuries no matter how minor lets file the paperwork gt amelia well if you want to put your hand near where i got the burn youll see how hot it is knowing her probably some doe eyes involved somewhere always effective theyre just too damn blue soon after they decide to look at the offending computer the hr rep puts his hand on her terrible clone which happens to have a gfx card pumping everything it could thanks to the dna software running which ensured her gpu stayed north of c most of our clones simply used onboard video but some had real video cards it happens when youre using random hardware everywhere gt hr with a warm hand fuck ouch what the hell call in the bilateral health amp safety board now they didnt say anything else in front of that union rep or union employees but her trick was good within three weeks everything was pulled out and replaced by nicelooking asus boxes and dell screens the last of our crts were thrown out hell i saw someone loading some of the trash into a truck from our garbage bin i hope he had better luck with them than we did that stuff was seriously outdated since then no such issues the telco sucks right and left but we no longer appear to consider that its worth it to cut corners when it comes to the hardware tech support needs nowadays senior staff can often work from home using toptier equipment they install at the telcos expense if we ask for it all of bytewaves tales on

obviously fake name anyways a while ago i was working a contract for a rather significant pharmaceutical company it was your standard runofthemill st line maybe nd line type role with a clear difference our manager was great attentive offered good career advice when you needed it always had your back when the proverbial hit the fan guided us through some difficult times with lunch on the company card or the odd tin of quality street the guy was excellent one of the few times i could handonheart say it however good things dont last and as higher ups decided that support was way too happy decided to dispose of our erstwhile leader much to the cue of oh captain my captain upon his departure enter angie there are few words to describe angie wed heard tell of her actions and personality through her previous subjects during our morning coffees around the campfire apparently she would snipe and shout at you for merely existing and applied the logic of a year old suffering major attention deficit disorder at a lecture on string theory angie had been in charge of drug safety for about a decade to put it into perspective if you took this companys product and turned into a blue octapus that shot fire the authorities would contact her department for advice now from what i could tell these guys seemed to be very well versed in everything from chemistry biology and some were even former doctors none of this sheer brilliance washed with angie she merely treated them like tools that she had no idea how to use and would bang with a hammer when they worked her way even if her way was clearly stupid still judge no book by their cover and all that angie arrived in support a day early mere moments after our former hero had walked the long mile she immediately proceeded to command facilities to join her at her desk where she chewed out a year old girl mercifully due to there being dust on her desk and grit in her drawers this relentless torture went on for a good minutes while angie inspected every inch of the girls effort to appease her whims even recleaning several spots more than once afterwards she walked away red faced eyes to the ground and with a lump in her throat after just about getting the words to indicate she will have her drawer pack replaced with a brand new unit we all knew it was to be a new world order with angies arrival we would have thought her showing up a day early was to meet and greet the troops it was very apparent to me that she was just a vicious troll marking her territory showing everyone who was boss suffice it to say we finished up the day typing up cvs and comparing layouts
i recently left school and started in a big it company as an apprentice so im still learning a lot every new it apprentice starts in the first level support to get a general overview of all the support cases that come in from our employees we have a ticket system and also a hotline so one day a lady calls since we see the name on the phone display my colleagues immediatly ignored the call so it goes over to me i didnt think much about it and picked it up me name itservicedesk how can i help you lady i opened up the excel file my colleague sent me via email but it doesnt seem to open up properly can you build up a remote connection and take a look at it me sure give me a second after i had remote access on her computer i tried to open up the excel window since the program was clearly running nothing happened but the program seemed to be responding so i opened up taskmanager to see the process status everything looked fine then one thing my colleague said to me on the first day came to mind always think that the customer you have on the phone never touched a computer before since every employee at our company has a second monitor i asked her me can you check if the window opened up on your second monitor lady wait let me turn it on first yes it opened up but the window looks odd can you see it me no i can only see your main monitor so you need to move the window to the other monitor lady so can you see it now normally it looks different kinda confused i look at the window and it looked completely fine me whats wrong with the window you need to be a little more specific lady the size the window should be way bigger me ah thats what you meant you can maximize the window size with the button you can see up here in the right corner the lady hung up and left me behind confused how my company can hire people without the most basic computer skills its tough to be the it guy 
i got a trouble call from one of our nonlinear video edit rooms this was back when we still used tape to tape linear editing so this room was special so special that they had sent the expert from ny to install it without telling us or even saying hello anyway the room had a funny smell and the editor pointed to a little ups on the floor which was smoking and the sides were bulging i told her to stop editing save her work and shut her workstation off we needed to get the ups out of there immediately she said that she was on deadline and the ny expert had told her to always use a ups to protect her work she wanted a guarantee that nothing would go wrong if we removed her ups i told her that she will never get such a guarantee from me about anything but that i could almost guarantee that her project will be lost if she continued to use the smoking ups she reluctantly shut down her system the ironic thing is that we have an enterpriselevel buildingwide ups for technical power which is far more reliable than the crappy desktop apc unit she loved so much

nd story this one boils my blood please note this story does not take place in the usa i used to work as printer support for a small business these printers were actually xray printers which would produce digital quality images from xrays machines and such using our provided equipment pretty fancy nightmare to install and troubleshoot also bear in mind that since this is a very specialized kind of equipment it wasnt like you could google the answer since most of the problems would be user related or hardware errors its also worth mentioning that the closest piece of equipment we had was about hours away with no way to remote into these machineprinters when i joined i didnt have any kind of experience dealing with this kind of equipment i was told anything i needed to know would be provided to me and i would be trained accordingly nopeavi first day at work the training i received was in the form of a pdf manual with kk pages and the product orientation was going to the website of the product and reading anything that was there everything else was figure it out enough ranting and background on with the story me yours truly ot other tech quite knowledgeable and cool dude manager regional manager of the company gt manager i just got a call from client who is at least hours away driving through mountains and dangerous roads and they are not able to print gt ot ok ill give them a call and gt manager no they are upset and are threatening to return the equipment if we dont help them now gt me rushing thats at least a hour drive while a phone call can resolve the issue in minutes or less gt manager i dont care i want someone there now sigh earlier that day ots car had broken down and it was at the shop with no reasonable eta so it fell on me and my whole weeks of training to solve the woes of this machine after driving through treacherous and dangerous paths to get there during which one of many trips i witnessed an accident right before my eyes where people died but thats a story for another day i get off my car head in the hospital into the xray imaging room to see the hospitals manager fiddling with the machine and printing as usual at this point i wanted to murder anybody inside that tiny cold humid and godforsaken office but being the nice it i am the only thing that popped out gt me oh its printing thats good what did you guys do gt hospitalmanager i just powercycled it and it worked gt me thats great let me take a look at the logs and ill be on my way i took the damn thing off took it to a pitchblack room so the special printing film wouldnt go to waste and quietly weeped at the incompetence of higher ups for not letting me make a single phone call needless to say i quit months afterwards and the company dissolved months later after that tldr i drove hours to sit in a pitchblack room to cry with a special printer edit formatting edit wow thanks a lot for the support guys also quote of the day big thank you

angie arrives in tech support and starts work a few tech support underlings had moved her machine down the previous evening but from what i had heard she had had another chewing out session as she preferred her monitor on the left hand side as opposed to the right ok a simple mistake to make and one which is easily rectifiable not without a lot of noise and assurance of stupidity i did wonder why i found our resident work experience kid close to tears in the mensroom i sat down and began my day at my first interaction with this hellhound was imminent i was busy tapping out a response email to a remote worker about an excel problem and she beckoned me over well i say beckoned she clicked her fingers and with an impertinent commanding tone she scowled you come here thinking i couldnt possibly have had enough time to annoy the woman yet i assumed this was just another vulgar display of power sorry been listening to pantera this morning however she then demanded i showed her how to access her email now im used to running it inductions and showing new users the jig but someone whos been here for years hmmm so i managed to show her where outlook was amidst the utter blur of icons on her desktop adorned with a background of her several pitbull terriers figures as outlook ungraciously churned into gear she immediately snapped why does it take so long ok in fairness this was taking ages her disapproving sighs as i attempted to determine the cause was all the signal i needed to know that i really hadnt impressed the boss from hell task manager showed outlook knocking on cpu and the hard disk was going nuts until i noticed that network packets had also rammed up musting up the voice to break through the blackened icy air i politely enquired when is the last time you opened outlook this was met with a sharp stare and dont be stupid why would i ask you how to use it if i had been using it already after waiting several minutes the cause eventually became clear angie was presented with approximately years worth of completely unread communiques an unsettling amount of them marked urgent or with subjects implicating fatal consequences had occured totally without her knowledge as i said angie had headed drug safety for a decade in that time she had never seen a single email nor did it seem had she ever any cause to question why and now she was in our realm infecting our happy little team with a blackness mired with incompetence and only a tongue sharpened with the stones of hell to act as her only contribution
im the guy responsible for handling all the support calls in the morning this morning i check the queue and see a ticket from a user saying the phone software has disappeared from his computer at my work we use a remote support program where we can direct the user to our help site have them click our name and download a file and it will let us remote in and fix their issues i called the user and told him i would be happy to help i said please open a web browser for me he replies bruh im gonna be completely honest with you i dont mess with computers like that so i ended up having to send one of my techs out there probably just to replace the desktop shortcut for the missing program this happened about minutes into my day and im already fucking done update i called yesterday to try and talk to the night shift worker but was told he would be working the day shift this morning im going to call over there in a few minutes to make sure we fixed his issue and see if he will let me remote in to check the logs if he cantwont do that ill just get the service tag from the machine and use it to look up the macip address and have one of the it engineering guys remote in they dont need the user to let them in and check for me
so in response to the last closing account someone in the comments said i hope you are the only isp in the so i thought i would share this lovely story with you all well as it happens i am ceo of broadband we are the only broadband provider in a large part of our rural coverage area had a woman rent a house on a month contract in a semirural lifestyle area mins outside of the local suburbia she moved in everything was fine then one day a storm went through the area it took out the power lines and access to a hill where the transmitter tower was located which served her she rang up the help desk and said her husband was missing out on work because they couldnt get the incoming phone calls the tone of voice and attitude was unacceptable the support rep apologised and said once the weather improves one of our techs who was already on site will be able to get up on a quad bike with a generator and charge up the backup batteries the power lines company managed to get the power back on at the bottom of the hill before he got up on the quad bike a week later same thing happened and this time when she called she was much more abusive i took over the call this time and politely informed her that due to the flooding her husband wouldnt be able to get to work if he was called because the only bridge into the area was closed for safety reasons this was preventing us from getting on site with our generator she hurled more abuse at me so i said that if she speaks to me or any of my staff like that again i am cutting her off it happened a third time she accidentally unplugged her voip ata with the vaccuum cleaner the notes on her account said if she is abusive to instantly hang up on her and cancel the account so thats what the support rep did she called me that afternoon literally crying like a year old trying to explain a booboo because she was stuck in a contract on the house rental for another months and couldnt move back into the city due to the cost of early termination of the house contract i told her she had two warnings and we dont have to put up with people like you who cant appreciate how hard it is to do what we do never heard from her again edit many of you are concerned about my lack of empathy or the fact i did not reinstate her connection when she called crying at the end she didnt even try to say sorry she was just trying to justify herself which i did not accept it actually reminded me of a scene from southpark where cartman wants to be wined and dined 
this just happened an hour ago and i couldnt resist sharing it with you all gtuser hi yeah im having trouble signing into my email do you know my password gtme hi who am i speaking with gtuser oh im talldenseampampdumb from generic reality ampamp co gtme his talldenseampampdumb sorry we dont keep your passwords listed i can try to help out though worst case we can just reset the password gttdampampd okay this is what it says reads out standard usernamepassword field letter by letter asterisks and all gttdampampd starstarstar gtme alright no problem just enter in the password you use to log in gttdampampd well if i knew that i wouldnt have a problem gtme sorry i mean the password you use to unlock the computer gttdampampd yeah i know what you meant gtme do you never lock your computer or log out at all gttdampampd no facepalm gtme thats really insecure id definitely recommend at least locking your computer when you leave the office if not logging out completely gttdampampd what do you mean you guys are supposed to handle the computer security gtme well yeah but thats like having deadbolts and a combo lock on your front door but always leaving it wide open gttdampampd oh i got it now forgot to capitalize thanks gtme wai click gtfuck headdesk tldr maybe you should turn off the neon sign above your computer reading steal my data its free checked his pcs uptime the guy wasnt lying edit i work at an msp and this is one of our clients i have no say on their group policy settings i could set them myself but that could also get me into trouble as thats not something i have the power to decide 
but after verifying via the rmm that was not the case which the ticket was submitted through mind you jumping remotely onto random unoccupied systems from the site and browsing i called the user who filed the ticket it went like this me hi there this is guidoz and i received a trouble ticket that i need some more info on it was stated that the internet was down but all our tests indicate it is working correctly can you be more specific user my web browser wont display pages ive tried rebooting and refreshing i pop on users system via remote me the fact that i can get to you this way is a good sign lets take a peek i instinctively open up google and it comes up instantly i do a quick search and hit a random but safe link me it appears to be up to me is there a specific website youre having trouble with user yeah umm facebook user types in facebook and it fails to load me that is likely an issue with facebook it even says it has an issue on the screen facebook displayed a something went wrong message user no facebook cant be down there must be something wrong with our systems me ampamp i do a twitter search for facebookdown tag and show her a few hundred tweets in the last minutes it appears to me facebook give it a bit it should come back up user do you mean i found a problem you cant fix ha i stumped you me mmhmm buhbye more xpost from rsysadmin edit i love you all
 rolls around angie is already sat in the stale meeting room waiting for me obviously given the events of the day before i knew i had essentially caused this impromptu ticket review to me there remained two choices i could head in there a subservient professional plead for my sins and be managed yep be managed by angie as she had already minced three of my colleagues into vegetative states i realised this tactic was doomed however my heavy metal spirit prevailed i took a cue from dee snider and instead presented myself as just me the guy who will still smile and offer professionalism with a light hearted stance even in the face of a total bully i walked into the meeting room brandishing a pint glass of red fruitjuice which i happily placed on the desk i honestly dont think angie was expecting this one i jovially sat down and acted like i was eager to go through any concerns she had with my tickets she came straight out with it i want to know why you close the lowest amount of tickets out of everyone in the group this isnt good enough you are consistently the lowest score in every single stat i have my case revolved around the fact that we were never ruled by stats ever we maintained a low openticket count and concentrated on mentoring junior staff and leading by example i was hired as a senior simply as a representation of my experience and it was not uncommon for me to accompany junior staff on their calls as you can guess as well as a frosty stare this was met with a singleworded writeoff rubbish she sniped she tyraded for another minutes scribbling all over her prints in red pen like a crap maths teacher and proceeded to throw me ticket after ticket and reasons why she wasnt happy thats ok i dont stop there after she finishes her rant i decide i can play your game i turn her stack of redenned paperwork over and begin to go through them in depth one by one to answer her concerns this ticket here i started you were unhappy as it took too long to resolve i admit three weeks is a little out there however this pc is running some bespoke medical software and as it happens will only run on windows nt the department is not willing to shell out five figures on a new xpcompatible version so they asked us to source a replacement motherboard instead now heres how i knew we had a rat angie has no idea what nt is or even a motherboard however her tyrade this time seemed more bitter and twisted i was really stirring the hornets nest here i insisted on moving on after i can take your comments on board i started into the next ticket this ticket resolved around a new vendor requiring set up of several oracle databases angie stopped me mid sentence she reiterated bitterly my low call count if i didnt shape up she would have no option but to seek disciplinary steps ok so i didnt win but at least the playing field has been set i dont back down though i know i wont win but at least now i know what her prize is why i dont know she cant be after everyones job surely that makes no sense epilogue angie left for the day i was alone watching a new hp laptop complete a windows install ready to fine tune and install later to sysprep the balding head of it wandered over to ask what all the meetings were about today i adopted happymode and shared my thoughts in as diplomatic a manner i could i expressed how i was the lowest ticket closer and angie isnt happy about that initially balding head bhit tried to plecate me asking how i could do better blimey id forgotten higher ups were meant to help however he soon discovered my tickets for what they were all mine were the complex issues internal wifi dropouts preparing master configs for different models of routers the sales reps had troubleshooting legacy windows nt and msdos systems and then i landed everyone in it compared to some others it seems the bulk majority of calls assigned by people to themselves in the mornings were password resets i guess thats one way to boost your stats ooops did i just selfrat my team

the it cupboard had transformed into a veritable hive of activity boxes of laptops littered every available crevice in the it cupboard some boxes contained freshly built machines signified by their address labels destined for their new homes others lay brand new yet to be called to command our efforts were meticulously presided over by a flickery samsung monitor which recorded our every move in a single excel spreadsheet names addresses serial numbers asset tags all required recording despite the obvious pressure qbg and i were under roland seemed content with doing the bare minimum he took his position in the only seat left in the room our demands for action seemed to go unnoticed as he idly fiddled with his phone occasionally breaking his concentration to scroll up and down the excel sheet his arm outstretched to reach an old mouse and keyboard we had rescued from a junk box for our purpose roland indolently looked up his phone what one are you doing now qbgs response was evidently irate in tone as she read out the serial and asset numbers roland duly tapped in qbgs response barely even taking the effort to capitalize his text the keyboard old yellowed and not even built with the windows keys clacked loudly as he typed rolands attempt to permanently affix himself to his throne and rule the roost had grown weary after this exchange while unwrapping a fresh laptop i decided enough was enough roland i started if youre not going to help could you kindly go back to support im busy his snide response grated on me as if to exemplify his uselessness qbg dragged the keyboard away from towards her as she entered another row of data into the spreadsheet her body language exuded bitterness towards rolands unyielding lethargy in a stereotypical way that only the female of the species can perfect i knew how she felt though roland sat without a single reaction he seemed to silently shrug off this display of discontent as if it were of pure meaninglessness for the next hour we worked around roland uncomfortably as if he were a cold and jagged heavy rock inconveniently situated in the center of the room we had expected angies inevitable visit her arrival intensified the high feeling in the cramped environment as we shuffled around box after box of dell laptops she discussed our progress with roland loudly taking great purpose to exclude mine or qbgs input roland dutifully furnished angie with our present number we had imaged repacked and addressed just under laptops the fact is angie could not bear to leave any situation without imposing her sense of authority it just wasnt even in her vocabulary angie especially liked imposing her authority onto qbg more than almost any other engineer it was though qbg represented everything that angie was not to the letter true to form angie directed her attention towards qbg where she was loading a trolley of outbound boxes angies voice drowned out the whir of the imaging laptops and the groaning ghost server are these laptops supposed to be finished angies loaded interrogation was not intended to garner any real information qbg duly provided her response knowing that angie had simply just opened her line of questioning to find fault these postage labels are entirely too small you need to redo them all in a larger print this condescending request lashed qbg like a whip as she winced at the proposition qbg declined angies proposition instead offering well do the next ones bigger these are fine as they are angies insistence was delivered over a lambaste which seemed almost infinite as she constantly picked up more and more trivial matters of discontent not enough tape this box is slightly damaged there are too many boxes on that trolley angie satisfied with her instruction retreated back into the ether of the office roland remained motionless on his pedestal smugly smiling as he reclined back into the chair where he stayed for the next hour pm slothed into view roland donned his dark grey duffle coat each popper irked us more and more as their echos disturbed our frustrated silence he left for the day without saying a word leaving qbg and me to continue our work his departure was suffixed with our in depth symposium of the situation as we offered one another further anecdote of why roland and angie both should be buried in shallow graves we seemed to further agitate each other right you know what i started this isnt happening another day lets go see bhit our mercenary strut through the hallowed halls towards its seemed to gain in speed the closer we got it was tantamount to a race to reach bhit as he sat blissfully unaware of the onslaught we were about to deliver his balding reflected the ceiling light with a dull shine qbg and i tagteamed our way through our complaint as bhit listened our frustrated accounts grew louder as we described in depth what the first day of builds had brought we spilled the beans on roland angies micromanagement and how the duo were jeopardizing our attempted rescue with their banality bhit pondered our predicament as he noisily scratched the side of his unshaven head he finally leaned forward and said ok leave it with me get back to work previous pt a new world pt safety pt the it induction from pt pt how to make friends pt marking pt one friday to rue them pt best laid pt its one step for pt and one step

names redacted to protect the innocent and guilty it all started with a phone call the whole network at customer redacted is down and they have no power they need your help my blood ran cold the engineer calling me sounded panicked and for good reason customer redacted has an enormous natural gas facility in south texas too far from civilization to get enough power off of the grid we designed and built an onsite natural gas power plant for them a big one capable of supplying mw of power at peak load they could run the facility for a short while without the power plant but not long and shutting down the facility meant losing figures per hour by the time i was informed they had hours until they had to shut down as the guy who had designed and installed said network i was naturally the guy to call when it had problems which had never happened before it was a pretty simple network honestly just switches cat cables and fiber since this was the network all the plcs relays meters and whatnot ran on it was airgapped amp isolated no routers not much to go wrong i quickly get on the phone and walk the guy on their end through plugging in a laptop and running some simple tests check lights on things ping this ping that everything seems good though the network is emphatically not down so i send him a remote app and take control of his laptop to see for myself log into switches check things nope the networks not down when i log into the hmi system though i see a big red error message network error cannot connect to database the database server is up though i log into the database server windows server running mssql and thats where i find the problem sql isnt running i try to start it and it immediately shuts back off now this is very bad for a couple of reasons this server provides databases for a couple of very critical things in this plant included are the plc systems which explains why the plant shut down the plcs werent running and the monitoring system had shut down the turbines additionally this was not a problem with the network this was a problem with a server and we had subbed out the systems work to plc contractor so i had no idea how all this was supposed to function and no documentation on it im flying blind here a couple of phone calls later i find out that plc contractor had subbed out procurement and set up of the server to incompetent morons who was on vacation plc contractor doesnt want to touch it tells me to call incompetent morons woohoo hours to shutdown and this has now become my multimillion dollar problem back at the database server i start digging to find out why sql wont start it didnt take me very long to find the problem invalid license data reinstall is required turns out that incompetent morons had bought the appropriate licenses for sql but never bothered to retrieve or use the license key the plant had been running on a trial install of sql this entire time and went down because the trial period ended i wish i really wish i was making this up but i am not of course i cant do anything to jeopardize the integrity of the database including reinstalling and i dont have the license key the next hour or so consisted of lots of angry phone calls until someone at plc contractor finally dug up the documentation from the purchase and the hour after that consisted of roughly impersonate the ceo of an energy company incompetent morons put him down personally on all the microsoft paperwork to get into the msdn account incompetent morons had inexplicably set up in his name find out that ms does not just give you a license key anyway its embedded in the install disk which means that incompetent morons actually bought sql and then proceeded to set it up using a trial copy sweat bullets waiting for the install disk to download extract license key from install disk use procedure i discovered using the powers of google to update the license information without reinstalling reboot everything sweat more bullets after the database server was again serving databases the plc came back online and the techs were able to restart the turbines we avoided shutdown by about minutes i took the rest of the day off edit vlsc not msdn i had a brain fart there
so i work in tech support for insert big computer manufacturer brand name here more specifically for their big business customers which means that more often than not systems have either same day or next day onsite support when it comes to critical hardware failure this one lazy thursday i was minding my own business at work probably browsing tfts when one of my coworker currently on vacation messages me over fb more specifically he was still in the plane to his holiday destination cw my coworker he kinda looks like a skater or hipster important to the story cw lol this dude sitting next to me in the plane has the new insert brand new ultrabook model here but cant seem to get it past the bios splash screen quite unfortunate but not something weve never seen before most of the time its because of a bad bios or bad motherboard in the end the same part me at work to my cw ok ask him for his serial number and contact information and i can book service for him directly so that we can get his system up and running before the weekend in my mind im thinking if this isnt the best customer service in the world then i dont know anymore so my cw asks the frustrated user for his serial number and explains to him that he works for the company and that that way we might get it fixed shortly after the plane lands already the users reply to that big computer manufacturer would never hire a kid like you they have professional men working in their departments i dont believe you really work for them flabbergasted by his comment my cw didnt reply back and told me to drop it all while the user packed his faulty system back in his bag in great frustration we were the heroes he needed but not the one he deserved in the end

i work for a multinational manufacturing company and while most of our technology is uptodate and changed out frequently we have no need or desire to be bleeding edge as such we tend to hang back a bit after big updates and wait for our various groups to thoroughly test the new update or os before doing a large scale rollout when the new ios came out recently we decided it would be a good idea not to upgrade everything overnight because we dont know how a new ios will work with our other systems on the corporate iphones for example our mobile security program is specifically intended for ios because of this we sent out an email when ios became available saying gt tomorrow september th apple will release the latest version of ios the operating system for iphones and ipads our group requires some time to test and certify ios with our systems gt gt please do not upgrade any apple device until we have sent an updated communication and instructions emphasis was in the original email as well gt gt thank you later that day i got a call from someone who said his iphone wouldnt send or receive email he said i got that email from you guys that said to update to ios i did and now it doesnt work anymore i asked him to check the email again and read it closely oh i really wanted to say you did the thing you did the very thing we said not to do and you did it because we said not to do it but i did not because im nice unfortunately there wasnt anything i could do for him except send it to our ios guy as a test case for how to fix a problem like that
as a woman in tech support often times you find yourself in unpleasant positions there are some people who cant wrap their heads around the fact that in offices these days there are things that are no longer acceptable for the guy in his sixties who seems lost in the culture time forgot the idea of a woman shouting down the phone to a manufacturer about the centimetre fault in the custom made new server rack that we ordered is almost too tempting such an individual will respond loudly with and what would you know about good racks flaticus we had one of those here he was a senior administrator in the department that deals with procurement and we know him as mr touchy now mr touchy has no concept of personal space no idea about inappropriate jokes and he frequently likes to give what we dub the reverse bear hug we call it this because he comes up behind you and will wrap his arms around you pinning your hands to your sides hes been in hr more times than i think the hr people have its like his second home however hes the younger idiot brother of ceo and in his contract is a nice little handshake should he ever leave or be fired every single human being in this building seems to hate him a cleaner once told me that she would wipe neat solutions of various corrosive cleaning agents on the toilet seat in his office ensuite just because she knew that the stuff would give you a rash unlike anything else if it contacted unprotected skin thankfully hes not down here very often and the last time he was in my neck of the woods an improperly fitted toner cartridge had explosively leaked toner from my nose down and i was avoided to such an extent im surprised that they didnt give me a bell to ring as i wandered round on the fateful day in question we had a client onsite one of the junior network admins who was down to talk about an upgrade to their current setup they wanted to come in and have a look at some of the higher spec machines wed be supplying to them considering we were using them ourselves for once the sales people were on the ball and decided that it might be able to answer some of their more technical questions about upgrading absolutely no problem so ms cleverclient was down with us having coffee while we drew up the details we had on file for her and the main hiccups wed expect with changing out the machines with her setup it so happened that on this day mr touchy was down our way to argue with big boss about an order wed put in with procurement to purchase some extra licenses for the floor planning software the sales team used he wasnt aware we had a client on site and with looks of horror dawning on the faces of those who spotted him he grabbed ms cleverclient from behind in one of his hugs all us women look the same it would seem to which he received a headbutt which broke his nose and an elbow to the ribs which cracked one of his floaters she then asked calmly if we could call the police which we did immediately mr touchy unfortunately was released with a caution since our client chose to drop the charges in exchange for an discount on her purchases the details of which werent clear at the time mr touchy was released from the company within two weeks and the hundred thousand handshake well it turns out he never got it it was absorbed to cover the practically free equipment we gave to ms cleverclient some clause about damages to the company in his contract smoothing over something like assault is pretty costly it seems ms cleverclient was one of the instructors down at the local womens selfdefence group tldr go figure karma exists

the following morning i waited at my desk primed for a showdown with angie roland sneered and snorted loudly as he worked on some inscrutable task angie fresh starbucks cup in hand barely made eye contact as she approached the its area my opportunity to loudly demand satisfaction was at hand as she placed her cup on the desk i armed myself with a copy of her project plan i stood up to metaphorically remove my glove to slap angies face with it just as i began talking i was stopped in my tracks as angie barked into gear her scoff trampled my incursion with a strident whine why hasnt hr tanks machine been replaced she demanded i defended with theres nothing wrong with her machine at all its barely a year old and is one of the highest spec machines we have deployed anyway i angie dismissed my petition with a stony faced ultimatum i want that machine replaced before you go to lunch today reopen that ticket and get it done still brandishing angies project document she retrieved her cup and stormed towards the lair located somewhere beyond the dimly lit corridor which had seen many an engineer walk to their deaths i was left immobile the duel won before i had even drawn my weapon the emptiness of bhits desk offered no sanctuary in this moment i left the project plan on my desk skulking away towards the it cupboard to furnish hr tank with a new optiplex after enduring yet another hourlong session of unintelligent questions garbled half chewed up and spat back out by the hr tank i escaped her deskside with her old machine and yet another list of demands she felt inhibited her capacity to perform as she otherwise would at the top of the list she required a colour printer placed near her desk i guess having to walk half way across the floor to the communal printer may have burned vital calories necessary to plug the realestate offered by her inch wide trousers in reality i was aware through the rumour mill that an apprentice she had appointed in the guise of being mentored in all manner of hr and legal duties had left some weeks prior citing the need for an actual career hr tank had instead used her as a dogsbody to fetch printer output deliver files to various unsuspecting recipients and on the way back from such voyages procure various canteen supplies for her this mornings diversion of angies insistence became all too clear bhit had finally gotten word of what had happened last night most likely the tip off was my email sent to him just prior to my leaving which complained vehemently about angies actions it seemed he had grown an impromptu pair of balls and demanded angies explanation via email which of course angie was all too eager to give remember this power woman had a lifetimes experience of deviously plotting her rise to the top attached to angies response was yet a new project plan now detailing my newfound responsibilities as technical delivery engineer whats more the handover of machines would nolonger be carried out at the conference instead all machines would ship next week directly to their recipients this lunacy has been given the eager thumbs up by all middle management who welcomed the fact that angie would deliver the project apparently ahead of time opening the pdf i scaled down to the procurement section only to validate what i fully expected to see anyway against the parchmentcoloured background of the branded company document my atatime proposal had been replaced by a single line machines to be ordered from dell the statement rubber stamped by all and necessary seemed to vindicate angie completely the ball it seemed had bounced clandestinely into my back yard bhit rushed to my desk i knew what he was going to ask before hed even asked it even though roland angies eyes and ears sat in close proximity i let my true feelings known to bhit so youre telling me there is one week to image odd machines so in reality thats machines per day bhit nodded hoping i would concede and provide some magical way out of this new found emergency this is stupid whoever planned this needs their ass handed to them my claim had now garnered the attention of the rest of its no longer were their eyes transfixed on their screens scared to move they were intently watching the spectacle as it unfolded in front of them i turned to roland demanding are the images even ready rolands familiar ratty vocal snare simply retorted with a shrug the images are ready whenever you want them angie returned to its and immediately interjected my exchange with roland as if something deep inside her had fired up and manifested into some sort of primal trait of a mother defending its young she started you told me it would take a week for the laptops to be imaged her obviously incorrect statement seemed a purposeful twist of words on my initial claim no i said that each batch of would take a week to build and qa refuting my claims angies stern voice still sought to overshadow any offering of reality delving deep into her pdf i demanded why are we now couriering the laptops out why arent we delivering at the conference as planned what about the or so that are staying in the field that only need reimaging i felt confident for once i felt that bhit had my back albeit ever so slightly blunted by how easy he had historically caved in angies abrupt answer seemed to be the line she had used to sell her project amendment with i will not disrupt an entire conference just to give out laptops it is better to present the face of it by offering a support dropin service as people need it instead of disrupting an entire event there was no way we could now argue this round now angie had landed us in it she had played her cards now it was an allornothing game of seeing where the chips would fall bhit was powerless to do anything other than hope for a magicwand solution angie was golden in the eyes of the upper management who had rubber stamped her new proposals all the way there was only one card left to play i hadnt expected things to go off to this magnitude i was inexperienced in this sort of corporate espionage if i failed to deliver built laptops angie could easily pass the buck down my name made synonymous with total disaster if i delivered built laptops angie would get the glory and i would remain a nameless entity for me neutrality or bust for angie glory or neutrality i dunno how were going to do this i said rising from my chair leading the procession qbg followed closely behind me as roland wheeled the ghost server towards the it cupboard bhit watched us disappear hoping we would indeed find this desperately needed magic wand previous pt a new world pt safety pt the it induction from pt pt how to make friends pt marking pt one friday to rue them pt

their extremely competent team lead some months earlier and their team had quickly degraded to people who didnt really seem to care about their job they were also secure in the fact that the telcom system had degraded enough to be sufficiently obfuscated enough where it would take considerable resources to figure it out by a competent replacement this made them act like they were untouchable as such i had learned fast to start recording my phone calls to them thank you google voice so they couldnt pin anything on us anyway one day around pm the network dropped out as such i called the telcom oncall me leaving voicemail hi this is craysh from tier it looks like the network is having issues again internet communicator and email are all unresponsive all three webfarms are unavailable trace route to the gateway has failed ticket is unavailable as the ticketing system is inaccessable due to the issue please call back to confirm your taking ownership of the incident minutes go by and sop dictates that i call back before escalating to their manager the oncall answers tech oncall phone this is steve me hi steve have you gotten my voicemail were having issues with the network tech no i havent tell me whats wrong me repeats what i said above tech ok wait minutes and try again click i had assumed that by wait minutes he meant that he was taking a look at it and that it should be back up in minutes minutes go by and the network is still having issues the network has now been down for the last minutes or so i call the oncall phone again no answer me leaving voicemail hi this is craysh again the issue is still ongoing please call me back as soon as possible minutes go by so its time to call again no answer time to call the acting supervisor supervisor this is aaron me hi aaron this is craysh from tier we are having issues with the network and the oncall has stopped answering their phone supervisor stopped you mean they initially answered me yes he said to wait minutes supervisor ok hes probably working on it call me back in an hour if the issue persists click at this point im calling my supervisor and apprising him of the situation for the next hour i continue to call the oncall every minutes as is procedure no answer i call the supervisor again supervisor this is aaron me hi aaron this is craysh from tier again we are still having issues with the network and the oncall still has not answered his phone supervisor ok ill take a look at it turns out that telcom had pushed a policy to the junipers that had scrubbed the white lists completely blocking all access to all ports all in all it took hours to get everything back up and running i documented the ticket extremely thoroughly once the system was available again the next day came the fallout telcom was claiming that i had never paged them and they said that a customer ended calling the supervisor to find out what was going on they even showed zero calls on their cellphone they had removed the calls and messages as such we had a meeting to discuss tier s failure to report a severe incident i walked into the room filled with extremely pissed off big wigs including aaron and and steve they demanded why i hadnt contacted the oncall and i stated that i had and that they had lead me to believe that they had been working on the issue nobody believed me because the oncall phone didnt have any messages or call logs from tier their excuse for having a completely empty call log was that they cleared it daily so they could keep track of the calls made on the phone i calmly walked to the overhead projector logged into google voice and played each consecutive voicemailconversation they no longer work here and ive had three promotions since edit someone expressed an interest for the actual meeting here goes i was working the shift at the time and i had stayed an hour and a half late to own the incident a little after am im woken up to be informed that there is a meeting i need to be at for am concerning the issues that tier had alerting proper individuals in a high visibility incident running on hours of sleep i usually went to bed around am and got up at pm i figured great its about time telcom got reamed for never answering their oncall phone when i walked in to the meeting i pretty much knew that the telcom guys had decided to screw me they wouldnt look me in the eye alarm bell one we sat there while management had a little powwow before hand outside the meeting room including the acting supervisor for telcom and i heard phrases like separation procedures obvious alarm bell two as i knew that they would not get rid of any telcom guys as of that point my supervisor was not a part of this meeting he was sitting next to me alarm bell number three and he was pretty sure that they were planning on letting him go too they came in the room and sat down quietly they asked my supervisor if he had been apprised of the situation last night and responded in the affirmative we went over the procedure that i had followed and my supervisor acknowledged that i had called him and told him of the situation they then asked telcom their version of events they essentially said that i had never called the oncall phone and that the supervisor had been contacted by a customer friend of his who asked in passing why the internet wasnt working they took out the oncall blackberry and showed that there were zero calls and messages last night the actingsupervisor forgot his cellphone that day so they couldnt check his i so wanted to call his cellphone in the middle of the meeting and watch him explain that away he was one of those people who had their blackberry attached at the hip the contracting officers technical representative or cotr came in to the room and he was fuming asking me pointed questions and kept repeating why didnt you page out and there are procedures in place that you should have followed i couldnt get a word in edge wise and the telcom guys had very smug looks i pretty much didnt care anymore at this point so instead of trying to explain further i stood up which pretty much made everyone tense up a bit and i walked calmly to the overhead projector logged in turned on the and started playing the voicemails nobody really said anything at first but the telcom guys definitely had priceless faces the cotr told me please excuse us craysh we have some business to discuss feel free to take the rest of the day off with a per diem i think i ended up seeing prince of persia my supervisor was told not to tell anyone what happened in that meeting after i left all he would say was that they were very lucky that charges were not brought up against them since the documents that they filled out with the false information was a government document and what they did was technically fraud against the us government the only reason he told me this was because i had to help file an amendment to the incident report

 boredom nothing was happening today i guess this is what happens when everyone is mildly competent and looking out for any mistakes themselves instead of just leaving mistakes in a pile to collapse on someone i looked out over the tech area everyone was hard at work kinda boring really time for a ticket i thought to myself but which ticket to take i looked at the queue nothing jumped out time for some ticket roulette i closed my eyes and hammered the up and down arrows on the keyboard until i couldnt keep track of where in the queue i would be i pressed enter and opened my eyes new ticket gtcould someone come upstairs and help soothe some problems with the new desktops marketing dept walking up to the marketing department i remembered the desktops the vp had left in a pool of water i wondered where these other new desktops came from gtmarkhead airz come see the new machines gtme where did you get them from the ones ordered while i was away were wrecked markhead smiled knowingly at me gtmarkhead silence has its price a high one actually i looked at the desktops in front of me they were macs gtme woah you managed to get these from our vp i stared at the silver beasts before me gtmarkhead they say its the fastest apple computer ever built gtme so whats the problem markhead looked a little sheepish for a moment gtmarkhead you see we love the look and feel of mac but we sorta forgot all our programs are in windows sooo umm markhead looked at me with a worried expression i was still ogling the powerhouses passing off as personal computers gtmarkhead any ideas i stared hard into my soul trying to think of a solution gtmarkhead anything gtme just one idea the next day a whole shipment of computers arrived marked as upgrades for it oddly they didnt seem to ever get to the it department gtmarkhead so these new ones will work with our existing software gtme yep markhead watched as one of the macs got taken into the lift gtmarkhead and those macs go gtme mmm havent worked that out yet gtmarkhead you sure its okay these new computers are coming outta your budget markheads face was filled with concern i smiled back at him gtme you let me worry about that gtmarkhead thanks for keeping thisdiscreet gtme discretion has a price i smiled at the head of the marketing department who in turn smiled back gtmarkhead i owe you one as i got back to my office i saw a pile of brand new macs just sitting in the middle of the department well no use these going to waste i looked around at the it department gtme time for an upgrade anyone apparently sometimes ticket roulette really pays off

i graciously admitted defeat in the face of managerial apathy i accepted my diminishing responsibility as i set about my regular duties visiting desk sides and dealing with the various whims and fancies of the user base in one way it was a relief to detach myself from any view of the perpetually turning cogs of the rollout i engrossed myself in some other issues which had come to plague the user base most notably a problem visiting reps had experienced with their laptops and smartphones failing to maintain a stable wifi connection in the office i made my way past some familiar faces as i strolled around intrepidly laptop in hand waiting to catch the moment when the wifi would drop just as the signal dropped my investigation was put on hold as one of the sales managers caught my attention his artificially whitened teeth seemed to surrender every line of imperfection under the light as he smiled his wellpractised salesman smile as he casually enquired about the rollout i deflected his attention towards angie as the new goto person i was only in a consultant capacity as needed his smile took on a slightly apprehensive expression i knew full well that bhit had sung my praises right from the start to hear this dramatic change in events appeared disturbing maintaining a professional demeanour i simply assured him of my belief that the project was in capable hands the first time ive ever flat out lied on the job he disappeared back into the hustle and bustle of the office leaving me to my wifi investigation an oddly airy wednesday afternoon surged into view its felt clean and clear we could at long last breathe a hearty sigh of relief angie and roland had disappeared off for what seemed like ages the absence of their black auras had left a dramatically spacey vibe like we had all just surfaced from some colossal ocean depth finally able to drink in some of the bountiful fresh air its taste was like a cool breeze amidst some arid summer heat wave it was a relief to actually hear our own voices again the drone of insipid chatter from the finance wenches had been the only aural accompaniment of recent days their meandering discussions on male pop sensations years their junior various coffee recipes and deeply particular insights of certain male employees that these aging portly women found attractive made for a percussive din the only moments of reprieve as angies led her menopause group for their twicedaily starbucks fix of course she would leave roland on guarddog duty still we now had an opportunity to let our guards down with a secretive half vocal whisper qbg was eager to catch up on the latest rolloutgossip her face contorted in disbelief as i confided angies actions i was just barely loud enough to be heard outside our conversation but just loud enough so to ensure bhit was in earshot he barely flinched while i concluded my full update to qbg in one way i didnt care who heard me anymore so long as bhit did but it felt good to get listened to as if my account needed to be heard by someone theres only a month to go shouldnt something more be happening by now as the week trundled towards its closure angie and roland made frequent trips to the higher floors for rollout meetings as its beavered away in their duties i waited for consultation requests from roland sometimes even publically inviting him to check anything he wanted with me through as an agreeable manner as i could muster roland refused to ask for help but in reality i think i was happier without having to endure this pairs attitude and negative manner my working life seemed basic and simple again just the way i like it well of course with the regular admonishments of angie morale was long gone but there were our own little private worlds to disappear of to the biggest casualty was the ghost server that mafg and i had acquired built loved and later valiantly rescued from its janitorial doom it stood poignantly next to rolands desk the threeitem to a desk rule apparently mute given rolands status it was now clearly being held prisoner like a hostage whose captivity had broken them down sympathising with their kidnapper and taking on a new persona to mirror the evil twisted nature of its jailer the beige box was coated in the alienesque slime and goo that oozed from rolands skin like spidermans evil doppelganger shooting acidic goo from his palms the dymo label which had so proudly identified the ghost server by its hostname itsgho had been forcibly removed as if to eviscerate some evidence of its history it left a white rectangle obvious against its discoloured skin with scratches and scrapes surrounding it akin to an animals claws two weeks passed by all news of the rollout went untold roland appeared to be busily toiling in another part of the building we were quite happy to be relieved of angies underling monday morning i was training qbt in the fine art of replacing an old atx pentium motherboard in an desktop that she had retrieved from a research department a donor packard bell from the rear of the it cupboard had already been looted for some other parts previously its casing battered and bent however luckily an entire motherboard and cpu remained it was this we were transplanting to the distressed research machine its rare and irreplaceable exclusivity commanding the utmost care and attention the antistatic wrist bands seemed to complicate the procedure as its plasticcoated coil snagged on various parts of the metal chassis we were happily bonding in our moment of isolation catching up on each others hearsay it had been the first time i had been able to relax with someone at work for a while qbg it seemed could make a suitable replacement for mafg our mothers meeting was almost at a close when our a stony faced facilities monkey clad in dirty green jumper which seemed to evidence hard toil appeared in the doorway with an aged disapproving look jon he mumbled theres a truck turned up with loads of laptops where are we meant to put em his manchester accent echoed from the hallway through the opened it cupboard door his frame slightly obscuring the overhead lighting his accent clearly demonstrated the fact that he was far from home like a lone warrior holding his own in some foreign land right here i guess theres some space at the back i said motioning to an isle mafg had previously emptied towards the end of his tenure his toldyouso smile accompanied the shake of his head what all of em you know theres about of the things convoyed to the scene of the crime the facilities monkey purposely shuffled me towards the articulated lorry that had arrived in the yard standing like a bruised battle tank just returned from war its rear doors were flung open to reveal box after box after box adorned with the familiar dell logos as a team of facilities workers scrambled to unload them you better figure out where were going to put these double quick he commanded thrusting a manifest into my hands i could see my name planted firmly at the top of the documents recipient list i knew right then that my evening had just been squandered by whoevers administrative oversight had caused this turn of events of course i knew full well it had to be only one persons doing the lobby of the building was decorated with an oversized clock face which hung above the main security desk its appearance had a stealthy corporate doublemeaning on the one hand visitors would be impressed with such a bold artistic statement on the other it reinforced to any tardy employee that they had been caught redhanded their arrival time electronically indelibly stamped on their permanent record as they would swipe their access cards to add to this crafty corporate purpose this oversized clock always seemed to be a few indistinct minutes faster than almost any other clock that existed tonight it took on a new role it sarcastically emphasised my rapidly vanishing evening as i walked pumptruck after pumptruck of dell branded boxes to their temporary homes neither angie or bhit were anywhere in sight to mediate the situation repeated appeals to helpdesk to locate their whereabouts went unanswered in the end some sympathetic facilities manager had yielded to my plight and offered three temporary rooms to hold the laptops these were now crammed floor to ceiling with dell boxes my clothes smelled old from my efforts prickled with boxdust and the stale smelling air of the rooms i had been afforded which had sat unused for some time i packed away the last box finally leaving the building at pm my disentanglement from the project as prescribed by angie seemed to have been suddenly and majorly rehabilitated in this single dramatic move i had clearly stated in my project plan that these deliveries should be conducted in batches of at a time we didnt have the space to deal with machines as this very evening would attest this detail im sure had made it into angies rewrite of my project plan in verbatim i know i had even seen it whats more with only two weeks to go building machines in that time was no mean feat what had roland even been doing this whole time this blunder which felt a little too obvious seemed to signify stage two of angies sabotage previous pt a new world pt safety pt the it induction from pt pt how to make friends pt

i didnt realize just how much id thrown myself into work since my exfiancee left me ive been closing tickets a month since march plus all my projects and emergencies the next closest person is averaging about or so a month the bosses have said the number of tickets i do is too damn high tuxedo jack and craptacularly spignificant productions present i will find you hr will end you and i will laugh june a friday to end all fridays that one was my boss coworker and i were dealing with daily tasks he was working on an exchange migration for a new client and i was busy making up for the slack our lessthanerstwhile tier and helldesk operators were leaving between the two of them that day they closed incidents i closed on my own thanks to the power of the contents of my uairz eat your heart plus working on our barracudas spam filters and setting up a few allowed senders on it hey boss i said spinning in my swivel chair towards him we got a problem cryptowall emails got through the spam filter today he didnt look over when and to whom a few hours ago and to some of our most pantsonhead stupid clients i retorted flipping my rightmost monitor to him and pressing ctrlplus a few times to increase the font size in the rather long list of email recipients whod gotten the spam sure enough his eyes widened and he expressed his displeasure with a string of expletives that called the companys owner in from his corner office behind the wall next to him send out an email instructing people not to open that to the admins at each company let me stop you riiiiiiiiiiiiiight there boss not only did i just do that but i added it to the blacklist in the barracuda and im remoted into the most critical clients boxes as well as their replay servers just in case someone opens one of the links as i said this i noticed the newly opened open files section from computer management in one of our bigger also quite gullible lacking in common sense and obscenely rich clients fileserver dc was flickering quickly enough to give an epileptic a seizure with a smirk i looked up the machine that that user was connecting from and remotely ipconfig released it the flickering slowed and stopped and i shrugged problem half solved get minion over there and lets have him clean up that machine i dont want it on the network until its clean properly sure enough a few minutes later the users whod been accessing files in that server called and stated that theyd been corrupted we loaded up replay mounted the restore point and started copying back the corrupted data from the backup the restore completed successfully we turned back to our machines and continued working a mere halfhour later the phone on my bosss desk rang and the caller was from that company uh the files are still corrupt thats odd we restored them from backup let me look i flipped open the open files window which had been behind a bunch of other rdp sessions and blinked in astonishment another user had opened the same email and this had reinfected the shares wed restored and to an even worse degree i kicked that user off the network and phoned minion with strict instructions to ban both users from the network until further notice at the same time i started composing a new email to that sites admin and forced a new gpo on then psexecd a gpupdate force to every machine on the domain jack i dont get it the admin forwarded your email to everyone here saying not to open the email and the second user said it was a legitimate accident that she opened it she thought it was something she expected from a legitimate dropbox user i dont care normally id make sure theyre canned but mike restocked my coffee this morning so ill be okay i locked the users out of ad then over the next hour i not only restored their data but sent out an email to everyone at that site from our administrative account stating that under no circumstances were they to open that email or anything like it if they were in doubt they were to call me immediately on my desk line and i would work with them to make sure it was safe i stated that two people had already infected their machines that day and while i can understand one or two a third would result in immediate hr referral for disciplinary action i left the office that day drove home in rush hour traffic and sweltering heat and proceeded to down a bottle of malbec then passed out saturday morning i woke up to my phone ringing just after seven am the answering service put a call through to my cellphone despite my explicit instructions not to and me not being on call and i made it eminently clear there would be retribution on monday when i talked to my boss before talking to the client on the other end none of our files are opening the woman on the other end said we thought you cleaned this up yesterday we did i grumbled falling out of bed and stumbling to my home office through only a mild hangover lets see whats going on i pulled up my remote access console then remoted into their file server sure enough every file on all but two of the shares was encrypted i politely excused myself then tapped mute on my cell and started swearing like mad i pulled up the properties of the file and then the details tab showed me the owner at which point my eyes opened a bit wider let me call you right back i said firing up outlook and my softphone on my desktop after looking in a folder to verify the information i wanted was there i activated the callrecording feature then dialed the woman who called me back so youre right the files are encrypted apparently a third person infected their machine with cryptowall after we cleaned everything up they did so by opening the email after we told them to a good hour after we told them not to and after not one but two emails were sent out to warn people about this and from the look of the ntfs metadata that person was you no one ever sent me any email let me stop you riiiiiiiiiiiight there i said flipping open outlook again ive got two read receipts here both timestamped that said you read the emails one that the admin sent out one that i personally sent out you opened the email afterwards and then opened the infector on your machine at i remoted to her machine and found the infector file which indicated it had been running for just over hours fivethirty pm um so im going to do a few things here i enunciated through the haze of earlymorning sleepiness and the slight hangover i had as i locked her ad account and rebooted her machine which shed been remoted into with logmein im going to pull the list of files youve destroyed im going to make an estimate on the time the restores going to take im going to kick off the restore and then im going to conferencecall my boss your boss your head of hr and give them the information ive found which clearly states that you did it sure i opened the email but i didnt break the files and you cant prove it well the ntfs metadata will prove you did but

this is a bit of a long one but believe me its worth it im in the it department for a midsized utility company were a small department of three a coworker the it director and myself so we all wear a lot of hats a year or two ago we installed a new voip phone system one user in particular a secretary of sorts for the electrical department uses her phone nigh constantly because of customer calls coming in and then making calls out to the crews she has a wireless headpiece for her phone to ease the strain she also has what might be courteously called a brusque manner of speaking about a year ago she called up our department with complaints that her phone was dropping calls no problem we say well check it out theres only a few things it could be right i check the switch logs and see nothing suspicious in the port as far as errors dropped frames or anything like that the config on the port also looks good cable tester results look good for her connection phone is still fairly new so we decide the most likely factor is a bad wireless headpiece since weve had trouble with them before we swap that out everything seems good for a short bit but soon shes complaining again we check all the same things again and this time decide maybe it is the phone itself weve got spares so we swap it out every few weeks she calls up complaining and as you might guess try as we might literally nothing works we run a new cable to her workstation we move her to another switch turn off autonegotiation on duplex speeds replace the phone again we finally feel like weve isolated and done everything we could do the only factor we havent changed is the user herself we all chalk it up to her brusque attitude toward customers and assume that people are just hanging up on her last week my coworker gets a call from the user she explains that shes determined the cause of her phone ills every time she gets an email on her personal account on her iphone while talking on the phone the line goes dead as soon as he can my coworker calls me up and we howl with laughter over the diagnostic theres literally no connection between the iphone and desk phone we dont even provide wifi for our users if shes getting data on her phone its her own personal mobile connection we enjoy our chuckle and hang up not even bothering to investigate later my boss comes by my office and while talking i tell him of the call he has a good chuckle too and is about to dismiss it but then something makes him say man wouldnt it be crazy if that was actually the problem to which i reply yeah but obviously its not but what if it was so i spitball what might be happening maybe maybe somewhere the shielding is off the cable and receiving the email makes the the iphone have a brief spike of electromagnetic interference that somehow momentarily disrupts the connection but no its too outlandish still my boss has got my interest piqued and i decide to check it out i hustle up to her desk and tell her i want to check this out because its so crazy i call her desk from my mobile phone and then have her send her personal email account a test message the phone pings its notification noise to signal its got the email and son of a bitch if the line doesnt go dead i flip out but have enough presence of mind to see that the line hasnt gone dead only become muted my mind races then grasps on a halfremembered fact didnt people used to phreak phone systems by using specific frequencies and that notification ringtone was pretty flat and electronic sounding change your notification ring i have to check something out i splutter we repeat the test and sure enough with the new notification ring the line stays connected and unmuted somehow some freak chance of tech has matched some touch tone in our voip phone system to the exact same frequency on the users iphone and she was inadvertently phreaking her own phone to mute whenever she got an email i admit the phreaking diagnosis might not be for sure and that it might be some kind of weird audio overload instead but theres no denying the ringtone was causing her phone to mute shes not had any problems since i humbly admitted to the user that i hadnt believed her and that this was one of the craziest solutions to a problem ive ever encountered in it
hello everybody im back on nightshift this week which mean that i had some downtime to browse some old tickets and chat logs which led to me rediscovering one of the more amusing requests that the internal it help desk has received tonights cast steve the head of it for site lingo william internal it tech used to work for steve directly before joining internalit incident from steve site lingo message left my pants at home could you bring them to me incident from steve site lingo message the black ones incident from steve site lingo message theyre on a hanger left hand side my coworkers watched these messages come in with a mixture of amusement and confusion finally one of them could no longer resist the temptation to respond re incident from william internal it message sorry boss but we dont do pickup or delivery turns out the messages were intended for his wife but the internal it desk was somehow being cced them steve didnt realize that we were receiving the messages as well because he had long ago created an email filter to hide the you have created a ticket auto response that was sent out every time we got a new incident or request how steve managed to include both our address and her address in the same message without realizing it though remains a mystery more of my stories can be found

edit sigh i could literally kill myself ampnbsp im a fairly new redditor and im still amazed of all the supreddits of course there is a tales from tech support a bit of background originally a software developer but after a year working for a small company right after my degree i realized that i would never be top dawg coder infact i hated the long long hours and unrealistic deadlines so when i got the opportunity years ago to work as an it administratortech support i jumped ship and never looked back im working at a big danish municipality with users and computers and working both and line support municipalities aways have to save money hence the double job function so this was a couple of years ago i get a call from a user that cant login to a new system that she and two colleques have gotten access to phones rings gtme it this is boef gtuser hi my boss sent an email explaining how to login to the new system with pictures and everything but i still cant login the login window is like not responding gtme right whats the name of the system gtuser xxxxsystemz can you somehow see if my pw or username is wrong gtme tell you what let me just reset your pw and give you a standard one which you change when you enter the system your pw is now xxxsomethingcool gtuser thx i can hear her tapping the keyboard nope sorry it doesnt work gtme are you sure its the right pw dont we all know capslock is not on remember the letter that was supposed to be capital gtuser yes im sure but something is weird about the login prompt it is as if its frozen you should fix it since you made it tone of her voice is now annoyed gtme we didnt develop the system your department bought it without our consent and expected us to support it which we wont we will only help with pw resets the rest is up to your super users and the company you bought it from gtuser oh gtme but since you are so sure about your pw ill just reset it again and make a new one might be a delay from serverside the new pw is xxxsomethingcool gtuser hmmmm no sorry but it just doesnt work the login prompt wont allow me to enter anything gtme uh ok whats your computers id number ill remote in secs later im remote controlling her pc gtuser see what i mean i do everything im told in the email gtme gtme you are trying to log into a screenshot 
my last was a bit of a downer so i thought id share a good one this one also takes place at the university several years back i deployed new computers to the library with windows on them now most of the library staff took to the new os without issue as theyd been using it at home for some time but one librarian our head librarian was still used to xp so the new os was a big adjustment for her knowing this in advance i expected to receive some extra calls from her about basic usage items some extra calls instead over the next few weeks she inundated me with multiple calls daily with issues like how do i mute my speakers or my screen is too dim or why cant i find ms word as you might guess some of the calls i received were actually related to the new os whereas the rest were unrelated but triggered by the upgrade because she didnt understand that windows doesnt actually control things like the volume knob on her speakers now headlibrarian hl is a friend who in spite of living in want of technical prowess is actually very intelligent willing to learn and very good at what she does this i respect so i was happy to extend her extra patience as i never had to answer the same question twice nevertheless after two weeks of calls my patience was beginning to wane and it occurred to me that most of her questions could be solved by a simple google search so i decided on a new tactic the next time she called gt me lordpaddington here hey headlibrarian what can i do for you gt hl hi im wondering if you can help me with something i cant figure out how to set my email signature in outlook i sighed a little this is exactly the kind of nonosupgraderelated question id been getting from her since the upgrade gt me you know headlibrarian this the kind of thing you could find out for yourself with a simple google search gt hl really but its just so much easier to call you gt me be that as it may looking this sort of thing up in google is the better way to go now im going to help you with this problem but the next time you call me with an issue like this if you havent checked google first i will hang up on you gt hl you wouldnt her tone was flat and clearly unimpressed gt me trust me headlibrarian i have no qualms about dishing out tough love i will hang up on you if i think its necessary but never mind that heres how you can update your signature i proceeded to walk her through updating her signature gt me there you go pretty easy eh gt hl thanks gt me now remember next time be sure to look your issue up in google before calling me gt hl okay i could tell by her tone that she didnt quite believe me fast forward a few days the longest interval i go without hearing from her for a while and im beginning to suspect my encouragement to use google might have actually worked but the next call i got from her proved me wrong gt me lordpaddington here hey headlibrarian what can i do for you gt hl hi lordpaddington i did something to my speakers and they came unplugged can you come fix it for me gt me headlibrarian do you remember what i said to you about what would happen if you didnt check google before calling me about issues like this gt hl you wouldn i hung up on her it was coldblooded of me and i felt awful doing it but it was the only way she was going to learn seconds later she called back gt hl you hung up on me she sounded offended but i think she was more shocked that id actually done it gt me i told you i would now did you check google gt hl no but i i hung up on her again this time i was sure shed be pissed seconds later gt hl stop hanging up on me she was angry gt me listen headlibrarian when you call me with obscure questions about the internal database structure of your library catalogue where do you think i get the answer you are always impressed that i seem to have such amazing knowledge but you must understand that google is the lifeblood of my work and like you ive spent my career seeking out information through written media now you are a librarian your job is to manage knowledge and teach students how to search out that knowledge put your own skill set to work and apply your ability to acquire knowledge to this simple problem she was dead silent i took a breath gt me now look im not mad in fact this conversation is the moment ive been waiting for with you so im actually quite happy just believe me when i say that you can do this just do a google search and i promise you will find the answer in half the time it takes for you to call me she took a deep breath gt hl okay but can i call you back if i cant find the answer gt me absolutely and provided you can prove to me youve done due diligence in looking up the answer for yourself i will not hang up on you ever again i promise gt hl okay gt me let me know how it goes we hang up i take a deep breath and pray this doesnt get me fired five minutes later the following email arrives this is the actual email pasted in from outlook and anonymized from headlibrarian sent thursday august am to lordpaddington subject i did it i did it i cant believe it actually worked i googled how to plug in computer speakers found some instructions and plugged my speakers into the green holethingy in the back it was so easy thank you i emailed back welcome to freedom headlibrarian youll like it here its been years since that day and now when i get support requests from her it comes in the form of an email containing the answer she found on google and how shes having trouble with one of the steps consequently our professional dialogue has gone from handholding to learning together best day ever lp edit oh my gosh you guys this kind of a response i was definitely not expecting i cant begin to thank you enough for your upvotes and kind words of support and perspective thanks especially to the person who gifted gold as a new reddit user im still trying to figure this all out i once managed a blacktie dining restaurant and one day my boss looked at me and said lordpaddington with every decision you must work toward setting others up for longterm success failure to do so will invalidate you as a leader its one of the rulesofthumb i now live by and what motivated my actions that day with hl

a request came in on friday last week that computer rooms equipment needed swapping urgently they are swapped at great speed with our amazing team pulling a massive effort and the important room is ready to go at the end of the day we are told the non important room will have new occupants friday this week so we are inaging them today this is where the person who is in the important room decides without warning that they must now use both rooms this week even though it was agreed the non important room is out of action until friday they went strait to our line manager and put in a complaint that the room was out of action all i can say here is that im really glad we have a fully traceable helpdesk system i spent minutes with my line manager showing them the requests and agreements all i am left with at the end of this is annoyance at the person who complained they knew what was going on and how long it would take so could only have been trying to make us look bad i just dont understand
qbg and i worked long and worked hard machines were building while machines were unwrapped while machines were repacked this time with larger address labels as per angies demands the previously arid air infected by roland seemed more pleasant now that angie had declared he had far more pressing duties to attend to that didnt stop angies persistence in micromanagement each visit brought a new list of vices which had to be adhered to her elephantlike memory seemed to retain every minor piece of misdirection she spluttered her leathery face and tongue breathing fire at the slightest transgression qbg and i pulled overtime on wednesdaythursday our thanks came with a companysanctioned pizza on one night followed by an impromptu trip to the local chinese takeout the next we both worked diligently for our cause until sometime on friday afternoon when the last batch of laptops sat imaging the it cupboard looked like a bomb site discarded baggies hastily recorded cdrs with various drivers on them several cardboard cups which once contained cheap cost effective canteen coffee and shreds of illcut tape and inners littered the floor i sat on the trolley gently rocked myself back and forth thoroughly shattered as qbg lounged on the chair our hands were grubby from the manual lifting but we were finally done we still had no idea if our plea for clemency from bhit was the real reason for rolands absence but were glad of the break the last laptop completed its imaging process as i struggled to my feet after loading the correct user profiles we loaded the last box onto the trolley we turned the lights out on the it cupboard as we rolled out the door which clanged loudly echoing through the lifeless corridor as the electronic lock whizzed sealing the cupboard with a tomblike finality as i pushed the trolley towards the mail room again filled top to bottom with our efforts the conversation turned to the conference next week angies plan of having a support presence seemed unnaturally forwardthinking yet seemed to be yet another construct of some great demonstration of incompetence we had no real idea of what we were expected to do there and we still had another machines to image as reps waited qbg and i had also realized that our unanticipated teambuilding time had come to an end a valuable insight we would have never gotten had angie not interfered in the way that she did but mired with her constant micromanagement we were glad it was all over for now another monday morning the rain and sleet smacked my windscreen as i could only think of the same old mantra i hate mondays its had arrived early at the conference centre to set up our support booth spanned four tables which had been strewn with all manner of supportrelated paraphernalia it looked like someone had raided some longforgotten box of promotional material which now served to entice passers by a sizable gazebo stood behind the dubiously supported makeshift tables housing the secondary support area when i arrived i found angie midlecture as some helpdesk underling borrowed for the purposes of the day had met her disapproval in some way her shrill demanding voice was evident even over the noise of the waiters and waitresses igniting several water heaters in anticipation for the impending delegates angies constant barking continued up until our official open time of am at which time she scarpered to makenice with some apparent acquaintances it always amazed me to see her personality and body language shift so seamlessly when interacting with anyone who wasnt well us almost as soon as the hall opened our first delegate arrived at the helpdesk brandishing a very familiar laptop bag the delegate bore all the hallmarks of a vintage salesman his suit was worn distended around his stomach which showed obvious patronage to many miles behind his repmobile on motorways placing the bag on the table he stressed with a clear but jovial tenor voice that he had received it the previous week but was having problems with it i ushered him into the back of our support area our it setup seemed to impress him the ghost server hummed proudly atop a stack of plastic boxes while stations demarked with chairs and table space offered spare network cables and power supplies already connected and waiting for their prospective tenants its like mission control in here the delegate quipped with a confirmatory laugh he added we have lift off the delegate presented his laptop as i hooked it up he withdrew a shabby bluecovered notebook filled with scribbling bits of paper and bound by a rubber band from the depths of his suit peering through the frames of his rounded spectacles he declared that he had a number of problems he reeled off each entry on his list as though sermonising from his blue notebook the software though it could open was unable to load profiles or remember preferences which though meant nothing to me meant the world to a marketing guru such as this man it also seemed to failed to synchronise in any way with the central database while scanning through the laptop i had also noticed mcafee was failing to update and the image distinctly lacked any installation of ms office the realization that roland had indeed fudged the image was all too real this was polarized by the sight near the helpdesk tables at the queue seemed to extend to the far corner of the hall all said the same thing the rickety tables seemed the final barricade on the front lines as reps brandishing the same laptop bags came to voice their ails tensions ran high as the word spread among the queuing reps it had blown it theyd screwed the pooch and messed up bigtime dissent spread quickly into the queue our borrowed helpdesk guy was buckling he was illequipped to deal with demand of this magnitude without the simple escape route of simply logging a call for escalation i relieved him with the instruction to find angie in the meantime all we could think to do was accept laptops back enmasse and deal with the fallout later the rear support area filled as some machines lay piled as portrait of the enormous blunder angies eventual reappearance was complemented with another bout of her ranting and raving despite her inability to offer another solution she stormed off in anger leaving us to somehow organise transportation of laptops back to head office two sales and marketing managers also appeared demanding explanations and reasons for this mother of all fuckups our borrowed helpdesk guy and i loaded the laptops into a hire van for their voyage back to the office our drive back to the office through the rain seemed dark and depressing the rain reverberated off the large metal hulk of the van only dampened by the cloth of the soft laptop bags the only thing to look forward to now was another drenching skirmish through the office yard to return the laptops to their holding cells previous pt a new world pt safety pt the it induction from pt pt how to make friends pt marking pt one friday to rue them pt best laid pt its one step for pt and one step back for pt bring home the pt who needs minor pt dawn of a new pt rules

sadly my first tale here is not my own but was shared by a coworker this morning he received a call from our engineer claiming that windows was trying to delete his computer he promptly walks into the office to find that no matter what the user clicked on the are you sure you want to delete x dialog appeared without much thought he ran a quick virus scan but nothing came up he then suggested rebooting the machine to see if anything changed as he went to reach for the power button he noticed something the user was using a laptop seated in a dock the screen was open and his was phone laying on the keyboard the weight of the phone was just enough to press the edge down onto the delete key he moved the phone off of the keyboard and miraculously windows lost its interest in digital genocide
so i work at a relatively small software development place usually focusing on making webbased softwareasaservice solutions for individual customers as such were often asked to help with general tech support and database management allow me to set the scene its early on a monday morning everything is quiet and everyone is going about their usual monday morning routines committing changes to live sites catching up on easy tickets and the like suddenly the silence is shattered by the shrill sound of the telephone ringing it gets picked up and i kind of zone out again carrying on testing my current bit of work and listening to music my interest is piqued when i hear my coworker exclaim the server is what everyone stops what theyre doing and looks up my coworker on the phone has suddenly gone quite pale and wideeyed as it turns out the customers database server has been quietly smoking for the past half an hour or so and someone finally realised that servers should not be smoking but of course they wouldnt do the logical thing and turn the server off oh no they calmy and collectedly called us for a minute ambling chat this is quite normal for this employee from this firm wherein they calmly drop the bomb that the server is currently smoking and if it isnt too much trouble if we could perform a offsite backup via remote desktop quickly tldr server starts smoking customer leaves it for half an hour before thinking to call someone

 as i stood in a crowd of designers and thought about a way to describe shoes i wondered if all jobs turned out this way probably for me they would inspiration i needed inspiration i looked around for anything that could help nothing not even a poster was on the walls gtme shoes to me define the man i looked around the room everyone seemed oddly interested gtme if on the street you see a man with no shoes you dont think what a cool guy no youre reminded about homelessness however if you see a man with great shoes you envy his success in life scarfy sat open mouthed staring up at me i couldnt think of another word to say so i sat down gtcarefree now that was excellent airz carefree continued to chat about the design aspects i tuned out after a while i was happy just picturing the odd look of confusion and pain on scarfys face near the end of the meeting carefree opened up the floor for general questions a designer with dreadlocks put up his hand gtdread what happened with the internet yesterday carefree looked to me i realised this was turning into a forum session gtme it went down because water got into the line gtdread it was down for almost an hour how is that acceptable i looked over to carefree waiting for direction on how to answer that question gtcarefree i think we should be thanking airz for getting the internet working again so quickly the dreadlocked man looked a little sheepish after that rebuke but recovered quickly gtdread i saw you airz wrapping a box outside in plastic didnt you know plastic bags are banned in this office i wondered where the dreadlocked designer learnt my name from i decided i didnt care about him or his opinions gtairz unfortunately in this situation plastic is the easiest way of waterproofing the problem gtdread i think we should find a more sustainable way of waterproofing i really didnt care if he could find a way to do it without plastic the internet was working thats all i cared about scarfy looked over at me with disdain on his face and decided he wanted to comment as well gtscarfy i agree with dread we really shouldnt be sacrificing the environment for internet imagine all the toxic chemicals we could save if we could find a better way of doing things i think sustainability is the key here at the office polluting our surroundings with plastic and making us dependent upon plastic is damaging i honestly didnt know what he was trying to say oddly though other designers were nodding their heads in agreement carefree looked concerned gtcarefree yes ill get airz to look into it for the environment the meeting broke up after that most of the designers left to start work again carefree signaled me over gtcarefree we gotta get rid of that plastic bag or therell be a riot gtme its literally the only thing keeping the internet up gtcarefree try to think of a more sustainable solution i looked around to see if anyone else was witnessing this madness no one seemed to care outside the rain continued to fall stupid rain

sadly in most workplaces and especially in call centres its not unusual for management to play hardball with sick employees and its all too common that it works even the best job security still requires you to do your part turn in doctor papers get your illnesses documented etc but what happens when the nature of your illness prevents you from realizing you were ever sick all too often you lose your job without even realizing whats happening not here not anymore years ago a frontline employee at my telco with many years of perfectly adequate employment slowly started behaving erratically his name andrew started popping in senior staffs coaching reports he randomly gave incredibly implausible diagnosis to customers i listened to a call where he ranted lengthily about ufos when a customers node was down colleagues had already noticed he was very withdrawn and seemed to have stopped washing his clothes and all conversations with him ended in non sequiturs then andrew sometimes just got up in the middle of his shift and walked out soon after we noticed he started sometimes coming in on days he wasnt scheduled to work and took calls without pay most critically he insisted all was fine in the world if anything he had started looking at everyone else suspiciously like if something was wrong with them it was obvious something was seriously wrong with him and the union steward told his manager in writing he needed to be granted extended sick leave immediately and that the medical office should order an independent expert diagnosis of whatever afflicted him scumbag manager instead focused on the fact he sometimes walked out of his shift without warning any union employee can do that with mere notification at a moments notice an email will do and it just gets taken off your sick dayshours no biggie but leave without any warning and its a fairly severe offense that rapidly escalates to suspension or being fired for cause obviously the guys sick though no manager could possibly hold it against him right gt bytewave senior line bytewave you may send me your ticket gt andrew oh nevermind i have to go boss seems angry what i look down i can see his desk from senior staffs upper halffloor his manager is talking to him he had a customer on the line he actually sent me his ticket and then he just hung up out of the blue and followed the manager next to the managers desk was a reliable and trustworthy guy i get his extension and have him on the line in seconds gt bytewave thomas your boss is coming to his desk with andrew id like you to keep this line live a minute and listen to whats going on andrew shouldnt even be here by now were all worried ill erase this call from the recording software afterwards thomas complies happily within a minute its obvious whats happening not only is his manager berating him specifically about the fact he recently left the floor without warning but he says the magic number times grounds for disciplinary letters exactly enough to fire someone for cause andrew clearly doesnt even understand whats going on from what thomas tells me in hushed tones but he says hes very agitated this is an obvious case of wrongful termination any arbitrator will give us this one straight up especially given the union had formally recommended he receive independent medical analysis but its way too risky when the guy is convinced all is fine in the world and may end up saying he left voluntarily best force the issue i dial the floors union steward mute him and conference in building security gt bytewave senior staff priority call we have a very agitated employee who must be taken to a secure room temporarily suspect serious medical issue please alert emergency services immediately while the scumbag manager is still explaining what the letters in his hands mean three building rentacops walk into the floor like their life suddenly has purpose its not everyday they get to do something other than use the outdoor cameras to zoom on cute chicks walking down the street yes they really do that they swiftly take andrew to holding over the managers protests any medical crisis is supposed to trump managements say so twenty minutes later paramedics and police are all over it while the union steward has dragged the manager into the directors office soon after andrew is on extended sick leave and under care against his will sadly but his condition required it we hadnt forgotten that management had been given written notice two months ahead of time about the problem and much less what this specific manager tried to do with the info plenty of grounds for a grievance fast forward a year the grievance is granted in arbitration and the unions health and safety vp now has power to order medical examinations on advice of the council if management fails to act on such a recommendation and the offending manager has been relegated to an obscure lowlevel position where he can do no harm hes in charge of letters about contract changes notifications to customers still too good for him but at least out of my sight all of bytewaves tales on 
friday the clock in my office was ticking notoriously slowly with sheer willpower i urged it to go faster weekend i thought the clock refused to move faster annoying thing i turned my attention to my blank inbox and queue perfect looking out into the department i could tell most people were waiting for me to leave i too was looking forward to it just a little longer bing an email popped into my inbox i frowned at it and hoped it was spam gtmy computers making weird noises secretary i read then reread the email it looked like a monday job future airz could take care of this i thought to myself i quickly replied urging the secretary to turn off the machine and go home for the weekend back to staring at the clock which i could have sworn was going backwards stupid thing i bet it was cheaply made bing another email id grown tired of the constant flow all week who sends emails on friday after three sadistic bds gtjust wondering can i get a new keybo should i just reply with a single line i debated with myself i decided a single word was more efficient no smiling to myself that id been so productive on friday afternoon i went back to harassing the clock with my stare it defiantly wasnt working i considered replacing the clock entirely bing three three emails after pm on a friday what the hell since i was a model employee i opened this one as well mentally noting that i deserved a pay rise gtive lost my phone messy oh darn an email that actually requires attention i frowned at the uncompromising clock and walked into it to find messy messy was the newest employee of it he seemed to have some non specific relation to someone else at the company he always dressed extremely professionally but he had this air of mess about him his hair never seemed to be under control he always had sauce of some kind on his face yet oddly his suits always remained spotless it was weird arriving at messys desk i was inspired by how much clutter hed managed to acquire whilst only being at the company a few weeks gtmessy i swear i had my phone at lunch and i had it when i got back to my desk now its gone gtme have you tried calling it messy had the receiver in his hand he bashed his number so quickly into the keypad i could tell hed been recently practicing a lot i was tempted to inform him of the redial button but reconsidered as i saw his clearly determined smashing at the buttons clearly stress relief gtmessy its ringing but i cant even hear the buzz i swear i havent moved from this spot messy was throwing papers everywhere searching for it i looked up at the clock in the department it was already nearing pm what a good clock perhaps i should replace mine with this one i though to myself gtme i guess ill help i got to my knees and started looking below the desk whilst messy attacked the top with a passion below his desk was a myriad of different objects i even found a half eaten bagel which i moved away with the end of a pen gtmessy so thats were that went messy looked down at the bagel i was dragging across the floor with my pen he grabbed the bagel shoved it in his mouth my face must have shown my disgust he quickly justified his actions gtmessy dont worry its fresh it was yesterdays morning snack messy joined me on the floor as we searched i tried to stay far as far away from the dirty old bagel that was hanging from messys face as possible eventually after much searching we gave up the hunt at this point most of the office had realized i wasnt leaving and gave up all pretext of working hard and just left gtmessy darn it its a new phone too what am i gonna do now gtme ahh can you think of anywhere else it could be at the shake of messys head i had to shrug nothing could be done i wandered back to my office and looked up at my office clock again what the hell clock i tried to justify leaving since the other clock said i couldnt do it my clock didnt say i sat back down at my computer dejectedly one email was sitting waiting for me four i thought to myself four emails after on a friday this was getting outrageous gthey it i turned the computer off even unplugged it its still making noises secretary huh that is weird i decided to call the secretary herself but shed apparently heeded my earlier message to go home i hiked up to her desk myself to take a look at the computer it wasnt making a sound though shrugging i decided i may as well take it down to it as i carried it downstairs i heard the distinctive rattle of something wrong something loose entering the it department i caught messy just about to leave gtme give your phone one last try you never know messy grabbed the nearest phone and absolutely hammered the numbers into the keypad the entire desk shook as he smashed down on it as soon as it started ringing the computer in my hands started to rattle and vibrate gtmessy i hear it now gtme its in here passing messy the computer he looked at me confusedly then proceeded to crack open the case his phone was sitting in a hard drive bay gtmessy huh i shook my head as messy left for the day wondering how he even survived in the real world i didnt have much time to ponder it as it slowly dawned on me that my weekend must be starting i entered my office to collect my things and looked gleefully up at the clock gtme seriously screw the clock i thought to myself as i collected all my belongings and marched out the door is close enough to pm on a friday in my mind 
 as i started walking over to see colourblind my coffee cup whispered to me it had a devious plan to level the playing field gtme everyone wants everything to be fair i said that out loud to no one in particular a few techs looked up from the desks but the competition meant they didnt have time to diagnose the nonsense i was saying out loud not with a weeks holiday on offer i got back to my desk and looked at the queue of tickets that hadnt been picked up by anyone it was empty new email gt due to the competition employees may not for the next week throw tickets back into the queue after taking them airz head of it i smiled time to make some tickets i looked at colourblinds ticket queue he had two open tickets excellent three spaces to fill new ticket gt a tech needs to cross match every asset our internal asset list with the physical locations of the assets estimated time minutes physically checking every computer in the company that might take a while new ticket gt a tech is needed to clean out every dust trap in all the servers located in the server room estimated time minutes just getting the keys for every rack in the server room would take hours i took a sip of my coffee mercy was probably the best approach new ticket gt one idea for the it consultant needed anything at all estimated time minutes i knew it would take about seconds to think of an idea but the other two would take probably days i released the demons straight onto the it queue sure enough colourblinds account took all three tickets straight away i then changed the settings so no one could redump tickets into the queue i took a sip of my coffee i smiled fair did feel good the afternoon began passing very peacefully as i sat down at my desk to my late afternoon coffee i dreamt about a world without jobs it was weird a knock at the door woke me from my thoughts gtitsec boss hey gtme haha you dont have to call me boss down here gtitsec could i have a chat since coffee was the only thing on my schedule i invited him to sit down gtitsec so umm i saw you sent solitaire and hockey home gtme yeah they where pretty stressed gtitsec you know how i came here and ill admit didnt know much about computers and stuff i took a sip of my coffee where was this going gtitsec well solitaire helped me a bunch he made it so i could pick out tickets before they became available to other people that way i could do the jobs i had knowledge of gtme wait what gtitsec i didnt know how to do a bunch of things so every ticket that came in id have a second window to take it before it would be available to everyone else that way i could just take the ones gtme so thats why every ticket starts its life on seconds i took a sip of my coffee i couldnt tell if it was angry bitter or impressive coffee gtitsec yeah the timer anyway im just telling you because i realize i should be taken out of the race for the week off since i cant do everything and its sorta cheating gtme mmmm every ticket you get first pick of gtitsec i didnt take all the ones i could do just needed the leg up so i could be semi useful i looked down at my coffee it smelt good and honest gtme take the afternoon off or whats left of it gtitsec and make sure you take me out of the running for the competition its really not fair now that i think about it gtme mmm okay now go home i sat back in my chair huh its actually quite peaceful 
reading this has just reminded me of my old fixit script we all know users never actually try restarting their pcs before calling us and lying to tell us that they have this beings back memories of a place i used to work at where there were problems launching software every few days back then everyone on wink or xp sp pcs on for weeks at a time with applications open for days at a time due to this i used to get inundated with support calls and used to psexec a batch file to pcs to fix them users were given warning to save everything ahead of time and then off it went the contents of this batch file are as below title computer recycle v cd windowssystem dir route print ipconfig all type shelldll net view arp a netstat ano shutdown r t essentially go to system run a bunch of pointless crap to make the user think their issue was being fixed then reboot this little toy used to fix problems on that otherwise stable network on the occasions where it didnt work we knew a helpdesk member was required and dispatched one immediately to my knowledge this is still being used today nearly years later or at least was last year when i consulted for them briefly on a voip router upgrade edit a huge thankyou to whoever guilded this 
 i was annoyed and not the good kind of annoyed the ive just spent half an hour on hold kind of annoyed the red headed lady was still sitting next to me gtredcheer so any other good ideas for my winnings i had enough of being on hold i could not care anymore no internet was worth this gtme i err pffft nah i cant think of a good one gtredcheer fine you know what no coffee for you today thats my winnings i looked over at the break room coffee would make this go faster i considered dashing over and making a quick cup i knew the operator would be back while im gone though its a curse carefree made his way over to me as if sensing my distress gtcarefree airz any eta on when the internet will be back the designers are getting antsy gtme no idea im afraid im on hold gtcarefree you look frazzled give me the phone go take a break gtredcheer no coffee though i looked over at the break room without coffee it wasnt worth walking over i decided instead id step outside and let the rain and cool air refresh me the red haired lady decided shed follow hearing the rain breathing the sweet air i felt a little better seeing clearly again i looked over at the communication pit outside the office gtme whats that plasticky thing coming out of the ground over there gtredcheer mmmm no idea the rain was coming down hard i ran over to the pit a bunch of cords were coming out of the pit and into a plastic container then hoping over the fence of the property and making a beeline for the communications room the container was filled with rain gtme huh i poured the rain out of the container and looked into the plastic hell connections everywhere i heard a shout from inside gtredcheer i think theyre saying the internet is working again airz i looked down at the plastic container in my hands and the wire strung across the front of the building not buried not covered just strung this was just i put the container back on the ground and made my way inside gtredcheer no no it just stopped again weird the plastic was slowly filling with rain again gtme i need some plastic bags and a bunch of tape gtredcheer oh we dont really do plastic here i thought about the time she told me they didnt do plastic cups here seemed like a similar situation gtme seriously though i need plastic bags and tape gtredcheer seriously to you we dont have plastic bags i can get tape gtme ahhh ill go ask carefree can you get the tape gtredcheer you know after being in the rain i was gonna let you get coffee to warm up but now still no coffee today i walked over to carefree and asked about the plastic bag situation he said they didnt have any i felt a little bad gtme im going to have to go to the store to get some plastic bags gtcarefree should i stay on the phone gtme probably a good idea as i walked to the store i realized i couldnt physically get any more soaked i thought about going in and asking for just some plastic bags but it felt wrong not buying anything gtme one coffee and some plastic shopping bags please gtstoreowner sorry a coffee and gtme just a few shopping bags please i pointed down at the shopping bags the owner was very confused gtstoreowner sooo you want the coffee in the bag gtme er no i just want a few bags gtstoreowner sorry okay the owner then proceeded to make the coffee and then puts the coffee cup into a shopping bag gtme thanks could i get a few more bags please the store owner then takes the coffee which is inside a bag and places it inside another bag which he then places inside another bag gtme errr thanks i tried to smile as i held my coffee surrounded by bags i tried to sip plastic was in the way i took my coffee out of the five bag protection as i walked back to the office i saw my coffee slowly getting weaker and colder from the rain i shouldnt have taken it out of its plastic protection getting back to the office red haired lady walks over with some tape and a mug gtredcheer airz youre soaked i brought you a coff she looked at what i was holding and just handed me the tape gtme thanks she stormed off i didnt have time to work out why i decided the internet needed fixing pronto i went outside with my plastic and tape poured the water out of the plastic container again then covered everything in plastic and tape i added layer upon layer as i walked back inside i could see the internet had indeed started working i saw carefree still on the phone to the isp gtcarefree oh it looks like its working now should i stay on the phone i took the receiver out of his hands and promptly hung up gtme you look frazzled go take a break i smiled and got one in return from carefree i looked down at my coffee and took a sip problem solved everything was good right 
i used to work for an engineering company but of course there were folks in finance and other infrastructure departments who were not familiar with technology the entire it department was in a locked area about half the company was in a locked area of one kind or another because we did classified work for the government standard operating procedure for us each closed area had an alarm keypad and door combo keypad next to the door most areas also had a phone hanging on the wall next to the door so you could call the person you wanted to see to let them know you were at the door no doorbells not workable given the size of the locked areas and the fact that there could be over people in there the manager of the it department had her office outside the door so some woman had to come see someone at the helpdesk one day she had to pick up a laptop or something so shes told where the door is and to use the phone to call the person when she gets there she shows up fails to see the phone hanging next to the door but sees the alarm keypad she punches in the guys phone number on the alarm keypad and starts yelling into the alarm keypad wtf the manager was in her office and came out to see if she could help the dingbat the fallout from this was that the manager jumped down the neck of the helpdesk staff to be more user friendly we had to move the phone inches closer to the door put a huge sign with big red letters and a big red arrow that said phone on it put a bigger sign on the door with everybodys extension on it all because this one woman was too stupid to recognize a phone and use it properly 
i initially planned to post this only to rskyrimmods because its very niche but its really a tech support story too i used to do quite a bit more sidework as a forhire general purpose it guy few years ago i no longer needed as much money and raised my rates to ensure my workload would be lessened and what was left was more profitable i had some faithful customers who kept relying on me as needed recently on that basis i got the most fun private job i was ever offered gt customer yeah i remember all the times you helped me out last time we were chatting you mentioned you played skyrim and stuff i googled the email address on your business card you dont just play do you youre a known modder gt bytewave i suppose i am yes ive contributed to some projects mostly what can i help you with gt customer i just love this game i tried modding it on my own but it crashes all the time now i need a professional just emailed you my load order mods esps thats a very heavily modded game those only stay stable if you really know what youre doing the scripting engine for that game is incredibly temperamental throw too many mods at papyrus and you end up with more ctds than playtime its the big secret to modding skyrim you need to be aware at all times of what scripts will be running and keep it light if you want a stable load order scriptless mods dont really hurt my skyrim install is over gigs because of heavy textures and yet never crashes gt bytewave yup i see the problem papyrus overload need to make some choices here your worst problem is the amount of scripts running while youre in combat bet you ctd often when casting spells gt customer suspected as much and figuring that proves youre the guy i need look id like you to build an install up from scratch i just emailed you a list of what i cant live without and what would be nice then you rebuild the install on a ssd ill give you and you test it heavily like do a completionist playthrough this isnt a rush thing look for little issues and fix them once youre confident everything is pretty much right and uptodate hand it back to me and for the love of god finetune the enb i cant get everything to look right everywhere im so tired of trying to do that the email in question lists dozens of critical mods everything from voiceactivated shouts in dragonspeech to interesting npcs texture and weather mods enb calibration thankfully the musthave list was actually rather light on papyrusheavy mods and most of it was entirely compatible with step a project im well familiar its the core of every of my own skyrim installs i contribute there some under another name gt bytewave modding an install this size alone takes quite a few hours testing it properly is the kind of thing only true hobbyists put in a completionist playthrough on skyrim takes a couple hundred hours were also going to make a few compromises i have scriptlight alternatives for a few of your mods but you know my new hourly rates given how big a job this could be are you sure you gt customer yup dont really care im retired now not taking any money to heaven your new rate no matter the hours if the quality is there i was just about to tell him that since i love playing that game and it was a big contract i was willing to slash my usual rate but well im only human hes ready to pay full price ill take it told myself id focus extra hard to make it utterly kickass to make sure he got his moneys worth and i did i cant know what other modders managed to pull off but i doubt there are as many skyrim installs that are as expansive yet stable than the one i built him and then tested for two months much finetuning during the test phase but at the end i thought it was damn close to perfect was wonderful because i had not only gotten paid for modding and testing a game i love but also got to use the work for my own use as the basis of my new skyrim install it was both the biggest contract i got in years and yet one of the most fun even though like with any skyrim loadorder this heavy there were dozen of minor issues i had to pick apart one by one everyone who ever saw a briarheart with invisible torsos or crashes around sky haven temple will understand i did troubleshoot installs before for my own enjoyment and it was incredible to know that this time around i was being generously paid for it all of bytewaves tales on

working as tech support for a large company with many remote workers one of the reps called with problems with his broadband we had sent him a new preconfigured router which he should have been able to plug in and go he called after not being able to get a connection we go through all the usual diagnostics and reach the point where i need to ring the broadband supplier uk telco begins with v cant spell phone we join our hero on the second call after all diagnostics have been done by the first call and all that was needed was a appointment for bt to come out and check the line cs customer service rep gt devish so can we organise bt to come out then please gt cs i just need to check a few details please what is the username and password you are using to access the router gt dervish currently its set to admin and admin thats not the problem we can access that page the adsl light is on solid so it has a synced the problem is happening when we give the users credentials which we know to be correct gtcs ok i just need to check a few more things what address are you going to to access the router gt dervish currently connecting to it on gt cs im just going to ping the router to check its online at this point the call has been going on for minutes i figure its best just to let him get on with it gt cs ok ive pinged the router at and its responded to the pings so we know the router is online gtdervish sorry did you just say you pinged the address from your computer gtcs yes and it responded so we know the router is online it must be some other problem gtdervish so you pinged from your computer and got a response are you sure that that is the customers router gtcs oh yes there was a bit of a lag but the router is definitely there at this point there were a few incredulous questions to determine if i really was hearing him correctly yes i really was he did think that pinging from his computer would somehow find the customers modem i then decided that i couldnt cope with any more diagnostics and arranged the bt visit and got off the phone quick

so this is a thing that started at the bigboxstore i was a bench tech at and its carried forward for years now this isnt just the usual heres a funny story or god this user is stupid story this is about making stuff better spread this theory around because its awesome and it works bigboxstore runs a private forum where techs across the company can interact easily to get help and tips whenever they run into problems they cant solve on their own one such thread was an asking is xxx from drd a member on these forums we just got a hard drive back from drd and the customer wants to know how to thank you where the xxx was the techs initials and drd is the data recovery place that we send dead hard drives to for forensic data recovery xxx responded with i like swedish fish and the customer mailed him a large quantity of swedish fish as a thank you from this point on it became proper etiquette to expedite a forensic data recovery with the inclusion of candy in the package sent out for recovery we would see drives sent with candy coming back in half the time of one sent without candy customers would look at us like we were crazy when we told them we can expedite this recovery for of candy but they would usually say yes because if it worked it was only and if it didnt it was only flash forward a couple of years customer of mine breaks the cmos battery mount off their mobo get my hands on the computer pull the board get the rma lined up with the mfg just to see if theyll do it the mfgs normal turntime is weeks my customer was unhappy about this and i basically tell the customer that they only have themselves to blame there are definite perks to being your own boss i have a brain wave and think it cant be only bigboxstore employees who like free candy so i toss a big bag of assorted candy into the box and ship it off days later i get an email from the mfg theyve received my rma next day i get an email saying my board is on its way back next day receive bnib motherboard holy shit it totally works customer is beside herself to get the computer back so fast and i was stunned later that year i have a watercooled rig die the pump blew catastrophically psu gets flooded with coolant nonconductive and its the only thing that dies probably from the pump blowing this time i decide to document it get the rma lined up with the psu mfg and send it out with a big bag of candy and a friendly note comes back a little over a week later with a brand new psu even though mine got soaked a different customer has a psu that dies from a dr pepper getting dumped through it luckily the psu caused the dr pepper to redirect out the back of the case and nothing else died send it out with candy and a friendly note gets rmad without issue i even get an email thanking me for the candy so seriously guys lets make sending candy out with stuff the norm as most of us know it is pretty thankless so getting free candy is a pretty great way to treat each other better because a little bit of candy goes a long way edit thanks to the person for the gold ive never gotten any before
i worked on a project running two different systems at different security classifications so the users had two machines and two monitors one for each machine we received a call from a user stating that they were not able to copy and paste files the user was right clicking gt copy on the mouse on one system unplugging the mouse from one machine plugging it into the second machine and then trying to right click gt paste 
so i worked as a repair technician for a couple years we had contracts with local schoolsbusinesses that had company phones computers tablets and other tech devices to provide tech support andor inhouse hardware and software repair one day we got a call from a man saying that he accidentally forgot to take his work phone out of his pocket before he jumped in the ocean now if youve ever dealt with liquid damaged devices you know how dodgy they can be as far as getting them back up and running sometimes theyll get a drop of liquid in them and will never be able to come back on while sometimes theyll be lost at the bottom of a lake for a week and all you have to do is dry her out and put a new battery in and it works good as new so this guy calls and i tell him the procedure do not try to turn it on or charge it immediately power it down and take out the battery and let it sit for one to two days ampnbsp guy ok i can definitely do that also i read online that putting your phone in rice can help water damaged phones me nothing is guaranteed when it comes to wet electronics but rice can absorb moisture pretty well which is why sometimes youll see it in salt shakers in diners guy seems kind of strange but ok ill bring her in in a few days ampnbsp couple days pass and a man walks in to the front counter holding a large looking object we have cameras that display their view from the back where the work benches are i think maybe some guy wants us to fix a printer or old computer or something i walk up front and recognize the mans voice as the one who jumped in the ocean and i immediately think oh for fucks sake ampnbsp guy well i read some stuff online about keeping your phone in rice and i couldnt imagine how that would work huh well i guess you let the tech guys keep doing tech things ill tell you what keeping this thing plugged in for two days probably ran my electric bill up a bit he proceeds to open up a rice cooker steam pouring out of the top as if he just unplugged it and fished out his phone from the bottom of a inch deep sea of steamed rice with a pair of tongs ampnbsp tldr guy gets phone wet looks online for help says to put phone in rice guy puts phone in ricein a rice cookerfor two days nonstop ampnbsp edit wow i had no idea this would get this much recognition thanks reddit just wanted to clear up a couple repeated questions no the phone did not work we tried to save it but we were ultimately unsuccessful funnily enough we actually saw that the most damage inside the phone as some of you pointed out was from the ocean salt and not the continuous steam saltwater leaves a very specific type of corrosion on the electronics and if anything the steam and pressure may have actually washed some of it away albeit causing many other problems in the process yes the old uncooked rice trick does actually still work does it work very well meh are there better options absolutely if youre in a pinch and dont have quick access to silica gel packetssilicabased cat litter or a repair shop then its your best bet against saving anything yes this story is real you have to understand the sheer level of incompetence that people still have with computers which even though theyve been in peoples homes for years we still get all of these horror stories in rtalesfromtechsupport now translate that to smartphones tablets and laptops which have been around for less than half of that youd be shocked at the things we saw every single shift weekin and weekout this one was obviously the most insane and was the first to come to mind but dont worry i have more stories to tell whenever i get some time after work ill try and write up some more cheers
okay this is by far one of my fav stories and i tell it at work often as a tale of woe and caution the scene my retail that also does tech support for our stuff store sunday afternoon about thirty minutes before close the players and yes the details are important tsv me a size chick darren customer easily muscled guy looks like the stereotypical bodyguard sort with his black on black suit shaved head etc guys biceps are as big as my head jeff coworker playing captain of the ship in the tech area the game dialogue is paraphrased but the gist is correct so im doing my thing fixing user error issues the occasional software restore and so on oddly quite for a sunday but whatever jeff hey tsv do you think you can take one more before you go i was supposed to be off the floor in about five minutes to go do some paperwork that was actually done so yeah i could tsv whats up jeff got a guy with a phone that was broken needs to replace it no appointment tsv sure bring him on jeff brings over big guy huge guy from my pov i firmly invite him to grab a seat as its the only way i can look him in the eye for those that dont read my retail stories im partially deaf so half my hearing is lip reading tsv hi im tsv dude darren not real friendly but not pissy tone tsv nice to meet you darren jeff tells me your phone was broken sorry to hear that lets get you set up with a new one okay yeah this is how the company makes us talk darren kind of nods pulls out the phone now this model has a glass front and back both are shattered total spider web he hands it to me and a quick look shows that it wont turn on and the external liquid tags are screaming red yeah its dead time to bury this dog tsv i need to take this in the back for just a moment okay darren nods again and i notice that his lip is shaking dude can hulk smash me like a fly and he honestly looks like hes about to bawl over a phone wtf so i make quick work of going to the back popping the back off the phone get the serial and look up the warranty and part i put the phone back together as best i can pop out the sim and put the unit in a static bag for the moment in case any glass decides to pop off back to the floor i go tsv okay darren i was able to get the serial and my system shows that you have warranty thing so a replacement is just since you have att transferring your number will be a breeze since its on the sim card i have you out of here in just a few minutes darren okay pulls out his wallet and hands me cash what about my numbers and photos and stuff can you get those tsv i hate this part it never goes well unfortunately the phone is very water damaged and wont power on so theres no way for us to retrieve any information i brace myself for the yelling darren my wife is going to kill me shes an ex seal shes good at killing people when she needs to shes going to cue a swear word filled rant that would make colin farrell blush mostly directed at himself some at the universe in general darren im an idiot she told me to back up the photos she said folks phones get stolen in vegas all the time she kept nagging me so i said i did it shes going to find out i lied and they will find my body in like a hundred pieces i get him to calm down and tell me the whole story half out of a perverse interest and half because he clearly needs to confess his sin and im the priest hes not yelling or anything so okay ill listen darren is ex military and the last of his buddies was getting married so as a bachelor party they went to vegas for the weekend its not uncommon as we are in la you can drive up pretty easy or find a cheap flight almost any time the night before they were out drinking etc and the phone took a drop into a stone bottomed fountain now why was darren so flipping out it wasnt over the phone but the data see darren was the generally happy father of a baby boy a three week old baby boy who popped up a little early so the mother in law came to help mom so darren and the boys could have their party how nice etc but before he left mom had reminded him to back up the photos the only photos of darren jr to the computer in case something happened to his phone she had reminded him several times but he was too busy thinking about vegas to be bothered and yes darren told his wife he did it and now she was going to kill him having seen darren im a tad worried about a woman hes scared of now our company has a backupsync service that if all goes well will save your stuff nightly i figure whats the harm in checking if he had it on theres a part of it that does save photos although its not on by default i dont tell poor darren about it because i dont want to get his hopes up darren finally out of steam oh well its my fault time to face it like a man tsv thats the spirit your wife will be mad but im sure she loves you and will forgive you after a lot of grief of course this actually gets a chuckle and hes only a few weeks old you have plenty of time for taking more photos darren yeah not quite convinced hes not a dead man i ring him up for the phone power it on get to the screen for him to log in at this point he just thinks hes setting up the new phone like normal and what to my wondering eyes do appear but a backup made the night before his trip tsv well thats interesting theres a backup listed in our system for your phone last updated thursday night darren i dont remember doing that tsv you probably set it up when you first got it that was months ago so its easy to forgot plus it runs on its own so you dont have to do anything other than plug your phone into power it might just be contacts and notes but why dont we try it cant hurt darren okay if you think we should tsv knowing the camera roll is on by default if full backups are i do jump ahead about five minutes and the phone reboots to load whatever it just downloaded darren hey all the apps i had are there tsv waiting to download but it knows what to get darren if it knows that could it have my photos tsv lets look he taps the gallery app darren those are my photos old photos wait those arent as old those are the photos you saved my photos you saved my life darren is so thrilled he jumps up and grabs me and hugs me remember hes got a foot and a good hundred pounds on me so he literally lifts me off the ground in the process i thought my lp guy was going to explode darren realizes about a split second later he probably shouldnt have done that and puts me down and steps a noticeable space back he thrusts his hand out to shake mine darren you just saved my life literally my wife is an ex seal tsv so you said im glad it worked out now be sure to back up those photos when you get home darren yeah i learned my lesson im never lying to my wife again tldr

 every year every darn year they host a christmas party as i walked onto the executive floor i wondered how i got roped into planning the yearly christmas party i remember being in my office then a nice lady stopped by to chat about the christmas plans then suddenly im on my way to planning meetings if i were not a man of science id say it was witchcraft the nice lady saw me walk in the meeting room door gtnice airz you made it gtme yeah about being on this committee gtnice im so glad you joined we can work together to make this the best christmas party ever as i wondered how you could have a committee with only two people i looked into her eyes they were hypnotic it was odd nice too gtme oh cant wait i smiled it felt odd to smile without coffee nearby gtnice what should the theme of the party be gtme theme theme i had no experience with parties usually i expect a fully stocked bar some music and perhaps food theme was an entirely new concept gtnice it would be nice to have a theme that way everyone can dress up gtme oh i looked into her eyes again the stared back at me expectantly unlike coffee they actually wanted something from me gtme how about prince and princesses or just a color maybe everyone could come as their favorite drink gtnice no no they all seem to generic i want something fun something new she started staring at me again gtnice oh my gtme what gtnice we should have an it themed party gtme it theme gtnice everyone can dress up as computers or printers you can judge peoples costumes since youre an expert on the subject gtme haha maybe we could think of another idea gtnice i really like this one i think itll be a winner i looked at the nice lady she seemed genuinely excited i could have said that a company filled with users like ours wouldnt appreciate an it themed party but the words got lost in her eyes gtme er if you think so gtnice great youll be an awesome judge although as a host you better have the best costume as she poked her tongue out teasingly i felt an emotion bubbling up from the inside it was warm is coffee an emotion 
im an information security consultant telling some clients what they need to do or implementing those solutions i did an risk assessment around years ago where we looked at the standards they were trying to meet scanned their networks for vulnerable machines and looked for missing controls and weak practices anyway we found a bunch of high vulnerabilities validated almost all of them made a detailed report with some recommendations which we offered to do for them as an additional engagement i went on to another engagement then another firm and forgot about them until this week my cell phone rings i answer and get a barrage from it director andy and compliance director cheryl its not unusual for me to have impromptu calls from clients where they expect me to know them by voice so i often listen and hope to figure out whats going on and who it is by context seconds into the conversation i figure out the client im torn between telling them to never bother me again and seeing if theres some current work to get out of them i figure its time to tell them that im no longer working for the same company and neither is my old boss andyfigures who should we talk to mewell the report should be self explanatory cherylcan you explain why the same findings came up in the tests from this year methat could be that you didnt remediate the issues andythats why i cant stand consultants we do these tests and nothing gets fixed mei was thinking the same thing why arent you fixing anything cherylwhy we fixing things wasnt that your companys job meer no we likely suggested that you fix some stuff we most definitely offered to implement our suggestions but you decided to save money and do it yourself then you likely decided to save time by not fixing it at all i figured there wasnt much chance of getting some business out of it so i ended the call 
i work as tech support for a webhosting company the other day my coworker one of those cornfed country boy type guys was taking a call from a customer who was complaining about his website loading slow and having php and other syntax errors web coding is not in our scope of support we just support the servers and hosting not web design issues btw all our servers have identical specs and run at blazing speeds customer your server is slow and makes my website run slow i want to be moved off my crappy server and be put on a better one tech well you see sir our server is like a bucket customer tech well we provide you with a bucket its scrubbed clean sturdy and doesnt have any holes in it what you put in that bucket is up to you if you take that bucket and fill it full of poo you cant come complain to us that you have poo in your bucket we didnt poo in it if you take your bucket and dump it into another bucket even if its a bigger bucket its still going to have poo in it if you request it we can dump out the bucket clean it and give it back to you empty but its not our job to turn your poo into gold he noted a little later he was contacted by quality control who had listened in on his call although that was a good analogy we would like to discourage comparing our customers content to poo i thought he did a great job edit fixed a typo edit march an update on this bucket guy has been promoted to supervisor

 friday midday the bigp smiled at the room as he announced his latest project i looked in horror at the powerpoint school mentor program i reached out to the water in the middle of the table and poured myself a cup remembering id already said no to the idea i started to relax gtbigp this year the school has given the children a choice in profession i looked around the room and saw the head of hr beaming with delight i decided to sit back in my chair and slow sip water gtbigp we offered the children places in hr sales cleaning the bigp droned on about the different opportunities hed offered the children i started to zone out water didnt have the same focusing abilities as coffee gtbigp all that being said the bigp paused for dramatic effect even i decided to tune in again gtbigp these are the positions the children picked a graph presented itself on the screen each department was listed out in a table with the number of children who wanted to go to it in a column next to it i read the first line of the table hr i looked over at the head of hr she wasnt happy i feared she may cry reading the second line of the table cleaning i was a little confused a child would pick that i guess people like different things though it wait what my glass of water started to shake gtme oh bigp these are just the students choices right gtbigp oh yes three students selected your department so thatll be quite a handful i tried taking a sip of my water but it wouldnt stop shaking gtme im afraid it cant have kids around were a little too busy gtheadhr nonsense ill come down and help if you need the extra hands i looked over and caught head of hrs eyes they looked pleadingly at me gtme i think perhaps we should make those kids pick again or send then to hr it isnt really a good environment for kids its very boring gtbigp nonsense look how quickly youve taught redcheer youll have those kids writing programs by the end of the two weeks the sound of redcheers name had made the vp look up in alarm gtme two weeks i thats so i tried to take a sip of water to calm myself before continuing my hand however had revolted gtme i dont think children and it mix so i dont think i want them in the department vp looked sneeringly from the other end of the table gtvp kids are great with computers if youve any trouble headhr will be right down to help dont worry gtbigp plus we wouldnt want to disappoint three children would we the bigp gave me a knowing look i decided not to respond i looked around the room head of hr was smiling directly at me vp looked oddly happier i sat annoyed with a glass of water

please excuse my formatting first post on this sub so a little background i am in no way considered an it guy i am just fairly adept at sorting through most issues and i have also picked up a lot from seeing my father do it work for some of his friends some of their problems make me cringe example being one of his friends downloads everything he sees so i know my way around a basic set of issues and as such i have become the resident it guy for my floor now for the story i live as a freshman in the dorms on campus and despite being on a floor full of honors students many of them are more inept with tech than my grandmother one day a guy from my floor who will be referred to as fm came to me with an issue i havent seen before and ive seen some pretty dumb things note that he is adamant that he can do anything so he googles bings he uses ie too all of his issuesyou can see where this is going gtfm im hoping you can help me with an issue i had recently i tried to fix it but it didnt work gtme sure whats up gtfm well my laptop was running really slow recently and i tried a fix i saw on the internet but it didnt work gtme preparing to run all the malware scans what was the issue gtfm my laptop about years old was running really slowly so i tried something recommended on the internet i poured water on my keyboard gtme what why in the world would you do that you are smart enough to know that water and electronics dont mix gtfm but people on the internet said it worked gtme ok just let me see your laptop and maybe we can fix this he then proceed to bring me his laptop and hover over my shoulder as i cleared my desk of arduino parts and immediately remove the back plate of the laptop and looked inside he was shocked to find out that laptops can come apart what i saw was a ton of dust and no moisture and looking at the front of the laptop i notice that on the surface of the machine there was no way for the water to get down into the internals because the keyboard is one solid unit at least where he poured the water i told him i would need a few hours and he will have his laptop back in full working order after he leaves i take a can of compressed air i had and blew out a massive amount of dust put the backplate back on and went about finding his slowness issue after running a malware scan i found a massive assortment of malware its like he clicks on every pop up he sees and agrees to any download and after it was all cleaned off the thing ran x faster than when i received it who would have guessed i then did him the favor of hiding ie and installing chrome where i set google as his homepage he should be much happier now with his working machine i also set a password that he got to pick for windows because he didnt have one after he got it back he went happily on his way to continue his netflix addiction without even saying thank you i should start charging people edit holy crap this post blew up didnt expect this for a tale of idiocy edit i am amazed that my halfassed untrained it work has received over upvotes thank you tfts edit holy crap thank you kind redditor for the gold

its monday morning i am in early to set up a bunch of noobies with their fancy corporate gear im usually very prepared and have kit ready to go by thursday eveningfriday morning at latest however thanks to bmfh our longstanding policy known to all department heads of it requiring weeks notice of any new starter so we can obtaining and set up new gear is summarily binned of course i find this out friday evening and need to scrounge up four new laptops and get vodafone to live up some sim cards double quick for delivery monday morning im literally imaging the final machine when my induction group enters the room ive had no time for tea or coffee yet im expecting salvation from a sympathetic coworker at any minute still best foot forward i meet my delegates with my usual optimistic smile and my welcome aboard handshake only the air is about to darken the familiar stench of putrid an old woman with too much perfume enters the room she walks straight to the back of the training room and takes her seat next to a young woman out of the corner of my eye i see the young woman attempt small talk to no avail i get started and im giving a brief introduction to the company it i cant help be but distracted by the icy stare of bmfh piercing me like a lazer as i duly hand out prescribed equipment to my delegates she watches my every move as i dart around the room ensuring everyone gets a new toy laptops in bags phones and chargers in the pocket its a little like christmas morning in my haste to get my lateattendees set up it seems ive inadvertantly packed the wrong chargers in by mistake after bringing it to my attention before i could get a word out bmfh hops to her feet to investigate the situation holding the end of the offending charger and staring at me she silences the room with an authorative well before even being able to offer either explination or promises to make amends she takes phone and charger from noobie and walks for the door with come with me after a solid dressing down i walk bmfh down to the stock room where she watches me hunt around in a spares box for any combination of phone and charger that would fit after rejecting my first three finds as unsuitable due to being slightly scuffed she demands i instead use my company blackberry as suitable replacement rather than enduring her wrath any further i oblige kitted with charger and wave goodbye to my lovingly customised toy of awesome we reenter the room like a freshly scolded schoolby i duly hand over the blackberry to noobie who feels mixed between oooh awesome this is better than that rubbish nokia you tried to give me and instant pity as she totally knew what just happened endeavouring to continue the induction my noobie starters felt compelled to keep any and all kitrelated questions to bare minumum not the most ideal situation im sure youll wager by the way where is that coffee we make it to bmfhs face looking like shes gnawing her teeth more and more throughout the session salvation the facilities lady arrives with delegates lunch and coffee blimey i need a coffee yeah bmfh has other ideas we break for lunch im making pleasant small talk with some of the noobies a standard tactic in making them feel comfortable with support the queue for the coffee jug disipates and i walk with one of the noobies to go get myself some salvation in a cup just as i pick the cup up bmfh appears by my side she again orders me outside she starts with stating how lunch is for the delegates only though no its not its been sop for god knows how long to have a working lunch with the new delegates to chinwag talk shop correct any misunderstandings whatever however new policy as of right now i need to return to my desk where bmfh will watch me complete some meandering tasks she has for me my coworkers are initially confused by my presence when i should be in induction but on seeing the redfaced snaggletoothed hellhound quickly understand she insists we look at the queues well ill look at the queues shell randomly point to various call tickets and demand why they havent already been dealt with this carries on for the next minutes after which i mention i need to get back to the induction for one glorious moment i thought i may have been off the hook as bmfh began wagging her finger at another lowly employee who had dropped a mouse on the floor back upstairs half the delegates have gone missing it seems that our departure to some had signified the conclusion of the induction a frantic runaround the various departments and minutes later we were a full team again still no coffee maintaining my professional demeanour against all odds i politely carry on with crm and best practices the crm training goes down like a slow slaughter every step requires clarification courtesy of bmfh like shes picking out every little thing and reexplaining it to the group a one hour segment turns into a two hour bloodbath and everyone has just run out of happy best practises i cover in seconds with theres a laminated card in your laptop bag about best practices password lengths etc read it good luck after the delegates have left bmfh decides to reel off at me what a terrible job ive just done and how if this is how inductions are performed its no wonder it support are a joke ok ive had enough three days of this b monday morning no coffee shes on her fourth cup i react i just said firstly it would have gone a lot easier if you hadnt had landed me with four delegates i wasnt expecting needing me to run around and scour kit up from somewhere secondly this is not indicative of how inductions are usually run at all and i resent your opinion that the support department is a joke oh no you ditint she exits with a calm and collected look yea ok i know it im fkd now and where is my damned coffee the coffee i ran into mr sureillbringyouacoffee no good lying git coworker who i thought had my back i just said dude you said you were going to my sentence was cut short when he gave me a complete insight into the mornings proceedings after helping me haul ass scrambling some extra kit together he had taken my cup from my drawer filled it with some lovely hot brown coffee and was on his way upstairs but unbeknownst to him he was being hunted as he turned for the stairs the bmfh had towered in front like a blackclad ss officer standing in front of a little girl in a pink dress demanding to know where this coffee was headed this was where she had learned of the it induction in between dressing down my colleague for godknows what and observed him as he duly tipped away my lovely coffee and placed my mug directly into the dishwasher she had decided that she had to be a part of this induction as i left for work that evening i knew i had incurred the wrath i knew something was coming what i dont know more of the same my job us iters are very dispensible my thoughts only revolved around one thing i need to get my cv in shape

one of my favorites my company deals with some highly complex software that is a huge pain in the rear to install and configure properly and can take several days to get it working properly with all of the servers db connections middleware etc so one of our more synapticallychallenged salesguys out in the field was due a new setup to use as a demo environment one of the techs spent a couple of days building and verifying the environment he does very thorough testing before shipping so he wont have to try to troubleshoot anything remotely shortly after receiving it salesguy calls the tech sg hey that new machine isnt launching the software properly can you fix it tech i tested that thing times before i shipped it did you make any changes to anything sg no i swear i didnt change anything i just turned it on launched the software and nothing happened will you take a look so tech logs in and spends a good hours troubleshooting after much trial and error he notices than an entire folder is in the wrong place what should have been in cappsoftware was now in cappsoftwaredata moved it back amp now everything is happy tech so i found your problem looks like a folder was moved are you sure you werent doing anything to the machine sg no way man they were down a level huh i bet the files probably just fell during shipping you should pack those machines a little more carefully

the elevators were not working the air conditioning was occasionally working the building manager was working hard all day although no results were ever forthcoming unfortunately this state of affairs was causing friction in the office work had slowed to a crawl it due to the lack of functioning lifts could only work on equipment on site this led to a number of extremely angry complaints mostly revolving around extended wait times gtsalesmanager how long the sales manager had a particularly harsh tone of voice it was like a death metal concert very loud and screamy i attempted to explain the problem again using my calmest voice she heard nothing after a full five minutes of continuously being cut off i hung up gtme ill probably regret that i mumbled to myself as i sank further down in my chair the list of current jobs was growing steadily it was larger then id ever seen it a knock at the door startled me out of my gloom gtpant suit boss the ticket list gtme its so long yes gtpant suit you know why pant suit went on to explain the current protocol was to put signs onto the broken computers since we could not move them back to the department apparently people were completely ignoring the signs using the broken pcs finding them to be broken and submitting another ticket gtme so how many computers are actually broken gtpant suit only about or so gtme just move them away to a storage room till we get lifts back pant suit seemed agreeable and hurried off to various departments to go hide the broken equipment i sat back in my chair and cherished the thought of hitting delete on so many tickets at once my dreams never came to fruition i got a call gtsalesmanager is this what you call a solution trying to just hide the problem the torrent of abuse that spewed down the phone drowned out all my hopes of a fun deletion party sales managers rage equaled that of a steroided man learning that his gym was closed for the day gtsale manager and dont think ive forgotten you hung up on me gtme listen sales manager didnt gtsalesmanager im not letting pant suit leave till you send someone up to fix the problem my efforts to explain that pant suit could probably fix the issue herself fell on deaf ears i heard in the background salesmanager ordering pant suit to sit and wait gtsalesmanager send someone to fix this now she hung the phone up on me a hostage situation i started trying to find the tickets sent from the sales department to make sure i had the correct equipment to fix it another knock at the door startled me for a second time gtmessy boy she was loud we could hear that whole conversation all the way out here gtme i think the aircon is out in sales again so theyre going a bit nutty gtmessy weird how everywhere else the air conditioning is broken but here its fine i laughed to myself as i looked towards the it plant room key alas the building manager had recently lost his copy gtme yeah weird gtmessy so i was wondering can i take that call gtme err theyre fairly mad gtmessy dont worry ill fix it messy strode out of the department with a confident smile i relaxed back in my chair reconsidering messy as an employee he did seem up for anything it was only a few minutes later that my phone started ringing gtmessy she wont stop shouting also i may have forgotten my tools i could hear the screams of frustration in the background sales manager demand the phone from messy who didnt even put up a fight gtsalesmanager he couldnt fix it says he needs to go get parts why didnt he bring them with him airz why im sick of waiting for it to get its act together these two cant leave until this is fixed gtme you cant hold people hostage just let pant suit go and messy will go get the parts itll be fixed soon gtsalesmanager let them go no send someone else up with the parts make sure theyre competent send redcheer shes good gtme redcheer isnt here gtsalesmanager still how long does a holiday take i didnt really know the answer to that redcheers idea of communication was to request leave with a question mark on the time period gtme what parts are needed to fix the computer gtsalesmanager do i look like a tech to you work it out she hung up the sound of the phone being slammed into the receiver made my head recoil that wasnt very nice i thought to myself looking around the office i considered just carrying up a new computer it wasnt worth it too many stairs i decided to just go face sales manager myself she had clearly gone off her tree after walking the flights of stairs and arriving in the office i realized the problem it was boiling everyone was boiling sweat was dripping from all the employees it was like working in a volcano fans weakly pushed air about the place hot horrid air wet towels were being liberally applied to foreheads ice had become a tradeable commodity gtsalesmanager finally took you long enough get to work salesmanager pointed at a computer with a broken sign my two techs sat meekly nearby gtme i cant i dont have the parts gtsalesmanager oh for goodness sake the sales managers face scrupled up clearly about to launch into another tirade gtme messy pant suit please leave and get on with your work gtsalesmanager theyre not gtme go i had cut off the salesmanager and waved them out the door messy who clearly had a thing for sticky situations wanted to stay but pant suit was pushing him out the door as i watched them leave salesmanager recovered gtsalesmanager i cannot believe this that computer has been sitting here broken for hours now is this what you call service gtme calm down gtsalesmanager no the sales department had stopped even in the boiling heat people seemed gravitated towards friction oddly salesmanager didnt continue she seemed to just run out of steam i could understand it was just too hot gtme now listen do you want the air conditioning fixed gtsalesmanager what no i want this computer fixed gtme oh we cant do that until we have the lifts working good bye i swiveled on the spot and started marching towards the stairs whispers of air conditioning and working swirled throughout the office as i walked away gtsalesassociate you can fix the air conditioner many pleading eyes looked at me like starved hyenas being offered a juicy piece of meat all hoping for one thing only the salesmanager didnt look hopeful gtme i can you just need to get the key to the plant room flick the mains switch on the air conditioner to on gtsalesmanager no it is useless and never fixes anything this computer has been broken for clearly mad with power the salesmanager went off on another rant about it and its flaws i didnt stay for its conclusion i pushed the door open and left when i arrived back in my office my phone was already ringing gtsalesassociate my manager has banned us from calling it but ahh where exactly is that mains switch i gave the salesassociate as detailed instructions as i could it was fairly distinctive after the call i sat back in my chair and took a sip of coffee no calls from sales anymore sweet my phone rang about half an hour later it was from the salesmanager i could hear the sounds of soothing air conditioning in the background gtsalesmanager sometimes people say things in the heat of the moment i got a little er hot headed you know gtme sure was this gtsalesmanager sorry about that whole thing an actual apology i hadnt ever heard one so i couldnt be sure i decided to be nice since shed given me the rare gift of an apology gtme im just glad youve cooled off gtsalesmanager so youll fix it when the lifts are working gtme thats the plan how civil i thought to myself i was almost tempted to go fix everything in that department now considering how much more reasonable salesmanager was being plus she did give me an rare real apology maybe i should fix all their stuff gtsalesmanager you dont happen to know where the switch for the lifts are do you nope nope nope nope

yesterday i got a work order from corporate telling me to call a store and tell them they are doing their invoices wrong the problem apparently someone in the store didnt know how to post invoices and was deleting them instead then called us to complain because their invoices were disappearingthe case had been sent up to corporate to investigate since l didnt see any obvious problems either so i call the store and let them know what corporate had found the person on the other line was the one that handles the invoices and she swore she didnt delete anything i remote into the server and theres an invoice waiting there to be posted i ask the user to post it so i can see what the issue may be she hit the d key the key that on this page is the shortcut for delete she thought it was short for displayit clearly says on the page d delete i had to work hard to keep myself from laughing while i was wrapping up the call but i did have a good laugh when i hung up 
first post so please be gentle i work for a large pc manufacturer doing technical support on contracts for business customers and the occasional end user and all of the systems that i support are business class last week i spoke to a customer out of pa who spoke exactly like rocky balboa he starts by telling me that his monitor on his laptop wont change brightness after more coaxing more info from him it sounds like he recently reinstalled windows sounds like a driver issue with the hotkeys i start to direct him to download the drivers and ask which version of windows hes running windows home basic now none of our business class pcs come with that in fact we offer professional on every one remember hes got the rocky voice gt theopholus sir where did you get this copy of home basic did your company require it for some reason or maybe school how did this happen gt rocky yeah well uh i got it and installed it myself gt theopholus why didnt you just use the version that came with the system windows professional gt rocky cause i use it at home its hard to argue with that logic at least it was just a driver and we got it installed and working 
working for the bigboxstore yielded enough strange issues that nothing surprises me anymore well computer related stuff doesnt i happened to be working the counter one day at the beginning of my shift when a friendly old guy fog brought in his fairly new desktop and said that it wouldnt boot up today and he was wondering if id take a look at it i plug it in and it fires right up he says you must be magical and leaves happy i like this guy already because whenever i dont feel like explaining how i fixed something to a customer i just tell them im magic he comes back a few hours later toting his desktop alongside him im now confused gtfog well i got home plugged everything back in and it still wouldnt boot up gtme define wouldnt boot for me gtfog well i push the button everything twitches then nothing no beeps no lights nothing this guy actually answered all my follow ups before i asked them he has to at least know something of computers awesome so i quickly hook it up back up and it boots like a champ i shut it down test the psu check for loose connections nothing its perfect its a year old ish and theres no dust no nothing i pronounce his computer fine and suggest maybe try moving the plug that his surge protector is plugged into either a different plug on that outlet or preferably grab an extension cable and plug it in on a different circuit because maybe theres something wrong with his houses wiring wouldnt be the first time i also add that if hed like we can send a specialist out to his house to diagnose it there but its x amount of dollars gt fog no no im going to get to the bottom of this gt me well if it still doesnt work and you have to come back bring everything you can with you surge protector peripherals monitor whatever you can carry its a slow day and this is a weird one i like weird he seems more than happy with this and leaves comes back a few hours later very end of my shift and bigboxstore is quite dead this time he has a cart filled with stuff and a grin on his face hes sure well get it this time so about minutes later weve got his whole desk wired up on our counter and a little bit of an audience my coworkers in their infinite boredom wanted to see the weirdness going on in my department so i start stepping through everything end to end everything checks out power strip is good power cable is good everythings plugged in hit the power switch twitch what the hell so i unplug everything except the power cable and speakers from the back of the computer and plug in my trusty kvm on the usb only since it worked earlier it boots up hear the windows logon sound shut down using the keyboard plug his monitor in boots up plug in all his usb peripherals boots up plug in his ps keyboard twitch what in the actual hell after im done scratching my head i run my hand down the keyboards cable theres a nice warm spot right on a discolored bend in the cable gtme you wouldnt happen to have a pull out keyboard tray on your desk would you gtfog howd you know gtme theres a short in the cable right here point to the bend have him feel the warm spot direct quote gtfog well ill be a mother fucker you are magic because id have never thought of that i crack up laughing because friendly old people are the best pack up all his crap sell him a new keyboard and send him on his merry way tldr customer is a motherfucker and im a sorcerer
i arrived for work the next day this time fulfilling my mornings requirement for coffee before leaving the house i was on the late shift so i could afford the luxury of adding breakfast for some reason i was unpreterbed by the events yesterday offered i arrived to find a deathly quiet it department sadly i had begun to expect this when angie had imparted her usual words of wisdom on some poor unsuspecting fool i duly logged into my pc fired up touchpaper and began the arduous task of setting up some appointments for the day i was surprised to hear a new type of noise from angies direction rather than the snarling voice of satan demolishing yet another soul or the heavy bleak silence that accompanied her stare there was banter and the sound of humans talking i looked over to see angie discussing in depth the virtues of a nearby starbucks with some finance hag on the one hand we were all pretty shocked that angie seemed to be demonstrating a more human side to her character though given her affiliation with finance hag see it support and finance were situated directly next to each other some time ago we had all been segregated into offices beautifully adorned with departmental monikers which happily contained our respective messes and existances at some point some middle manager in a fit of synergetic genius decided to implement an entirely openoffice strategy and had all walls removed as far as i can see it served to merely underpin the adage of good fences make good neighbours and that destroying the efficiency of aircon in the height of summer only adds to tensions finance had repeatedly become irritated with its occasionally walking through their area as they would usually have varying currencies hanging around for traveling business reps it seemed walking even near their area was suddenly deemed a security risk and were constantly angered by the fact we had a lot of foot traffic and a lot of equipment which invariably made its way to us really it support does not suit open office especially next to finance hags suffice it to say there had previously been a blowout and it support were mandated by up on high to keep a three desk distance from any finance team members a problem as they were forever encroaching on our space with temps filing systems and new layouts meaning we had to constantly move and shrink simiarly they had enforced a threepiece rule whereby you could only have three pieces of equipment on your desk at any time as the average monitor and system unit accounted for two of these you can imagine what a struggle this was should anyone show up with a non functioning laptop and accompanying projectorhome routerprinter our constant commandering of any postroom space and the need to create a pcden in the stock cupboard was a testament to what a poor relation it support really was in the company though our jobs were now more difficult in that we had to maintain a presence outside whilst actually getting to work in a cupboard was a constant struggle we all remained cooperative and chipper in our existances nevertheless angie was evidently on first name terms with finance wench with pleasantries exchanged off they set to the local coffee emporium to embark on their selfmade challenge of attempting every single combination of coffee type they could think of not forgetting the ominous stare at support personnel as she passed finally the coast was clear we could take a breath being the last one in my colleagues were quick to ask jon have you read your email yet well no actually and there it was retribution the storm of the bmfhs reign was upon us angie had decided that during the course of the day she would be performing ticket reviews on an individual basis middleaged family guy mafg was on the early shift he had obviously already been the meat grinder angies special treatment of course we were now fixated on his response to find out what went down it soon became clear when he relented and maximised his ie window to reveal several jobserve results wow it went that well then mafg wasnt a slacker not by a long shot in fairness there were slackers but he wasnt one and it looked like the wind had been knocked well and truly out of his sales he began to tell us how angie had spun her web she had a printed list of his open tickets and several examples of his closed tickets she had initially allowed him to dig his grave so it seems with a few innocent cases until launching into an allout pincer move to demonstrate terrible goings on within his daily work this invariably was forcing him to reopen old tickets she was dissatisfied with despite no suggestion from the customer of that being the case thats when it hit me as he talked about the meeting the fact that things were printed angie has no idea where the printers even are the fact that she was able to search the ticketing system for tickets at all its obvious there is a mole thats all there is to it someone here is working against us all someone had to have provided angie with a method of retrieving closed tickets someone has to have shown her how to use the printer the cloud of suspicion was very much there i knew it and i could sense maybe some others knew as well is there a traitor in our midst after our team postmortem of angies impact to date we were left deflated and totally unmotivated we returned to stare into the bleakness of the computer monitor hoping that salvation lay within i duly opened my outlook calendar sure enough jon tickets review at right at the start of my designated rotad lunch break ok angie you foul smelling b its on 
so did this really happen yes this is an asaccurate as i remember account of a bitch manager from hell that i endured over a month period the story indicates a much shorter timeline but i only have time for so much writing in reality angie micromanaged to death several its initiatives cost a few people their jobs and was an overbearing terrible person all of this led to her ultimate er promotion how many parts are there going to be to be honest i had no idea when i started writing how many parts there would be i just started initially thinking parts at most as i found people started enjoying it i just wrote more in truth angie was such a nightmare that if i took to time to recount every single thing she did there would have been near on parts at some point given i have other commitments to adhere to this needed to end sadly i decided to steer my writing towards the ultimate conclusion of angies reign are you a writer nope not professionally ive never felt compelled to sit down and write anything this novelistic before ive been writing lyrics for years and used to trying to fit syllables to beats restrained to only a few available lines to get the point across i play metal though so like anyone cares about the lyrics so long as theres a few cleverly picked crowd pleasing lines respect walk i suspect he is in reality british yep sorry about that why didnt you just quit it had been my third it support role in reality theres no such thing as a nice it support role theyre all disturbingly hostile places to be and i would urge anyone to get out as soon as possible its a slow suicide by telephone my take on it support is that it is the one area thats simple to get into but difficult to dig out of managers like angie are just all too common in this field if i had just quit as i managed to prove to myself when i did change jobs moving from one deadend support role to another resolves nothing its just the same thing different place go to her boss explain how shes impacting negatively on productivity and on your teams mental health there is such a thing as crapping in your own back yard no upper manager wants to be bothered by some troublemaking runt from some lowend support role going on about how much he hates his boss its a fast track out the door i can assure you the bbc should just go ahead and turn these into a show hahaha i am open to offers i would have flipped my desk and said fck it im done i am amazed with your amount of patience throughout this matter i was brought up to be very patient but the fact i had a mortgage to pay a car to keep running various other responsibilities i couldnt be that flippant about it i dont understand why the entire department doesnt walk out that would get the attention of angies superiors this is a rather hollywood ending but the reality is everyone has bills to pay id wager such a bold move would fall foul of its forerunner when this reality would dawn on everyone in truth we were all jobhunting though seconds do i owe you a new spring for your f key i love you jon awww shucks if this series ends up with a treefiddy joke ill be both angry and impressed you dont know how tempting this was to put up even for just five minutes though i hope it didnt end that way for you so just to be clear this all took place in the midlate s and jon was at the time correct its safe to say i was about and this was around i dont want to say much more than this though anonymity and all how does it feel to have so many people hanging on your every word jon odd but im pleased i provided such entertainment and i hope i didnt get anyone in trouble with their bosses i feel like chelle at the beginning of portal all that hard work and the feeling of victory at escaping the inhuman clutches of glados only to find yourself back in the pits of hell once more the evil thing is still alive and kicking and youll have to deal with her all over again luckily i never crossed paths with her at all after that but its the one big lesson of the corporate world credit travels up blame travels down the higher you are the harder it is to fall guys guys we got to the end we did it we sure did my large diversion from doing coursework has also suffered im envisaging a very hard easter weekend ahead to catch up but ive enjoyed writing for you guys misogyny loses my sympathy i would hate to be thought of as someone who hates women for one theyre lots of fun ok i admit i had to google misogyny the correct british vernacular is male cheuvanist pig joking aside i feel an explanation may be required to this line of questioning my account describes the situation endured by all at that time i tried to paint a picture of the characters involved as best i could where you can define your own definition i would welcome you to do so in some cases my brief description of quiet blonde girl should be enough for you to paint your own picture however angie and her gang were such an uncommon abnormal collection i felt that to not describe their mannerisms and neurosis would have done them an injustice similarly rolands ratlike appearance just seemed to burn anyone who set eyes on him bhit i think was also subject to rather unrelenting description ive had some excellent female colleagues managers and so forth so i would hate for it to be assumed i have a problem with women in power apologies if

a tale from years ago back then i was still relatively new on tech supports senior staff at the telco i still work for nowadays here you can have on chatbased tech support in clicks and its pretty standard industrywide back then the company was just exploring the possibility of expanding beyond phonesupport and eventually orders came down from the vps office on how to set it up then my exboss told us what would happen with a frown a nicelooking portal would go live on our website but it would be just a skin for a irc chatroom people would come in write about their problems and some frontline staff reading them while simultaneously taking calls would direct them to either call tech support for the harder issues or type solutions if seemed like a quick fix gt colleague so there will be some kind of system put in place to ensure customers cant see each others requests and our frontline staffs answers right gt ex boss no just a irc chatroom with a skin we have to leave it wide open too its not like we can only let v people ask a question everybody in the room either facepalmed or stared at the table gt colleague you cant be serious gt ex boss i know theyll be chatting with each other and some will get angry and stuff but our staff will be in there and there will be a bot able to automatically kick for obscenities and such the directives came up from up above i cant do much and its just for a trial period gt bytewave could we at least moderate the channel and have customers first pm a moderatoremployee with their issue once they seem rational about their situation give them v gt ex boss no thatd be about as ineffective as using only pms altogether gt bytewave and whats wrong with that only using pms why would we want a chatroom where they can talk to each other gt ex boss the vicepresident expects that in a crisis such as a significant outage we can be substantially more effective users asking redundant questions will realize their issues are already answered and will gt bytewave okay sure in the best of worlds but this is not going to end well angry customers will work each other up therell be rants stuff will go public people will hold us accountable for things outside our control and im sure im just scratching the surface she basically agreed with us but it was out of her hands the chatroom and the web interface was being designed by internal it and the actual interactions with customers were to be handled by frontline staff below us tsss was simply supposed to help them with tough calls about chatbased technical questions but we all left the room knowing no good could come out of this some weeks later once this was live my boss came to my desk looking crushed after reading the piece of paper in her hands gt ex boss look there are a few customer complaints with the new chatroom some threat of a lawsuit other stuff can you look at the logs for the last two days and tell me if theres anything we need to be worried about one of our employees filed a grievance about it too theres also a redacted copy of that in this file so please send me your findings in writing and cc the union steward i was surprised that she didnt ask me to come to her first technically her request was perfectly proper but its rare that supervisors dont at least ask for a heads up before we send work product to the union so i guessed she wanted what would follow to happen i looked at the logs not surprised one bit how badly it went wrong customers were spending more time reinforcing each others belief that our support was horrible because they had issues than trying to get them fixed since theres all kinds of people out there and they are less inhibited in a chat room than they are on the phone there were insults swears all caps and even threats thrown around liberally i made a call and learned frontline staff moderating the experiment were still waiting on official instructions on how to react when customers were being abusive and that so far their instructions were only to escalate to legal any situations where criminal threats or admissions are relevant this was being treated like alpha testing even though real customers were on the other end and it was on our official website in short they allowed any disgruntled customer to visit an open chatroom where the moderators were supposed to let anything slide unless a customer issued direct threats moderate ill kill you but do nothing if they merely said i wish you die with our logo on top the time i spent looking at those logs truly hurt my faith in humanity i say this despite having manned frontline phones for two years the stuff in that chatroom was insane the employee who had filed a grievance had to deal politely with customers implying shed be sexually assaulted all over a hour network outage she had no control over because the threat was indirect people in there were at each others throats too like in any poorly moderated angry irc chatroom and then blamed us for the resulting chaos this thing had just been rolled out but even the early adopters went in there willing to lash out at just about anyone there were customers with rf issues threatening lawsuits in writing if we didnt fix it remotely even though their problems were due to unapproveduntested splitters in their own houses customers getting into catfights with each other because they wanted to do something whenever we werent responding quickly enough customers working each other into joint lawsuits plans at am when we werent around nobody had ensured the chatroom would be closed when the staff was offline employees threatened or mocked for adhering to the projects ridiculously strict policies even one instance of two customers starting to cyber in the damn public tech support chatroom the stuff i read in the logs made me lose my cool so i wrote one of the angriest emails of my career our union guarantees a fair degree of job security and my boss did specifically request i cc the union stew union employees have the luxury of being able to speak the truth to power without consequences as long as were right at least so late that night while being paid at overtime rates i spent two hours crafting a huge walloftext longer than any tale i ever published here i sent it to my boss the departments director the union stew the union executive and cccd the employee who put in that grievance calling the whole thing a farce amateur hour and a serious threat to both the corporations and the unions interests i generously copypasted lengthy parts of the crazy stuff written in that chatroom i knew i was taking chances by sending an angry email this broadly but it still worked out before business hours the next morning union execs had a talk with upper management and within the day the chatroom was offline and they were working things out including the grievance for almost two years afterwards we simply had no chat service once we launched one again it was strictly oneonone and serviced by dedicated employees who werent multitasking thats the only way to do it properly it shouldnt need to be said but never put multiple angry customers in the same chatroom before youve even had a chance to address their issues all of bytewaves tales on

 the afternoon started ticking away i wondered why afternoons always felt so much longer than their morning counterparts probably because i look at the clock a lot more it had been a fairly settled day so far id managed to convince redcheer that techs dont have any special programs she didnt believe me at first until i opened up cmd and typed help apparently having a lot of options in a black screen was techy enough my peaceful existence of staring at the clock was shattered when scarfy decided to shout my name across the workplace gtscarfy airz i got up from my chair the red haired lady stood up too we walked over to scarfy as a tech duo the red haired lady had a large smile on her face as she arrived at scarfys desk gtredcheer what can we do for you scarfy had a bewildered look on his face he wasnt sure what to make of this suddenly nice redcheer gtscarfy my er my scarfys eyes looked like they were attempting to calculate what was going on gtscarfy my computer isnt connecting to the network properly its got internet but i cant connect to other computers gtredcheer dont worry ill have that fixed in no time redcheer opened up cmd then typed in help she started reading the options gtscarfy im kinda busy airz can you just gtredcheer no i have to learn i stood behind redcheer scarfy looked nervous i decided redcheer reading the help command in cmd wasnt the best use of time gtme hey redcheer maybe you should look troubleshooting steps up on the internet gtredcheer mmmm might be quicker ill learn what this does later redcheer then clicked open the browser it had been minimized at the bottom of the page gtjob website gtjobs for designers redcheer stared at the screen for a few seconds she finally found the words gtredcheer wha gtscarfy look just i cant the both looked at each other i wasnt really sure what was going on the silence was palpable gtredcheer airz can you fix the rest of this i gotta go redcheer stood up and just walked away she looked oddly shell shocked scarfy looked at me as if waiting for something i decided to take redcheers seat and start fixing the computer gtscarfy arnt you going to go make sure shes okay gtme what i was confused however my confusion about why scarfys computer wasnt playing nice with the network was swiftly cured a second window was open behind the job search gtways to search anonymously gtten ways to make sure noone is snooping on your internet i looked down the list it was filled with terrible ideas gtme you didnt actually follow this list did you the first item was downloading a secure program the entire website looked like where viruss are born gtscarfy well i didnt exactly want to spread that i was searching for a new job did i i looked at the processes tab it had processes running yep it was infected gtme i think youve managed to get this pc infected itll have to be scrubbed gtscarfy before you start that go look for redcheer gtme huh she was here a second ago scarfy stood up swung his leg backwards and forward lightly into my shin gtscarfy go not wanting to get kicked again i walked away from the infected workstation when i looked behind me scarfy had a smile that said see told you kicks solve everything his eyes however only held sadness i never did get back to the infected computer i did leave a note for the returning tech though

so heres one i thought you all might get a kick out of a new guy started in my office a week ago he sits in the cube next to mine hes a vet and has served in iraq and afghanistan i think hes a nice guy kind of laid back for someone who just got out of a war zone he seems to know his stuff fitting in nicely well today im sitting in my cube its after pm which is considered after hours for most of our clients this is important because in some cases if we have to escalate an issue it wont be attended to until the next business day especially for one of our clients that has a no exception policy for some crazy reason with the holiday weekend that means something coming in tonight wont be addressed until at least wednesday so im sitting there wrapping up a ticket and i hear him catch a call he reads the script for our crazy client no exceptions and starts troubleshooting with the caller i hear him go through the steps and he decides he has to escalate the ticket he tells the caller that given the holiday weekend he may not hear back for at least four days just then i can hear the client screaming at him on his head set i stand up and i look at him hes sitting there cool as a cucumber fiddling with a rubiks cube while this caller screams at him he casually tells the caller this please ive been in iraq and afganistan ive had people trying to kill me every day for the past six years raising your voice to me like that will not get your issue attended to any faster i can put in an email to the head of the level department but if he decides you have to wait until wednesday theres nothing more i can do the caller seemed to calm down and my coworker just smiled thats alright ill send that email now have a nice day i learned something very important today you dont know how bad youve got it unless youve had your life on the line makes the stuff ive had to put up with seem so trivial now that and its possible to be a hardcore bad ass and still be polite and maintain your dignity 
hey tfts im a ltlftp i used to work for a walk in phone and tablet repair centre for koreantech and have since moved on to another line of walk in tech support but this story is about back then i frequently got strange customers and issues but this is one thats always stuck with me a customer walks in about half way through a standard day of work sits at my desk and tells me her problem well call her broken phone lady bpl bpl ive noticed that my phone has been getting really hot and slow recently can you fix it i tell her ill do what i can take her phone and scan her imei in to our systems to check the warranty is still valid when the system brought up the details of her phone i noticed two issues the back case of her phone is for the g model and has the logo of fruittelco yet the system says she should have the g model from oxygentelco i shrug it off and begin the physical inspection of the phone whilst asking her for more details about her use of the phone after talking with her i notice nothing out of the ordinary with what she was telling me but notice something didnt look right about the back of her phone the camera and flash seemed discoloured and the plastic was flat and missing details on closer inspection i realised it had melted uh oh me excuse me a minute im just going to talk with a technician i walk in to the back and bring the phone to my manager my mind went straight to worst case scenario and thought the phone could have possibly overheated intensely and melted the back after a quick inspection by both of us he tells me to go back out and ask if the customer was aware of the damage at all me weve noticed theres some melting on the back of your phone were you aware of this at all bpl oh i forgot all about that it shouldnt be a problem though me sorry what happened bpl a while ago i forgot i left the stove on and put my phone down when i came back to it the back cover had completely melted but that shouldnt be a problem i bought a new back cover i thank her for her honesty and inform her that her phone is out of warranty she took it suprisingly well and left without causing a scene 
so i originally submitted this story as a on the crack laptop and more than people thought i should submit it as a main story so here you go a few years ago i worked as a repair technician at a popular namebrand computer store and the specific store i worked at was in a suburban area wellknown for a high concentration of rich bitches and their rich dick husbands and rich twat children you may have seen a movie starring lindsey lohan that was based on the high school that serves this particular area one day a woman came in with a laptop this woman was fully deckedout in that particular combination of gaudy jewelry and namebrand clothing that is meant to tell the world im richer than you so shut up and do my bidding serf but actually it just screams i married my husband for his sixmilliondollar inheritance and now im blowing both the money and the pool boy i assume youre familiar with this type of person the type that thinks that listening or paying attention to directions is so clearly beneath her station in life that even asking her to do so is a waste of her time before she even got to the counter i noticed the snowboarding sticker on the lid of the laptop it stuck out because it was totally discongruous with the rest of her belongings so i wasnt surprised when the first words out of her mouth were i bought this laptop for my son most of these people would buy a laptop for each of their children by the time the kids were in middle school and the next words out of her mouth were and he says it doesnt turn on anymore the laptop was a year or two old and appeared to be in pretty good shape a little bit of scuffing no obvious damage but any time we had a computer without power we were supposed to doublecheck for liquid damage before we quoted a repair so i excused myself and took the computer to the back room and opened it up sure enough there were some remaining residue spots and even a few drops of water left inside the machine but thats not what caught my attention on that particular model the keyboard is built into the top panel of the housing so you have to remove the entire panel and keyboard to open the machine as i pulled the panel off and turned it over onto the workbench some little greenish flakes fell out of somewhere i looked closer at them they looked strangely familiar i took a hard look at the keyboard especially the edges around the keys where dust and hair get in more green flakes seemed to be trapped there so i took a can of compressed air put the nozzle up to the back side of the keyboard a ton of green flakes flew out all over the workbench i was starting to get an idea of what might have happened to this computer so i dipped my finger in the drops of remaining liquid inside the computer raised it to my nose and sniffed which confirmed my theory this kid had been smoking pot and i dont know if he was rolling joints on this keyboard or what but over the past couple of years he had managed to get at least an entire bowl worth of ground marijuana trapped in his keyboard and the spilled liquid that had fried his laptop in the end bong water nasty funky grody bong water i showed my discovery to the other technicians and we all had a good laugh one of the newer techs asked me so what are you going to tell her i thought about this for a moment this lady was not the sort of person who would react well to having a retail keyboardjockey tell her that her son was up to no good the more i thought about it the more i thought hell if this lady were my mother id be using every form of chemical escapism available to me too so my course was clear i blew the rest of the bits out of the keyboard wiped up the weed that was all over the bench reassembled the thing and took it back out front im sorry maam but it does appear that a glass of water must have been spilled near the laptop under these circumstances we do have to ship the laptop out to be fully rehabbed and it will not be covered under warranty the cost to get this laptop working again will be and we could have it ready in about a week she didnt even flinch she paid without hesitation i never told her what id found wherever you are bro i hope you survived high school tldr rich bitch mom brings in sons laptop full of weed and fried by spilt bong water i do the kid a solid by wiping away the evidence
while this is not official techsupport i figured you guys would like to hear a truly happy tale it involves technology babies and cookies so it has to be worth it at my firehouse we check and install child safety seats enter new parents well call dirk and amy and their adorable two day old daughter emma now dirk is not letting one iota of this childs first week go undocumented i can only imagine whats on the camera dirk had done an excellent job of installing emmas child seat in fact it only needed a little bit of tightening while i went over the paperwork dirk asked if he could use the restroom i showed him to the restroom and returned to the vehicle for mom and baby were playing happily mom took it upon herself to get the camera to take some more pictures of baby emma dirk returned from the restroom to see mom taking more pictures of baby emms sleeping honey the camera wouldnt take any more pictures but i used that format thing to make more room said mom all color left dirks face i honestly thought we were going to have to load him in the ambulance he broke out into a cold sweat and did everything he could to contain his panic that card had in fact contained all of the photos from birth until now for baby emma i thought the man was going to cry in fact upon seeing his reaction mom realized what she had done before this lovely couple started yelling at each other i told her turn off the camera right now i explained to him that the pictures could likely be retrieved even though the card had been formatted his response was one of incredulity he did not believe that was possible i retrieved my laptop inserted their sd card and proceeded to recover all but a couple of the photos from the birth of baby emma until their visit to the fire station using some sd recovery software id used before in the end marital harmony was retained baby emmas first days will survive in pictures and my whole crew was treated to a couple of boxes of thin mints and a half gallon of vanilla ice cream tldr mmmmm thin mints cookies and vanilla ice cream

 after seeing the demountable site offices that looked like mini caravans parked outside our main building walking in for my first day i was excited for the new year perhaps it would finally get the space it deserves i thought looking around at our cramped department getting to my office i relaxed in my chair however not a moment later the phone rang picking it up i heard the gruff seasoned voice of a builder gtgbuild is this it gtme yeah youve reached the head of it gtgbuild oh excellent i was wondering if youd connect up our site office to the internet for us i smiled at the thought of getting to see what was actually inside a site office gtme sure thing ill be up in half an hour i grabbed a long patch cable and cable ties while attempting to figure out the nearest network port upon arriving at the site office i knocked on the door silence greeted my knocks i attempted to open the site office the door swung open no one was inside the entire office was pitch black someone had covered all the windows with ply wood my hand reached for the light switch flick nothing no lights no power brilliant i sighed and tried to fumble my way through the office with just the light from the door it was impossible things were everywhere upon evaluation i decided it was too dangerous a task to climb over the desks and chairs in almost pitch blackness without a flashlighttorch i turned to retrieve one from my office walking into my office my phone started to ring perfect timing i thought gtgbuild yeah hello its the head builder again you said youd be half an hour its been forty five minutes and youre still not here whats happening gtme oh i was just out at your office there is no power no lights or anything gtgbuild were still trying to figure out how to get power for now we need internet working i started getting an odd feeling gtme im getting a torchflashlight so i can pass the cable into your office through the side ports without falling over gtgbuild cool can you get that done by lunch i wondered how long i could stretch out putting a cable through a hole and a window probably to next year if i really got my snail pace going gtme yeah grabbing my torch and wondering what builders were going to do with internet but no power or lights i make my way back up to their offices getting to the builders site office i realise yet again that no one is around odd i pass the cable through a hole in one of the plywood window covers and through a window of our main building and into a network port the end of that cable i plug into the switch that is sitting on one of the desks done i smile and sit down on the chair in my office job well done i thought immediately however the phone rings gtgbuild yeah its me again youve run a cable for the internet i see but it doesnt work for our systems without power gtme well it wouldnt the switch its plugged into needs power to run the internet however is connected gtgbuild seems useless without power i sighed into my phone this builder didnt seem that smart gtme yep gtgbuild youre in charge of getting all the it stuff working right gtme yeah thats generally our department gtgbuild okay well none of our it equipment will work without power so can you organize someone to come out and connect us up with power so our it will work i was close to just hanging up the phone gtme no gtgbuild but i didnt hear the end of that sentence the phone was already on the hook 
 as i walked away from my first job of the day i looked over towards the break area a steaming unclaimed cup of coffee was sitting on the bench did someone make it for me gtscarfy airz ooh can you come back and help me with the printer i looked forlornly over at the printer area my mind screamed at me to say no to anything to do with printers gtairz er ill just grab a cup of coffee then ill work out whats up with the printers gtscarfy oh that coffee on the bench is free one of the other designers made it for me you can have it a coffee still steaming is now mine i was internally screaming yes after i grabbed it i walked back over to scarfys workstation gtscarfy okay airz so when i print it gets this error do you know anything about printers i took a sip of my coffee it was instant i felt a distinct lurching in my stomach gtme oh huh would it be rude to throw away this horrible excuse for coffee scarfy got up from his desk walked over to the laser printer i followed him to the print area gtscarfy well even if youre not a printer expert ill show you what i do normally hopefully youll have some other ideas scarfy then lifted his foot off the ground swung it backwards then flung it forward with great force straight into the side of the printer the kick bounced off the plastic and made the entire unit slightly shudder gtme woah scarfy what are you doing gtscarfy sometimes a good kick and itll start working i looked down at the printer before me poor little guy hes been abused like crazy i kinda felt sorry for the printer just a bit gtscarfy well im all out of ideas so what would you do now the printer beeped helplessly up at me save me the printer was probably shouting at me gtme you know what scarfy you should get to downloading those files you wanted and leave this printer with me poor printer scarfy decided that was good enough for him and walked away i looked down at the struggling device lets see whats wrong with you the screen flashed an error code when i tried a test print printers were no fuss with easy to read errors gterror code xxxxxx excelent ill have the poor thing up on his feet in no time i thought as i started walking over to the computer search error code xxxxxx gt results general fault general fault how specific i started reading the various things that are usually associated with the error gt broken fuser broken rollers broken motor power fault main board fault clogged drum damaged drum feeder unit jam feeder unit general fault gearing jam oh for goodness literally the entire printer was listed under the general fault heading i realised id have to open up the poor guy and see what was happening inside printer maintenance not usually my forte scarfy decided hed come take another look at how the printer was going gtscarfy so any luck so far gtme er just narrowing down the things it could be i cracked open the paper feeder and opened the unit doors scarfy took a seat and decided he wanted to chat gtscarfy i had a printer at home once gtme oh what happened to it i looked inside i started spinning the drum seemed to spin okay gtscarfy well at the time i had a girlfriend and one time the printer broke i moved it off the desk and gave it a kick and that didnt work gtme haha you know kicking these things probably isnt great for the calibration usually doesnt help that much either i looked at all the rollers they all seemed to spin fine gtscarfy trust me a swift kick sorts out more problems then youd expect anyway the broken printer wasnt working and my girlfriend got really mad she ended up throwing it into a drywall massive dent in the wall pretty spectacularly though the printer didnt fall out of the wall everything inside the printer seemed to be working reasonably well i started putting things back into the printer gtscarfy i plugged it in though started working while lodged in the wall gtme sorry you saw a printer lodged in a wall so you thought ill just go plug that in gtscarfy i had a hunch plus it printed what we needed i put the trays back into the printer closed everything up and pressed test page gtme haha fair enough i was skeptical i looked down at the printer i had done literally nothing except pull it apart and put it back together the test page printed successfully weird gtscarfy i ended up leaving it in the wall the printer worked at that exact spot for a few years after that i clicked test page again gtme so it stopped working eventually gtscarfy well eventually it ran out of ink and when i replaced the ink and put the printer back in the hole in the wall it just didnt wanna work anymore the printer started letting off distressed tones i didnt know if it was a protest to the story of printer torture or an actual problem i looked down at the screen error code xxxxxx f 
or how i thought i was removing my own access before getting fired years ago i used to do outsourced tech support on one of the accounts i supported i administered accounts on mainframes and the applications that were on them most of the time we get requests from hiring managers or supervisors to give or revoke access to either the mainframes or an individual application once in a while well receive a request to revoke access for a user from an auditor ie employee no longer works but id is somehow still in the system etc so i was happily administerin along when i receive the following ticket gtplease revoke access to application for the following user prodigaltoast my id at the time i was more than a little worried the particular company i worked at was in the process of downsizing and layingoff staff the mood was quite gloomy during that period especially seeing our floor which once had tech support agents down to half that size so was i really being asked to revoke my own access and was this in preparation for firing me i hesitantly brought it to the attention of my team lead gtme ummm team lead can you take a look at this ticket gtteam lead sure hmmm just looks like a standard revoke request gtme take a look at the user gtteam lead uh oh ummm are you getting fired gtme am i gtteam lead i dont think solets have team manager look at this gtteam manager hmmmmare you getting fired gtme am i gtteam lead i didnt fire him gtteam manager im pretty sure only i can fire him i think gtme did you gtteam manager it would be a dick thing to do to make him revoke his own access before we escorted him out of the building anyways what do think we should do about this prodigaltoast gtme well technically i could just revoke my account and it wouldnt really change anything because i have administrative rights to the mainframe the application resides on i can just go reactivate my account whenever i need specific access to that application in the end this ticket is basically a minute waste of my time you know as long as im not being fired thankfully the ending was anticlimactic it was a pretty useless ticket and i assume it was because of some automatic audit thing but as an administrator i was exempt from those audits so i never really figured it out my notes for the ticket looked like this gtmy id revoked access to application for user my id gtmy id resumed access to application for user my id to confirm user my id had been revoked

several years ago i was running a to at a k school in the us to deployments mean every high school kid gets a laptop i was managing macbooks and servers as well as or so mac desktops at the time one day my boss calls me and the conversation goes like this boss hey zaphod we have a serious issue and you need to address it right now me ok boss what is this serious issue boss your coworker derpdaderpalot printed out the master password list for the local admin accounts and left it on his desk and a student stole it me grrrrreeaaat so basically i need to reset local admin passwords like right now boss yes drop whatever youre doing and do it now me no problem boss i will have it fixed with in the hour i hang up the phone whip up a script in bash to reset the local admin password but i make one fatal mistake in my haste i forget to output everything to devnull so everything goes to standard output ie the systemlog my mistake under pressure plus i thought no way a high school kid knows unix i find this out fix the script redirect all output to devnull and the password in the script stops getting logged so the password is on clear text but only on several hundred machines ok no problem i am going to send a command out to wipe the systemlog file and clean up my mess since to change the password i had to set a password in a script this was back in like and lets say now my scripting behavior is a bit different now during this small window some kid had been sifting through the console looking at every single log file somehow picked out a string he thought looked like a password and bam he had local admin access to the machines so i start doing detective work and use a dummy receipt system basically look for a file or string that exists and if it does touch another file to stamp it with a dummy receipt and then build a database of machines based on that file to see what accounts have been promoted to admin accounts sure enough this one students user account was synchronized to a lot of macs and sure enough his account was always being promoted to admin i gathered my evidence called the student into my office socially awkward kid but actually quite brilliant i asked him why he was violating the aup acceptable usage policy and that i had proof he was giving himself admin rights he broke immediately i didnt even have to threaten the kid he spilled his beans i asked him if he pulled the password form the log he said yes i asked him if he had ever used unix before he said no it was just figuring it out on the fly i told him i wasnt going to turn him in and that i will just forget the incident ever happened he asked me why and i said youre too smart to get expelled or suspended however you need to take your brain and use it constructively what do you want to learn the most on the computer he said he wanted to start a programming club and develop games in python next week i rolled down to the storage facility and grabbed a compaq dual xeon server with a raid controller and hard disks in it and like or gigs of ram it was one of those spend your budget money or lose it deal government am i right and they had been sitting there since i started working there so about years had passed and those servers had been collecting dust they had no os on it i come into his building with the server on a flat bed i said here is your development server here are the rules you cannot plug this into our network my network manager will shut this box down immediately do you understand yes he replied second rule this server has no os on it so you must choose what os you want to put on it and you have to support it yourself you cannot call help desk for help and it has to be legit either open source or someone buys an actual license i understand he said years later the kid graduates and gets a full ride to boston college he also wrote the advanced math curriculum his senior year he did a bunch of stuff in python and latex oh i also turned him into my mole every time some kid talked about hacking he would email me and tell me what they were trying to do i havent talked to him since but i bet by now he is graduated pretty smart kid hope he succeeds him getting expelled or suspended or even in trouble may have damaged his record which may have damaged his chances at a full scholarship mind you i was working for an impoverished school district a lot of families in that district were below poverty level edit fixed formatting sometimes it is good not being the iron fist ruling over authoritative dick head system administrator but sometimes you gotta do that to get your point across i was lucky enough to realize the situation and actually put this kids smarts to productive use i hope he has a bad ass job right now edit several of you have expressed interest in the fact it was an impoverished school district and they all got laptops let me explain to you how budgeting works in public education the state you live in sets a budget and according to your size and your location you get x amount of dollars every year now additionally you can get federal money as well on top of state money the budget is then broken down into categories you have budget for staff which covers their wages benefits and so forth capital outlay is the part of the budget you spend on technology desks renovations and so forth it cannot be used for salary the government does not allow you to do so furthermore the government has a thing called erate which i believe is regulated by the fcc it forces companies who join such a program to lower their prices for schools and allows schools access to technologies through this program the school i worked for which i no longer do work there decided they wanted to go to with macbooks being about a pop it wasnt too much out of the question you only have a little bit of savings with a desktop since you must also pay for keyboards mice and monitors and they require more power a laptop is plug the school was about buildings and students the laptop program was at the high school level only which was you have to realize a lot of these kids never even ate their first meal for that day until they came to school i grew up lower middle class and i thought i had missed out on certain things in life and that i was a bit under privileged compared to all the other kids i went to school with i didnt realize how selfish and self centered i was until i got this job i worked there for years running their laptop program i got a bike for christmas and while my family was unable to ever take me on international vacations or cruises we at least got to go to the lake for vacation these kids have nothing it taught me how privileged i was giving them a laptop is awesome sure some kids will squander their opportunities and not care sure some will just get by and not take full advantage of it but some kids will put it to good use and get full scholarships to good colleges and come out on top that right there makes it completely worth it edit it is possible the kid read this post i am not going to say who my employer was or where it was because i believe anonymity is the best i would hate to have anything backlash and reflect poorly on the school system i worked at plus now i work back in the private sector and have learned it is really just a professional courtesy to keep your mouth shut i will update if it was really him update the student in question has in fact found this thread and i have been messaging him via reddit i have told him i wont reveal his name my name or the schools name for anonymity reasons i think it is best kept that way he also reminded me of a few other exploits the students found and used which i forgot about the ard agent bug apples fault which allowed you to run apple script with escalated privileges ie sudo then we had a package that had a self healing auto update and i had to have one folder in that package writable bad developer and we managed application usage by file path so once students figured out they could drop games in this folder they did to remedy this i switched off the write bit in posix and then just download and repacked the whole package manually every time an update came out and just redeployed said package ill have to admit i was impressed by how adaptive and smart a few of the students were they made me pay for my mistakes plus it is impossible to test every aspect of security with out a security audit team that is why companies have and contract out it security people to audit such things i also changed my whole approach of imaging and managing the macs after a lot of these issues the student in question is finishing up a computer engineering degree currently glad he made it to a good school

 im at a consulting company doing information security stuff one of our customers is a regional bank theyve decided to take third party security seriously for the unfamiliar any large entity likely trusts third parties like vendors or business partners with valuable information or access so making sure those third parties are also secure enough is important the way this usually works is as follows our client sends the vendor a question questionnaire with yesno answers and spaces for more elaborate answers the client then selects or of these vendors for a site visit which usually takes hours since the bank doesnt have a lot of it or infosec staff to spare they hire our consulting firm ive been assigned a bunch of these visits fly out to city x sit down with the vendors compliance it hr and other staff ask them a bunch of questions walk through their operations and data center then fly home generally im not a typical auditor i realize that nobody does this perfectly what im really afraid of is the liar the shop that claims to have everything locked up tight and theyre really doing nothing that puts my client at the greatest risk so im in a city i never thought id visit like kansas city riverside california or conshohocken pa office parks midline hotels chain restaurants and rental cars the consultants life im auditing a company that handles fairly sensitive data for our client every question in the questionnaire was answered yes without much explanation thats a red flag i decide to probe a bit more metell me about your dlp data loss prevention solution head of complianceour it director can answer that question it directorwe use a best of breed solution it blocks all sensitive data from leaving our network mei realize that dlp systems require a bit of tuning to find the sensitive data that your shop deals with how long did it take to implement it directorjust installed it and went fire and forget methat sounds great what kinds of data does it block it directorall sensitive data meso social security numbers it directorof course mewhat patterns are you looking for it directorany that contain sensitive data memaybe my accent is getting in the way of clarity social security numbers are digit numbers usually written in sequences of then then are you looking for all digit numbers traversing your network or just it director looking annoyedall sensitive traffic is interrogated then blocked we get alerts methats amazing on all your networks including the guest wireless it director still annoyed and boredof course meok have you seen an alert for that should have traversed your network twice outgoing and incoming in the last few minutes it directorwhat mei emailed myself richard nixons social security number out of curiousity from your network maybe you should change the answer in the questionnaire on dlp to no are there any other areas youre not so sure on needless to say the rest of the audit was a bit more fun

many of the tales on this subreddit are stories of the frustration of clueless users shortsighted bosses and basically anything that arises from working in an industry where nobody else really understands what you do i thought id share a different sort of story the only time i really wasnt sure what to do ethically im still not completely sure i handled this properly but screw it im not going to bother with a throwaway i had several clients i supported longterm to the point where i almost became another employee these were engineering firms and while they didnt understand all the technology they understood the value of preventative maintenance taking care of equipment and the it itself was typically pretty lowstress some of the employees would request my services for their personal computers which is how this story starts im at one of my best clients and their senior engineer a man in his s approaches me ive known him for years and even met his family at a few company functions he has a few daughters and a son all in their s and s heres how the conversation went my son has recently passed away and id like you to help recover some of his files sir im very sorry for your loss what can i do to help when going through my sons estate the most recent copy of his will which was updated about years ago has a significant portion of his assets going to his best friend and not to anyone in the family we found some files on his laptop we cant open and thought they might have some clues as to why he made this decision maybe a journal or something we always thought we were close with him and are really perplexed as to why hed disinherit us the friend seems just as surprised sure ill be glad to take a look at it although depending on the security there might not be anything im able to do im thinking truecrypt etc no problem whatever you can do so i get the laptop and go home when i power it up i see in cprogram files are the files in question archiverar archiverar etc through about or someone had obviously been doing some digging who the hell checks program files for rar files anyway they vary in size from say gb to gb try to open them up and of course password protected as rars are known for their rigorous security i figure ill have this job done in minutes or less i grab some random rar password decryptor and get the password i open the files and theyre all filled with gay porn most of it is pretty vanilla but theres a little bit of light bondage and watersports no journals personal files or anything else just porn as i work my way through archives and i realize that the file names are all now john and i doing x not the names youd see from a porn site great so as i realize that im looking at the amateaur porn of a dead man who was obviously in the closet to everyone it dawns on me the friend was really the boyfriend which is why he was named in the will and for whatever personal reasons the son boyfriend dont feel comfortable coming out to the guys father even in death nows probably a good time to mention that im only at the time and that i also happen to be bisexual i was completely in the closet at the time i still am to my family so now instead of dealing with a simple file recovery im faced with lying to an important client about his dead son or outing a dead son and boyfriend with photographic evidence fuck i decided id pull the laptops drive and search for deleted files in the off chance the son had a note or journal or letter to his dad that might somehow help the situation i found nothing helpful it seemed that his computer was solely for web browsing online banking porn nothing helpful at all fuck i thought about it for a while and decided that the boyfriend was fully capable of disclosing this information if he chose to and that the son obviously wanted this information secure and that it wasnt my place to disclose it however this still left me in a tricky situation with the father i couldnt tell him sorry i wasnt able to open the files because hed simply find someone else who could and might not be as discreet as me somewhere down the line the boyfriend and son would still be out and the father would know the homegrown porn existed no i had to lie about it in such a way that the father would be satisfied and not pursue the issue i pick up the phone hello its paracelsus ive got some news really did you find anything a journal notes anything at all no i was able to decrypt the files and i could see why your son wanted to keep them secure it turns out that he had downloaded some bootleg software and movies off the internet its not a big deal but they can contain viruses and be dangerous to the computer so youd want to keep them protected id suggest deleting them or at least not trying to open them ah that makes sense my son was always really good with computers and i could see him messing around with stuff like that thank you for letting me know the last thing id want to do is try and open them and mess up his computer you didnt find anything at all paracelsus no sorry i even ran a fulldrive search for deleted files just in case there was something in another location i didnt really find any personal files at all wow thats thorough thank you for doing that how much do i owe you oh considering the circumstances nothing at all im sorry you didnt find what you were looking for and for your loss tldr i lied to an old man to keep him from finding his dead gay closeted sons amateur porn collection and kept the sons boyfriend in the closet in the process

 sitting down at my desk i contemplated the upcoming call two techs destroying equipment is a fireable offence however both were not on my payroll this felt like a call for the bigp but the vp is probably searching for a way to get rid of both because his budget would look better calling bigp was mercy calling vp was death i was the judge my hand hovered over the dial redcheer knocked on my office door gtredcheer sorry again about the whole hard drive thing gtme ive heard your apologies however i cant reprimand you properly because youre not on my payroll redcheer took a deep sigh she looked slightly upset gtredcheer screw up that bad huh i didnt know apologies again gtme well its not me youll have to apologise too i gotta call the bigp redcheers face looked disappointed in herself gtredcheer thats probably for the best perhaps i dont know enough about it to be helpful i looked over at the sad redcheer it seemed odd for her not to be smiling itsec walked up behind redcheer and stood at the door gtitsec er im really sorry too boss i didnt realise that wasnt a ruined hard drive i thought it was wrecked i should have checked gtme wait but if you thought it was ruined why replace it in the stack with a new one from your own collection gtredcheer that part was me to be honest itsec didnt have anything to do with it cant we keep him out of it i gave them a questioning expression as i looked between the sullen redcheer and the downhearted itsec quite the troublesome pair gtredcheer itsec showed me his hard drive drawer and told me if i ever wrecked a hdd to replace it with one from his desk he was just trying to help gtme i see gtredcheer so please airz ring bigp but leave itsec out of it its not fair on him my mind wavered between bigp and vp mercy or death 
we have a special user you know the type everything has to be functioning in the manner that they are comfortable with or else its broke if it takes more than a day they cc everyone including your mom talking about how unhelpful you have been and requesting more assistance for their major problem which it never is well they were having a major issue where a secure website was making her click two options in ie in order to load and this was disconcerting to her i create a chrome shortcut that loads the website normally because this is how others go to that site all fixed right i immediately get a message from her about how it is still doing the same thing i go to their desk and realize they totally ignored my message about the chrome icon and are still trying to use ie i show them where the shortcut is which was difficult because they have shortcuts on their desk but this is not acceptable because they dont trust google i dont like arguing i just want to fix shit so i go back to my desk only change the desktop icon to ie and wait sure enough i get an email thanking me for fixing their problem 
a few days ago boss contacted me about her sudden inability to export reports to pdf i strutted into her office as i am wont to do and asked what was up gt boss it goes through all the steps of exporting but when i export to the usual network path nothing is there ive tried restarting the program and the computer but it still doesnt work gt me all right lets try exporting locally maybe theres something wrong with the network the export dialog popped up on the screen for a moment and appeared to do its thing but nope still no report gt me i dont have this problem so lets log in as me and see whether that fixes it alas it did not at least wed confirmed it was isolated to one computer gt boss do we need to reinstall violins shrieking in the background gt me its likely something got corrupted so its probably the easiest solution just let me know when you dont need your computer for half an hour or so an hour or two later i was sitting in her cushy chair happily reinstalling software along with adobe reader just in case minutes later i was banging my head on the desk nothing had changed then i realized something the dialog popped up for a moment the software in question is a buggy as hell mess so its usually the first thing i blame for a problem its become a dangerous habit to assume any problems with that software must be caused by that software but what if gt me hey boss doesnt the export usually take a few seconds gt boss youre right now it disappears almost instantly gt me okay weve isolated the problem your export is messed up ill see what i can find after digging around for what seemed like an eternity i found the problem windows update kb a harmlesslooking little thing that supports azerbaijani manat and georgian lari currency symbols in windows apparently that little optional update causes crystal reports to have a stroke on pretty much every version of windows lt boss is running i uninstalled the update rebooted the computer and voila all good aside from the pile of my hair scattered across the floor anyway boss promised me a nice bottle of something for christmas as thanks yay tldr if crystal reports suddenly cant export to pdf run wusa uninstall kb from an adminpriveleged command prompt and reboot edit corrected some typos and inserted others

previous tales from dishonest used car dealershipusersubmitted gtyou gonna be out at your girlfriends this weekend gtyeah were having a huge party you should stop by its going to be rad the raver and i were in the break room at dishonest used car dealership eating lunch one scorching hot friday his girlfriend lived on an island west of the city far enough from civilization that they regularly had parties enormous enough to be sort of generally known among the weird misfit kids who hung out at the sketchy dive bars up on the hill with all the gay bars and strip clubs like i did after a couple incidents with people being creepy at their events including a young lady who pulled a knife and started waving it in peoples faces they had instituted a friends and family only policy to limit the number of randoms showing up of course this had managed only to increase the mystique of these giant events among the freaks in the city and in all likelihood there were even more sketchy people than ever invading the island on these occasional friday nights in the summer as for me im pretty solidly an introvert parties are not really my thing but having made it out to one or two i did have to admit they knew how to have a good time gttr how about you you seeing that photographer girl this weekend the photographer girl was a young lady i had gone on a couple dates with as you might guess from the name she was a professional photographer and quite a good one at that better yet she was a redhead who liked whiskey a bit too much and had a hot temper which is a pretty killer combination gtme yeah i got conned into going with her her friend and her friends boyfriend to some movie tonight gttr double dates yuck unless its going to turn into like something kinky count me out the image of a sweaty crystalhangingfromhisneck postcoital the raver in my head i decided i wasnt particularly hungry anymore and excused myself from the table gtme well i probably need to go back and clean up whatever horrible attempts at english colossal redneck has vomited onto todays invoices gttr let me know if youre coming last ferry is at midnight just remember this is a friends and family thing you know gtme got it gtuh your temperature gauge gtyeah it does that i was sitting in the back seat of an old forest green grand cherokee eyeing the gauge cluster nervously as we drove across the bridge from my weird neighborhood on east side of the lake to the core of the city where our evenings movie was playing the graduallyclimbing temperature gauge on the jeep kept catching my eye gtme thats not normal you might keep an eye on that these fourliters dont like to be overheated i tell you what if you like i can have one of my techs look at it and ill throw you the friends and family discount this was surely going to win some bonus points with my date offering a discount to her friends boyfriend gtthe boyfriend yeah well its fine its just cause its hot outside ill just add some water if i have to gtme yeah but even with it out it shouldnt be getting that warm ill bet you have a coolant leak somewhere its probably an easy fix theres a valve for the heater that cracks on these that will slowly leak coolant and its an easy job i had to do it on my own cherokee not that long ago gtthe boyfriend i know cars its fine gtme alright not to belabor the point but these fourliters like to blow head gaskets if they get too hot i just dont want to see an easy fix turn into a big repair you know gtthe boyfriend ive dealt with mechanics before all youre going to do is charge me to fix a bunch of things that arent broken and rip me off okay then my date gave me a look and rolled her eyes she leaned over and whispered in my ear gtphotographer girl hes a dipsht just let it go i nodded photographer girl had a theory that conversation between guys is less about exchanging information and more about establishing a domain of knowledge and skill where you can be the dominant party in the room the older ive gotten the more i think she might have been right by the time we got to the movie theater on the other side of town the temp gauge was pegged at the maximum of its travel as i bailed out the miserable stench of an overheated car wafted over my nose its a combination of a greasy gross smell from all the hot oil and a sickeningly sweet pancake syrup smell from hot ethylene glycol usually theres some melted rubber smell in there too its the smell of death we watched the movie and the movie was bad and i hate movie theaters and jesus christ popcorn is expensive but it was two hours of not having to talk to mr bad attitude so maybe in the long run it was worth it afterwards we all conspired and decided we wanted to spend the night out on the island at the ravers party so i got in touch with him to confirm our appearance we drove toward the ferry terminal but on the way someone in a lexus was apparently too busy chatting on the phone and managed to tag a semi bringing the whole freeway to a screeching halt we sat in the jeep air conditioning barely able to keep out the sweltering heat by the time we got moving again the temperature gauge was back at the top of its travel we managed to screech onto the ferry the boyfriend pulled onto the boat and we piled out by now the death stench was different hot grease but no sweet glycol smell in all likelihood the boyfriend had run his jeep completely out of coolant i thought about saying something but i suspected that my commentary would receive a similar response to earlier so i kept my trap shut minutes later and the ferry pulled up to the dock on the other side of the water the boyfriend put the key into the ignition of the jeep turned it and the poor jeep hesitantly started up it was making a sad noise to my highlycalibrated ear it was clearly running on five cylinders and the new vibrations coursing through the vehicle suggested the same this was an unhappy engine the only solace was that i was sure soon its suffering would be over we lurched off the ferry making it about five miles outside of town on some longforgotten side road before we encountered a steep hill and the poor old liter decided it just had had enough it conked out and we stalled and rolled back down to the bottom the boyfriend tried repeatedly to get the engine to start again but to no avail i went around to the front of the jeep and he popped the hood i was immediately struck with a wave of heat rolling out of the engine bay at the back of the engine bay i spied a small black valve with a conspicuous crack seeping green fluid as i suspected the heater control valve had indeed cracked slowly vacating all the engines coolant onto the ground i grabbed a rag and popped open the radiator cap to be greeted by only smoke and steam note dont do this unless youre one million percent sure theres no coolant or water in there you will burn yourself and die this engine was in the words of my colleague colossal redneck fckin dead the boyfriend tried filling the radiator from a gallon jug he had in the back but the sad old liter was having none of it i contemplated making the hike all the way back to the ferry terminal but it was already the last ship of the night back to the mainland left port at and there was no way we were going to cover five miles of hilly territory with two ladies in heels in minutes it looked like we were stranded until morning immediately the histrionics started gtthe boyfriend i thought you were some kind of car guy how come all of the sudden you cant get a fcking car running before i had a chance to interject photographer girl jumped to my defense gtpg look dipsht he told you this was going to be a problem four hours ago and lo and behold the heater thing has failed just like he said it would and when he spoke up about your shtass car overheating you opened your dumbfck mouth and told him to shut up so you killed your car you idiot child and now were stuck out in the middle of fcking nowhere on some shtty island good work einstein i made a mental note not to ever try and argue with photographer girl because it was clear she would demolish me while the three of my companions were arguing i ducked to the side pulled out my giant old brick of a smartphone and surreptitiously sent a text gtme hey dude you know that bigass hill about five miles out of town on the way to your girls place were broken down at the bottom of it can you come rescue us gtthe raver yeah man i know right where thats at let me get things square here and ill be on my way ill text when im close it was now time to do the star trek ii thing sitting on my ass trying not to grin while everyone else stuck on the side of the road bitched at each other maybe some attractive lieutenant would ask me how i beat the kobayashi maru test aka how in the hell did i ever manage in one sitting to eat two entire plates of the colossal nachos at the korean karaoke bar behind the ford dealership i changed the conditions of the test id say i ate one plate and when no one was looking i got so blasted drunk that i threw up in the bushes outside and then i ate another one captain material right here the following half hour can best be described as a crescendo of anger and shouting as my three compatriots tried to yell themselves into some kind of solution to our situation photographer girl suggested we call a tow truck but the boyfriend didnt want to pay the many hundreds of dollars it would cost to bring his dead jeep back to the city my dates friend wanted to call a taxi of which there were precisely zero on the island the boyfriend waffled between making everyone walk back to town without him to summon help and just making camp for the night on the side of the road in either case he categorically refused to depart from his jeep after a few rounds of heated debate the three realized that i hadnt said much and that i was just leaning against the dead jeep playing with my phone the boyfriend sauntered over and got in my face gtthe boyfriend what the fck are you grinning at asshole gtphotographer girl maybe hes looking at your stupid fcking face gtme it is pretty fcking stupid i couldnt resist but before i had a chance to let everyone in on the plot and spoil the surprise my phone lit up with a text the raver was just around the corner gtthe boyfriend what the fck is this asshole for real youre just sitting here texting while were all trying to figure out what to do gtme yeah pretty much what else was i going to say rage lit in the boyfriends eyes and he pulled a fist back but before his badlytelegraphed assault could completely miss his girlfriend grabbed his arm and restrained him in a split second he shook her off and wound up another punch but this time he was distracted by the clatter of an ancient diesel volkswagen coming up from behind it was the raver i walked over to the approaching car gtthe raver sup fckwad gtme hey shthead thanks again man i owe you big time the boyfriends face was incredulous and he gestured toward the raver as his voice raised to an entirely new octave gtthe boyfriend now who the fck is this fggot at this point the boyfriend had burnt every last bit of sympathy from any of us even his own girlfriend was shaking her head at him the raver hollered over his direction gttr cmon now man you need to like chill gtthe boyfriend fck you the raver turned back to me and gave me a look gtme yeah weve been listening to this sht all night im gettin real fcking sick of it i hopped in the back seat and hollered over to my companions gtme this is our ride folks get in or be donner party the ladies hopped over to the decrepit jetta and after a moment of consideration the boyfriend shuffled over behind them the raver strolled around to the passenger side of his car and opened the doors for the ladies but before the boyfriend could pile in as well the raver held up his hand to stop him he looked over at me for confirmation all i could do was shake my head the raver turned back to the boyfriend gttr naw man this thing is like a friends and family deal and just like that the raver slammed the doors shut hopped into the drivers seat and we took off the last i saw of the boyfriend was him standing in the middle of the road arms raised to heaven shouting what the fck over and over three hours and an unbelievable amount of whiskey later photographer girls friend got a text that the boyfriend had been rescued by a county sheriff and was on his way back to civilization he was furious with her that she had abandoned him on the side of the road and left a manytextslong tirade exactly to that effect the words were hideous accusatory monstrous hateful the friend was obviously distraught and went and showed photographer girl and me the spew of vitriol that was flooding her cell phones screen she asked what she should say in response photographer girl put her hand on her friends shoulder gtpg text him back whatever you think he deserves the friend nodded and smiled and sent him back but a single letter gtk she turned off her phone and together we all laughed and drank cheap whiskey and listened to loud music until the moon itself was tired and slipped down to bed below the sea
hi tfts first time i felt i had something relevant to post the ups at a remote office failed its self test and reported a bad battery since the office is in another country we ordered a replacement from our usual retailer but had them deliver it directly to the location installation was to be handled by a contractor who works for the whole building not just our office so he offered to come in saturday morning to exchange the battery and we would shut down the server before just for safety we were told that the battery had arrived earlier this week so i confirmed to the contractor that i would shut down the server and he could replace the battery saturday morning cue phone call from the remote office this morning gt office hi you know that battery thing that got delivered this week how expensive was that can you order another one gt it why what happened gt office we had ordered some stuff from electronics retailer for a test weighing remote office does recyclingrelated things so sometimes they weigh packages for customers like electronics retailer just to be sure that they are invoiced for the correct amount of packaging to be recycled and those arrived the same day as the battery gt so someone took all those packages to our weighing lab since they were all electronics stuff and after weighing we sent the packages back to the retailer gt it so the battery gt office went back to the retailer along with the other items and apparently they had already arrived back at the retailer in remote offices country who didnt know what to do with the battery and sent the package on to their head office in our country gt it laughs ok so maybe we will get it back from them but in the meantime well order a new one for you i guess ill also tell the contractor he wont be needed this saturday after all dont worry we have another ups here that needs a fresh battery soon so if we get it back well use it for that one tldr hi that ups you upsed us can you ups us another one because we upsed it away
i came across another thread that reminded me of this quick story that i will share with you background info i am a network admin for a k school district with roots in helpdesk and regular break fix a while back a teacher came to me with her chromebook so i could show her how to perform some task she was having trouble with i happened to be working on my chromebook at the time so i closed mine grabbed hers and opened hers up nothing thats odd i say pressing the power button that should have woken up by itself still nothing assuming the battery is dead i unplug the charger from my chromebook and plug into hers the charging light quickly turns from off to amber to green indicating that the battery is fully charged the next few minutes i spend doing things like repeatedly opening and closing the lid pressing and holding the power button as well as any other button i can find shaking it flipping it over all to no avail the teacher had to get back to class so i asked if i could hold onto it and see what was happening she had assured me that she was just using it with no issues i decide to crack it open since i had done just about everything i could from the outside and the battery was internal i open the bottom cover ensure everything visible and accessible is secure then leaving the chromebook standing on its side because the bottom was open i hit the power button it works well im not sure what happened there but it seems to be working now so i close up the bottom panel put everything back to normal open the lid and nothing what the hell with the lid of the chromebook open i lift it up and shake it thinking something is loose or moving around in there suddenly it turns on all by itself oh boy i think to myself this cant be good thinking there is something metallic or otherwise conductive inside the chromebook bouncing around i proceed to once again take it apart this time i go further removing components completely from the machine over the course of the next hour i learn more about the internals of this particular model chromebook than i ever cared to know not finding anything obvious i decide i should try powering it on again so i put back only what is necessary to start it up once again on its side i press the power button and once again it comes to life alright great i say i carefully lift it and tilt it back to its normal orientation and as soon as i set it down the screen goes blank its off again no response to power button nothing leaving the lid open i proceed to pick it back up to turn it over and the screen comes to life ok i say nervously i place it back down dead at this time im thinking that when the laptop is twisted or strained in a certain way its causing something to break or lose connection so while i hold it in the air the laptop once again powered on and responsive i start twisting it and putting pressure on the base in different spots it has no effect the chromebook is still on and working perfectly i place it back down and poof it shuts off again thinking the feet are the stress point i start to lift it up slowly and when the pressure is relieved from the feet the chromebook comes back to life what in the hall is going on here but then i notice something i hadnt caught before every time this chromebook comes back to life it goes back to the screen it was on when it died so its acting like its going to sleep and waking up each time then it hits me like a ton of bricks these chromebooks use a proximity sensor like a magnet to detect when the lid is closed or not vs a button or switch when i closed my chromebook i set the teachers chromebook on top of mine her chromebook was detecting my chromebooks lid therefore making it think the lid was closed to it went to sleep two hours wasted but its a lesson i wont ever forget i hope you enjoyed my story as much as i enjoyed telling it

so my coworker who was also a tech support recently quit his job at our company so we had a new job posting up on our company website for a new it support person on the posting there is a apply now link that is actually an email link the mailtoxxxxxsomecompanycom format that the applicants use to send their resumes straight to my managers mailbox because we got some applicants in the past complain the link didnt work because they didnt know it was an email hyperlink we added some instructions underneath the apply now link on every posting in big red bold text that basically says that if you dont use a desktop email client like outlook then copy and paste the link right click the link and copy shortcut in ie or copy email address in chrome on to your gmail hotmail whatever other email service you use most people understand that and send in their resumes just fine but one day this guy with a really thick accent cant tell from where but its really thick and i can barely understand him called the reception and complained that he cannot apply for the it support position and that the link is broken the receptionist that answered the call forwarded the call to me because everything it related goes to me for some reason and i answered the call note that i work at an internal helpdesk so i dont get any external clients calling unless its our vendors or something so the conversation goes something like this gtguy hi i try to apply for the it network technical support position on your website but it is not working gtme did you click the apply now link on the posting gtguy yes but it doesnt work gtme can you tell me how the apply now link doesnt work gtguy i click the link and error appears gtme and what does the error say gtguy something about the default mail client is not properly installed gtme sure his email client isnt set up then what email service do you use gmail gtguy yes gmail sigh gtme the apply now link is actually an email address if you use gmail read the instructions under the apply now link on how to copy the email and paste it in gmail guy doesnt understand and repeats the same thing about how the link doesnt work and something about sending it to another email address in our company i repeat the same thing and tell him to follow the instructions and send it again he gives up and says hell try again and hangs up i thought to myself if you cant even solve your own it problems how are you going to solve the it problems for our staff a few days later i asked my manager and he said he didnt get any email from guy guess he still didnt figure it out

i work in several small offices with a consulting firm there are no shortages of stories but heres a quick one that happened recently following a recent sale mr sales sent an email to a couple customers with some remaining stock attached is a zip file said to contain photos from the items that must be sold our short story starts already in progress gtsales are you in the office today gtit yes im two doors down from him gtsales could you come over here for a minute gtit sure i walk over gtsales hr says i just sent the network drive to the buyers from the sale gtit lets take a look gtsales maybe ill just forward it to you instead i go back to my desk and wait as a small business hr is included in the customer service email address along with accounting marketing and a couple dedicated customer service people eventually as he comes and goes a couple of times the email comes in its a normal zip file with several photos we walk downstairs to try to see what hr was concerned about gthr see the entire network drive can be accessed straight from this email she had the zip file open and was clicking on the network drive directly from the explorer sidebar weve been on windows for three years now almost gave sales a heart attack but at least we got a mildly interesting story out of it
one of the many stories from my time as a level and tech support for the education department here is one with me and a female primary school teacher teacher almost in tears hyperventilating help me please me what can i do for you teacher well one of my kids was being naughty so i threatened to put him in the naughty corner he then threatened that he would hack my computer and he bloody has me what do you mean by hacking teacher hes broken the computer and given it all viruses hes refusing to tell me what he did after managing to get a word in i remoted into the computer turns out the kid had inverted the colours and changed the language smart kid 
i work part time in a call center where we do both clientcare and technical support for our client a mobile carrier in north america on the weekend im one of the few supervisor in charge for the careloyalty department in our relatively small center on weekends we dont usually treat second level escalation because were not enough on the floor but in this case i decided to take care of it because it seem so far fetched and also because the complaint was against one of our agent and we dont like these escalations untreated and prefer to take care of them ourselves so yesterday i get a call from one of the live supervisor on the floor whos speaking with luckycustomer whos claiming that we have provide him with as he was promised by a technical support agent the evening before the customer is not clear with the details to the supervisor and request that we listen to the call usually we cant being a contractor only our own internal calls are available lucky for him the tech support agent is one of ours so the call is already available for listening i ask the st level supervisor to put the customer on hold while i investigate the call this is what i can recall from the minutes call gt luckycustomer im tired that your application always shows big data discrepancies my phone shows me that im at gb while your app only shows gb i never get the automated warning in time gt generousagent well its not a very big discrepancy its only mb gt luckycustomer hum no its half a gig gt generousagent laughing not at all after the decimal its megabytes in this case only mb to be exact gt luckycustomer i dont think so no im no idiot i work it and my brother is an engineer we both can confirm to you that its mb youre mistaken gt generousagent let me speak to your brother i will explain it to him actually go on google and if you can prove me that and is close to half a gb we will give you the call is recorded gt luckycustomer what did you just say gt generousagent yes if you can prove that we will credit your account for dollar you just need to prove it which is impossible gt luckycustomer alright just let me get something customer puts the agent on spearker phone and comes back with something to record him say that again gt generousagent if you can prove us that and is close to half a gb we will give you a credit of gt luckycustomer alright like you said the call is recorded i also recorded that part ill be calling later to claim this amount to client care gt generousagent like i said its impossible but if you do prove it send us the proof and well apply the credit gt luckycustomer ok thank you and have a good day gt generousagent have a good day im sitting there listening to the call and having to find a way to tell the customer that theres no way we can apply that sort of credit from a promise from an overzealous agent who doesnt understand decimals very well i took the call and basically told the customer while he was right the agent had no authorization to offer this type of credit in the end i had to set up an escalation from our highest level available in the center i guess luckycustomer will probably get his credit and im not sure how long generousagent will keep his job 
the vps voice rung in my ear as i turned up to an unfamiliar workplace for the first time id been told to look for ways of intergrating two it departments whilst simultaneously getting to know the new staff wed just acquired i put on a large smile on my face as i entered the it department it actually looked quite tidy and orderly two it staff looked up at me from there desks as i entered gtgreyit you must be the new hire gtme new hire no im the it manager from the company youve just merged with gtyoungit merged ha i looked around and spotted an empty desk so i walked over to put down all my stuff the two men in the room seemed to watch cautiously gtme so mentally i screamed at the vp whod taken the manager from this office and placed him in charge of my own for a few months this place felt completely foreign gtgreyit so newbie today i think well start you with cleaning out the storage closet gtme ahem sorry you must be confused ill introduce myself im airz i come from the company youve just merged with ive come to manage this office for a while and work out how to better integrate this team as we move you over to our buildings youngit looked startled at the announcement that theyd be moving greyit however was steely eyed gtgreyit okay newbie introductions first then cleaning im greyit and this is youngit the closet is over that way anything you want to throw out just run it past me okay it was as if he was trying some mind trick i looked at him blankly wondering if he was just perhaps just thick gtgreyit hello newbie the closet is that way he waved at me like i was the thick one i decided it had to stop gtme okay stop calling me newbie im currently the manager of this office now unless you want to be assigned the cleaning duties id lay off youngit smirked at greyit who looked taken aback that someone was standing up to him gtgreyit youre the newest member of this office its tradition to call the newest newbie gtme unfortunately that tradition stops when that person is your senior gtgreyit senior im older then you i sighed and decided not to rub the fact i meant in position in his face he clearly wanted to be a boss or at least boss someone around gtme okay wheres the ticketing software gtgreyit youngit you show him the ropes i aint got time to show round a newbie he shook his head and got back to whatever he was doing on his computer i decided to just let him go youngit smiled at me as he walked over gtyoungit okay so this is your email and this is the knowledge base where you look up any problems and now we just wait for a call or someone to walk in the door gtme which program runs your tickets gtyoungit tickets what are tickets greyit finally decided to spin round on his chair he looked at me angrily gtgreyit we dont do tickets here people come to us with problems newbie gtme stop calling me newbie gtgreyit well when you learn how an it department runs you wouldnt be such a newbie i refrained from reprimanding greyit on calling me a newbie making a huge fuss over something so small on the first day never bodes well i turned back to youngit gtme so no tickets youngit looked confused but shook his head gtme oh gtyoungit dont worry we have emails youngit opened up the email client the list of emails already in my inbox was staggering gtyoungit when you complete a job just hit reply all and type done into the reply that tells us all youve done the job gtme ive already got emails isnt this a new account gtyoungit it gets resent every job it hasnt completed every few hours so we dont miss any i could already think of a hundred things wrong with this system youngit seemed to relish in explaining every aspect of it though i let him talk eventually a lady walked into the department youngit prompted me to take the inquiry gtfright oh hello are you new gtme yep what can it do for you gtfright my computer wont print just errors continuously gtme i guess lets go take a look i started to make my way towards the door but fright didnt seem to move gtfright dont worry ive brought it down gtbehind fright a desktop and printer combination sat on a trolley it looked like someone had taken great care to bring every cord with it the trolley was loaded with various cords and adaptors gtfright hopefully ive got the right cords i sort of need this done quickly gtme next time maybe leave it all in place and well come to you greyit shouted at me from across the room gtgreyit wait airz stop ill take this one he rushed over and stood between me and fright i was so surprised hed called me airz i decided to just let him as i walked back to my desk i listened to the end of the interaction gtgreyit sorry about that so youre not printing dont worry well sort this out gtfright what did that other guy say about coming up and not having to bring everything to it gtgreyit hes the newbie doesnt know what hes talking about im afraid no no the best way to get things done quickly is the it department i mean think about it thats where all the fixing machines are fright seemed to accept that as fact and smiled as greyit spent his time plugging the computer in i stared with incredulity at all the inefficiencies i seemed to be in shock for a while and was only brought out of it when youngit brought me a coffee gtme youngit is everything diagnosed down here nothing is ever done on the floor my question however was answered only moments later as an exhausted secretary pushed a massive full height printer into the department she gave it one last shove through the door then exclaimed loudly gtexaustsec printer for floor its out of ink or something again

this was back in the days of me being a codemonkey for a company about years ago the cio who was a wellestablished idiot who daisychained a raid into a constantly failing server drive was known for not knowing crap they have a massive homebrewed server when the size of the organization could easily survive on a single server rack if properly configured an org with less than people has a dedicated in house exchange server with the cios homebrewed spam filter in placeoh boy i got stories about the failure that pos was backups were done monthly and were kept in the same room mainly the whole thing was designed to fail even just on the hardware side the cio was an idiot on the software side he was an even bigger idiot he claimed to be a net guy but he was actually a vb guy everything he wrote vb hated c so cio decided to build this online tool where clients would be able to create their own ads the whole tool was a disaster that used a grid system like battleship anyways since i was the smartest codemonkey i got the privilege to alpha the pos sample data was given to us in a word document to input into an ad which i did minutes later boom alarms everywhere people scrambling children screaming dogs and cats living together finally one of the programmers ran to me did you just put a highbit character into the new ad tool he said accusingly i said i copy and pasted the text from the word doc apparently word docs have an end of line character thats invisible and is considered a highbit character which caused me to escape the ad tools text input meaning the rest of the text string i copypasted in was being read as code not a sentence to merge yeah they tried to pin it on me until i pointed out most our customers use word and wouldve copypasted in highbit characters eventually tldr sanitize your inputs
blah first time poster blah blah blah user having worked as an it support person during move in my favorite was the dad who was upset because he couldnt set up his server in his daughters room our networking team was always aggressive about blocking rouge servers on the network cast ad angry dad me me gtad why am i not allowed to set up my daughters computer in her dorm gtme thinking that he means a desktop you are allowed to set it up sir just make certain you follow the getting started guide that we put in her room gtad i did then if stopped talking to the network why snipping out the long rant about how much hes paying for his daughter to attend gtme thinking that he didnt bother to read the instructions and rather than belabor the point i decided to follow him upstairs to help ad walks me in and points to his daughters desktop computer which is actually a server rack complete with a couple of servers a network switch and what i believe is a decent raid array gtme um sir youre not allowed to treat your daughters dorm room like a server closet that will have to go note daughter is sitting on her bed during this time surfing the facebook on her laptop gtad sputtering do you know how much money im paying for her to go here gtme money has nothing to do with this you cant do this and it will have to go gtad famp you at this point rather than argue i decided to let campus security take care of this and walk out i call the special number we have for security and inform them of the situation an hour later i laugh quietly as he is hauling several boxes and an empty server rack back to his truck turns out he saw that our campus had access to internet and thought that he could just plug his business server up to our network and instantly have faster data speeds without having to pay for it tldr daddy will gladly pay for his daughter to join a sorority but is too cheap to pay for his own server room 
one day at my telco a new lowlevel suit asks me a favor while im getting a coffee refill gt new suit so i need to send a few faxes but these machines hate me hah senior staff right can you help me do it gt bytewave yes i am no i cant rules are a bit strict handling the faxes of management is part of the job description of the union secretaries im sure hr explained all the intricacies when you took the job youd be getting your first grievance in your first week go see one of them theyll be happy to gt new suit oh right i tried its just theyre on this seminar this afternoon were all out so obviously theres nobody to handle it gt bytewave its a fax machine if my cleaning maid calls in sick i can still operate a vacuum cleaner what can be so complicated mistaking my morbid curiosity for an interest in helping him out he beams and pulls out six letters and a series of voided cheques gt new suit yeah i really need to move all my stuff to this new bank account and you know how it is paymaster wants a copy old and new banks credit card company bills gt bytewave hang on i thought this was at least workrelated gt bytewave nevermind now im curious why do you have six voided cheques in hand and i look carefully at the letter hes hoping to fax along its a nicely formatted explanation followed by his contact information account numbers and everything related to identification at six different companies the six are identical copies gt bytewave im going to advise you to send a different document to each company that handles your financial business id like to say something like this is how identity theft happens but it really isnt nobody wakes up and thinks its a good idea to send their account numbers and everything from their sin to their parents names as proof of id on the same page to six different companies now why on earth did you make six copies of the exact same void cheq and then it hits me oh gt new suit well i need to send it to six places i have this post it with the fax codes for each gt bytewave you know what were now miraculously enough talking about something that falls under my job description gt new suit oh so you can help me with this gt bytewave sort of it falls under technical senior staffs purview to ensure everyone who talks with customers about technical issues have the required grasp of the technologies involved at their level for the services we provide usually its frontline techs but still i cant send your faxes but i have to ensure you get a class on the basics that you seem to direly need a remarkable amount of complaints management gets are from people who cant operate their faxes and someone in your position needs to understand the technology as its almost always due to their equipment gt new suit oh thanks but i really dont care about that stuff i just need these six faxes sent thank you ill wait for the secretaries tomorrow gt bytewave im afraid its not exactly optional in a case like this i can get someone to sit with you to cover the basics youll need in your job discreetly or i can file a coaching report that the director will have to review later its much easier for everyone if youre eager to learn sorry just my job youll understand gt new suit oh well i guess its true i dont know much about this stuff so what we head to the training rooms gt bytewave no i have stuff to do ill have someone from our team with you we should be able to do this by six and so a little later a tired suit sits in class learning why you dont need to use six void cheques if you want to fax the same one six times gt most junior guy on senior staff and so the first iteration of the technology that closest resembles what we use today came with with xerox magnafax in gt and therefore only a single copy of input contents is required as it is then converted into a bitmap and transmitted through phone lines as audiofrequency tones as a copy multiple inputs of the same document are of course unnecessary he told me the next day the newest manager listened but looked like someone who had been sentenced to hard labor and was counting his minutes to freedom all of bytewaves tales on 
firstly thanks to unerdguy for prompting me to write this after seeing my flair now i hope this fits in this sub so im not really in tech support but i think this counts as at the time i was managing the development and roll out of a new piece of software sort of a halfway house between customer and dev quite enjoyable actually if you are in the uk then you may have seen the adverts on tv and in the press about pensions auto enrolment for those who dont know basically if you earn above a threshold your employer must put you in a pension scheme and must contribute to your pension simple concept yes yes it is but the actual rules behind it are horrifically complicated the developers guide is over pages long and increasing here for more info if you have a week to anyway in the uk the tax year ends on the th of april and starts on the th of april at which point the thresholds for auto enrolment change depending on your assessment date depends on which threshold you use so if you are paid monthly st to th of april your assessment date is the beginning of the month st of april so you use last years figures unless you turn in the month and your birthday is on the th or after in which case you use this years figures there is much much more to it that this however with me or bored yet ill carry on anyway a customer g phoned last april your narrator is cl gtg the system has used the wrong figures gtcl ok lets talk through the scenario i then spend a good minutes taking down key dates salary age information etc and doing the calculation manually gtclno its right because you assess on the st of april it has used the correct figures gtg but today is the nd of april gtcl yes it is gtg so we need to use the new figures gtcl no use the figures on the assessment date gtg put i pay them at the end of the month gtcl thats fine but the assessment date is the st ie in last year gtg i dont care i want to use this years figures gtcl you cant gtg i want to because then i dont have to put them in a pension at this point alarm bells ring they want to fudge it to avoid paying employer contributions of salary i hasten to add there followed an extensive call with me reiterating i wouldnt change it in which i uttered the phrase no i will not change it to make it illegal they complained all the way up to director who all backed me which was nice and fudged it anyway edit so yes they told me they were going to fudge it anyway and if i had any faith that the regultor would get round to looking at it yes i would report them they will be audited shortly so it will come up regulator is tpr not hmrc edit everyone saying report him its a her 
 walking over to the pc that was the focus of everyones attention what secrets do you hide i wondered i grabbed a new coffee and connected up the computer to a screen colourblind finally looked up from his chair gtcolourblind what do you think is on there colourblinds curiosity hadnt died good gtme er i dont think i even want to know gtcolourblind what if its good his eyes had lost their sad edge they now shone with dreams of the possibilities i got up from my desk to get a hard drive with the company images on it as i came back to the spot where the computer lay i noticed that had been turned on colourblind looked guiltily up at me gtcolourblind sorry i couldnt help it but look no boot device found gtme what the gtcolourblind lets look in the bios in the bios we stared at the screen which told us no hard drives were plugged in gtme maybe the board died on the hard drive i grabbed the screwdrivers from a nearby desk and cracked open the computer gtcolourblind airz did you pull this thing apart before gtme nope i looked at the empty drive bays no hard drives gtcolourblind how did gtme er i looked frantically around the office how did a computer work upstairs then only minutes later not have a hard drive gtcolourblind f gtme yep 
so this is a story my boss told me yesterday he went to a client who was having wireless internet connectivity issues he checked out all three of their computers they were all connected wirelessly but the connection was a bit hiccupy after a while he figured out that all the computers in the office were connected to the internet via the printer its one of those printers that lets you connect to it so you can print from a device without having to go through the router or anything so apparently this printer was doubling up as an access point for the network everyone went through that to get to the router of course none of the users realised thats what the problem was once the printers wireless details were removed from every machine and they were all connected to the router again which strangely had a far weaker signal than the printer everything returned to normal and i imagine the little men inside the printer that make the miracles happen stopped having frequent panic attacks
this is a little more recent than my previous posts back in the s we had a tandem machine that was never supposed to fail and really didnt with processors everyone in the machine room seemed to have an evil aura whenever anyone got close to the machine a message was printed on the system teletype machine yeah baud the message said something like processor failed followed by a time stamp since this system was redundant as all get out the only thing that anyone not in the machine room noticed was slightly increased latency in responses when the area around the machine was vacated another message was printed processor is operating again with a time stamp this was a really new installation less than a month since startup so we called the manufacturers tech support the support tech immediately replaced the processor boards as we expected he would but nothing changed out of curiosity all of the nontandem techs were standing around watching processor would resume operation only when everybody left the immediate vicinity of the machine after several hours of diagnostics which passed when no on was close to the machine but failed otherwise complete with snide comments from the audience about spooky action at a distance the support tech found a slightly bent pin on one of processor s sockets he powered down processor straightened the pin restored power and restarted processor it worked even with the audience standing right next to the machine this was a mainframe type installation on a raised floor the raised floor had not been installed properly the weight of any individual standing near the machine was enough to flex the floor causing the connection to fail followed immediately by the error message shortly afterwards we got a new assembly for processor under warrantee i wasnt there at the time so i dont know how much was replaced but we never had that evil aura effect on the machine again as far as i know the floor was never readjusted we just lived with it
this was the query we just got from a client who just got their ssl cert renewal invoice i pulled up her invoice from last year and the email comms between her and our sales guy we are adding your ssl certificate to your final invoice please note that this is an annual charge it needs to be renewed before july th it was clearly labelled as an annual fee on her invoice as well so i asked her in spite of this why she thought her ssl cert should be permanent gt certificates dont expire excuse me gt i have had my degree since imagine if i had to pay for that to be renewed every year or i could not practice marketing it is permanent we explained that this is a normal practice and that every single ssl cert provider will bill the same way she accused us of taking advantage of people who do not understand tech and has now shut down her account with us flabbergasted to be honest 
or how the interpreter saved his boss butt its the early st century and one of my first jobs as freelance it amp media guy is with a local pr company mostly working on their first website yay future and fixing various user problems really basic stuff but i was a newbie in many areas making stuff up as i went along so it fit in late summer the cto of a japanese tech company was in germany to attent an exhibitiontrade show and meet a couple of investors our company had been working to become the official pr agency for the japanese tech company for europe and they got the cto to meet with our boss and project leads here before the show the cto was carrying a laptop that had all the important files for the presentations on it i was told the laptop simply went black in the middle of the meeting and wouldnt come back on for a while when it finally did boot again there was a boot error and the cto declared the laptop was broken and the data gone for good my boss sent for me to have me take a look at the machine i saw the error message mbr broken and said that i might be able to get the data gt shouldnt be that hard i just use one of them linux livecds to boot the machine and copy the files to one of our laptops over the lan and that was when the translator said gt are you mad the cto of a high tech company has just declared the machine beyond repair do you have any idea how much it will offend him if some lowly german computer nerd can prove him wrong that easily gt so would you rather not holding your presentation than being helped whos the mad guy here gt ill think of something now please leave us youre not needed here my boss nodded and i went back into the makeshift it office thinking to myself how unreal that just had been minutes later the translator entered my office laptop under his arm he told me my boss would be taking the cto out to lunch now and that he the translator had convinced the cto that those new laptops might have a sort of internal backup system that could be accessed in case of emergency gt i basically dropped a couple of buzz words and he had to agree unless he wanted to admit that he doesnt have a clue i was sent here to give you instructions but i guess you know what to do better than me we both grinned he continued gt now this is important it must look like it was a really difficult job it must look very technological wires tools hardware parts etc oh and take apart the laptop can you do that i nodded and he excused himself to join out bosses at lunch booting the machine using a linux livecd worked like a charm finding and copying the files was childs play so while the data was being copied over the network to another laptop a coworker and i started technologizing the office we removed the side panels from the desktop pcs put a bunch of cables here and there got the tool boxes and brokenoutdated hardware parts out of the closet and put them onto a desktopturnedworkbench put the networking stuff into a place where one could easier see all those pretty leds etc and for a final touch we put a soldering iron onto the desk right next to the ctos laptop it was horrible and beautiful at the same time hours later our boss and the japanese guests came back from their meal and the translator came by to ask if everything went ok it did he then ushered his boss into the room the cto scanned the room then saw the remains of his laptop spread across the workbench with the soldering iron next to it he turned to his translator and they exchanged some words the translator then told me gt please hand him the new laptop dont say anything just nod a bit i did as instructed the cto opened it up the presentation was already waiting to be started there was not a single muscle moving in his face he close the laptop nodded towards his translator not me and then left the room to get back to talking business with my boss and the project leads later i was told that during lunch the cto had phones his company and ordered a currier to fly to germany asap to bring a new laptop with the presentation data etc keep in mind this is early and we are talking huge amounts for that time of data uncompressed videos etc so just ftp that stuff overnight was not an option said courier would not make it in time for the presentation the next day our company would later get to do some business for the japanese company so mission accomplished i guess a few weeks later we got a package from japan in it mostly pr stuff for the marketing guys to play around with etc but also a small box labeled for it in it was a soldering station and a card that read gt we noticed you have a very old soldering iron we gift this new japanese one to you so you may fix computers more efficiently in the future

there are some things in life you just cant train for cooling is a very delicate thing managing heat can be difficult at the best of times but when your datacentre is in an office building shit can hit the fan quickly and when that happens you just have to improvise it was the middle of summer degree days celcius blistering heat high humidity we had two airconditioning units for the datacentre a big one and a small one that was about half the size i referred to this as n as the big one was new and the small one was old and thus most likely to fail wed always planned to get a third one the same size as the big one the designs were drawn up and it was quoted on but cash flow at a startup is light so we banked on the big one and hoped for the best gt uwizbam this summer hope was not enough the environmental sensors went off not long after the units management console stopping responding to pings i ran to the plant room with that hope in my heart but that hope was quickly pissed away as i nearly unrinated in fear the room was quiet ac was dead its corpse smelt like burning the air temperature in the dc went from to in five minutes with that rate of change it would be over degrees within the hour we had about an hour and a half before the servers would reach shutdown temperature and probably two hours max before the switches and routers shut off wed be screwed if it got that far but our customers would be worse if their drives melted down if that wasnt bad enough when the airconditioner blew it took out a whole bunch of circuits with it namely all of the additional power outlets around the room uhaakon and i gathered in a huddle to decide the plan of attack and after five minutes of discussion orders were issued minutes to shutdown temperature we sent every noncritical staff member to malls in every direction with and one instruction buy as many fans as you can carry i ran off to a hardware store to buy as many a extension leads and power boards as i could and left uhaakon to shut down all noncritical servers while the other two techs called as many of our customers as they could to let them know the situation and strongly advise they shut down anything noncritical also the ceo called the ceo of our airconditioning company and pulled the trigger on a purchase order that said it doesnt matter what it costs come in and build right now their office was an hour away and the portable chillers they were bringing took half an hour to assemble as they were in pieces minutes to shutdown temperature our scout missions all returned about the same time uhaakon and i ran in different directions with highamp power cables and proceeded to barge into every office we could find and steal their power the people who questioned us were glared at and gruffly told it was an emergency followed shortly by us storming off and looking for the next outlet with the power cabling complete phase was about to begin i dont know how many fans there were there would have been about people on the fan mission so a lot we broke the power cables out into power boards plugged in fans and opened both the doors directing air down the aisles and along the row to the exits a wall of heat spewed out into the hall it felt like getting hit in the face it was degrees now we didnt have much time the building airconditioning in the office and the hall were doing little to stem the flow of hot air and the lobby began to heat up we opened the doors to our office to every other office and when they started to heat up too the fire escape unfortunately this did little to stem the flow the hot air that the one remaining ac was sucking back in was getting hotter and in turn it became less and less effective uhaakon and i dedicated what little time we had remaining to helping the larger customers determine what they could safely shut off and unplug anything redundant the heat was overwhelming suffocating we took turns in the room as long as we could stand it before tagging out and taking a rest to rehydrate i thought i was going to throw up he looked somehow pale and overheated at the same time degrees the servers would be reaching failure temperature soon but there was nothing more we could do we sat and watched the fans spin aimlessly all we had left was the waiting game and the waiting game sucks at that moment four airconditioning techs ran through the open doors each pushing a kw portable chiller id never been so happy to see anyone in my life they plugged into the waiting power outlets and with a chug they sprung to life heat exhaust conduits two feet wide snaked their way down the aisles and out the door and for the first time in what seemed like forever the temperature began to drop we were saved but this was a temporary measure the units had buckets in them that needed to be emptied frequently so we took turns emptying them down the sink the other ac team had gotten to work shifting our new kw unit in and they were all hands on deck for as long as they had to be to get it online the temperature had dropped to a notrespectable but totally liveable degrees no hard drives crashed only two servers hit thermal max and they shut down gracefully in response i went home early that day dehydrated exhausted and out of fucks i was no longer of use to anyone someone asked why i was leaving all i could manage was one word no to be continued
i promised something nice for utannerleaf so here it is ampnbsp i work for a small it company that manages big law firms and car dealerships we still cater to our older home users not wanting to toss them away now that weve gotten a bit larger ampnbsp one of these people are very old s to s and he usually mulls about without any issue when he calls us its like a train hitting a wall going mph for instance one time he called and screamed at me as i could not escalate his call it was very busy and he wanted to warn us about cryptowall as seen on the sunday paper yes we know about that we were dealing with two outbreaks of crypto as he called funny enough but thats not the point here ampnbsp the point here is that this man always tries to be helpful but has absolutely no idea what he is doing but at his age and still being able to function on his own with his computer sounds good to me ampnbsp one day he calls us as he is having an issue with wordperfect something happened and then he found he couldnt use his mouse he sets down the phone and crawls under the desk and then you can hear him audibly groan from a distance before he comes back and tells us that hes unplugged everything by accident ampnbsp so this requires an onsite visit theyre expensive but he doesnt seem to mind and it is way better than him being on the floor at his age we get an appointment set up for him but im told by hr that the day chosen was actually his birthday ampnbsp fast forward to that day and ive bought the cutest card i could find and had everyone in the office sign it i sent my tech on his way and it went like this ampnbsp gttech hands user the bill for that days appointment as he wasnt able to esign the agreement gtuser signs bill gttech takes bill back and smiles and then pulls the card out from wherever he was hiding it gtuser takes the card cries hugs my tech and then calls us in the office ampnbsp this user is as stated old he repeated a few times about how happy he was and about how all of his friends were dead along with his family and that no one would have known it was his birthday he cried to me on the phone shouted a big thank you to all of the techs that i had listening in and then offered to beat up any older clients if they ever gave us any lip ampnbsp it was undoubtedly the most adorable thing ive ever had happen at work ampnbsp on a side note he called us the next day to tell us the speakers werent plugged in as a courtesy we went back free of charge only to find he hadnt turned on his speakers despite clearly laughing and scoffing at the idea and saying what do you think im an idiot of course theyre on he felt silly but we still love him anyway edit thank you all for helping me get this formatted correctly u
i work for health insurance company on the east coast and have been part of the tech ssupport group for going on years now and this is my first are you kiding me tech support moment that i felt like posting this story takes place on a warm sunny saturday morning we were working all week on upgrading the vpn software on the new wave of laptops we just got my boss we will call him barney as to protect his real name just incase any of my fellow people find me on reddit gave us a list of things to troubleshoot while setting up said computers well barney was in a meeting with the ceo and a bunch of the other directors and they all wanted the first wave of new laptops all of them were setup and working for each user as of friday afternoon when i left at noon they were going to be picking them up before they left for the dayor so i thought saturday morning roles around and i am woken up to the sound of my phone going off at am after answering the phone it was barney panicing i tried to calm him down to find out what was wrong but barney was in full panic mode freaking out and sounding like he was going to have a heart attack i talked to him for about minutes until i figured out the issueand it was a big one the new laptops were not working at all the compuets wouldnt let them log in and the directors had no idea why so i called our ceo i didnt volunteer i was basically told to because barney was having a break down after speaking to our ceo i will call him hermin hermin was no help at all after almost minutes of trying to ask him what the problem was he just kept repeating it wont connect i am really disappointed i tried to walk him through the setup and he keeps saying that the computer is asking for a windows keyso right there i know something isnt right then hermin just begins getting really mad and then he slips out the words god dammit obamanow i am holding back my laughter with all of my strength and tell him i will make my way to the office ok so now at this point i drive into the office which is minutes away so i dont even get dressed just jump in the car and drive off to the office when i get there i finally get to the th floor and find my way to my work area and then i see itthe laptops sitting on the tech cart with a giant sign that says directors laptops and each was boxed with the different directors name on a label on both sides and top of the box so it was easy to readthey didnt take the correct laptops heres when it gets goodi then have to call hermin back and explain to him what the problem is that basically whoever grabbed the laptops gave them the wrong ones i say im sorry for this mixup and tell them that they have to switch them out the ones they have arent even setup with windows yet hence the windows key screen hermin then begins to get really mad at me and below i have laid out the convo for you hermin well i am the one that grabbed these so you are saying i took the wrong ones how am i suppose to know which ones are the right ones me where did you take them from we had them on the tech cart in the support area with a sign on them they had each directors name on the box because we set them up based on how you wanted them hermin this is ridiculous where was that cart i dont know where the tech support area is me but you said you grabbed the laptops your self so where did you take them from hermin dont get smart with me me sir i am only trying to figure out how to correct this mistake please dont think i am insulting you in anyway i just want to know which ones you took hermin well we are all without working computers now this is entirely your fault me barney is in charge of this project not me so please talk to him regarding this hermin you need to bring us these laptop asap otherwise the directors will be unable to answer emails or contact clients this is false as each one has a work phone which has access to their email me ok where are you do you want to come into the office so i can give you the correct laptops and show you how to connect to the network hermin we are in atlantic city me thats a hour drive for me hermin start driving click at this point i call barney back and flip out i am not driving hours to give thme laptops because our ceo is a moron barney is begging me to do it and i tell him that this is the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard after screaming at barney for another minutes i hear my phone ringing its hermin hermin are you going to drive them to us me are you joking sir i understand you need the laptops but thats hours of driving all because you took the wrong ones this is ridiculous of you to demand this and i just cant do that hermin so you arent going to do this then we need them if you dont do this on monday we will have a meeting about this with all of the directors me that is fine with me i will explain to them what i explained to you hermin see you monday and if they all agree with me we will be letting you go that after noon click monday rolls around and at this point im ready to lose my job because our ceo is a fool my manager barney is really upset and freaking out as we walk into the conference room all of the directors and the ceo are in the room and hermin is at the head of the table ready to yell we sit down and he starts saying that this situation could have been avoided after listening to the garbage roll out of his mouth i stand up and say the following me ok let me start off by saying that we took an entire week to do this last minute upgrade for you we spent many hours setting up your laptops and upgrading your vpn systems with the help of the networking team with that said i would like to say sorry but not for myself but for our ceo hermin what did you say me since you are so hell bent on firing me i would atleast like to explain this situation to everyone in the room so please allow me to do that hermin ok fine me we setup your specific laptops and tripple checked that they all worked before we were ready to give them to you we also put them on a cart in our area with a bright yellow sigh that said these were your laptops as well as labeling each one of them based on the user then we left them in the middle of the room so they would be easy to find i got called at am because someone grabbed the wrong laptops this is not my fault then i was blamed for this and told to drive to atlantic city where the conference was that you all attended to give you the latops which to me is unacceptable you do not pay me enough to drive that far out of my way because of someone else screw up at this point hermins face is turning bright red with anger but he holds back until i finish mei have pictures of the tech support area that day as well as access to the cameras for that floor after further review it shows hermin going into the tech support closet and taking out fresh unopened laptops which didnt even have an os on them he told me on the phone he didnt know where the tech support area was but the cameras show him walking right past the main room to our closet he then threatened to fire me over his own ignorance hermin how dare you just as i was getting ready to be thrown out of the building one of the other directors stands up and says this is not your fault this is herminslike the voice of an angel hermin these pictures have to be false there is no way i missed them me you did and i also have you on our call system saying you had no idea where the tech support area is if you like i can play that back for you director its fine this is clearly not your issue and we will let it go sorry about the confusion me thank you for understanding but just so you are all aware this ill be going to hr before the end of the day hermin how dare you i walked out of the room sent an email to hr and had a meeting that day by the end of that week i had a formal apology letter form the ceo as well as the directors all of which saying that i did an excellent job point of the storystupid ceo took wrong laptops blamed me blamed obama and wanted me to drive to atlantic city with laptops edit sorry everyone for the really terrible typing i sent this from my phone so there is a lot of fail in itbut the story is still there i am entirely way to lazy to go back and edit this to sound like an adult typed this rather then a thgrader butlaziness is a hell of a drug

this tale happens back in the mid s a time of joy sadness and dialup isps i worked for one and once boasted that i could run someone through windows dial up networking setup with my eyes closed my thensupervisor thought i was lying and proceeded to bet me i couldnt i cant and ive been here longer than you he said i know i can in fact ill blindfold myself and do it i will let you know when im on one you can listen in he agreed the next morning i showed up with a bandanna to use as the blindfold and as luck would have it my first call was a win dun setup call for our service on goes the blindfold and i lean back and walk the caller through the setup all the way from click on the start button to his first web page without a glitch i did the outro and took off the blindfold no fewer than a half dozen of my fellow techs were watching me do this blindfolded there was chatter on our irc channel about it and my supe looked dour as all fucking hell at losing the bet he did pay up and i had a nice sandwich for lunch that day tldr no really i can do that blindfolded
a bit of backstory ampnbsp way back when i was oneman it for a family business in the early days of the internets think prewifi dsl and cable when people still debated the merits of modems and rockwell hcf modems were the bane of the existence of many i was tasked with getting us online what to do we had no network and i had no budget cue base thinnet strung about cause the equipment was available for cheap back then bt was becoming the norm but was still expensive and gigabit had just dropped and was unholy expensive and hubs much less switches plus stringing cat would be way more costly than rg ampnbsp so now we were all wired up with noplace to go bless the powers they accepted my explanation as to why a ton of dialup was not the answer but what then unfortunately the facility was hell and gone from newdeathstarbabybells nearest co so a t was right out of the question tspans back then were and may still be charged by distance for the physical circuit and access be it voice data etc was separate the quoted loop charges were insane even if i could get access for cheap but this newfangled service called isdn was not subject to a distancebased loop charge for those unfamiliar isdn was sold in many places as k bearer channels for data and k data channel for signalling i figured isdn lines or k bandwidth should work ampnbsp sadly said lecs internet offering wasnt very advanced and couldnt do bonding they charged by channel and connect time so that wasnt gonna fly plus this was a bit of a podunk area and innovation was thin on the ground i somehow managed to talk a local isp into leasing us a spanking new cisco with two isdn cards for cheap and rolling that into monthly dedicated bonded service they were primarily a consumer dialup isp first in town with k which is why they could also offer isdn and in the evenings throughput definitely dropped but when we needed the bandwidth it was there ampnbsp for a year or so this was ok but then flash started becoming a thing web pages were becoming more image intensive and broadcastcom was growing popular none were core business functions but what the powers want the powers get and the powers wanted bandwidth this was perfect timing isp was getting commercially shaky and the service grew progressively flaky meanwhile newdeathstarbabybell had recently started offering frame relay dedicated access in our area significantly more cheaply so out went one and in came another this time we had to supply the router and i had to configure it so i learned a little ios this will become important later but for now bandwidth was quadrupled our users rejoiced and we carried on ampnbsp another year and a half down the road and the screaming begins anew over the slowness by this time weve got servers and printers and devices galore hung to hell and gone so it is decided that well do it right this time and the catization begins but our contract with newdeathstarbabybell doesnt run out for six months so while we can redo all the infrastructure and be ready to move we cant actually switch until then and well have to have both running for about a month they wanted mmmmooaarrrr sppeeeeeeed so all was blessed ampnbsp at long last we get to the story yellowrunfastshortdistance telco was mounting a big push in the area to gain customers and had been by to see about picking up our dedicated voice business about a month prior we did a metric crapton of inbound tollfree service ampnbsp i called the rep and said if we got a deal on a xt circuit i might be amenable to switching things up when our voice contract came up in about a year she came back with a price that was equal to what newdeathstarbabybell wouldve wanted for the t loops alone and threw in a shiny new cisco something think it was a to handle it all they were going to handle provisioning install everything and the router was their problem so they said ampnbsp problem yellowrunfastshortdistance wasnt very good at provisioning and had a bad working relationship with newdeathstarbabybell i wish id known that earlier two weeks before the planned cutover i still didnt have an install date for the circuits even though the router had already been installed and mounted and was merrily blinking away into the nothingness not connected to a damn thing this will also be important later ampnbsp increasingly

just happened today when i was out for some emergency field work it all started with one call from one of our beloved clients we call him drb gtme hello techsupport youre talking to waldue gtdrb agh drb here i got problems with this damn fcking pc again i need someone to fix it as soon as possible send someone here please and yep he really started shouting in the middle of the sentence stopped and yelled again he always does that he is not that bad with it in general but sometimes especially when he gets really angry he doesnt know how to close a task gtdrb if you wont send anyone ill toss every thing in here out of the window i am sick of nothing working here as it should i swear i will rip everything apart hes always like this so his screaming is easy to ignore and he swears a lot more but otherwise it wouldnt be sfw so after confirming that it wasnt something simple as that the pc wont react even after restarting and unplugging it i get my toolbox ready and took off gladly he ist just a few miles away so when i entered his office a few minutes later he seemed to have calmed down a bit he showed me the pc and i looked at its backside then i turned on the power switch and it rebootet just fine and works perfectly normal when i looked at drb he just shook his head and thanked me gtdrb and that was everything just this i nodded and he started laughing still shaking his head once i returned i got mail from drb gtthanks for fixing my problem just one question is it okay to shut the pc down or do you have to come again the time i needed to fix the problem seconds guess thats a new personal best
user opens ticket annoyed that her computer keeps getting automatically restarted while she want to work she says this is very limiting to her sccm allows you to postpone updates until eventually it forces you to install them and restarts you computer in min no cancel button apparently she complained about this in the past and someone showed her how she can limit the updatesreboots to times outside of her business hours so she set updates to never install from ampm only problem she leaves at pm and turns off her pc every single day so ofcourse no updates get installed and eventually the computer gets rebooted while shes working now shes complaining that the setting isnt working tldr user want the computer to install updates while its turned off 
this happened sometime in the characters don me mom my mom gfmom my gfs mom gf my gf at the time it was a bright saturday morning i was in the basement rag chewing with some of my friends on meters when my mom called down the stairs gt mom don gfmom is on the phone she wants to talk to you uhoh i can think of many reasons for gfmom to call me most of them bad run up the stairs and take the phone gtdon hello gtgfmom hi don gtdon hi gtgfmom my stove is talking and singing gtdon what gtgfmom my stove is talking and singing and gf said you might know what is going on whew gtdon what is it saying gtgfmom i cant tell i know its talking and singing but i cant make out what they are saying gtdon ill be over soon gtgfmom to gf gf why dont you take the tbird and pickup don gtgf to gfmom enthusiastically sure hangs up phone i figured that this might be a technical issue so i grabbed my toolbox and went outside to wait for tbird and gf got to gfs house and gfmom immediately leads me to the kitchen gtgfmom it is only the rightrear burner and only for a few minutes after i first turn it on then it stops and doesnt happen again til i turn it off and it cools down i turned rightrear burner on and sure enough it starts playing music it was really distorted but what was coming out of the burner was obviously a commercial jingle it was a broadcast station the audio faded out as the burner got hot so i turned it off to let it cool down asked gf if she had an am radio which she did turned it on and started at the low end of the bc band comparing each station with the sound from the stove this was a slow process since we had to wait for the burner to cool every minutes or so it didnt bother gf or me because gfmom left us alone kept tuning till i got to am and we almost got blasted out of the kitchen by audio that was synchronized with the noise coming out of the stove that signal was strong called the station and the tech there said that they had recently boosted their power from w to kw the transmitting towers were just across the parkway from gfs house with that amount of power almost any slightly poor connection could act as a detector for am radio if it had any excuse for an antenna in this case the ac power line when the burner was switched on after the burner cooled down i unplugged the stove and checked the connections to the rightrear burner sure enough one of them was just a little loose when it warmed up it tightened up enough to stop the crystal set emulation one quarter turn of the loose screw and the talking and singing were silenced when gfmom returned i demonstrated the silent stove she was happy and insisted that i stay for a lasagna dinner since she was an excellent italian cook that was an offer i couldnt refuse tldr silenced a talking and singing stove got to spend unplanned day with gf mostly alone gfmom said mangia don ate a lot of great lasagna after thought i later heard that in gfs neighborhood people had talking bathtub and sink drains musical light fixtures and singing furniture i never did find out how they fixed those problems but im sure that all of them were pseudo crystal sets just like the stove editing format
i recently posted a few old tales about spam issues at my from the early s when i was still working frontline a huge spike in spam occurred because a single angry employee was able to steal a full list of every single email address we provided and sold it to spammers he just had to plug in a thumbdrive and accessed our billing database and copied everything easy as pie in the wake of the crisis administrative rules came down demanding that unauthorized staff refrain from plugging in thumbdrives phones and such to company boxes of course a security policy enforced by internal it would have been more effective than an administrative dont do it but lets not go crazy halfmeasures are the rule not the exception here people didnt mind much it made sense and those with reasons to be exempted were easily accommodated people started charging their cellphones in power outlets instead of usb and everybody moved on often literally unionized employees in senior positions stick around for a long time but both frontline and lower level management have relatively high turnover rates administrative rules gets twisted over time as their intent and the reasons why they were originally implemented are forgotten through the years as staff rotates many years later a new floor director started cracking down on charging cellphones at work at all now calling it electricity theft the cost to charge cellphones is trivial and people regularly use their personal phones for purposes that ultimately benefit the company like tests so that looked like pioneering new grounds in the art of being insanely cheap weve since learned that this happened merely because the new director thought preventing electricity theft was the original intent behind the rule at the time staff was more than a little unhappy to be told they werent supposed to charge their phones at work over this misunderstanding though the notion of electricity theft had some employees blowing a fuse and getting into heated arguments someone who was quitting told hr and the union in a mandatory meeting that it was one of the reasons he felt undervalued as an employee and that the company no longer deserved his services but that still didnt change anything awhile later i was taking an escalation call from an employee trying to troubleshoot a caller id issue all our business lines have confidential numbers so the usual way to test a customers caller id is to call them with a cellphone i made a joke about it during a call that some people took more seriously than i intended gt frontline tech so the customers caller id wasnt working like you asked i tried pushing the service profile to value added services server again so i guess now we just need to test it to see if it works gt bytewave sarcastically oh i see this is a situation where you cant test our caller id fix because youd need to use your cellphone but your battery is dead and we cant do it with our business lines well have to tell the customer we cant test whether our solution worked because youre not allowed to charge your phone here anymore as that would be electricity theft the frontline tech knew i was kidding and laughed his phone was fine but several other escalation techs around my desk turned their heads towards me grinning i already knew the fix was successful but i didnt realize my joke would get traction the frontline tech was amused but may have been the only one to understand i was kidding he used his phone for the test and confirmed all was well now but fellow senior staff around me thought i was giving them a loud hint about how to push back against the electricity theft nonsense they started using every excuse they could to lament on recorded lines that something couldnt be done because there was no way to charge a phone i was often working remotely at the time and didnt realize that was now a thing within a few weeks word had spread far enough that a manager went to see the electricity theft floor director saying it seemed like a major issue that techs couldnt charge their phones anymore because of his strict directive apparently they discussed various solutions like having some lab test lines switched to open ids specifically for this but the number of locations we operate in including contractors made this a fair bit of trouble and got the floor director to instead escalate the issue to the divisions vp who then issued a bold directive nixing the entire policy the way it was explained to him it was just about saving a few dollars off power costs and it didnt seem worth it anymore having completely forgotten it was originally intended for security purposes he wrote it off right now everybody is allowed to plug in their phone or a usb stick in their workstation for any reason and could be a few clicks away from copying whatever customerrelated information they want people were happy to be able to charge their phones again and so far nobody misused it but things like this make me wonder whether the whole company is just secretly recording us for a comedy show not only was the initial fix utterly insufficient but they failed to remember its purpose and then rolled it back because a few people decided to joke about it you cant make this stuff up all of bytewaves tales on 
i receive at ticket saying the above but had something i needed to do so i called afterwards please note its around pm on a friday afternoon before easter weekend i call the landline which keeps ringing and finally forwards to her cellphone i hear someone pick up and theres loud music and the person yelling gtuser hello i cant hear you gtme hi this is burncycle from comit calling about the ticket you submitted a few minutes ago gtuser i really cant hear yoh ive left the building already can i call you back im on the plane and im about to go under click im sorry youre about to go under on a plane should i call someone maybe 
sorry if this isnt strictly tech support but seeing as it plays a large factor i thought it was relevant background im still in college my soon to be husband is graduating ahead of me and since my credits oddly transfer to whatever communication program exists in the world im looking for jobs for both of us somewhere out of the american south ive worked tech support for my dads consulting business and all his clients since i was knee high and while ive never been it it was what everyone called me i freelance in social media marketing to help put myself through school which is about as difficult as youd think it is as in not really at all older computer illiterate people just dont understand the internet but can really be getting into a younger market with a little bit of help i have a rate that turns out at about hr depending on how much of my help they need because i work in a lot of really teeny businesses i often help the owners fix computers and set up their phones on the side im very accustomed to genuinely confused clients and bosses today a small marketing firm out of a major new england city called me for a phone interview everything had been going really well and i had spoken to them several times we even had a time set up for an inperson interview in march when i would be in town the employees id dealt with were super nice and there had been no red flags up to this point id actually become rather close with a specific guy who id talked to and emailed multiple times over the last few weeks and who i know is a redditor well call him geoff i had his extension number and his personal email address the person on the other end for the interview was significantly older than anyone else id dealt with he sounded like a late s smoker who would have been better suited for a manufacturing plant he starts giving me scenarios asking how id respond to them really weird things like if one of our clients made cupcakes that killed one out of every three customers how you would respond to that every time after the second sentence of my response he cuts me off saying ok thats enough sweetheart after about minutes of this he suddenly asks do you know anything about resetting wireless routers we really need someone to do that we just had to fire our it guy because he kept messing up lying bastard anyway would always clear his internet history you dont do that do you because only liars do that i spent a couple of seconds in complete silence wondering what the hell i just heard i eventually said yes i do know a good bit about networking setups what seems to be the issue he then details how he tried to install this browser tracking and keylogging software on the network so that he knew his employees werent liars he had also installed security cameras so that he could see how much they were taking breaks i needed to be ok with that i also helped him install a wireless mouse now he was speaking really loud i had to turn down the volume all the way on my phone and still had to hold it away from my ear by now i was sort of scared that the employees didnt know about any of this i decided to stall telling him that was going to have to talk to my fiance and see if the dates lined up for when he first needed me i obviously wasnt taking the job he wanted me to start as soon as possible i got off the phone and immediately called geoff i asked him if hed heard any of that he confirmed that he had heard everything and that no one had been aware of what was going on hed checked his processes and there it was a keylogger as well as some other random software installed that dumped everything hed done during the entire day into a file on his bosss pc he told me hed call me back he had to call a lawyer then quit he called me back later and told me the entire office did just that people theyre starting their own firm and have invited me to join once they get on their feet the owner had died a year or so ago and this guy had bought the business his previous job head of sales for a sofa making company tldr big brother is revealed in a phone interview entire office quits edit just got a text again from geoff though he didnt give me any information on how his boss was doing it apparently he was recording every phone conversation in the place and saving it without notifying anyone including the person on the other end there had also been some discrepancies with pay with half an hour being taken off somehow or being made to work an hour longer apparently even though most were salaried he had been docking their checks for every minute spent on nonworkrelated activities theyre hoping they can sue him just on the phone conversations alone
previous tales from dishonest used car gtso why is it that the red one is so much slower mr ferrari one of our salespersons was in my office at dishonest used car dealership attempting once again to get me to fix something that wasnt broken gtmf i drove both the red one and the grey one over the weekend and the red one is just sooooooo much slower theres no way i can sell it with how slow it is its not even drivable he was on a tirade about our vanagons as you may remember from the story where one made a jailbreak on we would buy rattedout rustbox vw vanagons at auto auctions and then spend nearly in parts and labor swapping in vw l turbodiesels into them this had the side effect of making them even slower with the benefit of them getting exactly the same shtty fuel economy as before in fact slow does not even being to describe it they were positively glacial gtme look you submitted a trouble ticket this morning i gave both the grey one and the red one a drive and i cant tell the difference theyre both slugs all of em are gtmf i dont understand why this is so difficult its pretty clear to me what the problem is the grey one has a turbo and the red one doesnt gtme uh both have tdi engines in them theyre both turbocharged all tdis are turbocharged thats what the t in tdi stands for now if theres something wrong with the red one it might not be building boost pressure and it would feel sluggish i can have a tech troubleshoot it but well have to bill for it gtmf no youre not going to charge us a fcking thing because whatever tech put the tdi in the red one just forgot to put the turbo on it and thats services fault not sales before i had a chance to interrogate the bizarre misconceptions he was operating under he marched out now to people who dont know cars turbochargers must seem like magical devices i suspect people who dont know how they work think theyre like a lightning bolt sticker or something that you just stick to the side of the engine block congratulations you are now officially turbocharged this award confers the right to make more power theyre actually very simple and clever devices turbochargers instead of routing the engines exhaust directly out the exhaust pipe its made to spin an impeller first capturing energy from the exhaust that impeller spins a compressor which forcefeeds air into the engines intake more air than the engine can otherwise draw on its own more air means you can inject more fuel and more fuel means more power but because the turbocharger is mounted directly to the exhaust manifold between it and the exhaust pipe its not really possible to just forget to put it on thered be a big hole there youd notice i wrote up a repair order and gave it to lord salisbury one of the techs to take a look at gti say ill be damned if i can tell what hes on about lord salisbury thunked the repair order onto my desk gtls it builds boost pressure just fine i get bar of pressure at full throttle right within spec i put a scope in the manifold you know those early tdis like to clog up their intake manifolds but its clean enough near as i can tell its just as slow as those vans ever are but no slower i had a run down the interstate with the grey one and ill be damned if i can tell the difference gtme cool ill bill sales for wasting your time gtls let me know what happens lord salisbury wandered back to the bay and i paged mr ferrari who appeared immediately from the sales office i tossed him the vanagon key gtme give it a drive tell me what you think he took off in the vanagon only to reappear less than minutes later gtmf whatever you did to it its even worse than before i couldnt even get on the freeway its so slow this is not acceptable i dont get what the problem is here just quit fcking around and put a turbo on it for fcks sake i paged lord salisbury and had him bring the grey vanagon around and park it next to the red one we popped open the engine covers on both i indicated to the two of them a snailshaped object buried in the engine bay on the grey one gtme lord salisbury would you agree that this is a turbocharger gtls i would i pointed to the same object on the red one gtme and would you agree this also is a turbocharger gtls indeed gtme so would you agree it is reasonable to say that both of these engines are turbocharged gtls i would agree mr ferrari did not have a pleasant look on his face gtmf i dont know what the point of this perry mason bullsht is but its clear to me you two just dont want to fix whats wrong with the red one get off your lazy asses put a fcking turbo on it and stop wasting my fcking time and with that he stomped back into his office lord salisbury rolled his eyes and slammed closed the engine covers we stood out in the lot for a bit trying to figure out our game plan at a certain point mr ferrari would get fed up enough that he would go to rom and the amazon and the two of them were a whole order of magnitude more insane and unreasonable than he we stood surveying the two vehicles for a bit just thinking about how we were going to solve this nonexistent problem a moment later miami vice my new lackey stepped out of the office to see what was going on he was a smart kid and a hard worker but he didnt know much about cars gtmv whats going on guys gtme oh mr ferrari is a dipsht hes got himself all in a tizzy about the red van not being turbocharged or something gtmv well it isnt is it lord salisbury and i gave a quizzical look miami vice explained his reasoning the moment he said it it was blindingly obvious gthey dude can you get me a quote on a new turbocharger for an early tdi jetta ought to work i was on the phone with my contact at the old volkswagen dealership i used to work at he was a grizzled old man who knew these cars inside and out he was grumpy irritable and addicted to pain killers he was great gthim theyre not cheap you have one blow on you you know its usually not the turbo on these its often the vnt vanes sticking or a clogged manifold gtme no no i just need a price on a turbo its a long story he laughed he had been around long enough to know what was going on gthim looks like with your discount its gtme cool hey do you have part number cagx in stock gthim looks like ive got three you want it on your weekly delivery or you want it rushed gtme asap this afternoon if i can have it gthim you got it you want that turbocharger on the truck too gtme uh yeah i guess why not later that afternoon a white van bearing the vw logo pulled into the driveway the driver tossed me a box with a turbocharger and a small envelope inside and drove off i summoned lord salisbury to the red vanagon gtme you wanna do the honors or shall i gtls oh i suppose i can muster up the strength to do it i handed over the envelope and from it lord salisbury pulled out a part he cleaned off a spot on the lower right of the back of the van and with all the gravitas he could muster placed the part in its new home he stood back and admired his handiwork there on the back of the vanagon shone in all its glory a little chrome badge that read turbo we had previously stuck a turbo badge on the grey one just as a joke since it was so miserably slow and now the two matched this was miami vices great insight the grey one said turbo and it had a turbo the red one did not say turbo ergo it must not have one brilliant right undoubtedly at some point the lack of a badge on the red one had registered somewhere in mr ferraris primitive lizard brain and now it was unconsciously at least tainting his perception of the vans performance lord salisbury dusted off his hands and went back to work on his other projects for the remainder of the afternoon as for me i summoned mr ferrari who appeared in a moment from his office gtme i had lord salisbury do a bunch of work to the engine today including bolting on a brand new turbocharger from volkswagen gtmf oh good you even got the little badge on there good he noticed gtme what id like you to do is drive the grey one first then the red one and tell me whether you think they drive about the same sound like a plan mr ferrari climbed into the grey vanagon and went off on his test drive a half hour later having driven both he came into my office positively beaming according to him the red one drove like a brand new car and it was easily the fastest vanagon we had in fact he had half the office staff give it a drive and everyone agreed it was a speed demon by vanagon standards from then on we added a turbo badge to every diesel vanagon we built it was never an issue again oh and the repair order somehow someone accidentally billed sales for a turbo replacement rather than a badge lord salisbury somehow got paid hours of labor to stick a badge on the back and an extra tdi turbocharger somehow wound up in inventory but i dont know anything about all of that
first call of the day its short but good for a chuckle gtperson can you fix my email mine is pink and the other persons is yellow mine needs to look like hers my manager and i took a few turns asking questions to try to narrow it down until we just decided to have them send us a picture turns out they were using different applications file this one under pebkac

hi again tfts i am delighted to report that my favorite users to date have made first contact you can find the original story here i arrive at my desk tuesday morning and sit at my desk for probably the first time in february ive been dragged from site to site and am excited to stay in my office and work on some remote administration for a change i open our ticketing system to get the lay of the land and notice two tickets from this morning they are from someone named jake working at the same address as the two diesel mechanics who had so impressed me with their eagerness to read manuals on their computers before using them the tickets are like nothing i have seen before instead of its broken or come fix thisnow or even someone put porn on my google i am looking at a block of text all capital letters too but ill spare you that reads something like this computer inventory number xxxxxxxxxxxx computer powers on but does not successfully power on self test computer at no time reaches windows boot screen computer instead beeps in a pattern consistent with mobo user guides description of a ram hardware failure need technician to confirm andor replace i am floored by this ticket as i am reading the second one a third pops up since i am the only person in our office right now i lock up and drive across town to the garage on arriving i find my way back to the room where i left the greasemonkies previously and let myself in inside a kid of maybe is seated at a laptop with a greasemonkey at each shoulder they are both holding notepads and barking orders at the kid who i presume is jake my two favorite users positively beam and greet me in turn one of them turns to the typist and tells him to get his ass back in the garage he scoops his hat off the desk and scurries out of the office looking a bit traumatized they have machines with problems one they have diagnosed with hardware issues and the other are having problems with product keys or misconfigured software i am impressed by their work but i am curious as to how they figured out some of these issues i inquire into this and they tell me that jake had told them about something called internet search engines on discovering that navigating the internet required the use of a keyboard they had forced jake to do all of their searches this had apparently started on friday of the previous week ticketing and emails they successfully figured out using some kind of latent googlefu that the motherboard was the part that was beeping and that it had a manual that spelled out exactly what its complaint was they then debugged every single problem to the best of their ability and started submitting tickets first thing this morning i was very impressed i boxed up the problematic machines and told them to expect replacements later that day i drove them back and dropped them at the it workshop to be fixed up and placed an order for new machines to be sent back the head tech and i agreed it was time for us to treat these guys so the tech office started a pool and bought them a fairly nice bottle of whiskey to be delivered with the laptops when i dropped everything off they were delighted they told me i should bring my fellow techies over on friday after work to drink and talk shop and for probably the first time in my life i am looking forward to spending time with my users tldr somewhere far far away a kid looks over his shoulder before pulling out his smartphone
 why do all good offices get ruined eventually a new ticket review system had recently been set up it allowed users to give feedback on completed tickets it was tedious i sat down at my computer the business consultant walked into the office gtcon so we need to go over the reviews for the last few days i looked down at the list of reviews i couldnt think of a worse way to spend an afternoon gtme yes ive already taken a look the business consultant started smiling it was weird gtcon oh but you havent been through it with me yet gtme alas i have been without your valuable insights perhaps you read through these and ill go fix some equipment then we can pool our thoughts at the end gtcon what needs fixing coffee wasnt around for ideas gtme errrr gtcon plus we never get any alone time itll be good to go through this together gtme oh i need to wash out that smelling laptop gtcon hahaha hardly urgent okay open up the first review i stared down at the computer finger hovering over the enter key might as well get this over with click gthey it i loved the promptness everything was backup in under minutes thanks again finance secretary gtme seemspositive gtcon oh my looks like someone loves it not much we can get outta that one next click gtthanks again for the loaner laptop this one didnt smell i hear you got a bad one in the batch now still keep up the good work sales rep i stared at the screen what was happening gtcon another positive review good god airz and here i thought i was the only one here that liked you gtme sorry what gtcon ernext click gti give you everything was done as expected analyst three good reviews in a row gtcon eight out of ten yes write that down somewhere room for improvement it seems gtme yes eight out of ten click i started reading the first line of the review it was glowing i was interrupted from going further by the business consultant gtcon i think thats probably enough for today dont want to stop you from the laptop i smiled without coffee around it felt good gtme oh its hardly urgent gtcon no no i think perhaps this needs some tweaking tweaking dangerous word very dangerous indeed 
a enduser who read too many things online about new technologies to extend battery life convinced himself that there were already working phones on the market that did not need to be recharged at all and insisted so much they convinced one of our salesmen out in the field salesman then called tech support frontline asking about that technology and which brand of our magic phones we should sell him as tech senior staff i get escalations from frontline employees who do not know what to answer all too often incredibly silly stuff gets to my desk but that day i wasnt being called about magic batteries just listening to the call for mandatory evaluation as the salesman complained to management after being told we had no magic batteries about a minute into that call gt auggie the frontline tech no i assure you were not currently selling any phones that do not need to be recharged and though some experiments are in progress and documented on the internet about leeching from the radio frequency spectrum to extend battery life no such device is commercialized anywhere your customer got worked up over something that basically doesnt exist yet but i can tell you which of our highend smartphones have the longest battery life gt salesman no no the customer showed me all about it online on his phone we have phones now that dont need to be charged anymore maybe were not selling them ourselves but theyre out there if you dont know about it please escalate immediately ill hold frontlines purpose is precisely to ensure that escalation staff has to handle the least amount of frivolous calls as possible theyre there to filter the insanity and though they sometimes fail to i liked auggies reponse a lot gt auggie no im sorry but i have enough relevant information and knowledge already on this topic im paid precisely so that i filter calls where no additional input is needed so that their much smaller department doesnt have to spend time on trivial issues so i would be not doing my job what your customer wants isnt commercially available since im sure of that i will not escalate gt salesman give me your supervisors name and phone number now auggie gave him that information as he was supposed to but then the salesman still insisted to hear from tsss so he very politely hung up superb work i looked at other logs and confirmed he had no issue escalating real issues to us he just knew this one wasnt worth our time and said no when his supervisor got a call from the salesman a minute later the supervisor also confirmed it was proper policy to refuse to escalate if a tech is certain he knows the right answer already and then did what they have to do per procedure anytime someone complains about something technical have my department listen to the call thats why i was listening to this whole thing frankly i love it when everything went just right despite a complaint and everyone followed procedure like this it takes my mind off all the times things get screwed up spectacularly since the salesman who was easily convinced magic batteries are available wasnt tech staff lets say that part doesnt count but what about the meat of the story the issue of magic batteries that do not need to be recharged well its not wholly made up theres a lot of money being spent to extend battery life and it doesnt just boil down to packing in more mahs and making displays more powerefficient these are the ways devices currently maximize battery life but there really are some serious research efforts out there aiming for better solutions such as a kickstarter for a phone which harvests lost power back from the devices radio frequency emission to give a limited boost to battery life for a few years there have been studies and experiments about wirelessly harvesting power from the rf spectrum at large and other to reduce and some hopeful say eventually eliminate the need for manual battery recharge on efficient lowusage devices energy harvesting in is fun to read about but its nothing practical when it comes to mobile phones right now there may well come a day when we can commercially sell phones that only have to be recharged if you used the screen extensively thanks to these efforts but today is not that day all of bytewaves tales on 
yesterday afternoon i received a call from my former boss my company was recently purchased by a larger company and he decided to stay with the part of the company that wasnt part of the purchase we have a tsa in place so i get calls from time to time to help out when they built out their network they did their best to mirror what was in place before so they bought all the same equipment and configured it pretty much exactly the same they are trying to setup their new network and he asked if he could take a look at things since they couldnt get authentication to work its been going on for two weeks and they just cant figure it out sure not a problem im a juniper engineer but ive dabbled with ad before and i have no problem giving a hand to the guy that hired me for this gig we go through the configs and everything looks good i found a couple issues but once we got those squared away it should have worked it was close to cob so he told me hed do some testing in the morning and we parted ways this morning my phone rang and its my old boss again kiltedcajun we still cant get authentication to work right can you take a look at this we fire up a gotomeeting and he starts logging into the dc through the hypervisor when i notice that the time on the server is the same as the time on his laptop i also know that the server hes logging into is a timezone away from where he is i asked him when they moved that server to the home office and he said the hadnt but wanted to know why i asked well i see that the time is in central time i thought that server was in the eastern time zone gtyeah i got tired of being confused about the time zone difference so i just set the clock back an hour gtoh so you just changed the time zone gtnah i just rolled it back gtthats weird ntp shouldnt allow you to do that gti disabled ntp it kept fixing the time every time id log in it would be back to eastern time and it was pissing me off i wasnt sure what i should say at this point i was actually kinda dumbfounded i calmly explained that kerberos has very strict time controls and that when he changed the clock the way he did he broke everything gtthat cant be it the time on the laptop and the server are the same its within that minute limit youre talking about again i explain that because he left the server time zone set to eastern and the laptop was set to central there was actually an hour difference i told him to reenable ntp and try again gtthats not going to work gtplease just humor me on this one ntp gets enabled and he goes to do his test and all i hear come across the phone was gtwell ill be damned thanks kiltedcajun ive gotta run click i decided to forgo that other cup of coffee for my blood pressure medicine after this incident but i thought you guys would get a kick out of it read my second story in 
 gt help ticket ac gt i cant enter call data into the customer service page it just sits there when i click save i call the user up and get remoted into the users computer i instantly see the problem its happened rather frequently the past week or so so i instantly close out all of her open browser windows and head to control panel remove the coupon commander ask toolbar yahoo toolbar aol toolbar minutes later during a reboot she finally asks gt user were those causing all of the issues with call data gt me yeah any browser addin can mess with the customer service app gt user well how did all that stuff get installed gt me you had to install them at some point its pretty hard for them to get installed without someone approvingaccepting the install gt user well i never installed that stuff it must have been on the computer when i got it i dont respond not worth the effort to fight with her over this on a short day before a holiday her computer comes back up i have her log in and she enters the calls perfectly gt user thanks that fixed it can i show you something else thats wrong gt me sure im still connected she opens her downloads and i see a row of ask toolbar installers copies of the adobe reader installer various other installers for stuff that she really should not install on her work computer gt user when i install this it doesnt work and i am one of those coupon queens it would be great if you could fix it gt me maam you have copies of ask toolbar installer various other apps where did those come from gt user well it came up and said it would improve my internet experience if i installed it and the internet is kind of slow sometimes so i thought it would help gt me so you installed the toolbars gt user i installed these toolbars but they improve the internet not slow it down gt me those toolbars are the things that were causing the problem with the call data it was preventing you from working gt user no those improve the internet not stop it from working gt me ok im going to make a few more changes to your system i removed her power user rights and deleted all her internet improving applications she had downloaded i sent her the computer use policy to review and resign highlighting the parts where she is not allowed to install any nonwork related applications on company equipment and i ccd her boss helpdeskboss instantly replied that his people have to be able to install software and i shoot him back a copy of the chat log from the remote session i tell him if he can convince her that installing things that break work related things is bad she wasnt getting install rights back he elevated to his boss and his boss told him to train his staff better 
im a very calm amp reasonable person i can count on one hand the number of times ive raised my voice in a professional setting and this was one of them many years ago i worked for an msp that supported a large corporate office my team was responsible for the usual desktop support hardware issues software installs etc one day i get a ticket that a machine wont boot so i head on over there to check it out when i roll up on this desk im greeted with the sight of the pc completely disassembled and i mean completely every component is out and spread out very neatly on the desk all the way down to the mb whats um whats going on i had never encountered an enduser tearing down their machine so i wasnt quite sure how to process this the user looks over and says oh good are you here to put my computer back together the other guy said hed send someone whos the other guy you know the new guy he said hed fix it for me i have other tickets piling up so i figure ill figure out mystery guy later i reassemble everything turn the machine on and i see right away that its not booting because someone left a floppy disk in the drive i pop it out and everything is fine after things slow down i go on a hunt amp eventually piece together what happened another department outside of it had hired an engineering student as an intern he was good with computers so they asked him to look at this machine amp see if he could fix it he took it apart to look for problems and then couldnt remember how it all went back together panicked and called it into the helpdesk as machine wont boot id love to say that he got canned for that but turns out he was the son of someone important in the company he tried an internship with engineering but couldnt keep up so they shifted him over to the business unit rep team interface between users amp it this was apparently the second machine he had completely dismantled so i had some rather harsh words with him about where his responsibility ended which i clearly defined as anything short of physically touching a pc he was there for another months before he went back to school where rumor has it he eventually failed out i still imagine hes out there somewhere randomly taking machines apart as his first troubleshooting step

this is another tale from the late s let me set the scene i had a rich uncle he was a senior partner in a major civil engineering firm who had an even richer neighbor played the cello in broadway musicals the neighbor had one of the original really expensive garage door openers expensive but very cheaply built no remote just honk your horn to openclose the door his problem was that the door would activate randomly even in total quiet my uncle told him that i was pretty good with electronics so he called me and offered me if i could fix it as it was driving him crazy that was a small fortune to a teenager in the late s so i hopped on my bicycle and got there as fast as i could when i got there i checked out the electronics and found that it used a microphone obviously a tube audio amplifierdetector strange tube iirc volt filament a pentode section for amplification and a triode section for detection and relay activation ending with a sensitive stepper relay updownupdownetc while i was there it activated and put the door down i didnt hear anything so i started thinking about sneak signal paths power line noise etc i went home got a pair of highimpedance headphones and my homework and returned i attached the headphones to the input of the detector and could hear myself making minute noises that were being picked up by the microphone this was a good sign whatever was activating the system would be audible in the headphones i started doing my homework while listening to the headphones gtidlewild tower this is united idlewild was the name of the major international airport in new york city later renamed to jfk we were nearly under the approach to one of the runways up went the garage door the cable to the microphone was about wavelength at megacycles mhz to the youngsters right in the middle of the aviation band back to the bicycle got a uf capacitor and soldering kit connected the capacitor from the pentodes grid to ground and closed the garage door finished my homework with no further garage door activations collected my and an lp of the latest play the neighbor was performing in and went home another happy ending happy neighbor proud uncle and much much richer me
i used to work for a website hosting company it was actually a call center for later hosting companies with various names that all were owned by the same company and run in the same datacenter its a slow day i take this call from some guy and hes super pissed about a ddos that was making traffic to his server screech to a halt admins were mitigating traffic and getting it under control it would probably be resolved within minutes or so but he wanted an instant fix which i couldnt guarantee he got pissed off and said hes canceling his hosting account then hangs up the phone next call i get its the exact same dude but he called one of the other brands he didnt recognize my voice somehow we had talked literally five maybe ten minutes prior obviously he didnt do any research on hosts and just searched for a rate plan he liked he rages that hes super pissed with other brand and wants to switch to our main brand because hes sick of their crappy support and wants help uploading his data to this new account he created by the end of the call he told me my service was great and he was really looking forward to working with our support team as he migrated his data yeah same support even the same agent in this case lol same equipment same datacenter literally the same everything except the color scheme in the account management software i didnt correct him if he was too dumb to research any of the alternative options he had and this information was so easy to find then i didnt pity him at all i remember stumbling across his account like two or three years later and there was an email from him thanking us for our amazing service and switching to that company was the best thing he had ever done lol his data maybe moved like feet to another row of servers and that new server his data moved to was older and had lower performance specs
read part here first off i love you guys all you guys p i quickly set the siso app to notify me when the employee changed his status from in office to meeting then i went in the cold room and got one of the spare laptops pulled the drive and dropped it into a hdd cradle a few seconds later i had a blank hard in hand as i was heading up the hallway towards no it land as i turned the corner i see the employee heading into the developer managers office and i see the door close i look around nonchalantly and see the hallway is empty so i let myself into the employees office i step around to his laptop push the power button until it powers down and then whip out the multitool i flip the laptop over and i remove two screws a few seconds later another flip and i push the power button i watch as it begins to post a small grin at the missing operating system message and then i head back to my cave once i get back to my office i drop his drive into my hdd cradle then i start it ghosting it to an image file i tab around doing a few things while the drive is imaging and smile at the new mail ding i tab over and find i got him out of his office for minutes i couldnt think of anything to keep him out of his office any longer was that enough time i start to reply to his message when my phone rings gt me hello you got it how can i help you today gt employee hey yeah this is buck over in development i came back to my computer and it says missing operating system thats bad right gt me yeah thats bad whats the tag number on your machine gt buck its a dll laptop we got them about six months ago did i lose all of my data gt me well it sounds like something is wrong with your disk i tab over and see that the drive is about halfway done imaging ill come up in a second let me send this email gt buck ok thanks ill be here in my office i tab over to the email reply to developer manager he has a hardware issue im going up to see what is going on exactly i grin at that and head up towards bucks office the developer manager is at his door with a very pale complexion gt devman what happened why does his computer not have an operating system gt me i dont know ive not had a chance to look at his laptop i can give you an update once ive had a chance to look at it gt devman that man has stuff that has to be completed on time you better not have done something to cause him to miss a deadline i dont think ive ever wanted to pimp slap a man and tell him to slow his roll more than at that point gt buck he didnt do anything to the laptop yet i just called him gt devman i know what he does around here i just want it fixed buck actually looks more uncomfortable about the situation than i am with developer managers attitude gt me ill update you once i look at his laptop it might be something simple ill come by your office i point down the hall at his door and tell you what i find out developer manager stares at my finger for an uncomfortably long time then turns away with a huff and heads towards his office buck and i share a grimace and he moves aside so i can get at the laptop i do the once over checking for thumb drives disks in the dvd drive and then i force a reboot and go into cmos gt me well it sees the hard drive and the boot order is set right gt buck so the drive is just suddenly blank gt me not sure at this point im going to take it back to our area and test it ill give you a call when i have an idea about whats going on with it when do you normally clock out for the day gt buck pm then im gone until monday gt me long weekends are nice gt buck son is getting married his fiances parents are paying for most of it so that means we have to go out of state i unplug his power adapter keyboard mouse and speakers then stand gt me well congratulations ill try to get back to you asap gt buck thanks to be honest im kind of hoping you dont get it fixed laugh gt me well im found of those multigrain chips in the vending machine laugh its probably something simple ill call you back shortly it will either be a quick fix or a few hours of replacement parts i head out of his office and turn towards the developer managers office i knock on the door frame and see another outburst about to come out of him i decide ive heard enough gt me wait dont say a word or before this is over what did you say exactly was it im going to have your head he doesnt say anything but i can tell he is thinking wonderfully awful things about me gt me not a wordill have his laptop fixed in about mins well before the time he normally leaves the office and you feel the need to show your butt like that again after dragging me into a world of lies then the next meeting with hr wont be about your inability to submit a form he looks about ready to pop i give him another finger the index in a hold on gesture gt me if youd submitted the form when you first started this mess i would have done this while he was at lunch three hours ago any stress this is causing you is your fault and i will not be verbally abused because you are stressed about something i smile and turn to leave his office i figure that one will come back around to bite me but thats fine wont be the first time hes cried about something i said back at my desk the drive is almost done imaging so i turn his laptop over and pull the tray to remove the blank drive i stick a sticky note on it with the word bad drivecheck warranty his drive finishes imaging and then i mount the image to check it has what appears to be proper file structure which it does i plug his drive back into his laptop replace the cover and turn it on windows loading screen pops up and i go to the cold room to get a power adapter on the way back to my office supervisor comes in with a frown on his face gt supervisor did you threaten to harm the developer manager gt me maybe here you listen to what i said i toss him my phone while he listens i go back the laptop and get the power adapter hooked up windows has a message up about improper shutdown and not to do that again i look through the drive and it seems to be ok i shutdown the laptop properly and close the lid gt supervisor did he really say im going to have your head gt me in an email want to see it gt supervisor no just dont stir that pot anymore than you need to ok gt me laugh ok did you listen to the one prior to that recording with a deep sigh supervisor hands me the phone and turns to leave shaking his head in what i take to be resignation first things first i head back to bucks office and offer him a repair hard drive i let him know that i reseated the drive and ran chkdsk it seems to have fixed the issue he seems happy when the laptop comes up to the windows screen and even more delighted when he doesnt appear to be missing any files i remind him to send a help ticket about his hard drive issue and wish him a safe journey out of state i go down to the developer managers office but the door is closed and i hear some heated conversation coming from inside his office i decide i will let him know everything is green with an email and head back to start the investigation i send developer manager an email letting him know that bucks laptop is repaired and back in his possession i then drop the bad drive in the cradle and start to image the file to the disk i go to the cold room and grab the spare laptop missing its bad drive back in my office i am delighted to see that buck did send the help ticket as requested developer managers response to my email is a short and somehow pithy thanks i close out some help tickets while waiting on the drive to finish imaging once it is done i plug it into the laptop windows boots up i get a machine name conflict and quickly disable the wlan adapter i get it plugged into a router to hide it from the rest of the network but allow me to get to the internet gotta be able to read reddit while all this crap runs right i start by scanning his computer for files out of place we generally look for mpwmampwmvavimpgjpggifziprartorrent etc occasionally you find a huge stash of music on computers which isnt necessarily a bad thing unless they are clearly downloaded mps its amazing how many times people claim they ripped a music cd down to a folder named vanowthatswhaticallsongsusretailloud its just said to see a guy set a boat on fire to fix the leak in it while hes headed for a waterfall sometimes we find things in strange locationsone kid had anime hidden in his driversetc folder for some strange reason i start filling in the check boxes and getting rather frustrated that this did indeed seem to be a witch hunt this guy has nothing on his laptop that would be considered improper program and features is clean he doesnt even have solitaire installed i copy his firefox profile over and set it to launch by default and open up firefox his browsing history is extremely boring the only thing i find thats not work related is a tendency to listen to various sermons on youtube hes got dropbox installed and hes saved his password in his browser i peek but there is nothing there as well i open up the training site and i see hes been spending a ton of time on the training for the next wave of software but hes a developer maybe he is reviewing the documentation before its publish to the customers i log his internet activity i attach a report of the past days from the proxy server and the data report from the firewall i run a file type report and save it to the investigation form as well he doesnt have enough media files to break the line on the pie chart i am really beginning to think this is a waste of time i open up setupdevlog i see he has a nook someplace i got back to see if i overlooked some ebooks i find about a dozen mostly web griffin books one clancy novel i add that to the report i rerun the file type report to include epub files not enough to change the pie chart i save a screen shot of usbdeview it doesnt have anything that screams look at me i decide to take a break and head over to supervisors office gt me hey ive not found anything worth trouble on his hard drive there was nothing in the logs before he seems to be a super boring person as far as his computer use goes gt supervisor really well when you get the job done let me know and i will take it to developer manager i do not think he wants to hear how boring this guy is and i dont want you taking anyones head from them even if he only seems to use it to hold up his hat sometimes i laugh and wave as i head out of his office i run by the software testing guys and replace a fuser in a laser printer theyve been working it pretty heavy printing stuff recently i get back to my desk and finish up the snoop job i run recentfileview and save that report yet another boring list of boring files opened by a boring guy i finally go back and archive his user folder his browser profiles and save a copy of the disk image file i type up my report in the form and send it to supervisor for review i head home and forget it about it to the best of my ability im up and about early the next morning thinking that maybe i got a sharepoke issue figured out that or i had a very strange nightmare involved workflow loops i get a call on my way into the office gt me hey this is me let me know what this call is about gt supervisor hey dont explode on me but i gotta ask did you do a thorough job on investigating bucks pc gt me yes gt supervisor why do i feel like im in physical danger you arent in the building yet are you gt me i wouldnt hurt you i know youre just doing your job but yes i did as much investigation as the job required the guy is super boring he has no activity that would cause use to report him for it to his manager or hr the worst he had was a bunch of random religious sermons in his browser history gt supervisor how are religious sermons bad gt me they arent but thats the worst he had im telling you the guys machine was clean his web reports are clean he does have a ton of traffic to the training site but that may be work related gt supervisor ok im meeting with developer manager in a few minutes i just wanted to make sure gt me alright talk to you later i get to the office and spend a good minutes answering email questions about store membership card spam no matter how many times you tell them someone always wants to get their free points to a store theyve never been to before im working on a mean green smoothie and watching some reports process when i get a visitor gt devman i need you to go over that laptop again you missed something gt me i didnt miss anything there was nothing there to find i can look again but the report will be the same gt devman ok then i want access to check it myself i stand up and grab the laptop i offer it to him he looks surprised gt devman so i can look at his computer to see why hes having trouble meeting deadlines gt me sure have at it i wouldnt get to excited though its not exactly his computer at this point its a copy of his computer but its a clone of what he left with yesterday gt devman oh ok i will give you a call if i need help gt me you do that you can login as an administrator to the laptop and look until the cows come home you might have trouble connecting to some things on the domain gt devman i can get to the internet on it tho right surely he isnt this dumb gt me yes you can get to the internet but you will have trouble running internal apps or accessing some of the servers but the internet should work fine gt devman ok thanks he turns to leave and i turn to send an email this is a notice that developer manager has the cloned machine to do a personal review of the activity of the user i sent it to supervisor hr devman and developer director i went back to the reports sending them off to their destinations and wondering why devman had it in for buck i get curious i log into the project server and i run a report on bucks assigned jobs i dont see a single missed deadline i dont see any outstanding deadlines either which is odd he is the only developer that doesnt have anything upcoming one of the new hires appears to have inherited part of bucks normal responsibility and he is missing deadlines pretty consistently i print this stuff to pdf and go back to finish up my reports soon im visited by supervisor and hr who both look a bit nervous standing in my doorway gt me did one of you spill the milk again gt hr no but why did you send that email gt supervisor yes are you trying to cause trouble gt me devman came in and wanted me to look again to find something on his employee i told him there was nothing to find he then requested to look himself and he seemed very interested in getting to the internet on that laptop gt supervisor surely you dont think hes going to fake up something and get us to find it on another pass gt me i dont think hes going to fake something up im sure enough that i already put a c note on it amazing what vegas bookies will accept a bet on these days birds attacking the side door is going today supervisor laughs and hr looks more confused gt hr so hes going to browse something non work related get you guys to find it and thenwhats he trying to accomplish i tell them about the project server and i speculate that hes wanting to get rid of buck for some reason i point out how the new guy is doing the training data and how nothing new has been assigned to buck recently hr tosses up his hands mumbles something and goes stomping off leaving supervisor standing in the door mouth agape gt supervisor seriously gt me sneaky devman wanting to do a snoop job without the form on a guy that hasnt missed a single deadline and who apparently has a brother than eats four whole chickens for lunch gt supervisor four whole chickens gt me its a blues brothers joke one of the brothers eats plain white toast while the other brother eats four whole chickens gt supervisor oh because hes a boring computer person right i nod and go back to my sharepoke workflow supervisor tells me to keep him informed and heads back to his office read part here
it had that odd smell of glue about it thats how i knew it was that time of year again compliance time gtme seriously though what is a compliance department gtcomliguy for the hundredth time we keep the workplace safe now can we please get on with this just select the sticker you think works best hed delivered a lot of stickers piles of them i wondered how anyone could even bother making this many different types gtme why again gtcomliguy seriously look these stickers are going to be placed on everyones computer case warning them that if theyre not a trained technician they should not open the computer how is this that hard for you to understand most of the stickers had a big warning exclamation mark my personal favorite was the sticker that had a skull and cross bones with the warning potential death id already tried to select it but alas it was apparently too shocking the right sticker for the right job i was told gtme ive worked in it for years very few people ever try and actually open a computer gtcomliguy very few so you admit some try these stickers are for those employees safety gtme couldnt we just you know let them try compliance department personel seemed oddly attached to the idea of putting stickers on everything recently theyd placed stickers on all the doors encouraging people to remember that doors are pinch hazards gtcomliguy let them try they could get electrocuted gtme so theyre getting a free lesson in electrical safety bonus i could tell the compliance guy was getting increasingly irate about my lack of enthusiasm for the stickers gtcomliguy how can you be so flippant about employee safety gtme i think i enjoy the enterprising spirit of an untrained employee blindly opening up a computer gtcomliguy you like it its so dangerous theyre untrained theyll probably be doing more damage than they fix compliances eyes scanned the room i could tell hed noticed my door did not have a pinch hazard sticker id peeled it off it was ugly gtme ive an idea gtcomliguy an idea for the stickers clearly stickers were the only thing on this guys mind i started to question his sanity gtme why dont we just hire smarter employees you know ones that wouldnt get a hand trapped in a door or ones that wouldnt try and pry open a computer when it isnt working gtcomliguy you dont have to be dumb for accidents to happen gtme so the stickers help how compliance guy almost completely lost it his love for stickers could not take my skepticism gtcomliguy placing stickers over the case will be another barrier of entry for people trying to open them theyll read the sticker before breaking it which would tell them they should be calling it this will save you time how are you not getting this gtme i guess i just find it hard to believe that someone who has gone out of their way to find a screwdriver take out any screws in the case and attempt to pry it open would be stopped by a sticker in fact im surprised you think people even read the things gtcomliguy were just trying to make the workplace safe we need people to just read the directions comliguy clearly had enough of me not accepting his one true love stickers he grabbed the pile of stickers off my desk and walked to the door he reached out and gave it a push the door wasnt opening he struggled with it for a few moments then he gave the door a mighty kick it swung outwards with great force and rebounded off the wall behind it hitting him as he made his way out and managing to knock his pile stickers onto the floor gtme perhaps we need a sticker for that dont open the doors with too much force no no dont kick doors or maybe rebounding door hazard i looked over at the compliance guy madly scrambling after the stickers hed dropped i began to feel a bit bad but then i noticed the pinch hazard sticker plastered on my door hed stuck it on well

we used an old web filter that was managed by the suppliers we had to email them to allow a site to become unblocked because software ai and didnt get everything perfectly correct corporate admin sent round an email stating that the company had an account with a well known ticket provider for national rail services and we were to use that with the supplied login to book travel tickets and check timetables if required first call of the day gtcustomer i need adding to the adult content group on the web filter gtme why it wasnt an unusual request as some services had access for reasons gtcustomer im trying to access a website and it states that its blocked for adult content gtme whats the site address and ill check if it is incorrectly classified ill raise a ticket for this and well get it sorted i had access to all sites for this purpose gtcustomer www dot new train ticketing websitecom gtme are you sure i remote to his machine and he is correct his browser is displaying the blocked for category adult content i check the site out on my machine and there is no adult content i then log the call and raise it with the supplier before theyve had an opportunity to look at it there are more calls for this same site same issue it manager wont allow access to the adult content filter to everyone because obvious reasons finally we get a resolution form the suppliers they are unable to whitelist the site no explanation other than its a technical issue and not a policy issue so it stays blocked one can only suspect the level of adult content that is inherent in a train timetable
previously on patches crazy tales one column just ah another saga from my past so here i am three inches of hard copy bug reports and i noticed there was one coming up again and again one regional office was complaining that a sales report was taking minutes to run this was originally designed to run at close so run time was never an issue however during sales pushes upper management asked for hourly updates which would lock the pos while this report ran i asked itspaz who have been there for awhile gt itspaz the customer is lying it doesnt take minutes gt me oh how so gt itspaz we ran it on the test machine and it only takes minutes now for those who know sql minutes is still ridiculously long for a query however why would a customer repeatedly escalate to the director that the queries took minutes i personally think that customer perception can be warped but there usually is an issue if the customer is reporting something this specific so i decided to take a look at the test machine about to date myself big time here it was a p meg totally state of the art that would be fine except the regional offices ran with meg huge difference i gave the order to dismantle the top of the line machine and turn it into a workstation somewhere i wanted a test machine that was identical to the regional office gt itspaz but the report will run slower gt me really i am shocked i finally got a legit test machine another thing i noticed was itspaz was only testing a single day worth of data instead of a month aggregate after the store closed that night i created an exact duplicate of their system and ran it on the test machine minutes exactly quick review of the code for some reason it deleted the indexes and rebuilt them before processing the numbers there was no legit reason to do this as indexes were automatically rebuilt any time the system was rebooted there were some other issues going on in the code building arrays instead of a properly written select but nothing i wasnt able to cleanup the policy of corporate was i had to choose a random store for each software push and wait a week for it to soak before rolling out another version i randomly chose the store that had been complaining about the report the loudest amazing how that worked code was pushed out and ready to be tested i ran the report remotely on their system before they opened up and knew it would exceed expectations late morning when store opens i called the manager gt manager oh my god no i cant run the report right now i have a line out the door and i cant risk locking up the register for that long gt me all right i understand i know you dont know me and my group doesnt exactly have the best reputation with you when you are ready to test please call me back before you push the button i would like to be on the phone when it runs gt manager ok but it wont be for awhile two hours later i get the call gt manager this better not lock up my register for another minutes gt me i need you to trust me push the button gt manager all right here i go gt manager gtgtinaudible squealsltlt gtgtsound of printer in backgroundltlt she called her director who called my director to explain that i managed to get the run time down to zero that is you push the button it prints this is how any sql based report should run if properly written in my opinion i used that strategy for all of my test locations and amazingly turned around corporate opinion about my group in a very short period of time they even had an expose about me in the company newsletter that created its own amusing nontechnicalrelated stories

i wanted to share this story because the sweet taste of justice the problem is this is not exactly it related and i dont know if this is the right channel but we hear about sewing machines lawsuits and dishonest car shops so ill give this a go this story happened years ago and is mainly about by dad my dad was a great business man and had build a great company that sold advanced cable monitoring systems and safety system for large factories specifically those with highly automated assembly lines i did tech support for my father during those years and we always talked about large events around the dinner table so one night my dad looked really puzzled we didnt really have taboo subjects in my family so i inquired gt me hey whats up gt dad i dont really know i got this lawsuit today but i cant remember this order or project at all gt mom where is it from my mom remembers everything gt dad from pissed off company gt mom i dont remember that either lets figure it out after dinner we lived right next to the office which was just a house out in the country so they went to work after dinner and i went to my room to fix my computer now my dad sold his company some years back before this story unfolds to a business friend in a different country and was rehired as the acting ceo of basically the same company he sold good money and a good position at this time my father was years old and at some point he might retire this move was great because it was easier to leave the company and his employees would still have work security in total the company was in countries with one head office which meant acting ceos and one to rule them all some days later my parents found out more about the order and had contacted the company that did the lawsuit to get some more details because they could not remember doing the order at all and this was a close to digit million dollar order those were rare and was something you would remember they requested a copy from the contract they received when they got the contract it just became weird my fathers signature was on the contract no one in my fathers company could remember a thing about this so my father drafted me into browsing their system for any clue i could find i collected everything i could from the project and gave it to my father as i could only find the information but not really understand the significance of it a week later i came home from school and i could hear my father yelling loudly like i have never heard before i learned some interesting profanities that day and i found out why they have been piecing through the stuff i found apparently the ceos from the other countries thought that the order was really good to get from pissed of company but they also knew that the probability of failing was high so to protect them selves they made the contract in my fathers name found a digital copy of my fathers signature and used it on the contract so he was responsible without telling him being my father he would not stand for that sort of abuse he called his lawyer a damn good one and the day after a resignation was sent out but my father has worked hard to get a lot of agreements from different vendors to make his company the sole distributor of products in his country and these contract were worth millions of dollars each year and my dad wanted to start a new company and he wanted those contracts now the law here stated that an employee may not use information from previous workplace to start a new one an nda is normally in place for years my dad went to court and got the nda nullified the company location was in a building that my father owned so he terminated the contract immediately almost throwing them out in the street he sent job offers the all the employees to work with him at his new startup everyone accepted last i saw the old company they only had one guy working in a lonely office in the city and had lost millions the following years because my dad took all the contracts and customers that day he went to court he came driving home honking celebrating and flashing his lights when he reached our house we went out to eat a very nice dinner and then went drinking dancing and playing dart i remember some young girls next to us playing darts as well while my father was dancing asking gt girls erhm do you know him gt me yep that is my dad i said proudly gt girls awesome i never knew what happened to pissed off company contract but my gut tells me my dad made a new contract with them that was successful tldr company uses fraud against dad its ineffective dad destroys company and goes drinking edit the usual suspects spellinggrammer edt there seems to be some confusion as to how the company was structured the company has offices in countries and those offices were sort of independent from the others but shared the same product catalog with some exceptions kinda like a franchise hope that cleared things up

again i am supporting the professors using classroom technology at a large university a little background our interfaces on the instructors podium include an hdmi cable a vga cable and an ethernet cable so that you can hook up to the projector and get on the internet if your wifi isnt working a professor calls me and says she is having trouble getting her mac to show on the projector no problem we get these calls all the time she probably just needs an adapter since apple would never include a common video interface on one of its laptops me are you using a vga or hdmi adapterdongle her i dont think i am using an adapter ive got it hooked up already its obviously the projector that is broken since i cant see it on the screen me what cable did you use to hook it up without an adapter how old is the computer i am wondering if this is some kind of new mac that i havent heard of that has an hdmi port her oh i used the modem cable it was the only one that fit me modem cable what do you mean there are only three cables on the podium and none of them are her interrupting me its the one that looks like it goes in a modem see i dont really understand all this new technology thats why i got a mac its easier than a computer shes referring to the ethernet cable as a modem cable and thinks that will carry video to the projector automatically me i see well unfortunately thats not going to work you will need an adapter to hook up your mac to the projection system you can come by our office anytime to pick one up her i dont have time for all that i have to give this presentation right now ill just use the modem cable me good luck it concerns me that this woman drives a car on the same road as me 
alright im not actually it support but a gatekeeper at night to fund college few days ago i got the following mail gtdue to recent events companyxx handles the burglar and fire alarm is no longer allowed to work in the server rooms unsupervised please call headofit whenever their employees need to work on blabla turns out their service guy turned off some of the ac systems in the server rooms because he was cold it also turns out that calling the emergency ac guys at am on a sunday morning because of critical temperature in the server room isnt exactly cheap no matter how trivial the solution is gthave you tried plugging it in 
heres the context i used to work tier tech support in a corporate office you know intern stuff you all also know theres always that one problematic user that no matter what you do you cant placate they just exist to make your life difficult well this time things were different because you see it was my last day well pick up from where the ticket begins gtlusers ticket i cant get to companyintranetsite no additional info no screenshots no error messages great alright sounds like a compatibility issue to me lets give them a ring and gather more information you know as in do my job gtyci hello im calling regards towards the ticket you put in are you still experiencing the issue at this time and has anyone followed up with you today gtluser seriously youre calling me to ask that how should i know if im still experiencing the issue did you guys do anything at all before calling to ask me this gtyci im sorry its just the other techs arent at their desk and the ticket hasnt been updated so i figured id follow up with you can you try and reach the site now gtluser im not going to try i dont have time just fix it alright cool looks like im taking a trip to the users workstation to fix it manually i know the site works i could reach it just fine gtluser what so you come over here im busy and you need to fix the issue why are you here i didnt want you to come and i dont have time for this just do your job and go reboot the server that runs this stuff even i must know more about it than you if even i know it needs a reboot gtyci im sorry its just policy this is how we always resolve issues that we cant close over the phone thats fine though ill just go close the ticket dont worry about it gtluser so why did you even come over here then if youre going to go to your desk and fix it and just close the ticket see this is why i told them to stop sending you over you dont know what youre doing at all ill be sure to let your manager know how much of my time youve wasted gtyci oh im not fixing the issue im just closing the ticket when you email me an apology with my boss cced since you were being rude and threatening me over my following of company policy then i will gtluser you cant say that to me dont you understand im vaguelyimportantposition i will see to it youre fired gtyci dont you understand todays my last day whatll you do fire me ill see to it someone fixes your computer it just wont be me hopefully you cooperate with them in the mean time ill be waiting on that apology im really not normally that bad its just this one user ive avoided them like the plague since the day i started to the point where i would push tickets to other techs of course they push them back though because i was the lowest on the totem pole and they wanted to avoid the toxicity but what ever happened well i sat back down at my desk knowing that entire encounter was worthless that user will of course never be reprimanded and that i wasted my time by the way the fix they needed was just for me to add the site to the compatibility list it takes less than seconds and had they not been difficult i wouldve had it done promptly but for once i got to tell a user to get it together and that was all ive ever wanted 
 tuesday morning today marks the first day of the security audit it is a bleak time in it as it leader i envision it being free from these oppressive checks free to fix computers and fix them well i looked over at the entrance to our department embargo the door i realise suddenly being a leader of action i walk over to lock its door gtme this will keep security out the rest of the it staff look at me wearily gtsolitaire why are you unfairly burdening us gtme security to raise security to fight the audit gtsolitaire embargoing locking the door will just get in our way gtme we as a department need to be free from the injustice of the security department security cant audit us if they cannot even enter it was in shock the department door was always open change to the long established way of doing things had the department enraged gtredcheer keeping people physically out is securities job we just need to stop hackers right redcheer looked around the room for support many were nodding in agreement i felt the urge to crush this rebellion quickly i attempted to disarm the it staff with reason gtme its easier to keep people out of our systems if they cannot physically access them i tried to smile at the it staff but they seemed to be surrounding me in an unfriendly manner colourblind put down his tea it was at that point i realized i had perhaps pushed it too far gtcolourblind no they could do as much damage from any computer connected to the network then from these ones the server room is locked my grasp on the situation seemed out of hand a knock from the opposite side of the locked door distracted everyone gtheadsec hello this door seems to be locked solitaire walked over and unlocked the door for the head of security who i could oddly only hear in a french accent gtheadsec who locked this door the room turned to stare at me i realized it had somehow allied themselves with who i thought was our common enemy security gtheadsec its a fire hazard to lock this door you know gtme oh defeat 
i work as senior staff at tech support for a big telco where tech work is neatly divided between multiple departments being technically able to fix something yourself doesnt mean youre allowed to if it falls outside your departments job description because too many things are broken we do skirt those rules on the dl when we deem it critical ive defended that at and even wrote tales about but for routine tasks and problems we tend to respect the rules our internal tools are handled by a dedicated internal it department called systems in my tales that day our manual provisioning tool key backup tool given how many issues arise everyday with regular provisioning was down i knew it pretty well given i worked on improving some of its features ten years before when assigned to a different position its a lifesaver but its aging software with a few quirks and sometimes it needs attention wrote a quick ticket to systems explaining the issue and practically handholding them through it gt bytewave ticket to systems manual provisioning is down all tasks sent by tsss are on indefinite hold thats usually the task queue crashing should clear up if you run the script that reschedules tasks please make a new task to check if it gets processed or not reboot server if issue persists i assumed that could be done pretty quickly awhile later i get a ticket alert from systems assumed it was a resolution entry until i saw it was an escalation tsssbytewave your priority ticket to ticket manager systems is has been escalated to tsssbytewave probably a misclick when filing in ticket resolution no no it wasnt minute later im on the phone with the ticker manager at systems who handled my ticket gt systems yeah i couldnt do it myself frontline at systems dont have access to these scripts nor physical access to that server we need to escalate this whenever this occurs our internal it has grown so large that its plagued with an issue that normally only customers have to deal with everywhere to slash costs the corporation has reduced internal it to a multilayer department where people taking calls and dealing with tickets are paid to filter out simple issues and escalate real problems to people with reasonable access levels and technical knowledge basically management added frontline scriptmonkeys even internally gt bytewave right but thats not me i never even worked at systems im from tsss i deal with the escalated issues of our external customers not our internal systems and i sent you the ticket so how did it make sense to gt systems youre the listed backup for this system and unfortunately the three admins who normally take care of it are unavailable one is on his weekend one on vacation and one calledin sick protocol is that the ticket be escalated to the backup and its you i was speechless for a second im not formally allowed to do any kind of maintenance on this yet im still somehow listed as a backup admin for the system because i helped with some overdue updates years before on top of that it seems sane procedure to send someone from another department his own support ticket back and tell him to try to fix it himself gt systems well i assumed you could do it yourself since youre listed as backup might still have a valid login to the remote tool too right you guys at tech support are union staff you get away with pretty much anything right nothing to lose but if you cant you can send it back and i guess itll be put on hold until one of the regular admins can deal with it probably tomorrow yes i still remembered that old login and could have broken the rules to fix it myself we do that kind of thing to keep critical operations running sometimes but i had a bad feeling here the whole thing sounded like he knew i could be convinced to do it myself even though he knew im supposed not to felt like i was being pushed to break the rules so they wouldnt have to bother handling a real issue that clearly fell under their department and thats not how i operate i dont like to enable terrible policies or be manipulated into someone elses workload nor setting precedents like this my tone got a little frostier right the second i decided what to do about this mess gt bytewave im not allowed to perform this task myself at this time company and union rules hence why youve been sent the ticket im afraid the delay youre suggesting is unacceptable as manual provisioning is rated as critical internal infrastructure one of the regular admins will look at the issue asap the service level agreement is minutes tops gt systems well like i said theres nobody who can do it today gt bytewave no what you said is that one of them was on vacations and another was sick hr is not allowed to call either of those the third you said is on his weekend and therefore qualifies for emergency overtime im writing to hrlogistics and my boss to say a ticket for critical internal infrastructure im not allowed to act upon myself has been sent back to me due to lack of critical escalation personnel at which point theyll simply have to call him in on ot due to the sla im sure hell take it gt systems emergency ot rates are crazy thats going to cost like days worth of normal escalation pay youre sure thats worth it for running a script gt bytewave emails already sent im afraid also asked to be taken off the list as backup escalation for this tool as its unfortunately outside my current job description thank you for your help gt systems err sure press send half an hour later the single admin eligible for overtime it was a friday and he worked sunday to thursday logged in remotely from his telework station and ran the simple script that i knew would fix the issue with the task queue everything returned to normal he was indeed compensated quite ridiculously for such a simple thing but some situations make me think the company deserve to just pay up when management hear about this kind of thing and see there are real costs bad tools or policies actually tend to improve for the long haul if we just hide the dirt under the carpet they remain broken forever all of bytewaves tales on 
there are days where id rather be wrestling a couple great whites in their natural habitat while an underwater volcano was going off sequel to sharknado this was one of those days the software we support uses the sql database engine the installer has a batch file that runs the sql express installation with the default settings our software requires at times it fails due to windows updates permissions microsoft sucking etc i can walk somebody through an sql install and its not too painful as long as they follow my instructions the manual install doesnt take too much time but like i said the prerequisite of this not taking too much time requires the customer to follow my instructions a remote session failed so i was not getting into this guys computer an hour went by no progress me are you sure you dont see that folder in the temp folder customer oh sorry i closed it this is pretty much the story of this case however the fates were kind to me as something glorious and slightly majestic happened he yelled at his son customer no i dont want you to take that unplug your computer from the tv i dont know how you did that my gears start turning this kid is probably running an hdmi connection from his computer into the television this requires him to change the default sound settings and sometimes visual settings its a gamble but im bald and dont have any hair to rip out to ease my pain i began to engage in small talk customer sorry about hearing me yell at him me no problem how old is he customer hes about hes pretty savvy with windows you guys play command and conquer red alert remember tanya remember how shed go in a somewhat manlywomaney voice cha chiiiinnnggg this happened me oh you think hed be able to help us customer meh maybe this is no longer up for debate me may i talk to your son please customer oh sure jake come here and talk to the nice tech guy note were about an hour and a half into this i get his son me hey jake i need you to follow my instructions exactly as i say them if you have questions feel free to ask this should take us about twenty minutes jake oh okay cool i was wrong it took minutes so thank you customers son for being the light at the end of that issues tunnel no there was no bacon at the end of that tunnel as i was wanting but whatever edit spelled sharknado wrong sue me
i work as escalation tech staff at a telco like everybody else we offer the standard array of telecommunications products including hardlines voip and mobile which of course means we also offer voicemail gt bytewave senior line bytewave you may send me your ticket gt frontline i have the weirdest voicemail tool issue here customer just had their hardline number ported to mobile that went fine but they locked themselves out of their voicemail shortly thereafter by putting the wrong pin four times and the tools to fix it wont work i tried all the ways i could still wouldnt work tried sales senior staff as they know tricks with the voicemail but no cigar so i called switchboards and gt bytewave i have to interrupt right there we at tech supports senior staff should always be your first contact point for escalation per procedure not to mention sales have less than zero to do with this gt frontline i know but your line was soo busy there we go productivity metrics interfering with real work yet again he saw we had many calls waiting due to a regional outage we were in the process of documenting so to avoid damaging his statistics by waiting minutes he started dialing randomly i hate that but the pressure management puts on frontline techs to solve issues per hour leads precisely to this tomfoolry gt bytewave back to the issue at hand portability to wireless caused your customer to switch voicemail systems as you know were still running a separate one for mobile users until theyre merged later this year yeah thatll happen maybe next year at best but i like to use the official timetables reminds everybody nothing is ever done on time here gt frontline yeah i know thats why he locked himself out he wasnt told or didnt hear when we told him his pin would reset to default after portability default pin is unavoidable when switching voicemail systems but gt bytewave in that case the issue is resolved we already know what his pin is and theres no need for our tools the reason your tool to reset isnt working is because the switch hadnt been processed yet by the billing system which this unfortunately relies on we can gt frontline got it i explain to the customer ill call him back tomorrow and then ill be able to unlock his voicemail gt bytewave not quite you ask him not to touch it for minutes and then try again with the default pin gt frontline oh you want to wait out the lockdown at this point id have been happier to learn he had never been told that these security lockdowns only last minutes or that the voicemail was using a default pin but clearly he already had all that information given he tried calling three escalation departments i looked at the timestamps for when his current inbound call got in nearly minutes gt bytewave actually try it right now with the default pin please gt frontline oh you fixed it all of bytewaves tales on 
a few years ago i was working tech support in it my client a large tugboat and barge company in my state had called in reporting that their head office had just lost power i told them to let me know when their power is restored so i can check all their servers are online and accessible a few hours later one of the staff called me and it went like this me hi welcome to it company this is t how can i help client hi this is sarah from tugboatco i was told by management to give you guys a call when our office power was restored me no worries so your office has power now client ummm im not sure me youre not sure if your office has power client no im not actually sure sorry me are there lights on can you see people working on their computer again client hmm i dont know me i dont understand you can or cant see lights on client im not sure ill have to have my manager call you im not too good with the technical stuff me ok no prob a few mins later the manager of the tugboatco called and explained that they now have power and he was confused that sarah couldnt tell if they had power as they have a large open plan office with not that many windows it would have been very dark in there when they didnt have power tldr sometimes people cant even see if a light is on in front of them

i worked blackberry tech support for major wireless provider several years ago right as they were being bought out by other major wireless provider well call it spring one of the two worst calls i received was regarding that very buyout i gave my overly long introduction got the customers full information it took approximately minutes of us demanding information before we were allowed to ask what the customers issue was or we would be disciplined for not following the script and asked what the problem was me and how may i assist you today maam customer well first let me start by saying that i am not at all racist me of course not maam at this point im recounting how the most racist bigoted things ive ever heard were prefaced by those eleven words customer well you guys just got bought out by spring wireless right me we uh technically merged with spring so now we are the same company customer used to be when someone would call my phone before ringing they would hear please wait while the original company customer is being found me yes customer well now it says please wait while the spring customer is being foundbut then it repeats itin spanish me yes maam because our customer base is very diverse we find that it is best to reach customer well i do not want people to think i would ever ever associate with someone who would speak spanish im not going to support those illegals me butits just a recording customer well you better change the damn recording i dont want people to think i have anything to do with them me you dont understandi do not have the ability to rerecord the message that goes out to several million subscribers myself customer you will change the message or i will cancel my account today me okay maam i responded exasperated but i just dont seem to understand why it is such an issue customer because if those little people want to float over here in those little boats and steal our jobs and ruin our economy then they damn well better learn our language now you send me to cancellations so i can switch to a company that has some morals at this point my supervisor has come over to listen to the call and is doing everything he can not to fall out of his chair laughing the lady has four phones on her account and is just a few months from the end of her contractmeaning she will still get hit with in cancellation fees because she cant accept the fact that other languages exist my supervisor comes over and mutes my phone let me handle this he says with a grin he hits conference on the phone this puts the customer on hold and opens another line he types in a number that i faintly recognize but just cant place he hits conference again right before the line picks up the phone is muted from our side but he has just connected the customer to this other department who starts to give their intro i cant believe what i heard my ballsy supervisor transferred my racist customer to the spanishspeaking helpdesk edit anonymized company name to spring instead of its real name as per reddit rules
while lurking i realised some of you might enjoy this short and literally sweet tale i usually wouldnt warn yall about formatting because im brutal about making it perfect but posting on this new mobile site is confusing as heck so sorry also ill probably forget to reply to comments because im never logged in i used to stay with an older woman and since my new house is near hers i still visit from time to time i also help her learn how to use a laptop when im free to give you an idea of how inexperienced she is i cant show her how to use the backspace button because she was taught to use delete and its too confusing to use both shes a lovely person and didnt go to school so its more cute than annoying today i went over and she tried showing me a video of her friend in the hospital she complains that its always hard to find and i notice that its because its lost amongst a bunch of imessages being the good samaritan i am i teach her how to save the video and shes so excited about this that im encouraged to help her around her phone after a bit of gentle instruction shes able to send text messages by herself using the greek keyboard instead of making do with using the english one for greek letters she was so excited that she texted random stuff to all of her grandchildren the amount of pride she had in herself made me smile and she said something like my grandchildren always tried to teach me but i always thought i couldnt do it i dont know that was badly written but i hope you all enjoyed that as much as i did makes me feel a tad better about the fact that with the degree im studying for im probably going to spend most of my life dealing with incompetent users edit ok so i totally warned everyone that id forget about this post but i wasnt expecting so many commentsupvotes and gold i think im gonna have to start logging in to reddit after i post things p now to enjoy the random stories in the comments
i would imagine most people here have a story similar to mine if you worked with techcustomer support this one however stood out to me late in my shift i got a call for an angry elderly customer who demanded to speak to my boss as standard i screened to call before transferring to the boss and this was his story for several months he had been in contact with my colleague nora danish girl name but she hadnt responded to his last two emails and he was furious here is the kicker we only had people working there and i knew all of them none of them had a name even close to nora the clever ones here already figured this out but like i said it was late in my shift i asked him what email he was emailing us from and went to town on our mailing system nope no mails from the last two months actually no mails at all i asked him to forward the last reply from nora to me so i could identify her thinking by now it might have been a phishing email lo and behold he had been emailing us for quite some time always being answered by my colleague noreplycompanydk i spend the next five minutes calmly god bless the mute button to stifle laughter explaining who nora really was trying not to hurt his feelings too much
weeks came and went another month slipped by unnoticed a new support manager had appeared young new and inexperienced his often rash decision making seemed reminiscent of angies vicious and brutal idea of management though it seemed driven by immaturity rather than vindictiveness we continued to exist in the knowledge that there was nobody who would be like our first its manager but thankfully nobody like angie either i had two major projects after angies departure i was in the midst of successfully redeploying the laptops complete with fully working software however it became apparent in the days subsequent to her finding out that angie had opened administrative access to ad to the entire helpdesk as you can well expect our sparkling and carefully maintained ad structure now had contradictory group policies login scripts which went nowhere and more phantom accounts and objects than i think we would ever finally sort out it was if angie had left me a parting gift a final fuck you from the queen of aggression its twopronged effect seemed unintentional given her ineptitude but it had encroached on every single user in the company as their login times grew exponentially together with seemingly random permission sets which denied sometimes even the most basic of privileges it was getting to be the hottest summer ive ever known in britain i still hadnt taken time out to wash my mondeo its recent costly repair bill had left a bitter taste in my mouth the grime that lay affixed to the bonnet and wings seemed an apt punishment for depriving me of yet another wage check arriving back to the office from a wellearned summer pub lunch i walked towards the building across the car park as i passed a familiar jaguar graced a vip spot in the car park sleek and shiny its black finish shone in the midday sun freshly polished and lovingly detailed its congeniality seemed marred by the fact that angie had once owned a car like this her angry face refusing to even make eye contact as she stared over the leather steering wheel i had finished replacing a dead hard disk in an optiplex and was delivering it to a damsel in distress particularly this was one of the sales guys damsels in distress as i connected the machine back up he came out of his glassclad office for a chat did you see your ex manager is back he grimaced i knew what he meant this man had been trained to smile and lie for a living the news that angie was back seemed unpalatable who angie i questioned she got sacked didnt she the sales manager shook his head with a learned look people like that dont get sacked he explained i hung on his every word as if this was the most important lesson i would ever receiving in my life when someone like that is put into a particular position its usually because someone recommended her for it someone put her there jon if she had done well the person who recommended her would have gotten a nice pat on the back but if she cocks it up theres no way theyre going to turf her out whoever recommended her would have their nuts in a sling for recommending such a dud nobody would ever take them seriously ever again he continued when people like that in such positions of power make a fantastic fuck up like that they get paid off they get promoted with a golden handshake just so someone above her can save face with the board admitting failure isnt even on the menu despising the obvious truth to his words i had to probe deeper then who got the blame for all that then well bhit of course he was so close to retirement and he didnt really make much noise anyway people forgot he was there it was either him or you guys really i looked up from over the desk partition across the cavernous office i could just about see the familiar twisted frame of angie as she stormed with intent around a small section of desks her shrill and piercing tone somehow breaking through the human noise over the sound of printers phones and chatter another hapless team of underlings were getting it from her both barrels i turned eager to continue this discourse however the sales manager had already retreated to his office he held his phone to his head as he clicked the door closed as the optiplex spun into life the windows xp splash screen floated as if to stand testament to the spoils who had really won here well nobody it seems as i struggled to think for a moral to the story i was interrupted by the returning damsel she thanked me for my time turning back to her work our brief moment of temporary friendship now at an end politically and autocratically ceased with the completion of my task the only remaining duty being the closing of the support ticket previous pt a new world pt safety pt the it induction from pt pt how to make friends pt marking pt one friday to rue them pt best laid pt its one step for pt and one step back for pt bring home the pt who needs minor pt dawn of a new pt rules of pt bring out your pt the

hello again tfts now that my laughing and crying has stopped i figured i would share the tale of the last call i had this morning end user informed me that he was trying to install windows on his personal computer after informing him we do not support personal computers i decided i would be nice and give a little advice thats when the details of his problem came out gtkupholder thank you for calling employer how can i help you today gteu yeah i am trying to install windows on my computer but i keep getting errors while trying to activate gtkupholder sadly we do not support personal computers but if you dont mind me asking what is the error you are getting gteu it says that my product key is not valid and that i may be a victim of software counterfiting i purchased this key myself i called microsoft and they informed me that this key is blacklisted and that i need to buy another key however they do not sell windows keys anymore only windows gtkupholder where did you purchase your product key you will need to contact them if microsoft says the key is blacklisted gteu well i purchased from a site called windowsproductkeyscom but they never sent a key so i purchased one from windowskeyscom and they emailed me a product key now both of those sites dont appear to exist gtkupholder ok you first will want to reach out to your bank and get a new card because those sites are not valid sites to purchase anything from if you still want windows you should go to like a local bestbuy or something i strongly advise you to never purchase anything like this again without verifying that the site is a valid merchant gteu ok thanks i will do that goodbye the laughing and crying was so hard my chest hurts this is why cybersecurity is such a booming field
ive been working at my particular campus for going on four years now and never had anything truly entertaining to report ive had plenty of clueless endusers and unbelievably disgusting problems to address but never anything i considered worthy of reporting on this subreddit until today for the past month one particular departmental supervisor sup has been complaining about one specific staff computer the problem was not catastrophic and staff were still able to work so it was very far down on our list of things to address the emails sent were as follows gt sup hi guys either there is a ghost living in our staff computer or some wires may be crossed somewhere staff reported to me last night that the persistent beeping on the computer is causing numbers to pop up on the screen thoughts the regular troubleshooting methods were applied and the staff members were unable to reproduce the problem so we the it staff chalked it up to user error and moved on with our lives although the problem seemed to crop up at random points and the ghost of the staff computer became a running joke after a few more phone calls that led nowhere today i received the following email gt sup it appears the ghost is still living in the staff computer yesterday afternoon the computer was beeping for quite some time every time it would beep the numbers would show up on the screen im hoping this can be solved and is not actually a secret message code were supposed to translate finally my director dir comes into my office gtdir can you at least go look at the computer this problem just isnt going away gtme sure no problem gtdir im sure its nothing but let me know if you find anything i go look and it takes me two seconds to identify the problem an amazingly old legacy barcode scanner long and forgotten was crammed back into the corner behind the desk this old scanner used to be used to scan in prescription numbers but has long since been made obsolete by electronic rx modules it was positioned in just a way that it was occasionally scanning the serial number barcode on the back of the monitor solution unplugged the scanner miraculously the problem went away i was disappointed that i didnt get to perform an exorcism but i suppose i can take solace in knowing that the ghost in the computer jokes will stop 
 i used to work at an ad agency referenced the agency was in your typical suburban office park next park over was the emergency operations center for our local electricity utility ironically the office park had unreliable power which is why we had at almost every workstation one morning i know were going to have a bad power day when i can hear helicopters coming into and out of the operations center the sysadmins not at work yet so im bouncing between powering down servers in a controlled manner and explaining to users that i know your ups is beeping its singing the song of its people our phone switch goes down hard since we havent refreshed the ups battery we had diverted the funds to purchase the latest powerbooks for the senior staff one particularly dense junior account executive calls me over to her cube herwhen are we going to have power back i have a very important call at am mei really dont know id recommend making the call on your cell phone herthis isnt acceptable we pay you and you cant even keep the lights on me pointing out the window to the operations centertheyre clearly scrambling over there at localutility five minutes after power comes back the phones will be working herstop making excuses meok does it look like i have a hard hat herits just technology make it work actually her comment inspired me i went to the art department pulled a recently refreshed heavy duty ups attached to a workstation and connected it to the coffee maker 
this happened a few months ago i wrote and support a surgical audit system so all the users are doctors one part of the system lets them up load documents or pictures ppt pptx doc docx pdf and jpg so i get a call from an irate surgeon who is complaining that he desperately needs to upload some images but the system wont let him i take a quick look and see that hes trying to upload bitmap files bmp and not jpegs jpg gt ah i said i can see the problem you need to save your files as jpg and not bmp then the system will take them an oversight on our part i didnt think that people would want to use bmp files so didnt cater for it ill write a fix and upload it during the next maintenance update surgeon thanks me and i closed the call minutes later phone rang gtive changed them all to jpg files and uploaded them but the wont display fix this shit so i logged onto the database and took a look yup there was binary data in the blob the file extensions were jpg the tags and filenames look ok but they wouldnt display then i looked closer at the blob specifically at the first bytes they were bm i rang surgeon back and asked how hed gotten the files into jpg format gt oh i just right clicked on the files and renamed the extension from bmp to jpg headdesk gt it doesnt work that way to put it into medical terms thats like grabbing a bottle of viagra crossing out viagra and writing morphine on the bottle and expecting it to relieve pain it wont work all youll get is a patient in pain with a hardon then i told him how to open the files in paint save as jpg and upload them problem solved

a couple weeks ago i told you guys about how you just cant save some today i received much better news i have a long standing policy with people if you really want to learn networking and youve shown to me that you really want to learn this trade i will make it my mission to help i will provide the hardware for you to learn on when you have racks like this at home you dont really miss an extra router or not only that i will loan you books from my own library to use i will work up exercises for you to complete i will do what i can to help you learn but you have to be willing to do so about two years ago i had a guy that worked help desk for one of my customers that was extremely interested in what i do whenever i was onsite hed follow me around like a puppy asking questions after a while i asked him why he didnt just get a ccna or something and start doing networking he obviously had the drive to do it he told me that his wife was unemployed and stayed home with their autistic son he just didnt have the extra money to devote to hardware or training if there was ever a situation where my policy fit this was it the next time i went onsite i brought a cisco and a switch with me i handed him the gear and explained my policy to him i would help him get certified i called my buddy jeremy and got him a full course of computer based training to get his ccna he had full access to my library of books on a thumb drive i had copies of all kinds of routing and switching books which i gave him i moved off that contract not long after this but me and the guy kept in touch i sent him exercises every other week for him to do i designed labs for him i even shipped him a router that i had intentionally screwed up and told him only to fix it starting with logging into it since i didnt give him the passwords for about a year this went on until he stopped responding to emails i thought that i had lost yet another one until this morning i received this from the guy this morning gti just wanted to say thanks i started my new job at ltcompanygt yesterday as a network engineer making k more than before i have you to thank for that what is your mailing address i would like to send you a check for your time and to thank you for everything you have changed my familys life rather than text back i just called him he stopped replying to the emails because he felt bad about leaning on me to learn he felt he had a good start and wanted to continue on his own so he did and he did get certified he got his ccna and ccda for christmas i sent him two vouchers for cisco tests even though we hadnt spoken in a few months he used those two vouchers back in march and got certified and yesterday he started his new career in networking at a very large bank its an entry level job but his total package including benefits is worth over k more than his previous job it also has excellent insurance thats going to help his son i could hear in his voice that he was nearly in tears on the phone i told him to not worry about sending me anything seeing him succeed was payment enough for me and at that point he was in tears now contrary to what you might think i didnt post this to toot my own horn or to pat myself on the back i posted it because theres a lot of us in this sub that have a lot of expertise in what we do we are the masters of the universe because if we all decided to quit our jobs tomorrow the world wouldnt be able to function who is the assistant marketing director going to call when she opens that exe file she received from an unknown email address how else will the cfo get his new surface tablet connected to the vpn i think all of the senior folks here need to have a similar policy to mine i issue this challenge if someone shows you a real interest in what you do especially if that person is young and willing to learn make it your mission to help them in any way you can many of the things that we look at as common knowledge probably look like rocket science to people that dont do it everyday even something like teaching binarydecimalhexadecimal conversion and subnetting to someone can open a whole new world to them youre going to fail pretty often of the different people that ive tried to help and provided hardware to only of them have gotten a certification and two of those people never put that cert to use although one is now an artist at disney and is amazing lets even try to teach users about what we do im not saying that the cfo needs to know what a type lsa is but he should probably understand why plugging that little netgear switch he picked up online into the wall twice wont give him twice the speed and will probably break something in the process well not if you actually configured spanning tree correctly the first time im getting a lot of pms about where people should start if they want to get into networking or which books i suggest for getting your ccna start with cisco press books for your ccna if you want to learn juniper and i kid you not the junos for dummies book is invaluable i have a hard copy close as well as pdfs of my phone ipad and laptop for quick reference for cisco heres some authors to keep an eye out for they are all excellent todd lammle jeremy cioara wendell odom kevin wallace william tedder if you want to computer based training jeremy cioaras cbt nuggets series is awesome he has a great voice and is very excited about what he does so it makes learning easier not only that but if you work for a company that is a cisco partner theres a metric shtload of free training on the partner portal for juniper simply go to junipernetfasttrack and you can take a free network fundamentals ecourse if you pass the preassessment exam on junipers site you get a discount voucher for your certification exam network companies want you certified and they will provide many different ways for you to learn the trade and just remember if doesnt matter if you learn cisco juniper hp brocade extreme networks or whatever routing and switching works the same on all hardware the only difference is the command line syntax and their own proprietary protocols im looking at you cisco routerfreakcom has tons of good resources too tools config tips cheat sheets these are invaluable study notes you name it guys please dont give me gold for this post if youre feeling the urge to give something might i suggest giving to wikipedia face it the wiki has saved all of our asses at one time or another if you dont like wikipedia try the electronic frontier childs a great charity that

the building manager was a portly man he bumbled about the building occasionally fixing problems and generally keeping out of the way therefore it was some surprise to me that i found myself facing the wheezing mass gtbuildmang the lifts he tried to puff out an entire sentence but failed the building manager slumped into the seat opposite mine and gasped for air i was mildly concerned for his health gtme the lifts arent working gtbuildmang yes the sound of his lungs battling for air continued for a few moments having nothing to say to the man i worked around him after around ten minutes of silent reflection and recouperation by the giant he finally decided to attempt speaking gtbuildmang youve heard nothing from the vp recently gtme the vp goodness no the building manager seemed disapointed i wondered if the vp actually had a friend i quickly discarded the thought it was too weird gtbuildmang youre in management right gtme head of it so gtbuildmang and head of security gtme not anymore luckily the nightmares of my time in security had finally started to fade i realized how out of the loop the building manager truely was gtbuildmang definitely high management though to command two different departments so i was wondering did the vp even mention to you our arrangement gtme no gtbuildmang well errr not to put too fine a point on it but the lifts dont run themselves the building manager bluntly rambled on about all the things in the building that didnt run themselves oddly he kept mentioning things like automatic doors and elevators which i had always assumed did run themselves gtme ahh and its your job to keep these services running gtbuildmang indeed the pause lengthened out to eternity i looked down at the bumbling man with confusion i couldnt tell if he was looking for his regular pay or a bit extra the word bribe spun round in my mind gtme well if youd like to head up to accounting gtbuildmang i was thinking more cash those accountants love books a little too much a bribe it was gtme i think youre in the wrong department for that kind of thing perhaps go up to the executive level someone will point you in the right direction i could feel my wallet thanking me from my pocket gtbuildmang mmm yes but that would take time looking around here at all these heavy computers i cant help but think it would be a liability not to just sort this out now gtme so youre saying the lifts wont work till i sort this out gtbuildmang the repair of the lifts could take anywhere from a few minutes to weeks having never been asked for such a blatant bribe before i didnt know the protocol naturally i just stared him down like a bull i silently waited for him to leave he eventually heaved himself off the chair and ambled to the door gtbuildmang just trying to speed things up building manager was right carrying computers up stairwells is dangerous opening up my email i decided to send a quick message company wide gtdue to lack of lifts it can no longer move computers between floors all it work will either be fixed on site or postponed until such a time i sat back in my chair and wondered who else the vp had agreements with
working as engineer for a large manufacturing group i discovered the server that controlled all automated sheet metal fabrication equipments was a stand alone island network and sever that fell outside of our secured data center upon asking about this they informed me that the sheetmetal operators were confident they could handle the responsibility of maintaining this island network of sheet metal computerized machines and the server surprisingly they went years without any issues that affected their production one day they needed a bit of help so i came in never before had i actually seen where this server was under the billing secretarys desk she said it put off so much heat it kept her warm in their some what drafty shop office it was connected via a cheap compusa powerstrip along with the most stable of electronics a space heater and the shop microwave the dell txx server was throwing a raid drive fault light i see the audible alarm has been disabled i tried to get a response out of the few people watching me look at this dusty reck secretary oh yeah it started beeping and wouldnt stop did you not think to bring that to someones attention how long was it doing that secretary since october so about a month of this server has been beeping at you for two years yep and this was no cause for concern silence with all due respect maam youre an idiot 
a very old tale from when i provided inhouse it at a corporations headquarters it was my first job over a decade ago it was an incredibly wasteful place previously featured a few times at one point we needed to purchase some licenses from microsoft for a few different pieces of software my orders were to purchase a total of over licenses which seemed fine given that some of them would be used outside headquarters until i looked at the specifics at the request my boss boss had decided to order tons of copies of nearly everything in their catalog including licenses for an old os we were almost done phasing out along with the new one and things as outdated as ms works along with ms word at a glance i could tell half of these would never be used but he had clearly opted for some sort of package deal when tacking on the costs of premium support the final tally was one of the largest bills i ever signed up for the exact specifics of the package direction wanted had been pointed out to me so really i was just handing down an order but still i thought this concluded the business after all the software we actually needed to use was already part of the wink ghosts i used all day long as part of the ongoing migration we werent actually purchasing new products just the rights to use copies we already had and were in the process of updating and several hundred extras to cover for future growth sometimes later i get a call from my lovely friend at reception gt emily bytewave your crates just arrived do i let the delivery people in or youll pick them up here crates wat gt bytewave i dont believe im expecting a cratessized delivery gt emily from microsoft your name is on the order i hurry over with an industrial trolley i sign the paperwork and bring them back to the depths of its lair the shock when i opened them one was filled with endless copies of brochures explaining the features of each product we had bought tons and tons of fliers explaining what you can do with visio powerpoint basic yeah i have a use for that thankfully at least it wasnt one brochure per license then the cd crates for each license or nearly so by my estimation we were provided with a hard copy okay its the early s which makes it slightly more understandable than it would be nowadays but im still dumbfounded and theyre not in cd cases but in thick envelopes where they are directly stacked on top of each other in bulk i looked again at the invoice to make sure i didnt make any mistakes and order hard copies instead of licenses sure enough in the breakdown of the costs theres a scary line providing for physical media costs but its really part of the package i was specifically told to get i figure its an oversight as we have no use for all that stuff hell im not sure where were going to store it i tell my boss who quickly runs it up to see if it was unintended im still assuming ill be told to ship that back so im not sweating too much just yet my hopes were quickly dashed gt first boss im afraid it wasnt unintended they didnt know wed get this many but they wanted them just in case were keeping them gt bytewave where the hell am i supposed to store this were on a high floor of the skyscraper with the most expensive square foot in the city there arent that many available corners to stash crates in corners are generally occupied by tons of overpriced printers even the server room is getting pretty crowded its really the only place out of sight i have to store stuff beyond the maintenance closet theres the furnitures room but the lady in charge would kill me if i littered there it had to be spotless at all times after all important people need paper too sometimes gt first boss well not here you can take them to the tape backup location and take a dozen or so of each we could actually use and put them in a cd binder would you stash that in the server room oh and while youre at it bring the tape backups and here i am soon after a pfy with a big industrial trolley and heavy crates of utterly useless junk nobody will ever use being slowly pushed through elevators and hallways and carried by company truck to a set of empty offices above a noisy printing floor i tucked it all in a corner where its probably still collecting dust to this day i had a lovely afternoon there digging in these to find the potentially useful disks and slowly filing them into a couple binders the wink ones were ultimately buried at the very bottom under a thick stack of windows me disks all of bytewaves tales on 
i just went into a meeting and happened to be sitting next to the help desk guy who had the privelage of taking the ticket user reports that she had a squirel in her office and now she is unable to connect to the network she would like a tech to take a look at her pc to make sure everything is ok with the wires on the back of her pc made my friday so much better
this took place a while ago when i lived in sydney with my gramps he was on holidays with my aunt in brisbane i worked in hospitality and it was an exceptionally busy friday night where i had been non stop serving booze and fixing pokiesslot machines for a few hours now when i get a slight chance to check my phone i noticed my gramps had been calling me non stop for the past minutes and texts me asking to call him as its an emergency my old workplace was quite strict on phones you werent supposed to have your phone on you and you definitely were not supposed to be calling someone mid shift so i tell one of the managers that i need to call him as it was urgent i know im already in trouble as they will chew me out for having my phone on me when i get back but he frowns and continues serving people at the bar i rush downstairs and call my gramps at this point i should probably mention that brisbane is roughly kilometres from sydney the call me hello whats wrong im at work gramps whenn tell me what is the wifi password me what gramps the wifi password quickly tell me what it is i bought a laptop and i need to check my emails at this point im pissed that he got me in trouble as it certainly wasnt an emergency me oh so youre home that was early gramps no no im still in brisbane me wwhat gramps just tell me the bloody wifi password im in a rush me so you want the home wifi password gramps yes me while youre in brisbane gramps yes jesus what is so hard to understand i simply hung up on him and dragged myself upstairs awaiting to be chewed out by the manager for having my phone on me and leaving at the busiest time to make a call my gramps is the least computer literate person i have ever come across he is a goldmine for tfts

some years ago i found myself on the roof of our building at work early in the evening technically im on the clock but its a quiet night at my telco and theres a blood moon event so some of us decided to just go up there and have a slightly extended union break stargazing after bypassing a locked door with an override security card were not really supposed to have i see the roof for the first time great view but we notice the oddest thing in a corner a commercialgrade emitter and a receiver dish facing each other with just a few inches inbetween in a transparent casing to protect them from the weather and eliminate interference with hardened cables connected to each going back in the building on both ends i cant fathom a reason for this contraption in theory thats utterly useless a simple cable would do the same thing and were a cable telco we chat about it and are all a bit curious but we dont have an answer so we just relax and do some skygazing as originally planned next day i look at the building plans its all there in detail for anyone to see amongst the fire drill documents the contraption is documented and its actually broadcasting and receiving inches away over the air a couple qams which i look up and notice are reserved for public channels including cbc i go downstairs to the office of the tv product director to get the skinny i skip the part about the stargazing on the clock and tell him i saw this on the plans wondering if he has an explanation gt tvpd oh yeah that we only get the full subsidies for broadcasting certain public channels if we do so over the air rather than strictly through a cable network the rules were written by the crtc at a time most households didnt have cable and they were never updated once we stopped doing real ota here and at every headend we installed a setup like this where we are technically broadcasting a couple qams ota and feeding it back inside to the cable network to stay in technical compliance moment of silence while i process this gt bytewave thats cheating beautiful genius cheating given how arcane these rules are perfectly appropriate its also a great story ill let the rest of senior staff know about this i walk away not sure if i should be stunned or vaguely in awe probably both for clarity the genius part is that after being ota for a milisecond the feed the receiver gets goes on to become the source feed we broadcast for these channels so its not a matter of being able to pretend were sending something over the air but very much that any of our customers watching these channels is actually receiving a feed that was briefly ota thats what made this bizzare solution defensible after all theres nothing that says for how long the signal has to be ota theres also nothing that required these dishes to be on the roof at other headends they are all inside but at my work location there was a set outside that could be easily repurposed on the roof with minimal trouble all of bytewaves tales on 
hi may be not exactly support story but related about or years ago i was searching for a new job i was somewhat experiencedor so i thought at the time caring for a small ad forest and unixlinux based webhosting for years prior it was december relatively dry time of the year for job hunting so one of the positions left on the local market to choose from was in helpdesk support for some it outsourcing company they claimed that they are very big successful and popular company but ive never heard about them neither before nor after that during the interview there was an hr lady in the room and head of ithoit hr asked questions first pretty generic ones likewhy do want to work here nothing interesting so finally it was time for technical part of the interview hoit asked some easy technical questions at first but then gt hoit please name network protocols from microsoft without which windows xp based network cannot function gt me wtf is he talking about i can name a few protocols developed by ms but none of them are critical for network to work at least without any conditions mentioned to be necessary gt me well i guess netbios ldap even though its not from ms and i dont know nothing else related comes to mind and even those arent really critical for the network gt hoit sorry but this is an incorrect answer gt me ok can you give me a correct one gt hoit sure the answer is dhcp dns and icmp gt me what first of all none of those are developed or belong to ms and second none are required for windows network to function with only slight exception of dns needed for ad to function properly your answer for your own question is completely wrong gt hoit well you are correct but i wanted to hear from you the answer i gave gt me how am i supposed to correctly guess which incorrect answer to the question you are thinking of gt hoit yeah well that will be all for today we will send you an email with our decision regarding you about a week later i received an email explaining that my application was declined reason underqualified tldr you are correct but i am right credit ualacorn

long time readers may remember this old tale where overly honest guy was let ohg had explained in great detail one of my telcos controversial policies its still active today if you have a problem that requires a service call youll likely first be serviced twice by a smelly road tech contractor paid by call they usually get it done but if your problem isnt obvious and we need to go to your place for a third time we kick into high gear this is what ohg referred to as getting a good technician your issue is escalated to senior staff we review your history look at logs of your devices and your node and set up an advanced service call with recommendations sent to union road techs escalation for review then you get union techs from select crack teams sent your way with solid documentation these guys the best we got and will happily work all day to make sure everything is just perfect hourly wages furthermore when we send out a good technician out a network tech goes along in case anything networkside is causing part of the issue there is one caveat because of the chain of escalation the required analysis the fact two escalation teams have to be involved and handpick people for the job it takes time to set up also deep in the countryside we dont always have union people at hand sometimes your good technician will be driving for hours to get to your place so we need a hour delay for these something that some unhappy customers find hard to swallow as we can normally get someone to their place quicker sometimes at hours notice i wrote tales about how customers sometimes react when asked to wait with services normally frontline techs manage to convince them the short delay is worth it to ensure the problem is fixed for good advanced service calls are thorough with a success rate over and extensive followup but sometimes a customer just flat out refuses demanding we get someone out there faster several weeks ago a customer in the deep end of nowhere lost tv on a few specific channels for the third time cable box already replaced and wiring redone according to the contractors tickets signal problem on specific qams we were happy to roll out a union team hours away to get it done right frontline thoroughly explained why it was worth to wait for the next morning for our team but customer refused and instead got a sameday contractor two weeks after that they called again with the same issue and the exact same thing happened again two weeks ago the customer calls again for the th time same story despite assurances time was required for proper escalation they wanted any tech asap the call finally gets escalated to me late afternoon gt bytewave just lie tell them that due to exceptional circumstances no technicians available today and that hell have to wait till tomorrow first thing im on hold for a bit but after complaining a bit about slow service customer agreed to next am because it couldnt be done that day thats what its come to having to lie to the customer to fix their problem ohg would be sad the highfrequency rf issue causing this problem was fixed the next am though nobody else had complained about it and our network tools suggested everything was fine the backup network tech was critical to get it fixed as any contractor could have noticed had they bypassed the customers wiring and plugged a cable box at the source all of bytewaves tales on 
hello tfts short story from back around the holidays the company i work at makes robots and machine parts a few months ago we were contacted by a major company to get quotes for satellite parts which is a lucrative albeit difficulttoenter market bosses decided we would produce what we could on current equipment contract what we couldnt and fabricate our own highspeed highprecision cnc lathe to get more production for ourselves we make cnc anyways so why not a super highend one for our own shop on the day in question we have a mostlycomplete lathe that will turn small workpieces with incredible accuracy the engineers are excited it might cut to tolerances under a few dozen millionths of an inch however the machine also has very little in the way of failsafes which i am told get added just before final calibration then over lunch something goes horribly wrong this is the story on our records we may never be sure the manager of this facilitybrings his new girlfriend in to impress her with his amazing machine he leads her past several authorized personnel only signs no he is not authorized inside fabrication areas to the new lathe discovering the machine is locked out a lock is in place to stop anyone from turning on power to the machine he finds a pair of bolt cutters and removes the lock he then fires up the attached computer and enters a directory named something like benchmarkscriptsdonotuse and launches a program this program brings the lathe to life and starts it in action the lathe proceeds to push the compound tool rest into the chuck of the lathe the manager now panicking at the sight and sound of the machine cuting itself apart frantically mashes buttons on the computer before smashing its case with the bolt cutters the lathe eventually hits too much resistance from cutting itself and the motor driving the chuck catches fire and kicks out the manager and his girlfriend flee the scene he later argued that the machine had come to life on its own and that the engineers working on it were responsible he goes on paid leave while the bosses look into the matter they reach the obvious conclucion that the engineers and fabricators had followed company policy in securing the machine and that the manager had not only broken a dozen rules but had also engaged in activity that could be considered sabotage he was fired but i do not know if they actually filed lawsuit tldr i know why engineers drink
i did my work experience at company x where i worked in the it department so my jobs involved installing antivirus fixing phones that employees dropped and making computers for new employees so one day one of the actual it guys gets this call saying that someones monitor just randomly went black he thinks it will be an easy fix so he decides to take me along e is employee it is the actual it guy m is me gtit so what seems to be the problem gt gte i moved my monitor forwards so i could see it better and it randomly went black i instantly thinks that a cable has fell out checks the back and sure enough the input cable fell out gtm the cable fell out plugs back in and screen lights up there you go gt gtit whoa m unplugs cable you cant fix it that quick you need to talk for about five minutes so they can get you a cup of tea five minutes and a cup of tea later gtit so m do you think you can fix it gt gtm well it seems like a cable has fallen out the back let me get it for you plugs back in all done gt gte wow thanks so much m
tfts new here i work for a computer repair company that takes in a ton of strange clients this client in particular happened this past monday lets call her farmlady gtfl hi my computer runs really really slow when im on the internet gtme hello lets see what we find plugs unit into monitor and power while i am plugging this computer in farmlady talks my ear off on how she loves to play farmville and and also some zoo game on facebook so much so that she has facebook accounts so she can visit all of them and get more points or whatever gtme well taking a look right off the bat i see nothing on this computer that may be causing problems did you get this computer recently please note this computer had no data on it whatsoever there was still tb free space gtfl oh no ive had this computer for over a year now how can you tell if it is running defrag because i dont think it has done that in a while maybe thats the problem gtme well maam there is nothing to defrag as you have no data on this puppy at all lets see show me how you normally use this computer on a daily basis maybe we can get it to replicate the issue gtfl proceeds to open chrome firefox and ie signs into different facebook accountsshe uses all three browsers at the same time tldr when you use chrome ie and firefox at the same time youre gonna have a bad time edit i wanted to add a little clarification to this post she plays instances of farmville on all three browsers at once the reason the hdd space is relevant is because she kept asking me if she needed to defrag her computer and was wanting to know how she could tell that if it was running or not when i told her that she didnt have anything to defrag she was completely baffled but im on it every day

this happened a very long time ago when i worked for a very large organisation rd largest employer on the planet if that is a clue i worked for a national group in this organisation and we had offices in every major city in the country one of the cities had a regional holiday and i had agreed to cover any local calls while the two it support guys took the day off i was not expecting much other than a few senior managers who had to catch up on work no calls had come through until about am when a senior member from this remote office telephone number came up ive been trying to print and nothing is appearing in the printer he told me not a problem i said i will remote into your machine and check it out myself so i get onto his box and could see that someone had changed his printer to a networked one you are not printing locally i am sorry he replied you are not printing to your local printer it has been changed to a printer on the network i changed it back to the one on his desk while i explained you are printing to another printer in the country oh he said and hung up really abruptly i did not expect that type of rude behaviour from this guy but then he was a pretty high level person and they could get rude the next call i got was from this young secretary in one of our small offices i did not get support calls from there very often since it was a small office with only staff this girl had started about a month before and this was her first job i think she still lived at home hello is this it support she asked yes it is my printer has not stopped printing this morning i was kind of expecting this call and so i told her not to worry and was about to say i knew where it was coming from when she interrupted me it wont stop printing ppporn she exclaimed she had trouble saying the word porn as if this was something bad that her parents had told her about it is pages and pages about mens things and their problems i am sorry what is it i asked mens parts and them having difficulty with them she explained erectile dysfunction i asked i am not explaining this any more there are pictures we have been hacked she yelled at me in quick succession i calmed her down and told that i had stopped the printouts and that we would not be hacked again i guess the fellow in the other city had been trying to print out suggested solutions to his problem from various medical websites and when the first printout had not appeared he had pressed print several more times he had tried to print over copies of multiple articles the secretary left a short while later stating that she did not feel suitable for this position it seemed to have really rattled her edit wow front page thanks he was not in a medical profession this stuff was strictly personal he came in on a holiday to surreptitiously print information of a sensitive nature and read it later this was back when folks did not have home broadband i think that he had probably been set up to print to the remote office and then forgot about it until he remembered i never chased it up and found out if the local support guys had done this for him i thought the fellow had suffered enough the offices were on opposite sides of the country roughly miles apart the lass had left after this but i think other things were also affecting it she was pretty sensitive and did not handle being in a busy office well closeted schoolgirl to frontline support staff in a busy office is tough for most folks this probably did not help i have no idea what the pictures showed use your imagination 
back when i was in high school a couple years ago i was more or less tech support for most of my teachers simple stuff nothing too complicated this is my favorite story among many to tell from back then the bell had just rung i walked into class and sat down like any other day after everyone had arrived and gotten situated my teacher walked to the front of the room to get class started she went to turn on the projector so she could display the powerpoint with the material that she would be lecturing on class had continued on for about minutes or so when all of a sudden the powerpoint was gone the projector had shut off by itself for some reason my teacher not skipping a beat looked up at it with a determined look on her face dont worry i know how to fix this she took an empty chair putting it right under the projector and stood up on it after taking a deep breath she placed her face against the vent on the back and blew with all her might her face was turning red from how hard she was blowing the class was utterly horrified i did my best to contain my laughter managing to let out the words maam please dont put your mouth on the projector she turned her head and gave me this sincerely confused look this is what the tech support guys did the last time i called them in here to fix this these guys were being paid a salary for this i sighed and asked her politely to get down and she complied i tried to think of what to do to troubleshoot the problem it was pretty obvious to me what it probably was but i wanted to confirm by hunch i turned the projector back on leaving it for a couple minutes and sure enough after a while an error message popped up check airflow it was overheating naturally to prevent damage to itself after passing a certain temperature threshold it would shut itself off i got up on the chair to see what i could do i fiddled with the vent a bit and the cover popped off without much fuss to reveal a filter sure enough it was totally completely clogged with dust i took the filter to the trash can knocked it on the side a couple times to dislodge the dust and put it back into the projector that should fix it i said she clearly didnt believe me based on the look on her face but she humored me anyway and went to turn on the projector so she could resume class class ended and the projector hadnt pooped out on us again and things ran smoothly for the rest of semester still got a b in that class though
 so im in the military and work in tech support so to speak we broadly label it data networking but it entails a huge variety of actual tech jobs sometimes im configuring routers other times im troubleshooting equipment but on this day i was on the help desk for a fairly large field op it can be stressful sometimes because all of the users show up at the same time and it never fails that half of them have the same problems ie initial logons setting passwords with proper security stupid stuff like this things finally calmed down for us and i went back to our hide away to relax for a bit well i didnt make it very long when this pissed off sgtmaj came storming into the room hes all flustered because he cant get to the google i make my way over to his office and ask him to give me a couple minutes to troubleshoot thoughts running through my head initially were the basics is an ethernet cable even connected yes can it ping the default gateway yes and the dns yes i see his ie browser and open it in the web address bar he was literally typing the google in and trying to load the page to make my life easier and rather than explain that it doesnt work that way i simply saved the page and labeled in the google for him this guy joined the military before i was born and probably saw it go from snail mail to email just one of the dynamics of tech support in the military i guess

positondeploy technician main duties were building the computer to the requested specs and delivering to the end user or to the machinery it was used to run companybig green tractor maker we had around various buildings with different it equipment in them but the one that everyone dreaded goign into was the foundry if youve never been in a foundry they tend to involve a lot of activities like this and needless to say this was not our most favorite place to deploywell anything the one redeeming factor there were the people they fixed and madedo with whatever they had for as long as possible to help us out and we appreciated it when they called for hardware they needed it there was never a complaint from us about them requesting too many things as they used things to the last shred of usefulness was gone and then they called us one of these fine people was alex aka the mad russian alex was really a fun fun guy got work done but when things went wrong due to ineptitude or bad planning on someone elses part he let it be known he also had the pull to make things difficult for anyone who crossed him so we usually went out of our way to keep him happy usually this is a story of what happened when we didnt i was driving in the foundry to drop a computer off for a small office located just next to one of the hotter holes of hell located in the foundry i make my drop hook up and confirm it connects all is good and grab the gator to leave and head back to that air conditioned office i can see the door at the other end but then notice a bald mids russian standing directly in the middle of the inside driveway no no for most people but not for him hell who would tell him to move the following exchange occured alex derp we need to talk derp sure how can i help alex where is my printer derp noticing this isnt the regular happy alex imnot sure i know i dont handle the printers really alex unimpressed with my lack of answers the printer i requested weeks ago ours broke beyond patching and we need it quickly please find out and get back to me asap i agree and speed back to the nerd cave we have on the other end of the site i approach one of the more senior techs about this he assures me he knows and is trying to do what he can to get it and that he will contact alex he does notifying alex that due to restraints put in place by our contracted company terrible place by the way we had to wait for too many varying levels of approval alex understood he wasnt happy but he understood now alex isnt dumb he knows things such as hardware requests replacements etc are pretty low on the hierarchy of it issues around there the bigger issue we had was network security the wireless we had was strictly for laptops and they were hardcore at making sure it stayed that way no personal phones corporate phones or personal laptopsanything not a business use laptop was allowed when something not allowed connected it was noticed and that area was notified immediately more than that the higher it people were forced to deal with it look into it and update superiors on the issue etc massive email chains always erupted from this the very next day we get a high urgency ticket regarding network activity and an iphone specifically someone attempting to logon with alexs credentials through a phone emails were spammed alex was contacted the phone was disconnected from the network as he had recently gotten the phone he was made aware and disconnected he also became aware of just how serious this network intrusion seemed to be fast forward to the next day around pm the following day the same thing happened emails alex contacted phone disconnected from network ticket resolved again the following day it occurred it started happening each and every day ignorance no longer a valid excuse this email roundabout was becoming a hassle for all those involved as it touched some pretty important it mailboxes not to mention some higher ranking managers of the plant overall not soon after this first week of calculated attacks he stepped up his game times a day he would connect his phone to the network by the middle of the second week our it broke literally every other email seemed to be about why we couldnt keep the network secure why all these intrusions were happening to the passive viewer of emails most higher ups who were ccd out of requirement all this looked like was a bad it company not able to do their job to us in the it area it was pure genius he couldnt get his printer in a reasonable time fine but to make up for it he would swamp the it higher ups with so much grief and email that he would be impossible to ignore finally one of the higher it people of our company called him directly at first to berate him on his constant breach of wireless protocol he left a stern voicemail and stood by in fake bravado as he told us it was handled a call came in but as he was talking we were to listen and let it go to our department voicemail when he finished he turned saw the missed call was alex and put the phone on speaker before playing it obviously expecting it to be an apology but getting something much much different voicemail starts in a heavy russian accent im aware that ive broken yourrules i do not care ive waited ive followed yourrules to get a printer for this area you ignore me can you ignore me now i want my printer click the bossman stands in silence not sure what to think we all sit there doing our best not to laugh our asses off at his failed attempt at returning order to the land if the situation wasnt perfect enough we all got an email as we sat there in stunned silence intrusion alert days later alex got his printer mad russian not anymore tldr russian turns into cold calculating network abuser to convince it higher ups to give him what he deserves

 im doing some work for a customer with a significant industrial control system network spread over a large campus im not directly assessing their security but the work requires me to be in contact with their it and infosec folks customers ics systems present a risk to property and human life if they fail so there have to be significant controls to protect them their ics network is a separate network from the regular it network not under the control of it or information security the ics group is very tight lipped even with company it and is staff any questions i ask regarding their ics infrastructure are rebuffed with all our ics is on an airgapped network so were good my work peripherally discusses customers icsscada infrastructure so im not going to get all cranky i do need to ask a responsible person a few questions so i get an audience with an ics lead in order to not be a complete fool when i get to talk to the ics person i spend some quality time getting familar with the concepts and potentially the kinds of devices one might find in an enterprise in customers line of work until i find the document when i did litigation we often talked about the smoking gun document where someone admits that they knew the product was cancercausingmade from repurposed realplayer code but sold it anyway never saw one until now ive found a manufacturer of fiber switches with an open share of marketing documents including a detailed network diagram of customers ics fiber network showing switch locations names model numbers it also clearly shows how ics and business traffic travels through the same network and switches the switches break out traffic but sit on both networks i print a copy i get to actually meet ics person for ten minutes since hes running late from one meeting i get to ask him the dumb questions i had i think they were about physical security access logs or something like that im about to leave but i cant let it go mei keep hearing that you have an airgap how do you validate it ics guy looking annoyed that im breathing his airwe designed it that way mei get that how do you know nobodys plugged in something that bridges it or allows outside access ics guythe ics network is designed separately from the it network me handing him the schematicso can you show me the airgap on this map ics guy visibly turning palehowd you get this mefrom the vendor but if this is accurate youre separating traffic at layer or the switches are visible from both networks im going to guess that you havent locked them to serial only access since some of them are hard to get to ics guyyoull have to delete this document from your laptop its classified and proprietary mesure but a google search for customer switchvendor yearofproject will show it i think youve got some work to do im still friendly with a few it people there theyre working on it they at least asked the vendor to take down the schematic 
any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic arthur c clarke earlier today i was working on a webticket where i had to remote into a pc and install adobe flash player simple enough right well it would have been but while i was in the computer someone at the store walked by and saw it moving around all by itself instead of chalking it up to ghosts and leaving it at that they decided to take action they went over to the computer and ruthlessly tried to exorcise the demon from the computer by constantly dragging the mouse down toward the start menu to shut it down after almost a minute of fighting this person for control of the mouse i finally managed to click in the address bar at the top of the browser to type a message to get them to stop we usually do this to let them know we are working on it and get them to stop fighting us normally i would just type something like this is the help desk please stop moving the mouse but today i tried to be funny i typed word for word i cant let you do that dave the person stopped moving the mouse so i figured it worked and they had run away to prevent being ejected into space but a few seconds later the screen went black and i was kicked out of the pc i pinged it from command prompt and it was completely offline the person at the store pulled the power cord to stop the demons from escaping about a minute later a coworker of mine received a frantic call from a user whose computer was being hacked and identity was being stolen hilariously enough his name was dave edit after the fact i learned the the person who called back who was also the other person trying to use the computer was actually one of our level support group guys he was remoted into the same computer at the same time and had no idea what i was trying to do yes his name was actually dave which is why he was freaking out at the time all in all it was a very hilarious day edit i also learned today thanks reddit that sccm has a feature to lock the keyboardmouse of whoever youre remoting into so this silly scenario will never happen again 
emergency alarms went off at my condo tower a few days ago in every condo here there are at least three alarms all ringing and flashing red lights at the maximum decibel level considered safe by regulation whenever it happens guess what happens when my four emergency alarms go off each at peak safe decibels combined is so loud i get a little ear damage every time im sure thankfully its a rare event but i still wanted to write to building management about it leaving my telework console i ran stairs down levels to get away from this crazy noise like everybody else elevators are a hazard when theres a fire emergency fire trucks rapidly surrounded the tower as cops started redirecting traffic were very close to a joint emergency services compound and it shows the day theres a real emergency itll be nice fifteen firemen go up the stairs and a few down to underground parking one of them is notably a bald feet halfgiant wielding the largest fire axe ive ever seen theres perhaps up to a hundred people living here outside the tower now and i know this is likely to take a bit so i go grab an early lunch and coffee i come back well over minutes later fire trucks are still there the entire road is cut off people are mostly on the other side of the road because even outside the alarms are too loud babies are crying its so freaking cold i see men with icicles on their facial hair a fireman is addressing the crowd gt fireman weve determined this to be a false alarm as soon as we figure out a few issues with your primary fire panel downstairs the alarms will stop anyone who can bear the noise can go straight back in nobody does its just not bearable gt other owner what few issues just shut it off if its a false alarm gt fireman were trying but there might be something wrong with it we have someone good on it should just be a matter of minutes i shut down that thing before never been any issues gt other other owner my kid is freezing but its too loud in there im going inside elsewhere someone text me please gt bytewave fireman ive shut this down before lemme just mildly dampen the ear damage with earbuds okay lets go he shrugs and waves me in and we head downstairs into the underground parking and straight to the electric room where the primary panel is for the alarm system there after getting through the door guarded by two cops with fingers in their ears i find half a dozen firemen staring at the thing the halfgiant with his twohanded battleaxe seems particularly intent on driving it through the thing another fireman is holding a manual and screaming the lines written in it at their operator next to him is a huge open suitcase of manuals presumably for all commonplace systems like this one the operator is pushing buttons seemingly at random gt bytewave ive shut this down before the power button is up on the top left on the steely part itll shut down the system and the alarm wont be on anymore once it boots back up gt fireman i know i tried the power button doesnt work were trying the emergency codes now the power button doesnt work well stuff can always break even a power button but after years fixing stuff ive come to believe some explanations are less plausible than others i never even encountered a real issue wholly caused by a power button gt bytewave did you hold it down gt fireman what gt bytewave hold the power button down for seconds he complies alarms stop he looks at me with an even mix of thanks and im about to facepalm now did nobody there ever have to shut down a computer before eh whatever lets get something out of this instead of just rubbing it in i take out my earbuds gt bytewave hey happy to help now the noise these alarms make is crazy is it up to code any of you feeling a little deaf right now they confirmed to me each alarm was up to code but that together they crossed the threshold somehow nobody planned for this when we had this tower built gt bytewave okay id like this in writing so we can get it tweaked easily do you think it would be possible to gt halfgiant with battleaxe of course give us your email ill send you something incredibly enough merely an hour later i got a legallooking advisory from the fire department that our alarms were too loud already forwarded to building management all of bytewaves tales on

attention long story ahead im working for a big company with branches in many countries i and my colleagues are responsible for around servers and everything support related for employees inside the building and field staff you could say i am the it janitor this story actually made me so furious that i had an impuls to punch a hole in the wall for the whole day so today ill tell you the story of the in my opinion stupidest department of the company it all started on a monday morning when else i got a call from my beloved marketing department the call goes like this gt md hello toast this is stupidgoose the copier isnt working again you really need to fix this gt me ok whats the problem gt md its only printing half of the page i need seems to be a easy fix just some printer settings no big deal they mess the settings up every week gt me ok that should do the trick could you try and print it again gt md ok one moment after minutes waiting i hear a unhealthy sound through the phone gt md what have you done get up here immediately you are in big trouble gt me what the hell on my way so i walked up to their office and what is the first thing i see toner toner everywhere around the copier and pissed off employees so i asked what on earth is going on here the respond was screamed into my face from stupidgoose gt sg you see exactly what happened here its your fault you will pay for this points at her with toner sprinkled jeans gt me please stay calm and explain me what happened gt sg you broke the printer and now everything is fucked up gt me i see so investigated the battlefield around the copier the panel you open to get to the toner was ripped off the toner was lying on the ground in two pieces and there was toner on the carpet meters around and on the copier so i asked her what she did in the minutes i was waiting on the phone gt sg it was not working again so i tried to fix it myself gt me you tried to fix it yourself gt sg its your fault it should work in the first place now the rest of the department jumped in and helped sg stand her ground after minutes of nothing is working you broke our copier i am not professional and other stuff im kinda used to i just said that ill be right back to clean the mess i know those people for not quite a year now but i know that they are not the most intelligent people in the company so i told them to stay away from the copier because its important that the toner is not pressed into the carpet also toner is nasty stuff you should better not put on your sandwich so i left the office to get the special vacuum cleaner for toner and you might see where this is going when i came back into the office there were footprints everywhere around the copier that was the moment where i lost my calmness and got pissed bad idea i mean getting pissed gt me ok who the walked straight through the toner then it started a shitstorm of complaints about how i was useless now i realized that there is no way to talk to them like normal people would do so i just started cleaning the mess up with that very very noisy vacuum cleaner at this point i just ignored everything they complained about so after minutes of cleaning and putting the broken stuff into a bag i left with no words after only minutes i got a call from my area manager he told me that the marketing department is complaining to all highly ranked people in the company that i broke their copier damaged the office and soiled their clothing also they said you left without cleaning your mess up thats it those insert random insult will suffer after i explained everything to him he was on my site and it was time to think about the punishment so what to do there are many things i thought about at this moment most of them would bring me in jail for a looong time but there were some ways to make their job harder that are not thatwell not that brutal and bloody punishment writing a full report of sg destroying company material worth around broken copier broken toner until the end of days black carpet punishment talking with my colleagues about declining calls from them they are now not allowed to call us directly except for an very important emergency everything else needs to be put in as a ticket punishment i have the servers i have the power password resets every week with special rules character length min special characters min numbers both small and big letters and the passwords must be different to the one before by characters and beforeand before the list goes passwords into the past atm as long as they do not apologize to me i wont change anything the end of the story is that my report went high up to the boss and sg got to a first and last warning if she fu shit up again she is fired i think theyve learned their lesson they havent said a single word to me except for hello and thanks since then ps there was a trainee i know in the room when sg broke everything so i knew exactly what was going on in those minutes i was waiting at the phone and while i was gone for the vacuum cleaner i went like this sg goes to the copier waits for seconds punches the copier tries to open the printer with force rips off the opening mechanism of the printer forces the toner out looks at it and starts shaking it toner is flying around and she tosses the toner at the copier toner cartridge brakes in two pieces and spills toner everywhere copier got damaged by the hit too after i went for the vacuum cleaner she walks to the copier again and mocks around how stupid i am thats it im done with this department sorry for mistakes while writing my native language is not english so there are definitely mistakes in my text edit due to some people telling me how unsecure the password policy is here are some more informations for that everyone thinking that is right it is not professional and not secure at all they will write the password down and stuff im not going to let this new rule stand for a long time just for more week maximum but hell i laughed when the trainee told me how hard it was for them to change the password for the first time btw trainee was not affected by that stuff alsoi know that they were writing the passwords down the whole time i told them to stop that but they ignored it i even told the supervisor about that problem but it seems like they ignored it too ive already become loud while telling them to stop that they had lists with passwords under their keyboard so the security hole in this department cant get that much bigger
i was told you guys might enjoy this i went to the surgeons the other day for a followup and to get my stitches out yay he logged into the computer and pulled up the pictures he took of the inside of my wrist as they came up he made a joke about how the pictures wont mean anything to me because its not your fault you didnt go to medical school to which i gave him the requisite chuckle then when he couldnt get the program to resize the pictures properly on the screen and i had to show him how to use the computer i said to him dont worry this is what i went to school for i wouldnt expect it to make sense to you he didnt think it was all that funny true story

ive unfortunately taken down this story and my related comments a few weeks ago my most popular so far because there was a substantial witchhunt going on for a time about it at work after it made rall and i had reasons to believe it was an employment risk at the time the two parts together had over k ups and glids thanks to it everyone at work has heard about rtalesfromtechsupport now but its no longer an issue i have confirmation that it was largely overblown and that i was never actually at risk of identification despite early information to the contrary i hate censorship and i feel bad for ever taking it offline so im rectifying that tonight by reposting whole thing here the hell with it for the curious about past comments i present the internets inability to forget though with atrocious formatting part was archived entirely while part is all here comments the sidediscussion about plaintext passwords led to without further ado the whole thing i deleted because i briefly got scared of hrs plastic teeth were all humans with bills to pay but in the end all that is needed for hr to triumph is for employees to do nothing in memoriam of fallen colleagues causes of unemployement love justice system gonewild st century witchhunting against unions this story contains a healthy dose of legal drama but i believe its still relevant here awhile ago my isp laid off in one day unionized employees and about a dozen nonunion staff and managers including a director and in the end were quite unhappy to have to do so legally this happened over fraud were a big company and of course many couples formed at work and in many cases began to live together were also all entitled to generous discounts on all our services with several being simply free for all employees you can get a package of cable internet phone and mobile that would normally cost month for about if you go for a set of highend options as we mostly all do the problem was that when two employees lived together one of them defacto lost this privilege as a single privileged account covers everything you can possibly need at one address the solution used by everyone for years to avoiding wasting their perk for living with whoever they loved was simple one of them would put the home address of a relative as their own just to avoid wasting the perk legally this has now been determined to be fraud but at the time it seemed like an innocuous workaround and it was fairly common knowledge among average employees that was how you dealt with it and nobody cared until the day one manager with an axe to grind found out two union reps in love together were doing exactly that suddenly legal hr and the president of the company started pushing panic buttons frantically so began the great witchhunt initially according to sources close to the enemy the company their initial plan was just to fire the two that had been found out and issue a stern company wide warning against such practices but orders rapidly came down from the office of the president that this fell well short of sufficient the lovebirds were left alone for now legal papers were drawn up six people with great suits plotting world domination with legal degrees picked up their best italian leather suitcases and went to court requesting a closed audience to discuss potential fraud they argued that the audience had to be kept under wraps because for the time being the potential fraudsters had access to information that could endanger national security our databases have lots of confidential information on millions of customers and yes everyone aside from the frontline grunts can read their emails and see their passwords if they were aware of procedures against them and that police action would be hindered if word got out before the potential fraud was fully uncovered hey they said national security motion granted the secrecy prevented the union from knowing about the proceedings or representing anyone at this stage law at least ensured that a public attorney would represent the parties which did not know they were accused but without the possibility of contacting them to organize a defense at audience they explained the situation the suspicion it was widespread amongst rank and file employees in a relationship with another and that since the company had no records regarding who was sleeping with whom there was only one logical thing do order police to secretly collect gps data on the cellphones of every union employee for days to ensure they were not lying about their place of residence of course only police would see the data compare it to listed addresses claiming employee discounts and report mismatches to the court for further action hey why not its not like this is pre or something they did say national security lets do it then the generic public attorney gpa finally said something useful the dialogue is based on secondary sources and is not word for word gtgpa are unionized employees the only ones with these benefits gtevil corporate lawyers ecl well technically anyone working for the corporation has gtgpa defense moves that if such an action is authorized national security could also be affected by any nonunion employee with access to the companys database that any warrant must be broadened to the entire company and coupled with a gag order that forbids anyone with knowledge of these proceedings to share this information with any employee of the corporation including upper management gtecl your honor we do not believe such a risk exists and that the high hiring standards and regular screening of our nonunionized personnel who unlike the union workers fall under our strict corporate policy instead of a very limiting work contract make the risk negligible that they could defraud us its not worth the time of law enforcement to investigate such a dead end gt gpa amongst all people with employee discounts and access to systems that could access information that might in any way impact national security what is the ratio of union to nonunion personnel gt ecl objection relevance gt gpa essential to evaluate the extent to which nonunion personnel could theoretically impact national security gt judge overruled please answer gt ecl well i dont have exact numbers on hand but uhm slightly more nonunion personnel overall in the entire structure but obviously there was more to it than this corporate could bring in witnesses whereas gpa couldnt given his inability to contact those he represented were told he managed to get a government official to testify to his belief that the threat posed by isps employees ability to realistically damage national security through access to systems was generally low but to no avail still his main point had being heard gtjudge be it ordered that a mandate is given to city police to establish within days the technical basis for a days wiretap of every person with a listed address with employee discounts at the corporation limited to the collection of gps data of the wireless devices listed in the accounts in question that everyone aware of these procedures is sworn to absolutely secrecy about the provisions of this order on pain of criminal sanctions and police is to report within days after collection of cases of potential fraud to this court and that all collected data that does not point out to potential fraud must be immediately destroyed the contents of this hearing will remain sealed for the time being soon after a colleague of mine part of our unionized security department mostly in charge of ignoring thousands of piracy claims that very often involve references to the dmca even though were in canada and also in charge of cooperating with all police military or judicial requests to the corporation in complete secrecy got the very weird call he told me about it once he was legally allowed to gtpoliceman do you understand the contents and limitations of the mandate and that youre personally sworn to secrecy for the duration by virtue of its content and that failure to gtinternal security yes i understand have to track my own damn cellphones position for a week and a few thousands others your paperwork is in order soo if i turn off my cellphones for a week do i go to jail gtpoliceman this is no laughing matter and i do not advise that how much time to do you need to setup a track of this magnitude gtinternal security oh lets see thousands of accounts about more sims hmm gtpoliceman the volume is going to be a problem isnt it gtinternal security the only problem is that a judge signed off on this eta to hours policeman could you then next week crossreference it against employee accounts to gtinternal security could sure will no that falls outside my job description and your mandate i will provide you in bulk the relevant addresses and gathered gps metadata within to hours after the big brother week is over given the sensitivity i wont send it electronically i will have a physical thumbdrive for you to pick up gtpoliceman this will cover your obligations but its less than helpful gtinternal security then that is less than my problem have a good day policeman and so soon after my cellphone was legally wiretapped only for gps data for a week thousands of others too including the presidents and the ecls what could possibly go wrong tldr upon uncovering two union reps were living together and skirting the rules about employee benefits in a way many had done since forever upper management launched a legal witchhunt that involved getting legal rights to track every union employees cellphones gps data for a week in utter secrecy and they argued national security to get their way but it backfired when a random public defender forced them to track managements cellphones too fast forward a few months in part because local police is notoriously slow working with gps data when we dont do their job for them were back in court gt policeman over the course of the investigation we have established mismatches and potential mismatches between listed addresses and the usual patterns of movement a small percentage of sims could not be tracked either because they were offline not in working devices or outside network coverage the threshold of evidence for possible fraud charges is met and a copy of the report has gone to the crowns prosecutor for evaluation in a case like this the likelyhood of criminal charges were extremely low but section of the ccc obligates such cases to be reviewed by prosecutors frauds over k can land you in jail for up to years in theory gt judge very well before the report can be released to the parties the court wishes to know what procedures have been or will be put in place by the corporation to limit any threats of the sort discussed earlier in the process from playing out once information leaves these walls gt ecl we will build our cases rapidly at which point we will terminate the employees we are convinced committed fraud simultaneously with security in place to escort them out their access to tools and networks will be disabled as of notification union stewards will be informed simultaneously and will be present to offer counsel and explain arbitration procedures to ensure they get due representation personnel effects will be boxed and mailed we intend to separately file civil suits seeking damages legal fees and punitive damages but in the interest of not clogging the courts legal will show good faith when discussing potential settlements gt judge termination procedures are one thing but the danger to the public good you argued caused by the information your staff has access to is another i offer advisory that the corporation reviews its internal procedures to minimize potential future harm as weve determined that too many employees had access to potentially powerful tools that were not strictly necessary to do their jobs anything else before we proceed gt gpa yes your honor the termination procedure described was very specific mentioned union stewards and arbitration procedures what exactly will happen to nonunion personnel who are equally suspected of the same offense on this list we would argue that all must be held to a single standard if fraud indeed occurred gt ecl we continue to hold full confidence that if any nonunion professionals engaged in such practices itll be in extreme minority gt judge counsel will provide an answer to the question actually asked gt ecl i assume we would have to apply severe disciplinary procedures to these outliers we cannot really tolerate fraud at any level but the final decisions would lay with the relevant direction gt judge that is a big change of tone compared to the previous statement the court truly hopes this is not evidence of bad faith we have not mandated police resources and taken extraordinary surveillance measures for what increasingly appears to be a witchhunt against unionized employees the corporation will provide notification to local police the court and the union of what disciplinary measures or legal charges have been brought forward against each person on the list in addition to security improvements we have discussed within days or may face consequences for wrongful proceedings and contempt i am allowing into these proceedings the lawyers of the union whom are to be read into the gag order and events so far to assist or replace at their leisure gpa they will be equally bound to secrecy towards their own structure and the court no longer believes their presence poses a security risk you will understand my mood better in a moment sergeantatarms provide counsel with copies of the police reports we will recess until new counsel has been read in what i would not have given to be a little bird in the window looking at ecls faces when that union brick dropped on their head and they realized the bulk of the offenders were nonunion personnel including managers and a key director union lawyers were horrified to be read into what happened while they couldnt yet tell the union what happened they had power of attorney and immediately both drew up suits alleging everything they could and tacking on immense damages they went after them for civil damages for privacy breaches that could get them settlements offenses to union rules like conspiracy to hinder representation that could get them favorable rulings in arbitration and breaches of lawyer ethics legal misconduct willful misrepresentation etc that could potentially get ecls disbarred they stopped short of charges that would become criminal as theres no way to bargain once its in the crowns hands something the ecls should have thought about in the first place while they could not even tell union management what they were working on as per gpas gag order they could legally tell them that their billable hours would go up by an order of magnitude and they needed one extra lawyer which rang huge red alarms the union was on war footing this went on for awhile with most everyone still in the dark but suspecting something unusual was going on people in many departments started losing access to tools under new security policies that popped up out of the blue sysadmins could no longer see customer billing files plaintext passwords became harder to access someone in sales couldnt use tech diag tools anymore frontline staff were no longer allowed to ask for passwords without permission from senior line etc my department is probably one of very few that didnt lose any useful tools as the shadow legal battle began to draw on im fairly certain breaches to the gag orders happened on both sides though its impossible to prove the ecls were now negotiating directly with the unions lawyers and everything suggests they were blinking hard on firing everyone they wanted a deal but they had opened a pandoras box they couldnt close the police report suggesting likely fraud meant that crown could very well bring charges of its own and the corporation was now vulnerable legally to things like contempt or obstruction of justice if they did a so they ultimately just did it they fired everyone unionized or not only the person in each couple who was lying about their address was fired not their so except in the case of the two union reps they fired them both which was completely bogus one of them got their job back and significant damages in arbitration months later but the rest all lost fallen in the field of a senseless battle the promised civil suits for damages all vanished as the company had no desire to go hard after their lost managers which they hardly wanted to let go in the first place and they had to demonstrate equal treatment they clearly helped them land equivalent jobs at other companies while playing hardball with our own ultimately the final tally was union down nonunion some of them were good friends no criminal charges were filed by the crown there was a big shakeup at legal awhile later because the counter suits our lawyers filled had clear merits in many cases and had to be horse traded for things they had no desire to give this is a bit weird but its how it happens whenever one side is losing a suit too badly it more often ends up settled with related changes to the work contract the other side wanted rather than actually risking rulings with huge damages in the end its fairly obvious that the company came to understand the president and legal had gone in way too hard and the common sense idea of simply warning everyone that this had to end would have been much better tldr the ecls hopes to focus on the union backfired as more nonunion were doing it the court understood what was going on and brought in union lawyers they forced the company to update its policies sadly they had painted into such a corner they had to fire everyone even once they no longer wanted to our own lawyers made multiple gains when fighting back but we could only save one of the union fallen on the field because it was really deemed to be fraud in the end all of bytewaves tales on

i am a network engineer for an msp and we handle a number of clients being on the engineering team i rarely field phone calls but we were shorthanded one day so i was back in the trenches i received a phone call from user who is unable to access their files on the shared drive keep in mind that this location is in another country canada and doesnt have the same procedures as the us branches i then proceeded to do basic troubleshooting i quickly come to the conclusion that they have gotten some sort of ransomware as all of the files even shortcuts have the vvv extension interestingly the file last modified dates were all even more interestingly there were two sets of the helpdecrypthtml files one of which with a vvv extension huh so that means that the entire volume was not encrypted once but twice i informed user of the situation promptly disabled the unc share nuked the entire directory and began restoring from our daily backups of which we retain backups from up to years ago user was very understanding as this isnt the first time this has happened at this location in fact it was the th in under a year ive recommended that the entire staff there be submitted for it safety training and were pushing through a phishing test as well i found the users responsible and shut their machines down remotely followed quickly by a phone call telling them to ship the machines back to corporate for reimaging how no one there noticed that all of the files on their shared drive were encrypted for months is beyond me this was supposedly a business critical system
 a lot of employees have been here for a long time decades even but annie has been here for over years i dont know how old she is but if i had to guess i would say around she recently battled cancer and has recovered although she walks around the office a little bit more slowly now on the week before christmas she left a big box of chocolate covered cookies on the table in it and a card on each of our desks each one had a gift card the morning we came in and saw all this the helpdesk specialist and i ran out to kroger and got her a plant with some red flowers and a card that had a dove shaped detachable xmas ornament on the front inside it said may peace be with you in your life and always or something to that effect we left them on her desk when she wasnt there she came downstairs later that morning with tears in her eyes and thanked us and told us how thankful she was to have us in her life the story would be over at this point but it turns out she had a favor to ask of someone in it and i turned out to be the one she asked she needed a voicemail pulled off her phone and she didnt have the slightest idea how to do that as she gave her old flip phone to me she said what youre doing will mean a whole lot to someone i wondered what she meant i got some free time later that day and i dialed voicemail the first one was businessrelated that didnt seem like the one the next one started and i suddenly knew this was the one she was referring to as it started playing i could hear some quiet music in the background then a man started talking in an old tired sounding voice i love you baby i love you anne and thank you for everything youve ever done for me and are still doing for me i dont know if ill ever be able to repay you just to be the man that you know i that you want me to be thats all i can promise you but im ok ok i just want to let you know im safe i love you goodnight bye whether he was addressing annie or some other anne i dont know all i know is that she said it would make a woman very happy and after i recorded with my iphone and burned it to two cds one data and one music annie said that i did make someone very happy she said that the man in the voicemail was someones husband who died and this voicemail on her phone was the last time his wife ever heard his voice the next day there was a visa gift card for on my desk i bought a tiffany style turtle lamp with a stained glass shell i even bought the bulbs and had amazon gift wrap it i left it on her desk i spent on it and kept for myself she sent me an email the next day hungryweevil good morning thank you for the beautiful gift i will always cherish the light it is a spiritual artifact i will use during meditation gods love and light to you and your success love a 
everyone once in a while ill put on my best doctor cox impersonation and call a junior engineer by a girls name then go on some stupid little rant its all in good fun and enough people have seen scrubs or a uzachinoz ama that they get the joke quickly and we all get a good laugh this morning was just another one of those days but im actually quite proud of it myself ive noticed recently that our monitoring company is quite lazy they handle all alerts and tickets that occur between pm and am but if an alert were to be triggered at say am they will hold that ticket until and then send it up to us to be worked their main problem is that they actually forward the original alert to us and its timestamped so i know what theyre up to i woke up a bit early this morning and saw this very thing happen i checked the site to see that it was already back up and saw that the circuit had came back up minutes before he bothered to send the alert after all he had to wait for the cutoff time so he didnt have to work on it i shot an email back telling this guy that it was his issue and he needed to work on it but an email argument went back and forth for a few minutes before my boss put an end to that he asked me if i could prove my point i said yes and he had an emergency conference call and webex so i could do just that everyone dials in i was surprised we had people on a call at am with less than minutes notice and im made presenter i quickly login into the device and show that the last flap up was minutes before the alert was sent to us the guy was sitting there saying that it was down and i looked at the user logs to see that he was logged in shortly after the flap and was still logged in when the alert was emailed everyone saw my screen as im highlighting this part of the log files for some reason doctor cox came out gtwwwwhhhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeellllllll what do we have here it appears that the little princess here knew damn well what was going on but was too lazy to find a root cause you see logs are like hips shakira they just dont lie i dont think ive heard so much laughter in an emergency morning meeting in my entire career 
so i was settling down to go to bed one night around when my phone rings my boss tells me that he is having an email emergency i tell him politely that he is shit out of luck because there is no way i am coming in that late at night and to wait until the next morning i wake up to about texts and a voicemail that are basically i fixed the problem the problem is back when are you coming in please hurry now let me be clear this guy has an email emergency on a monthly basis but it wasnt until i got to the text saying he would pay me a bonus if i fixed the problem before noon that i took his request seriously if he was willing to throw in an extra hundred bucks there is probably a real problem so i rush to get to the office around and my boss is frantically typing on his computer he tells me that he thinks client emails arent coming through so he has been sending himself constant test emails and none of them are coming through either i sit down and check all of the usual suspects account settings were right across all his devices the network was fine i sent a couple of test emails and they came through fine i asked him to send a test email to himself because i wanted to see if the server was bouncing them back for some reason it was at this point i realised what the problem was he was typing in his own email address incorrectly which is firstnamerentalsgmailcom he had been sending dozens of emails with the subject line test to someone else all nightthat morning i informed him of the typo and he just kind of stood there contemplating the fact that he literally spelled his own name wrong turns out he wasnt missing emails it was just a slow email day he gave me the out of sheer embarrassment tldr boss thinks he isnt getting emails tries sending emails to himself doesnt get the test emails calls me late at night repeatedly he was typing his own email address wrong paid me to fix a typo 
just a short one here at my school had to fix an issue with a teachers personal laptop turns out she was on leave call her up and ask for a screen shot she says she will mail it to me find a pdf file in my mail thinking nothing of it i open it to find out that the teacher scanned her monitor and sent the pdf i think there is a face shaped dent in my desk from where my face hit it edit the obligatory holy shit this blew up

this is by far my best and most memorable story while working at a computer repair company a middle aged woman dropped her daughters laptop off because it wasnt workingor to be more accurate was so plagued with viruses the hard drive shouldve been take out back and shot i spent some time going over it and gave her a call to let her know a backup format and reinstall would be the best course of action she declined because it would cost r and said shed be back in the morning to collect she came in to pick up but needed to leave again so she could get some cash for our r minimum labour fee that was the last i saw of her for months out of the blue she came into the store to to collect the laptop but we had repurposed it as store policy was that if a pc or laptop is unclaimed after months we resell it or scrap it i informed her of what had happened and she and her daughter left but she would be back in the morning with her desktop which was not turning on true to her word she rematerialized the next day with a her pc in tow wrapped up in several black bin bags she informed me that it had stopped working after her son had borrowed it for the weekend and she had been trying to get it to turn on with no success okay doesnt sound too major may just be a blown power supply i checked it in and because i still had a lot on my plate that morning put it on the shelf and would get round to it later in the day a few hours later as the mid afternoon rolls in its time to see whats wrong with this machine i start cutting through the several layers of manky black bin bags wondering what kind of horrors im about to come across when i finally reach the case first thing i notice is that the side panels are loose interesting whats happened here then i pull the tower from its cocoon and it quickly becomes obvious why this thing isnt working it had been gutted everything except for the dvd drive had been removed and was nowhere to be found after about minutes of laughing i summon the other techs to see if they can lend me any assistance in figuring out why this pc isnt turning on they look at it in disbelief after i tell them its not a joke and was a legitimate customer who brought it in and we all had a good laugh about it grant called the lady up because he wanted to be the one to tell her that the computer she brought in wasnt a computer any more and that she should probably have a good chat with her son she picked it up the next day free of charge albeit angry to this day i still wonder what she was trying to plug the power cord into tldr customer didnt know why her gutted pc wasnt turning on 
this isnt a story about me but one from an uncle i love who was remarkably knowledgeable about technology back in his day fade to black and white this tale occurs in the early s everyone always called him joe since he was born back when it was cool to name at least a few of your kids joseph joe did all sorts of work when he was young he got his education studying to be a priest but decided he liked girls and booze a little too much to go through with it then he went on to be a lumberjack an accountant a vietnamwar volunteer worked a gig at what passed as a startup back then learning everything about punch cards they went bankrupt and then he became a road tech for a tiny company pulling copper wire all over a city where there was simply no cable network this tiny company would ultimately become part of the telco i work for today after having worked in the field awhile his accounting experience landed him a cushier gig in a longdefunct and thentiny department that essentially did everything hr payroll and logistics do here today its difficult to fathom but over years ago things were incredibly different he told me tales about how back then a simple lowrung employee could make decisions that today could only be made by the board of directors after the evil corporate lawyers signed on with a supermajority but this tale is about the day he was asked to choose between two technical solutions to help the company get into the computing age early he had a boss who wanted into the computing era early perhaps too early gt sboss were looking at ibms new column card and at holleriths card i know ibm has more capacity they are pricier but since you did some work in that field id like your input before i turn in paper gt joe er sure lets start by what theyre going to be used for gt sboss well that should be obvious we want to computerize if we do it early we beat our competition the goal is to put everything related to accounting and hr on those the vp is in i have a large budget payroll will have everything on cards itll be so efficient well make major gains but i do want to know which is the best solution so i asked three employees including you with expertise in the field which to pick can you look at it and get back to me by friday joe was silent a moment and nodded came friday the first employee was a strong defender of ibms card even though it cost more the second argued that there were many flaws with this card and that most people saw it as a rather than column card because there were huge issues reading the th row and suggested holleriths joe came in with a huge box filled with paper a secretary was helping him cause it was too heavy for one person on top of the box was an ibm punch card and an hollerith card gt joe first id like to congratulate ibm on their momentum even though its overpriced and there are some issues they did slightly expand on what you can do with a punch card right now but im not exactly here to recommend buying either he removed both cards from his cargo and put a relatively thin stack of paper next to them gt joe that small stack of paper is the amount of data you can store on the best punch card that exists right now i triple checked it wont be this way forever but right now its the best money can buy tons of great uses for them anyway what they may not be so useful for is storing accounting data the huge box next to these that i only pulled a single folder from thats just the data from the last quarter from the provincial health board regarding workrelated injuries a rather small slice of the stuff accounting deals with gt sboss huh so whats your point we should look into a different card gt joe theres nothing to be gained by trying to move our accounting to punch cards right now in fact i can get through that paper stack in a week but if i had the same data on punch cards id still be making excuses a month from now im sure punch cards will get better more data in less space but right now nobody in my department me least of all thinks it would help any not for the kind of work we do wait till the technology matures before making this kind of investment the old boss dismissed him but ultimately they chose not to go ahead right away with the punch cards just a few years later once early computing was becoming actually efficient for the kind of work they needed they went all in early and joe approved at the time it paid off in spades had they blown their money on lastgen cards they might have been late on the industry rather than pioneers all of bytewaves tales on 
 walking near the vp is always a problem he doesnt seem to enjoy silence gtvp so how are you going is it all good gtme yep good i tried to get out of sync with the vps footsteps but the vp continually managed to get back in sync we looked like we were marching gtvp why are you taking my computer away again its so fast now gtme unauthorized access gtvp cant we just ask what the boy did then if it was just a defrag leave it because it is at least twice as fast at the moment gtme oh well ask him still its better to just wipe and start again though safer that way i stutter stepped a few times the vp ignored it and somehow end up in sync within a second it was almost impressive gtvp how long will it take gtme a few hours max ill get you a loaner laptop for the interim the vp looked thoughtful he seemed to toss up the options in his head gtvp no dont worry ill just wait gtme oh are you sure gtvp itll be fine in fact i probably dont even need a computer anymore gtme er okay itll only be a few hours i suppose we arrived at his office and i started unplugging his desktop he sat down at his desk and started looking thoughtful gtvp airz do me a favor take the screen off my desk i placed the screen on the floor the vp carelessly tossed the keyboard and mouse over at the floor next to me narrowly missing my head gtvp oh my the vp spread his arms out over the desk running them smoothly across the now empty surface gtvp my desk its so big i had successfully unplugged the desktop and stood up to leave desktop in hand gtvp airz wait you forgot to take the screen gtme weve got screens downstairs for the install gtvp no take it now so you dont have to do a double trip gtme taking it isnt required youll need it again when your desktop comes back the vp looked taken a back he had recoiled in horror gtvp comes back no no no have you seen what my desk looks like without a computer cluttering things up its so smooth so nice i dont think ill require the desktop back gtme you dont want your computer back the idea sounded suspicious i didnt know if i should be overjoyed or worried gtvp no i think im better off without one a vps computer cant do much gtme but youve access to every department the vps face looked determined gtvp ive decided this office looks better without a computer gtme well okay i guess you wont be seeing much of it anymore then i walked over and attempted to juggle the screen and desktop in two hands it was too much the vp was smiling gtvp dont worry ill still be connected the vp waved a little box in the air it contained a new pda i then realized the vp would now solely rely on a pda f 
this reminded me i had to post this tale when im not working from home my office is in a tall skyscrapper underneath it is a parking lot underneath that is a core headend thats supposed to be able to survive a direct nuclear strike built to specs in the s based on what the government thought would most likely be lobbed our way in case of an allout soviet first strike few years ago we were in technology readiness tests for wifi repeaters the end goal was to ensure that every customer who brought or rented one of our routers would have perfect coverage in their entire homes no matter how vast its another moneylosing gimmick that upper management really wanted us to push orders come down from the office of the president to road techs manglement as a test theyre supposed to get those to work in multiple locations including some headends where this would be most challenging but mine is behind feets of concrete and heavy metal doors made out of some obscure alloy supposed to survive soviet nukes no wifi will ever get through gt bytewave senior line bytewave you may send gt road manglement patching you to our most senior road tech input required apparently something cant be done im told youre the department to call when this happens well im a tiny bit vain and he stroked the right buttons lets make miracles happen as he explains the situation my first answer is well youre pretty fucked but its not your fault theres zero ways to get a repeater to work past blast doors but then again its a damn core headend the entire region works only because of this blast proof or not theres connectivity gt bytewave so the real goal of the exercise is to demonstrate the ability of the repeaters themselves or your departments ability to get a signal in tough to reach locations gt senior roadtech in theory who knows but really the latter my boss made that very clear unlike pretty much everything else about this thing gt bytewave yeah you were right when you told your boss to call us to back up the fact it cant be done it cant but i might have an idea to impress the wide ties union slang for upper management fiber optics are going in and out of this headend no matter how much concrete was poured i dont know where but you do theres always an entry and an exit have the repeaters get to the entry point go through the existing wiring and then on the other side set up the repeaters to give total coverage generously assuming you need more than one in there gt senior roadtech well thats obvious cheating theyll figure it out in no time gt bytewave really you worked for the same union i do for decades and you still think theyll figure it out the only thing to figure out is the fact they handed down an assignment thats physically impossible now you can skirt the rules or just say i confirmed its indeed impossible either way i got no skin in this particular crazy game beyond this ticket i already closed gt senior roadtech why not give it a try from what i gathered they really want wifi to get into this bunker and so it happens the bunkers hard structure is circumvented and they get wifi coverage in there it goes down to the entry point then though well protected fiber optics deep in concrete then wifi again totally cheating but theres wifi coverage everywhere right weeks later im ccd on an email from the secretary of the president thanking everyone for great work and saying the repeaters are moving to businessreadiness yeah totally a cheat but when youre given insane directions you do what you can to this day the office of the president still thinks we got repeaters working through blast doors

first time at this subreddit i will definitely have to share what happened today all begins with the most ambiguous email title for an issue subject fix server asap please fix server so i called this user i asked him to be more specific in what was happening he told me that his applications were not working properly in his iis server there was a poor performance making everything partial down and then as he wasnt the developer he transfer me to this guy the star of this story the first time i was talking with this guy he didnt even say hi or good morningthe first words i heard from him was gtuser listen dude lets make this quickly just sent someone to put more ram in this server with the time our applications got bigger and heavier we require more memory because we need everything thats running right now if you provide more ram this will disappear its simple logic you get it gtdeycko sounds fair but first i have to take a look and make that decision by my own gtuser dude i just gave you the reason if you install the ram everything is going to be ok you say you got it gtdeycko according to system the last time that server was shuttled down was year ago so probably we will have to restart the server and see how it goes after that your applications are not accessible and are currently down so there is no risk or impact in here gtuser oh no no no dude no whats wrong with you thats your solution if restarting is your solution i will better call my son and after that your damn manager you cannot be serious i refuse to do such thing you have no right to say there is no impact you dont know nothing at this point i was getting upset but im not the kind of guy that shows his anger that easy actually i become more nicely probably in a sarcastic mode but nicely gtdeycko all right sir i will show you why a restart its needed i will connect to your server remotely andinterrumption gtuser no you cannot access to my server thats my server it has a password that i only know and there is no way i can give you that password gtdeycko no problem sir if you are using the corporate intranet i dont need your credentials gtuser but just after i was logging into that server i noticed something weird in the task bar there was a process running that was consuming almost of the memory and that process was prepare yourselves gta vice city so this douche bag wanted more ram to play videogames in one of the servers of the company he was about to beat the game as i also played it in the past and it was frozen when he was trying to save his progress apparently so that was maybe the reason he was not ok with performing a restart of the server i was shocked this dude was so rude at me because he was playing a game and got freeze deycko dude are you playing gta vice city user goes offline edit of course i sent an email to his damn manager i told him that his applications were down because his employee was using the server to play videogames and also he was being rude about it i dont have any response yet i will keep you guys posted edit i got answer from his manager you can be sure we will take this very serious this is totally against our company values and we are going to take the necessary actions thanks for your quick response in our issue

this is my first story so all of that or whatever this occurred at least ten years ago but probably not more than fifteen years ago so well into the age where folks generally know about email and the intertubes and such the star of our tale today is a salesguy as far as i know he was a pretty good sales guy and made a lot of sales but he had quite a few eccentricities one of them was he was constantly stomping up to the copy machine to make copies of forms that he insisted on filling out on the old style ncr forms so it already made four copies when he wrote it i guess he just didnt trust the clerical staff gotta get that cash his other weirdnesses included constantly doing a sort of pee pee dance while discussing any topic with anyone not just shifting from one foot to the other but bouncing around a fairly large area jumping and jiving he also was a blatant personal space invader yet another was asking every question three times of everyone with a different inflection each time as though expecting a different answer on this day we find salesguy inside of my tiny cubicle looming over me and getting in my face and taking up the entire area with his strange dance gtsalesguy my emails are not going through to my customer i typed his address in exactly as it was on his business card pee pee dance gtme well ill take a look what address are you sending to gtsalesguy my emails are not going through to my customer i typed it in exactly as it is on his business card more dancing around gtme yes you said that what address are you sending them to gtsalesguy my emails are not going through to my customer i typed in his address exactly as it is on his business card now dancing and flailing wildly around my tiny cubicle as i shrink in my chair gtme yes i am aware that is why you are here can i please know what email address you are attempting to send to gtsalesguy thrusts business card an inch in front of my eyes i graciously accept the business card and bring it far enough from my face so that i can actually read it great this customers email address is customercustomercompanycom gtme give me a moment please i pull up the logs and search gtsalesguy flailing and dancing wildly around tiny cube this is a really important lead you better fix this found it failed deliveries to wwwcustomercustomercompanycom gtme you didnt type it in exactly as it is on the business card there is no www in front of it because it shouldnt be there for an email address thats why its not on the business card just type it in like it is on the business card gtsalesguy huffs a few times and stomps off
i was a new starter looking after a client we had taken over months ago who where having lots of issues the ceo was concerned the old it guy was still accessing the system i thought that was a bit crazy but strange things were happening account lockouts passwords changing services being disabled it really felt like something malicious was happening but i couldnt prove anything then it happened one afternoon i was light on work so i decided to log into their system and have a poke around i log onto the terminal server look at active users logged in user backup holy shit that didnt look right i bring over my coworker who notices that the computer name has the same initials as the company that the old it guy was currently working for we look at his ip and bingo reverse dns shows he is connecting from his old work place reset his password and displayed this message on his session this is an unauthorised connection your ip has been linked to your domain comau and legal action will follow knowing his session wasnt idle i let that sit for a nice seconds so he could marinate in panic and fear then disconnected his session logged in and opened outlook and he had everyones mailbox connected to his with full permissions we checked his sent items nothing i hit recover deleted items and hey presto months worth of emails he has been forwarding to himself or forwarding to a women in the office who we discover he is having an affair with he is feeding her information from her coworkers and she was using that to her advantage he had forwarded other emails that i had written to the ceo assuring him the old it guy was not logging in remotely and he had added haha these guys are fucking idiots they have no idea cancelled another backup last night do you think they will figure it out morons i could not believe what i was reading i simply can not include all of the incredible things we discovered and the evidence we collected it was the most exciting it work i have ever done in my life it was filled with justice and epic wins epilogue the ceo decided to get lawyers involved i provided them with every scrap of data i could find and they put together this intimidating page document that included itemised lists of connection times showing he basically logged in every day while working at his new job and tampered with the system it stated they would sue him and have him charged if he did not capitulate with the terms of the agreement that document was delivered to him personally at his desk at am of a work day and at exactly the same time the exact same document was delivered to his boss at am he was escorted out of the building at am edit epilogue not prologue edit ii answering some questions here what happened to the girl the ceo decided to review her work and discovered that she had been doing some sabotage as well not putting in sales orders in from people she didnt like deleting messages and saying they were never recieved and in one more serious incident she edited someones timesheet resulting in lost overtime she had to pay the back money owed and lost her job they could have taken legal action but my understanding was it was not a large amount what where the terms and conditions i wasnt privy to all the details but my client did let me know that he had to attend several depositions in which he had to answer in great detail everything he had done surrender hard drives and other equipment that he had mentioned he had stolen and there was some kind of financial component to it as well where he had to pay costs of causing all of these issues i think it was in the thousands not a huge amount but for a guy without a job it was there was some provision about not working in it i am not sure how legally that works but i believe he had to stay away from it for or years you arent an it detective youre a big phony yes when taking on a new client all password should be rotated and the entire system should be reviewed unfortunately i had been working for the company for two weeks they took on the client six months ago i later determined that several factors went into why the system review wasnt done time and cost constraints but mainly laziness my coworkers had already looked into it and concluded that he wasnt logging in and told me a full password rotation was done later i discovered it was only for real peoples accounts not service accounts when i was given management of the client account manager not it helpdesk guy the ceo gave me a the full story and i began looking into it it should also be said that my job role was account manager i met with clients and discussed the performance of our helpdesk their it agreement and projects i was not meant to do troubleshooting that was apparently for the helpdesk tier the jobs that came through to the helpdesk backups cancelled account lockouts were treated by them as isolated issues and did not investigate further than that all of this coalesced into a situation where everyone in my company was telling me its fine and my client is just paranoid i didnt accept that and found what i found did i use any advanced techniques no the guy was sloppy as shit and anyone who is worth half their salt could have found it i am sharing this story because its interesting not because i think i am a detective what other evidence did you find he was a prolific user of lync and his chat logs were all stored in his user profile he would chat throughout the day with the woman in the office and have some of the most cringe worthy interactions that were just disturbing to read they had flashes of red hot anger swearing at each other like two drunks at a pub followed by pathetic apologies and disgusting make up flirting constant bitching about others in the office i found that this woman would contact him to fix it issues it explained why she was so hostile towards me when i met her in person several incidents where he was attempting to fix something our helpdesk was also looking at the same issue and this inflamed the problems he had accidentally saved some passwords to websites in his browser cache like facebook web management site of his personal domain some other weird forums couldnt do anything with these of course but it was hilarious clicking on his history and it loading straight into these sites the audacity and gall of this guy thinking he would never get caught yet taking no steps to hide his activity the most disturbing of all though was the m night shyamalan twist when i discovered that the old it guy was very close to one of the owners and they had remained in contact after he was let go he had convinced the owner that letting him go was a mistake and to watch how many problems would occur without him he also claimed to be logging in to check on things and make sure backups run that kind of thing quotes from emails he wrote he was sabotaging the system while pretending to fix things saying that if he wasnt logging in things

it tech for a school district ok ok last week i had a work order from a teacher stating that everyday around pm her mouse pointer would jump to the bottom right corner twitch and clickdrag randomly i get to her room to check out her machine the mouse is behaving normally so i check the usual places for anything unusual eg installed programs i find a bunch on shady stuff ask toolbar coupon companion and yontoo among other things i start culling the herd and run mbam for good measure final score items including trojans i remove these and tell her to let me know if she has any more trouble today i get an email from her saying that she is still having trouble i try swapping out her mouse thinking that maybe the optical sensor has gone bad rolls around and she is still having trouble i propose reimaging her computer since nothing else seems to be working she agrees and is done for the day so i can get right to it as im backing up her data to google drive she tells me that she has to step out for a bit and will be right back as the door to her classroom closes the mouse starts to have a seizure i look at the door and see that there is a mirror bolted on it that when opened faces to the west my only thought is no i move the mouse to the other side of the screen open the door and slowly close it i see light reflected onto the floor and as it lines up with the desk with mouse freaks out again turns out she always has her door open during class tldr sniper trick shot from million miles away manages to give a rodent ptsd
 part part part im performing it vendor audits for a banking client this particular vendor seems to be special since the bank itself is sending their own compliance people instead of leaving all the work to me im sitting in the director of compliances office while hes trying to shmooze the banks compliance people hes discussing his career as a big corporate lawyer i dont mention that im a lawyer itd only confuse things im here for it things the vendor is a print shop they print statements for the consumer and investment customers so theyre processing a bit of sensitive data for the bank i ask a bunch of questions on how they hold and process data and i get believable straightforward answers just to keep them honest i occasionally ask about the same control from an attackers point of view rather than a controls point of view as an example i stick in a thumb drive into one of the graphics workstations can i download valuable data to it im hoping to get them to explain how their controls work together if they do i get the feeling that theyre less about compliance checklists and instead about actually securing important data this drives the vendors director of compliance batty i think hes afraid that ill come up with something to ding them which im not trying to do hes starting to make nasty comments when i ask questions next i want to see their print shop they run on what essentially are truck sized inkjets once the statements are printed theyre put into lockable wheeled cabinets until theyre assembled and mailed i reach over and touch the padlock a nice reliable master the director of compliance snaps at me docwhat do you think you could pick that mewell yes masters are hard to break but not too difficult to pick my local lockpicking group uses them to teach people to pick locks at this point everybodys staring at me the director of compliance is not happy docso youre saying you could waltz in here and steal anything you wanted mewell my job requires me to think like a bad guy if i were so inclined id make a pretty good thief bank compliance personso do you think theyre insecure melisten listen theyve got multiple controls in place theyve got cameras theyve got key cards ive been stopped on the way to the bathroom if i were going to steal data id try to get the feed into the printers get tens of thousands of records rather than a few hundred director of compliancewhere did you learn to think this way melaw school 
one day at my telco my boss comes to me with an unusual assignment gt boss theres something id like you to help me with but im not quite sure if it falls strictly under your job description gt bytewave lets hear it ill let you know gt boss six months ago dropped calls to senior line quadrupled went from a little over to almost overnight i asked systems three months back to explain the anomaly but they said they calls arent being dropped for technical reasons and that nothing changed regarding the system since you have access to all recordings maybe you could investigate it socalled dropped calls are just calls that didnt actually begin at all an agent calls us and hangs up before speaking to us at all the legitimate reason for it to occur other than a technical problem with the internal call system is whenever they find their answer on their own while on hold but this spike is definitely abnormal gt bytewave yeah i have recordings of every call not recordings of calls that never began at all but yeah i can take this theres a broad line in the job description all relevant operations to service the internal technical senior line so it was my job sorta even if it flirted with managerial work first thing is to get the timestamps of dropped calls im missing i call switchboards who are in charge of our pbx and internal call systems gt switchboards wait you want logs on every call to your line for the last six months gt bytewave unless you can give me specifically those who hung up before conversation started yup just timestamps and employee ids will do gt switchboards just got your ticket so we will get that to you within the next ten business days gt bytewave to pull timestamps seriously any staffing or tool issues i should know about gt switchboards i never said when within the next business days check your email that was humor there it is with a huge csv attachment gt bytewave i will mail you my thanks within the next business days have a good one i start by looking at the shortest calls but im not satisfied by the volume theres only a few dozen that last mere seconds bulk of them are obviously lasting longer a pretty sure sign that this isnt a technical issue then i get an idea i export my own recording tools logs to csv specifically just the timestamps by date reduce the logs i got to the same and compare the two all the missing lines in csvdiff are the dropped calls theres a lot and theyre all at least a few minutes long which is weird because the wait times are usually instantaneous on our line now the fun part tracking who is making them in such bulk it takes a bit to paint a clear picture but its increasingly obvious the crushing bulk of the dropped calls accounting for the entire increase come from a specific call center our main subcontractors this isnt just a few people it looks like we have dropped calls from dozens of them and upon closer inspection the calls all occur when were particularly busy enough to be worth it to call and hang up to take a short break that wont show up as too odd in your call statistics but how would they know when to hang up to avoid getting caught sure theres tickers with calls waiting but its pretty hard to gauge your position in the queue youd be bound to get caught regularly unless you came up with creative reasons to call unless something changed over there six months ago time to call their batphone gt bytewave bytewave from senior staff id like to know about your ticker system over there specifically any changes that might have occurred around mid june earlier this year gt tim hey this is tim floor manager right now ticker why gt bytewave quality assurance purposes he doesnt get my life story until i get my info gt tim uhh we only had one ticker it wasnt really working out for a call centre this big so we put up extra displays around june yeah whats it to do with qa gt bytewave lots of problematic calls from your centre ever since i need more information on these new tickers are they all exactly like the one you had before tim hesitates and puts me on hold for a minute not exactly inspiring great trust once he gets back i ask again gt bytewave actually if you could take a cellphone pic of one of the new tickers and send it to me that would be best he seems a bit reluctant but does it still gt bytewave thats not a ticker tim thats a large tv connected to a computer running managements live call monitoring software gt tim yeah we had the tvs on hand so it was the most costeffective solution like you can see it has all the calls waiting in big bold at the top gt bytewave that it does and the live details about every queue and the the employee numbers on hold right underneath anyone who can see this knows their exact position in the queue gt tim so gt bytewave so we have an inordinate amount of dropped calls coming from your floor since june people are looking at this and whenever we have calls waiting theyre calling us and know exactly when to hang up once theyre next in queue gt tim err if thats so we wont let that go unpunished thats absolutely unacceptable gt bytewave yes it is the problem is that from what im seeing its a bulk problem thank you for helping me figure this out ill let the contractor quality director figure out the details i swiftly hang up knowing the amount of dread that oxymoronic title inspires in every subcontractor managers heart clearly someone over there got this idea and spread it far and wide because from my logs this is happening all the time every time theres as much as three calls waiting on our line i rank my diff file by employee number and pull up anyone who shows up at least times to account for legitimate hang ups thats employees times employees clearly done on purpose i make a neat list of employee numbers with the diff file as evidence and off to my boss and the cqd it goes with an explanation and the picture of the new tickers couple minutes later i already got an on it reply from the cqd and i can hear my boss cursing i give him an half smile gt boss well excellent work sooo i hear you like to get subcontractors in trouble today was a good day huh our dropped calls were back to within a few weeks tldr subcontractor put up overly detailed info on calls queues on large tvs instead of using normal tickers and their staff swiftly used this data to call us and hang up repeatedly whenever our line was busy to get untraceable little breaks it took six months but it wasnt so untraceable all of bytewaves tales on

as a roving it engineer with a health service i occasionally had to take a trainee minion with me so they could experience real it work my work was varied from installation of hardware cabling software install to the turn it off turn it on fixes as a result i carried a lot of spare kit with me and every tool imaginable i had arrived at a remote site in a small seaside town ad was scheduled for the entire day to floorwalk and fix the simple issues that they were getting we brought my kit in from the car and settled down with a coffee gtminion im curious about three things in your toolbox gtme go on gtminion nail polish remover nail file and clear sticky tape the cheap stuff why do you need them as if on queue we are asked to fix a printer the laserjet in one of the offices was jamming paper i used the air can in my kit to clean out dust and then check the roller its smooth gtpass me the nail polish remover please and grab me a couple of paper towels from the toilets minion returns to see me soak a paper towel with the remover then wipe it over the roller after a few seconds i dry off the roller and reinsert it allowing a test print no more paperjam gtme the acetone in the nail polish remover eats at the roller and roughs it up a little it buys us time to order a new set and have them delivered i make a note of the asset number of the printer and the model gtminion what about the tape gtme these pcs have a design fault the power switch is a microswitch thats held in place by two flimsy plastic clips any decent force pushes the mechanism into the case and you cant turn it off or on if one breaks i just wrap a layer of this tape around the switch and reinsert it it wedges the switch in place and again provides a temporary solution until we can replace it i see hes making notes gtme first rule of customer service make sure that the customer is working even if you have to stick things together with tape and glue theyre not fixes but they are temporary solutions that means the customers are not sat twiddling their thumbs that trainee now services our printers and still carries tape a nail file and polish remover in his kit

screechy and i stood outside starring at the sabotaged airconditioner you would have to be brave to destroy something so exposed a building was directly facing the wall the air conditioner was placed on it was a wall of windows the vp arrived to access the damage i expected hed want to control the situation which was fine with me hell if i would volunteer my time to fill out police reports gtvp airz gtme oh vp yes its pretty bad the server room is cooked gtvp why would you do this gtme sorry gtvp and you miss screechy whyd you help destroy a server room gtme it wasnt us gtvp like hell it wasnt i get a call about the server room going down run to the server room realize the air conditioner is broken when i arrive outside i find you two still admiring your handiwork gtme er no miss screechy and i worked out the same thing as you came outside and found this sabotage i point over to the airconditioner with the pipe sticking through it i realize im still carrying coffee i take a sip tastes a little bit like a framing gtvp see youre carrying coffee if it was such an emergency youd have dropped it i looked down at my coffee coffee was getting me in trouble coffee was framing me 
so i got asked about my flair yesterday so i thought id share the tale thats very likely embellished and ive probably filled in some points incorrectly its also only tangentially related to it and its also thirdhand theres a demolition site near where i work and the workies often frequent the sandwich shop i go to for lunch one of them is complaining about how the mandatory site safety training they were doing this morning felt like being taught to suck eggs so the other guy explained they were forcing it on everyone because of what happened at their last site gt wibbly wobbly wibbly wobbly flashback theyd hired newguy who instead of doing the job hed been hired to do acted as a gopher for sitemanager so he was well known by everyone on site as the guy who gets stuff for the boss the morning of their last demolition the sitemanager was having trouble connecting his laptop to their wireless hub even standing right next to it he phoned up their it for help see itlt it does belong here and he was told to get a cord and just plug it into the back for now note the specific use of the word cord newguy gets sent off to get him a cord he comes back twenty minutes later with a large length of detcord turns out newguy had worked in construction but not in demolitions and it turns out he didnt know where he could get network cable on site so he started asking the other guys around where the cords were kept explosivesguy when hearing the site manager needed it said yeah sure went off and got him the detcord newguy having never seen detcord or probably cat for that matter thought nothing of it and sauntered back to sitemanager sitemanagers boss who was naturally on site for the big day clearly wasnt pleased now if you dont know what detcord is its basically a fuse that explodes at miles per second its used to trigger multiple higher explosives simultaneously and its what they use to make sure all the charges go off at the same time you probably dont want to stick it in your laptop hell you probably couldnt crimp the ends of it without losing a limb anyway the higher ups got shit scared that a new hire could so easily get a hold of explosives you know cause turrurism needless to say there was a major security audit resulting in everyone getting extra site safety training and sitemanager being told not to use the same guy regularly as a gopher whether it was newguy or not gt wibbly wobbly wibbly wobbly flashback ends i never asked if he found any cat though but if the last site was the building they blew up last year theres a lot of old ss brutalist eyesores around here then its surrounded by about computer parts shops not counting a pc world and an argos within spitting distance so im sure he got some tldr company worry intensely about rodents stealing their explosives

three years ago i started working in my current post as an it manager my predecessor had decided to turn our old kitchens into a printer room and thrust a large highspeed printer in there that does our critical print jobs a year after i started the pipes froze cracked and when the weather picked up around fifty gallons of water cascaded through the printer i was tasked with securing a replacement and this is the conversation i had with the accountant acc gt acc i dont see why we need all these features on the printer gtme we print pages in a single run so this will cope without having to refil the printer with paper of that run pages are colour a and another are duplexed trust me this is the minimum spec for a printer gtacc but grand is a lot for a printer my inkjet cost fifty quid gtme your inkjet doesnt print at fifty pages a minute and hold five thousand pages it also would have to replace the cartridges halfway through the print run gtacc what about if we go for a second hand printer gtme i cant get a full warranty out of a refurbished one and you never know how badly its been used previously if it fails we wont be covered gtacc surely we have a backup solution gtme sure a printer that runs at fifteen pages a minute it will take us all day to do a print run on that so we will only use it for dire emergencies not as a fix gtacc thats fine then well get the second hand one and use the backup as an interim fix if it breaks gtme id rather have the agreement that if the new printer breaks then we replace it within weeks i dont want to be trusting an older and slower printer with the main print run for too long gtacc well cross that bridge when we come to it i can always swing it by the board we bought the year old printer and last week it died one thousand pounds worth of component costs alone three days labour the device came with a year swapout warranty and the second year was a simple fix warranty labour and small ie cheap parts now the accountant is wondering why its not being fixed and a new printer has not been budgeted for we can get a new one for grand or a refurb for five this time im not settling for the refurb edit disclaimer our company owners never lease anything all managed print solutions are purchased hardware

so we recently made some changes to our wifi infrastructure here and predictably its caused a great deal of angst from the users that this was going to be done was announced a month ago and a web page put up explaining what youd have to do it was announced again last week as is our way and again last night before the change actually occurred theres been a lot of why is the internet down and my usernames broken and a whole bunch of why doesnt it just work why do i have to do anything it worked yesterday this is too hard coming from people who didnt read the email announcements or the status or news sections on the intranet site or even the notice that we stuck up outside the department hoping that people might read it before coming in here which is causing a certain degree of homicidal feeling among the support team but this one this one user from idiotcompany to helpcompany supportcompany linemanagercompany localofficedronecompany itteammembercompany itteammembercompany itteammembercompany it went on like that as far as i can see she just emailed every address shes ever corresponded with subject wireless down gtthe wireless is down then a whole bunch of reply to all happened with the various ccd people also emailing help and occasionally even each other and it took a couple of hours to prune everyone who had nothing to do with this out of the conversation once the shouting had shut up we managed to get a reply back explaining that the wifi was not down and that she needed to log in using her usename and password now along with detailed instructions as to how also a fairly stern warning about sending out bulk mail and why it was causing everyone such a pain in the ass what did we get back from idiotcompany to helpcompany supportcompany linemanagercompany localofficedronecompany itteammembercompany itteammembercompany itteammembercompany etc subject ok gtthe wireless is still down aaaaaand the reply to all happened again whilst we were trying to quieten everyone down we got another again ccd to basically everyone shed ever met gti tried the password then another gtit didnt work then another gti tried my username too is that the password and another gtwhats the password each time ccd to what appears to be her entire address book each time just one line with no context each one a new ticket that we have to merge with the old tickets to try and track this growing abomination to try and stem the tide we sent one of the helldesk to her office to talk to her in person she wasnt there whilst hunting for her more emails kept coming in gti thought my password might be wrong gtmy password is password is that right headdesk gti tried otherpassword which is for my pc is it that one double headdesk gti changed my password to newpassword that doesnt work either i had this image of someone sitting there just typing whatever came into their head into their email client and hitting send to all once every few seconds never reading the replies that came back then something occurred to me if shes not sat in front of the computer in her office and shes not able to use the wifi then where the hell is she sending these emails from i was composing a message to that effect when i got this final one gtby the way im at home tldr user cant get their home wifi to work spam everyone theyve ever met with their stream of consciousness whilst trying to fix it
i have a really nice speaking voice for the phone and it works to my advantage but at times it can form an unrealistic expectation of my looks to men i talk to on the phone i talk to a lot of guys who work in the field and they are less like the corporate guys who apologize for swearing and more like boys playing around they really have no filter they usually try to unabashedly flirt with me i dont care so much about that its the time it takes for them to stop and tell me their problem that drives me insane i have never professed patience as a virtue one guy in particular was especially flirtatious and obviously decided that he had game and would try and woo me even though we were over miles a part after our first conversation i called him the daaammn your voice is sexy guy dyvis for short also one note before i start the story this guy had a pending request on my facebook that i had neither accepted or ignored there i am minding my own business when i get a phonecall i rattle off my usual spiel dyvis hey baby nice to hear your lovely voice me oh hello whats going on nervously laugh dyvis why havent you accepted my fb request me oh i really only have people i know in person and really well on there dyvis ah cmon im not a creep me what problem are you having i try to extricate from the uncomfortable conversation dyvis oh i see how it is he guffaws my aircard isnt working after some troubleshooting and remoting into his pc i am checking the drivers and need him to take out the aircard and put it back in me can you take it out and put it back in dyvis woah bookinvertebrate its a little early for us to be doing that laughs obnoxiously shredding every last remnant of patience i had ever deigned to posess finally fed up my voice entered a flat tone and i said no i am not talking about your penis i am talking about your aircard he coughs the line goes silently awkward my coworker practically broke his neck as he swung it around looking at me with surprise the guy finally does as i ask and he stays blissfully silent the whole time im sure he thought i was going to report him but i just wanted him to stfu 
greetings fellow support experts ive come to regale you with a tale of great justice this is a follow on to an earlier tale about a ridiculously stupid userowner that just doesnt have a clue what shes doing which you can read at after undergoing quite a great deal of hassle and headache associated with their migration to quickbooks the owners of senior corp finally came to the realization that they were ridiculously undermanned and overworked plus lacked real quickbooks experience to deal with their contractors so they decided to add a few heads to the operation at the time they had employees workstations including owner ps server machine they wanted to add more stations and intuitqb support advised that they would need a dedicated server for their quickbooks data something i had been suggesting for the better part of a year now yes i could conceivably have up to stations with pro but a server is clearly the way to go here since owner p never listens to the it guy but listens to qb support she now was onboard with me and owner m that they needed to go with a dedicated serverhooray so i spec out an inexpensive lenovo server box with tb of raid storage and server r with cals plus additional workstations identical to what they purchased earlier they have no issues they order the stuff stuff delivers all is well over a weekend i get the server in and set up move the data etc no problems at all backups are running and the only machine with any shares at all is the k box sweet owner p also requested a second monitor since user l has two hooked up her old nonhdmi monitor to the vga port so there was an extra monitor in there for owner p since she needs to feel special p has her new p monitor set to x resolution btw monday evening owner p starts texting me like crazy while im at the gym gt whered the quickbooks data go gt how come the quickbooks isnt in my documents gt i moved the quickbooks from the p drive to my documents gt i cant log in to quickbooks it says it cant find the file gt you screwed everything up with this server i want it back the way it was gt i cant see my quick books screen through go to my pc at the same time user l emails me gt p fd up the quickbooks somehow can you unfk it when you get a minute also the vendor excel sheet is gone i think she fd that up too i come home and prepare to vnc in to unfk the fk up before dinner turns out that owner p did in fact move the qb data file and vendor excel file to her my documents and her desktopseveral times i proceeded to undo the mess and put the files in the right place so user l and everyone else is working just fine as im wrapping up owner p apparently gotomypcs into her machine and sees ive done work she proceeds to call my phone and thats when the sparks flew gt p oh thank god youve answered things are really screwed up gt me well yes they would be since you moved the data file off the server where it belongs you cant go moving the data file gt p but it needs to be on my pc im in charge so it should be on my pc gt me thats not how it works anymore we have gone to a dedicated server nowany and all shared data needs to be on the server gt p thats not how i want it gt me well thats how it is now your pc doesnt have any shared folders as it should so nobody else in the office can see the data on your computer anything that needs to be shared must be on the p drive anything you dont want shared should go in your documents folder gt p thats so stupid i should be the master computer my computer should share everything gt me no you just spent x dollars on a server which does all that now for you just like quickbooks and i recommended you cant share with all the office pcs using just your computer remember gt p thats bullst but fine i give up did you fix the thing and why cant i see my quickbooks on go to my pc gt me well its unfortunate you dont like it this way but its the way it has to be as far as your gotomypc access it would appear that you have quickbooks running on your second monitor did you switch monitors in gotomypc gt p switch monitors what the hell is that gt me you should be able to control what monitor youre looking at when using gotomypc im not sure what the control would look like i dont use gotomypc gt p fine so how did you fix the mess gt me i put the quickbooks file and vendor excel file back in the appropriate locations on the p drive now everyone can access them and user l is already in the system remotely from home without any issues gt p how come i always have so many problems with quickbooks gt me well once everything is set up properly and the files are in the right place youre the only one that has problems p l m and s never have problemsand every time you report a problem its due to you not opening the right file or something else that is only on your end gt p are you saying i dont know what im doing gt me no im merely stating my observations from current and prior experiences i believe you guys are hiring a new person thats a quickbooks expert correct gt p yes but im very computer savvy im a quickbooks expert you dont know what youre talking about youre the idiot that screws everything up gt ltlt and here is where i lost it and rage mode ensued i could have cared less about the job at this point i just unloaded full lbj treatment style here gtgt gt me p how old are you gt p im gt me okay p im going to be direct here so just shut up and listen what you just said is not the case at all you are the one that doesnt know what youre talking about you are the one that screws everything up you claim to be a computer savvy individual that knows quickbooks yet youve managed to create the largest quickbooks clusterfk that one of their senior engineers has ever seen you dont understand how a network works you dont understand how data is supposed to be shared in an organization and most of allyou dont have a clue how accounting works you are the cause of all the problems in your business because you sabotage the employees there that do know what theyre doing how dare you call me an idiot when i am the one that is constantly fixing your screw ups gt p ltstammeringgt uhhhuhhhuhhh gt me quite frankly p you are without a doubt the most incompetent ignorant user ive dealt with in the last ten years you have no business being in a quickbooks file and really you have no business being on a computer to begin with you just told me you give upwell thats what you need to do give upretirego enjoy your life and your grandkids and whatever else makes you happy just for fks sake stay away from a computer and let your people do the work for you gt p ltsobbinggt uhhhhok gt me now have yourself a lovely evening im going to go eat now gt p bye at this point i figured i was done with the company shed fly into a rage at owner m and demand they bring someone else in i could have cared less however ten minutes later owner m calls me gt m what did you say to p gt me she said i was an idiot and didnt know what i was doing so i laid down the ugly truth to her gt m whatever it was you rocked her world she told me she wasnt going to be in the rest of the week and was crying up a storm gt me good gt m indeed thank you for everything owner m told me that a couple days later owner p let her know she was throwing in the towel and finally retiring to spend more time with family she came in and cleaned out her office that friday owner m is beyond grateful to me as she had been trying to get p to retire for over a year and p wouldnt budge tldr idiot owner screws things up again claims to be a genius and calls it guy an idiot it guy verbally pwns owner into submission and retirement
i read this other and it reminded me of something a coworker shared with me from back in his day a story where styles of management and tech support collide lets call this coworker tim many years ago at a company far far away tim was working for a us defense firm as you may expect defense companies use computers and other stuff to test military hardware one day during a particular test cycle the test fails and fails hard in the beginning its not even clear if its an issue with the computerized test equiment or the unit under test uut god help you if your test equipment fried a perfectly good uut the pope will refer you to st jude before running like hell so theres a tight schedule and all testing is halted because of this failure managers are sweating senior managers are sweating directors and vps are sweating the customer pays a call to say hello in person for defense firms the customer is a polite term for uniformed members of the armed forces it falls to tim to be the man on the spot hey tim fix this up double quick he gets to it after some troubleshooting it turns out the test equipment is buggered but the uut is fine the fix will take roughly minutes except that all these managers senior managers big wigs galore and the customer are huddled together feet way to facilitate we know how some managers are when it comes to facilitating via being physically present in the room every few minutes one of these folks would break away from the group meander over to tim and ask some version of so hows it going or whats your status or how close are you to being finished every few minutes a minute job quickly starts to extend into forever tims direct manager walks in i mean whats taking tim so damn long lets call tims direct manager bob bob takes one look at the group of big wigs and then one look at tim then back to the big wigs bob walks over to tim bob tim how are you doing tim well bob im trying to do this fixup work so we can get back to test i know what needs to be done i should be done by now to tell you the truth but they keep coming over one by one and interrupting me bob spins on the balls of his feet and jabs his finger up in the air everybody out after a few minutes of catherding and political massaging the room is evacuated except for tim and bob tim continues his work and bob actually helps out by passing tools around job is done steps and fixes are logged the word spreads faster than bad news and testing can resume forever after tim knew he liked working for bob edit front page wow thank you everybody edit holy man i never expected such a turn out when i wrote this personal records abound thank you all i hope to share more stories as they come and we know they will clasps hands and shakes thank you edit made it on to best of ttfs july many thanks
ffs people are complete idiots as a web designer this is what i get of the time so you can do this for right anyways today i had a potential call me and ask about web job he had and this is how it went client i am looking to build a website for my small company i already have the logo and content i just need the website done lthere i gather the detailsgt after gathering details me this sounds like a plan so as far as budget goes client yes so we were thinking would be good me so you want me to spend about two weeks on a project and get paid client well it is easy right so what is the problem me the problem is you are paying me hr for estimated time client but web design is easy me then do it yourself click ffs tldr web design is easy therefore you should be paid hr edit after this i have reformatted my website to include in the contact form budget requirements before this i never did as to let them send details and negotiate from now on though i will see how this works outof course the field is not a required field but lets see how it works out edit i paid myself to get myself a drink after finishing the above task as it only took minutes i got ripped off but hey prices fluctuate
so this happened today at my telco as i was taking calls on senior line when we heard about this leak of usernames and passwords earlier today we very quickly all understood neither gmail itself nor mailru had been hacked we quickly needed to remind frontline staff that either way the whole thing had nothing to do with us as they were of course getting calls about it from some users because reasons the topic made some headlines today sometimes in a sensational fashion that suggested gmail itself was compromised or that the data was generally current and accurate what was actually hacked is a series of websites with shady security and plaintext passwords well known names include bioware eharmony friendster fildropper xtube etc whom were compromised sometimes several years ago stolen email addresses of accounts associated with three mail providers were published but the accuracy of the passwords appear rather low usernames are accurate but a user would need to have used the same password on both the major mail provider and the compromised website and then go on to never change it for it to pause a problem but on million yeah theres going to be many valid credentials held by people who dont care or dont know better what does that have to do with a canadian telco we thought nothing until i got this call gt bytewave senior line bytewave you may send me your ticket gtpatrick hey bytewave going to need a second opinion on this he worked senior line on a temporary basis meaning he passed all our exams so i know hes good and the call will go straight to the point gtpatrick lady here says she cant log in her email we can go in fine so i was about to say its on her end but she tested it on two computers and her tablet with multiple browsers with or without router same deal everything else works so i had her disable wifi on her smartphone and using data it went through mail provisioning is obviously fine got any idea he had already gone through all the normal troubleshooting kind of call i like gtbytewave okay so mail auth fails only for her cable modems ip address thats new or rather thats quite old we havent done ip bans to the mail servers since the spam age and theres no notes about it but i cant think of anything else even then it was rarely used of the time wed disconnect problem users but there were special cases when such tools were preferable like a customer with multiple static ips with only one offender or blocking a single network adapter causing problems from an open wifi spot i follow my gut instinct and dig up a very old bookmark to an intranet page where such bans of ips or network adapters were listed automatically its still up after all these years later annddd my customers ip and two of her mac addresses are blocked from the pop and smtp with recent timestamps no notes anywhere normally this must be greenlit by internal security i put patrick on hold is has no answers for me they say theyre the only ones supposed to do it but if it had been them there would be a flag on the account and they didnt touch it okay then the only others i can think of with access are the mail admins gtbytewave bytewave with senior staff i have blacklisted network adapters and a single ip address without is approval they havent used this in a long time i just wanted to see if gt mailsystems yeah im your guy i got an alert earlier that failed pop login attempts with nonexistent usernames were spiking through the roof honestly took me hours to get to it but then i found out theyre all from this ip i didnt wait for is id have just disabled the modem but we lost access to provisioning tools in the security review it takes a second to sink in that theres still major telco whose pop server lacks any automatic lockout even after thousands of attempts with invalid logins sure well lock out a specific account if you type the wrong password a few times different accounts you hit once each if the mail admin gets to it maybe hell care to do something about it manually in four hours or so gt bytewave so youre telling me the pop got hammered by some script with random usernames any matches or breaches gt mailsystems thats the good part theres well less than half a percent of valid addresses which is very low but the attacker got into a few still which isnt the end of the world but translates into a somewhat worrying percentage of auths amongst valid boxes seems like he had some sort of partial data on passwords and it operated damn fast too im getting is on it as soon as im done typing it up and im monitoring this should be fine on my end your enduser will get a call from them gt bytewave wait this is too juicy to just pawn off i have a theory i can test right now are you swamped because if you have five minutes i need some of the addresses both failures and those that got through gt mailsystems no fires to put out why not i assume by now that password leak must be spread pretty widely its the internet after all i bypass the work proxy with my usual clean wifi and the internet delivers as usual takes about a minute to find and snatch it i discard the yandex and mailru leaks right away a ton of our customers use gmail though open that in notepad just a long list of gmail addresses with passwords stolen from rd parties that may or may not work anymore gt mailsystems chat heres some of those that dont exist in our system and just bounced file attached he sends me several of course all in mytelcoca form i change astreusmytelcoca for astreusgmailcom boom its on the list after three on three im sold gt bytewave its the damn credentials leak the script kiddie on the other end is just fishing for people who might also be our customers using identicallynamed addresses on both our domain and gmails and who are still reusing the same password he just got lucky a few times but out of these million theres statistically quite a few more dawned on me that any large isp with similarly shitty mail security could be hammered in the same way for a few handfuls of valid accounts of random people reusing usernames and passwords everywhere though its anyones guess what could be gained from that and youd most likely be locked out swiftly elsewhere anyhow gt mailsystems yeah with those numbers i figured the attacker needed some source of at least partially valid data that makes sense were just setting up a temp ban for multiple wrong usernames should prevent further attempts i checked the accounts he got in too little of value was endangered well coordinate with is then that temp ban idea should have been up long ago by now ive kind of figured the lady we had on the phone wasnt our scripter fishing for random valid logins more than likely the other email address registered in her account that ended with a belonged to the guilty party most likely a years old teen i search for that username and with much irony reusing usernames find every trace of online life you can expect from a careless teenager up to and including a reddit account under that very name annddd he posted a comment in a post about the password leak if youre reading this slow clap at least hes not reusing passwords gt bytewave okay ill coordinate with you but would you have a use for the script that was used i know you cant see billing data but this account belongs to a lady with a teenager who is likely responsible theres decent circumstantial evidence we could probably gt mailsystems nah write it all down for is but were not running such a script voluntarily on my watch were lucky it just caused a slight slowdown you know how old the hardware is right besides people reusing usernames and passwords are beyond any mail admins help right out of my hands then so i just filed everything down to the semiincriminating reddit comment from someone using the same alias as the customers kid i was forced to tell patrick that even though we had found the cause of the problem shed need to wait for our security team to call her before we could explain the details all of bytewaves tales on 
i used to work as a student worker for a college where i provided support for anything and everything that needed support printers ad av setups lab deployments scripts cable runs ad and pretty much anything you could think of or bigboss told me to do this tale is about one of the most awkward situations that ive ever had happen doing a task that is really simple anyways one morning i get an email gtnursehey i was wondering if i could have specificlabprinter added to my office computer now a word about this or campus had a large number of printers it had been set up so administrators would have to physically add the printer to computers as some of them we didnt want anyone and everyone to be able to print to such as dprinters plotters and some color printers anyways their office was literally across the hall from our lab so i figured i would go down and do it n person so i go to her office gtnurseohh hey thegiantcat here to set up the printer gtmeyep shouldnt take long just have to log in and add the printer gtnursealright i wasnt doing on anything go ahead i sit down and get started now a word about how we are set up everything is on roaming profiles so if a teacher logs into a classroom system they easily have access to all their files they dont have to worry about using a flash drive or using a network share or have to learn anything they can just log in and they will be there in their documents this is where it gets interesting the second i log in i see the user start to tear up and she asks gtnurseis that your cat pointing at my desktop backround gtmeyep thats my kitty gtnursemy cat kitty just passed away last night he looks like a sweet heart pointing at my cat gtmeim sorry to hear that gtnursehere is a picture of him after adding the printer she showed me pictures of her and her cat it was actually kind of sweet afterwards she thanked me and gave me a hug and a picture of her cat and a packet of hot cocoa mix she even sent an email to bigboss about how sweet i am and asked that if im available i deal with her which isnt a problem as she is actually a nice person who is willing to listen and trouble shoot tldrgo to install printer end up helping a user cope with the loss of her pet
i posted story about about traffic powered wireless and people seemed interested in my story about the judges daughter so here it is i was doing my normal shift helping customers with their broadband television and phoneline woes and i got a call ill never forget this was a few years ago when i was relitivley green ive had my fair share of crazies tin foil hat style overyly paranoid we tend to humour them but this girl was different and changed the way i view the crazies so here it is gt me hi there youre speaking with jaay how can i help she sounds really panicked gt pars hi there my names paranoid and rightly so i really need your help i think someone is hacking our phone line we need to get this fixed alarm bells ring ok lets humour her gt me ok lets have a look what makes you think your line is being hacked gt pars well my father is a judge and hes preciding over a major case a few of the people involved in the case were stalking me a few weeks ago when they managed to hack my apple details so they could follow me around using the gps information in order to scare me i managed to get that sorted but now i think they are listening to our phone calls im so scared you need to help us ok i tottally think this chick is a zoomer who thinks the mothership will be coming to pick her up soon so i open google and search judge parl sure enough top result is a wikipedia page of this girls father i still think shes a loony though gt me ok lets have a look your line seems fine on this end and since there doesnt seem to be a fault with the line the only way i can send someone out to investigate the line would be chargable call out gt pars yes thats fine when can you get someone out so i book her out a technician to my surprise as the crazies normally back out when you tell them their paranoia will cost them i save her account details out of curiosity and check them a couple days later when the tech had visited turned out the technician found a strange device on her line which shouldnt have been there so turned out she was right her dad must have been into some proper shit tldr dont judge a fruit loop by its colour 
a manager of a department in my warehouse messaged me on our im app and told me that she had sent too many jobs to a label printer which is on the network i come in she tells me it just keeps printing i cant stop it i take a look and there were about billion with a b jobs going to the printer i go on the server cancel the jobs and all was well i asked why she didnt put a ticket in or call me on the radio she said she was too embarrassed to do either it turns out she had scanned a bar code into the print quantity field
 after law school i did some contract document review while dull it was lucrative it entails sitting in front of a screen looking at documents and reading other peoples email and figuring out if they were useful for a filed lawsuit any voyeuristic tendencies were beaten out of me by doing this in order to keep us productive internet access was turned off since the document images were hosted remotely i realized that there might be a way around this after a bit of poking around i realized that internet explorer was locked down and only able to view the document hosting sites the leasing company had set these machines up and wasnt available to unlock them to get around this i installed the portable version of firefox on a usb drive so i could browse the internet during breaks eventually this came to the notice of the paralegal managing the jobsite instead of getting in trouble she found this resourceful i soon got pressed into offering tech support for the rest of the team especially when we needed to obtain and distribute documents from sites barred by the restrictive policy i had a few additional usb drives that i offered to my friends one is grace a delightful older woman without much technical savvy grace looks at me browsing the web after inserting the usb drive graceso thats why you can browse the web and we cant meyep gracethats amazing mei guess graceyou can fit the entire internet on that little drive

a couple doors down in the industrial park from dishonest used car dealership was a shop that built canoes and kayaks we hated each other when i got hired on as a service writer the guy i was replacing pulled me aside and shared some wisdom saying gtlook kid theres three things you gotta get if youre gonna work here rom and the amazon are aholes sales wins every argument and we hate those fckers at the kayak place the war had been going on so long that no one could even remember who had fired the first salvo nor what specific disagreement had even sparked the conflict we only knew where the current front in the war was and that front was in the parking lot those animals at the kayak place for some reason absolutely hated how many cars we had in the back lot it shouldnt have been an issue the back lot was galactic in size and was never more than half full our lease specifically granted us use of parking spots and we never used more than about and you know guess what if you move into the same complex as a used car dealership you shouldnt be super surprised if there are some used cars parked around none of these facts mattered to the barbarians at the kayak place each morning i would come in park the jeep and walk into the back door with eyes like daggers glaring out at me from the kayak places shadowy back door some time around noon like clockwork the tribal elder over there would march out to the lot and painstakingly count the cars that belonged to us grumbling the entire time about how many there were twice a month or so wed get a snarly phone call from the landlady telling us that she had received complaints that we had upwards of cars on the lot in spite of there only being a third of that it had all gotten a little ridiculous one friday it boiled over this particular friday was unusually slow for us slow enough that i actually had some downtime the defrost switch in the jeep was on the fritz and it doesnt come out without removing the entire goddamn dash bezel late prefacelift cherokees are just complete mongrel cars the dashboard is all amc but some jackass put a partsbin chrysler steering column in and the two do not play well together now age the plastic years in the sun until its good and brittle getting the extremely fragile and yet completely enormous dash bezel out is a careful ballet of nervous sweating and cursing lest you snap the bezel in two around the narrow steering column cutout ive been at it for a good ten minutes trying desperately to sneak the tiny column cutout on the bezel past a steering column the size of the moon when someone starts shouting gthey hey whos the fckin boss here i peered over the dashboard and saw the alpha male of the kayak herd standing in the bay door i rolled my eyes and acknowledged his existence gtme hey im in here what can i do for you gtchief kayak yeah yeah you the boss gtme sort of look im kind of in the middle of something delicate can this wait gtck yeah well look you fck i wanna talk to the boss about all these fckin cahs out here gtme in that case were an anarchosyndicalist commune gtck im sicka all these fckin cahs in the fckin lot theres too many fckin cahs gtme my count says theres that belong to us today i can recount em if you want but were well below the were allowed on the lease gtck thats horsehit theres gotta be a hundred out there gtme yep and not all of them belong to us it might surprise you to learn this but we dont own every single car in the world now if you dont mind im trying to do something very delicate here and i need to concentrate i turned and started back trying to coax the dash bezel out past the column maybe hed take the hint he didnt my ignoring him only further fueled his rage and he began shouting directly in my ear gtck im sicka this hit you know what ive been talkin to my lawyer yeah weve been talkin all day about what to do about yous fcks you get all these fckin cahs moved now or youre gonna hear from him and while youre at it you can go fck yahself gtcrack fck fck fck fck it was all i could do to keep from taking the broken pieces of dashboard bezel and smashing them over his head gtme im afraid youve said the magic lword and at this point im forced to terminate this conversation any further contact with any employees of this company will need to be directed through our counsel i will also have to ask you to leave the premises have a good day gtck no i aint done with you you get in these fckin cahs and you move em now now by this point colossal redneck and the raver had come out to the bay to see what all the commotion was about colossal redneck walked up to chief kayak and got up in his face gtcr the man told you to leave this heres private property and yall is tresspassin the dictator of kayakistan started to say something but colossal redneck just stepped back a pace flipped out his phone and dialed gtcr howdy thiss colossal redneck at dishonest used car dealership we got ourselves a trespasser yall police wanna come take care of im or should i just do it myself colossal redneck would have easily weighed in at lbs after a month of starvation and he had a good foot on the savage from the kayak place ive been in enough fights to know that you dont take on the big guy and the primitive standing in my bay apparently had gotten the memo as well he retreated and colossal redneck called off the cops gtholy balls the owners colossal redneck miami vice and i rolled into the lot at about the same time the next monday and found a disaster about of our cars had been keyed and not just keyed but keyed two windshields were smashed tires were slashed it was a mess of course we immediately knew who had done it colossal redneck filed a police report the amazon got in touch with our insurance agent who surely was going to drop us this time and rom and i dug into the security camera footage to see what it caught a blurry pickup pulled into the lot late sunday night and two blurry humanoids in blurry hoodies piled out the humanoids had blurry items in their hands and did blurry things to blurry cars gtrom why cant we see anything gtme how much did you pay for this camera gtrom it was on sale at radio shack gtme thats why we had nothing we could pin him with gtpfoot bang pfoot bang pfoot bang oh goodie weird noises coming from the service bay i walked out and discovered felonious monk molesting a pile of splice connectors gtme what what would you say you are doing gtfm check this out you take a splice connector and you fill it full of hot glue and then once it dries you stuff it in the tip of a blow gun and then watch this hit felonious monk grabbed one of his hastilyconstructed missiles and stuffed it in the end of a blow gun he connected the blow gun to the air compressor and pointed it outside gtpfoot bang the blow gun launched its projectile at somewhere approaching the speed of sound sending it all the way to deepest darkest kayakia slamming into their bay door and leaving a golfballsized dent the back door of the kayak place opened and a face peeked out of the shadows gtck hey hey yous fcks i know its you making that racket quit fcking with my bay door i smiled and waved felonious monk did a little jig gtck fck all you fckin aholes the door slammed felonious monk stuffed another missile into the launcher gtpfoot bang felonious monk shot me a grin gtfm i figure i just do that every onceinawhile and maybe hell go crazy gtme hes already crazy gtfm well i dunno maybe hell kill himself gtme well i obviously cant condone this kind of behavior but it does look like youre getting a little low on splice connectors ill order another couple of boxes for the afternoon delivery things were quiet for the next couple of weeks a couple times a day felonious monk or one of the other technicians would launch a few splice connectors over toward our mortal enemies just enough to keep them on their toes over there their bay door was beginning to look like it had a bad case of acne then one rainy tuesday i got a call from the landlady gtme service this is gtll cars thats how many you can have cars gtme were aware ive got out there right now give or take one or two you can drop by and count them if you want gtll i dont care how many youve got im sick of getting these calls that you have too many cars you get this was fairly typical for the landlady any conversation eventually devolved into her just repeating the same few words rainmanstyle until you hung up luckily just then the diplomat walked by my office on her way to lunch you may remember her as the young lady we hired to handle red tape for us she was unbelievably persuasive i waved her over gtme hey landlady just real quick theres somebody here who can handle this issue better than me i put her on hold and filled in the diplomat she took the phone and worked her magic gttd hi hey look we know youre sick of making these calls and we dont want you to be burdened with this kind of stuff youve got a lot on your plate to handle and a dumb parking dispute has got to be unbelievably trivial for you to have to bother with look we know it was chief kayak filing the complaints because hes been over here threatening us with lawyers over the same issue if youd like and the complainant is willing we would like to sit down with you and him and see if we can come to some kind of amicable agreement really great hey when you come can you bring a copy of everybodys leases i just want to go over them with the group to make sure were in compliance and not treading upon what they have promised in their own lease you know great friday at noon awesome thank you she tossed the phone onto the hook gave me a grin and disappeared noon on friday rolled around and i found myself with the diplomat the landlady and chief kayak all crowded in my office the landlady pulled out our lease and slid it across the table to the diplomat gttd if no one minds id also like to see the lease for the kayak place you dont mind do you gtck why gttd im guessing whats going on here is that youve been given a bunch of spaces in the lot and weve been given a bunch of spaces in the lot and together its more spaces than there are parking spaces in the lot you know and then you come in and the lot is full with our cars i had no idea what she was up to the lot was never even close to full half full at most she smiled at chief kayak gttd so you dont mind if i just have a quick look do you gtck no i guess not the landlady shrugged and looked through her briefcase pulling out the kayak places lease while the diplomat slowly read through the two leases chief kayak amused himself by working himself up into a froth horrendous hateful deeply untrue accusations were levied against us gtck yous fcks always have all these fckin cahs in the lot theres hundreds of em and worse yet now yous fcks are shootin some kinda thing at my bay door its all covered in dents from you fckin assholes i bit the inside of my cheeks to keep from grinning gtck im sicka all the fckin cahs they gotta go all the fckin cahs theys makin my shop look like its in a junkyahd its like were on the set of the jeffersons or somethin gtme sanford and son gtck the jeffersons sanford and son whateveah the landlady chimed in with her usual admonishment gtll cars you can only have cars no more than cars before the landlady could repeat herself once again or chief kayak could work himself up into another crazed rant the diplomat chimed in gttd im sorry to interrupt but i think ive found something as everyone will note our lease does show we can occupy up to what id like to do is go outside with everyone and count how many weve got just to show everyone were in compliance we walked outside and i counted our cars for everyone today gttd so theres still a bunch of other cars on the lot who do those belong to gtme im not sure i see a couple parked in front of the gravestone place i suppose those belong to them and then the florist over there has five or six and then the rest i assume belong to the kayak place gttd is that right chief kayak how many cars do you have on the lot today gtck i dunno theres the workahs and me and the delivery vans so thats like cahs so what gttd well thats interesting because your lease only gives you fifteen parking spaces the look of oh hit on his face was delicious to watch gtck what lemme see that chief kayak snatched the lease from the diplomat and she indicated where in the fine print she was reading the landlady immediately chimed in gtll fifteen thats how many cars you get fifteen cars you get fifteen fifteen cars gtme you know ms landlady it sounds like there are a bunch of cars on this lot that are illegally parked id be more than happy to grab our tow rig and remove them for you the landlady threw up her hands in disgust at the lot of us and divorced herself from the group walking off to her car chief kayak turned tail and retreated back to the uncivilized hole from whence he had come pausing only briefly to turn and shout gtthis aint the last youve heard of this you fckin aholes epilogue it was in fact the last us fckin aholes heard about it though the following monday five of his employees were conspicuously parked on the street that evening i stood in the bay with the technicians carefully filling splice connectors with hot glue gtpfoot bang pfoot bang pfoot bang we hate those fckers at the kayak place
again lets visit the magical land of what the absolute fuck working at a small company budget is a major concern so if it can be done cheap great free is better i come in one morning to find the boss has performed one of their auditsof my computer having already configured spiceworkd i never understood why they needed to go to computers then again they didnt seem to have a clue what they were doing these audits consisted of looking around for files and applications they dont know and deleting them i wrote code examples like github gists to demonstrate how things could be implemented they were deleted to prevent them accidentally being included in release builds two branches of source code better delete one which one better delete them both so they know not to have multiple copies that reminds me i better ask where we are up to with the new features they were writing i would come back to databases being deleted migration projects gone database engines gone i open outlook to see they have once more removed the reading pane oh look they have moved all my email and forwarded them all to themselves oh joy i envision a day of you received an email years ago fromx at y about z can i mark this as resolved there is an email from them at it has been noted that hardcore pornography was on your computer unsure what constitutes hardcore these days i email back was this email meant for me i am not sure what you mean after only a few seconds i receive an email back with on your computer you had a file called gimp that contained pornography do you mean gimp the gnu image manipulation package i used last week to edit graphics for a client as we do not have photoshop we have photoshop i will bring it in its the latest version you can get and it cost us a fortune they brought in cs i was expecting cs it appeared to have been bought at a rummage sale and i was told not to activate it gimp was never mentioned again tldr the gimps sleeping
in the hospital i work at we have portable workstations that use these big ah batteries to power them and ive tasked myself with going through and inventorying the locations of each of the chargers because weve got a couple listed as unallocated that have bad batteries reporting back to the manufacturer so i get in and get through floors and on the next floor as im looking for the chargers i was told that there was a mobile workstation called a wow for workstation on wheels that wasnt responding to badges keyboard or mouse input usually this means it has a crappy startech plastic hub and just needs to have the power and b connector disconnected and reconnected i tried that first and it didnt work crap now i have to take it apart to replace the old style hub with our newer ones as im taking it apart im noticing that the screws are loose as hell the wires arent managed properly and i started complaining quietly to myself trying to figure out what moron did this wow previously so minutes later i get everything buttoned back up i tighten the screws properly and velcro strip the wires so its more asthetically pleasing and better tucked away i return the wow back to the floor and go back to my charger inventory duties and minutes later it hits me i worked on that wow about a month after i started here and i remember bitching about the other techs tightening the hell out of the screws so the screwup was me it goes to show you that everyone can have an off day including you 
im new here so this might not be correct format but here it goes years ago i worked tech support for a company and about of my work were taking calls from customers who locked themselves out of our website its a very simple and basic website for customers to manage their accounts one of the most memorable calls i received was from a customer locking themselves out and needing a password reset it went like this idiocracy thank you for calling i can i assist you today customer your website sucks and i cant login idiocracy i apologize about that can i have your name and account number customer jesus insert expletive here christ why cant you pull it up with my phone number that shows up on your screen idiocracy if you dont have your account number handy i can pull it up with the phone number but i still need your name customer i dont have time for this fine its customers name now can you insert expletive here help me idiocracy thank you for that information but lets try to keep this call professional and refrain from using profanity so what seems to be the problem when you attempt to login my company advised us reps that if a customer started using profanity andor became abusive we could give a warning and disconnect if it continued customer look im a millionaire and i can speak however the hell i want we spend a lot of money with you guys they didnt and i will cancel this account if you dont help me get on your god damn website my username wont work so fix it idiocracy i apologize you are having trouble on our website what is the username you are using customer customer idiocracy thank you i see that it has been locked out i have unlocked it and reset your password is your email still customer emailcom customer yes now why did you have to reset it its always the same with you people i used the right insert expletive here password so it shouldnt have been locked out idiocracy maam im going to have to ask you again to refrain frrom using profanity if it happens again i will disconnect the call the reason your password was reset is because anytime a username is locked our system will automatically generate a new password and email to the email address on file have you gotten the email customer are you trying to say i am stupid and dont know how the internet works i am a millionaire and obviously very successful and know a lot about computers idiocracy i am not saying you are stupid i am just explaining how the process works did you get the email yet customer yes idiocracy thank you can you please trying logging in again with the temporary password ill stay on the line with you you can copy and paste it if youd like customer okay i just put the password in and it isnt taking it this is ridiculous i dont know what you mean by copy and paste idiocracy hmm okay are you getting a specific error message customer it just says it isnt correct at this point in the call i usually start asking some basic troubleshooting questions i asked her what os and browser she was using both of which we support then this happened idiocracy can you make sure your caps lock isnt on customer wow you guys really think im an idiot dont you of course its not on ive been dealing with computers since the s so i know how they work idiocracy i am not saying that maam im just trying to help you login can you do one last thing for me can you type in your username and tell me if its all uppercase or lower case customer its all big letters sic idiocracy okay that means your caps lock is on if you customer insert expletive here you and your company click i know it might not be as exciting as some of the tales on here but i guess some people truly believe their wealth makes them experts i was curious after that call and did a simple google search on her company well it isnt even hers its her husbands and she was labeled as the secretary edit some are questioning how i can remember it so well well it was a recorded call and i saved all of my really crazy calls on my computer up until i quit a few months ago i listened to a few of them on my last day and this happened to be one of them they wouldnt let me take the call with me though i was a manager when i left and had been out of the tech call center for a bit it may not be verbatimbut im sure of the posts here arent either

i work at a tech firm that services residences and businesses in the surrounding area im sure everyone here understands the basics of what that entails this particular service call for one of our contracted clients a cpa firm took place this past week client tax season is coming up pretty quick so we need to clear off some of our computers to make way for new temporary hires me ok that shouldnt be a problem what do you mean by clear off client like make it so the new employees dont have to use the old employees login and files that kind of thing me alright well when the new employees start well just need to create new user accounts for them on the server once thats done all theyll need to do is sign in and begin working client i dont want them to have to use the old employees information i want these computers cleared off so none of the old stuff is there what do you call that wipe and reload a feeling of dread begins to form in the pit of my stomach and a disturbance in the force tells me im about to lose my cheery demeanor me you want to have windows reinstalled on all these computers client yes so the new hires wont be using the old employees information me they already wont be theyll be using their own logins that well create when they are hired and all files are stored on the server the old employee logins have already been deactivated so nobody could even use them if they wanted to client well when you go to sign in it still has their name there me ah i see what youre saying its quite simple to change that all you need to d client it may be simple to you but its not to me i dont want to spend a lot of time trying to figure it out just clear the computers off for the new employees steam begins to billow from my ears due to being cut off midsentence me i understand what youre asking for im trying to tell you your computers are set up so that doesnt need to be done all you have to do client sigh how long is this going to take i have a lot to do and i need to get back to work red is beginning to cloud my vision and the steam spouting from my ears is whistling like a tea kettle me forcefully all you have to do is click the switch user button and type in the new username client i dont know where that button is well just call you guys when we start hiring some new people and you can help us then walks off i stood there for a moment simultaneously dumbfounded and enraged at the clients rudenessignorancerefusal to learn what has to be the most simple task you can possibly do on a computer short of turning it on tldr client wants complete windows reinstalls on multiple domain workstations to get rid of former employee usernames at login refuses to learn about the apparentlyunderstated switch user button drives me to rekindle my friendship with the captain edit it seems i forgot the most important point of this entire incident and now feel like an idiot thats what i get for typing this up at am i mentioned the client is contracted but i forgot to detail what this means the client pays a monthly rate for msp monitoring services and part of their contract is unlimited labor any work i would have done would have been under this contract meaning we would have made no from going ahead and wipingreloading the computers and it would have ultimately been a colossal waste of time

dont work in tech support but as the only teenager in the house i may as well be backstory my stepmother considers herself to be very proficient with technology because and i quote i set the router up with channels and every device is on a different channel in reality the ghz and ghz networks were on by default and i turned on the guest network for her my dad thinks shes a genius as well recently a lightning storm came through and actually fried the router my dad and i head off the the shop to get a new one and my stepmother has no trust in either of us to get an actually good router because evidently nobody is as good as she is with technology we get there and i subtlety manage to persuade dad to get a netgear nighthawk xs under the guise that the range will be long enough to reach his sheds we live on a somewhat rural property and in fairness t does actually reach the shed but really i just wanted a gaming optimised one where the qos would automatically prioritise me over my stepmothers netflix binging we arrive home and i begin to set it up and she walks over and tells me everything im doing is wrong before id touched anything great i began thinking knowing shes inevitably fuck something up and id have to sneak out and fix it later overnight while she claims the credit naturally she cant make it work note the setup really wasnt a hard process all we really needed was my dads isp details and it does everything else automatically i dont understand how she couldnt do it but it was my fault because id touched it important tidbit my phone service is provided through the same isp but on my mothers account eventually i get sent away from the router because im obviously screwing everything up the claim the router couldnt connect to the isp because it was trying to latch on to my phone g network and authenticate with the servers wirelessly deciding the argument wasnt worth it i left and upon returning to my room introduced my face to my desk four hours later my dad and stepmother went for a walk and i fixed it in three minutes tldr stepmother knows technobabble thinks shes an it queen definitely is not 
at a call center for dsl internet tech support for a major us phone company a very angry lady calls in because my internet is down and my kid cant do her homework she missed a due date and its all because of you so i go through a bunch of troubleshooting and ultimately wind up writing a trouble ticket for a tech visit her dsl modem is out in her back yard in a tool shed apparently and we ran all the wires for it when we built the house ok maam got a field tech visit set up for you earliest time window is in four days advise her of possible charges if the problem is in her home wiring she screams about that for a while but my daughter cant do her homework at all shes been waiting for two days to do her homework and its late i guess she forgot that earlier in the call she was also screaming at me because her daughter is homeschooled and thus has an extreme need for their internet connection what i probably should have said maam since your daughter is homeschooled you are her teacher and you set the due dates so perhaps you should just move her due date to allow for the internet being down what i did say nothing i just let this jesushugging church lady scream into my ear for nearly a half hour
its been a few years since i was desktop support but users still come to me for assistance rather than go through our wonderful helpdesk im sure many of you can relate user sticks her head in my office first thing this morning and said she was having problems with her laptop and asked if i would be willing to take a look she starts telling me how yesterday afternoon she started getting these popups for a program that she hasnt used in years she used it daily when she was in a different department but insists that she no longer uses it i was only half paying attention as it was still really early and i was on my first cup of coffee we get to her office and try booting up her machine pgp screen comes up and she enters in her password immediately we get a bsod with the message unmountable boot volume i ask her which program she uninstalled pgp she says she had no idea that pgp was used to encrypt her laptop even though she has to enter in her network password to get past the pgp encryption screen every time she boots up her machine howwhy pgp allowed her to uninstall it without first decrypting the drive is beyond me but yeah she used pgp years ago in her previous position and rather than go through protocol by contacting helpdesk and opening a ticket to resolve the popup issue pgp couldnt find her keyring files she decided to just uninstall pgp the person she shares an office with also used to be in it so she took over the efforts to try and get her back up and runningpulled the drive connected it to another machine with pgp and started decryption process i would say i hope shes learned her lesson but i kinda doubt it lol update apparently it caught wind that she was trying to get it fixed without having to send it off and they let her know that this was grounds for dismissal so now shell be shipping it off and probably wont get it back until sometime next week beautiful

a few years ago i did some contract work for two different companies that were owned and run by the same group of people for the most part they were separate legal entities but they shared some network resources and at one point some office space each company had their own it staff though including developers help desk and admins my buddy was the lead developer so he was in charge of a few interns one of the interns proved to be completely useless within a couple weeks of onboarding showed up late left early took long lunches did less work than anyone else etc they let him go on a friday as was customary monday rolls around and useless intern is strolling down the hallway like nothing happened my buddy chases him down and tells him dude i fired you you cant be in the building who let you in oh othercompany hired me back on because they needed help with this project the it manager storms off to talk to management it turns out that the assistant to the coo saw the termination email go through hr and without asking anyone immediately rehired him under the other company they didnt know why he was fired and never asked was he stealing from the company did he assault someone did the background check show he was a convicted felon oh he seemed like a nice kid and we really needed help on this facepalm so they kept useless intern around for a few more weeks so he could prove he was useless again luckily he wasnt fired for anything horrible but in any other company it would have been considered a massive security breach
i was recently asked why my coworker girlfriend and i have the same acer laptop so ill tell the tale perhaps a year ago working at my telco gt boss hey bytewave theres going to be a job opening in our department soon do you have time to handle grading the exams pretty timeconsuming task always a ton of applicants and the exams for technical supports senior staff are hard so its a long string of failures usually before you get the guy but hey paid by the hour plus i have nobody to blame given i designed some of the exams gt bytewave sure theres an opening they really finally opened new positions gt boss alas not thierrys leaving for sales senior staff ill need to fill the slot usual exams to be corrected in rank of seniority i was slightly taken aback few tech people much less senior staff are interested in anything that has to do with sales we fight tooth and nail to ensure that our frontline staff doesnt have to sell stuff when troubleshooting theres admittedly a much more favorable gender ratio over there but thierry was already married he saw me wince gt boss there was an argument we dont have much to reward you guys with beyond pay and the work contract basics here over at sales they get offbook bonuses all the time thierry got mad that the top girl over at sss got a free car as a performance bonus last month while all i have are free pens really wish i had the rewards budget to match that its true sss is seen as an awesome source of revenue by the telco while tsss gets scraps at best weve often been told youre an expense not a revenue gt bytewave ill grade but the rewards budget will always be minuscule for tech support just use another budget if you want to hand out candy he was about to say something thought the better of it nodded and went back to his desk hes always had our interests at heart but is always careful not to say anything that could be incriminating he has no union to back him as a manager soon after at the next tsss monthly meeting gt boss so i know our security suite has always been underwhelming but im told theyre really trying hard to make the next revision outstanding i know weve heard that before but still this time around i thought tsss ought to take a more direct hand in testing the beta we have the usual external qa team on it too since that falls well outside our typical job description and union job descriptions are fairly narrow people in the room werent immediately enthused a few puzzled eyebrows were exchanged also we all hate that software previously featured gt boss purely voluntary basis of course ive had these laptops readied for testing purposes but youll have to install the security suite on it yourselves if youre interested you can take them home and back here as you like if you take one and find any bugs you can file them the usual way the department secretary brings in a pile of these acer then another i notice theres literally one for every of us gt frank wait you know we cant do any work outside work hours without violating the work contract and we already have plenty of computers here to run tests on the clock for indeed we had already been testing the beta in our lab and on several workstations gt boss oh i know the rules ive been union too never do any work outside work hours without authorized paid overtime this is not an authorization to bill overtime that requires hrlogistics consent anyhow these are for testing as per the quasiunlimited budget for the security suite theyve been added to the permanent testing devices account and then it dawned on frank and any other who had not already read inbetween the lines i have two pvrs with full testing profiles in my condo i never paid a penny for because theyre testing devices they never ever ask for these devices back once the tests are complete its more trouble to track them back than to just forget about them gt frank oh well did it have to be acer laptops if youre gt boss ahem its what we could have in bulk at a reasonable cost for testing again purely voluntary basis take one if youd like the acer bloatware has been removed no worries if you dont feel like it theyll be put to good use elsewhere everybody took one boss never really expected us to even install the security suite at all the whole point was to tap an unlimited budget to give us something offbooks to show appreciation because unlike other departments tech support almost never gets any money to do that outside the christmas budget hes really great making things a little better for our department in a company thats usually truly stingy when it comes to giving us anything that goes beyond the work contracts requirements all of bytewaves tales on

frustration crossed my cousins face as the progress bar slowly crept across his game console gtcuzdad its so close to the rooter though i dont know why its so slow gtme its router plus i think its an issue with the game service not your internet cuzdad went back to the game console and continued to try to update the system the fact is was working albeit slowly on chrismas day seemed like a miracle to me gtcuzdad darn it our internet has been acting up a lot lately help me move this thing closer to the rooter gtme router i sighed as i helped untangle the cords behind the television set arguing was futile since he was family gtcuzdad everythings all tangled down behind the tv isnt it gtme mmm hmm i pulled at the cords connected to the game console everywhere i looked things were wired incorrectly tvs with external sound systems that werent plugged in speakers plugged into inputs not outputs it was a mess gtcuzdad you know ive always wondered how that happens you put the cords in nicely but when you come back its all tangled and messed up how you going with the untangling gtme i cant get one cord right at the bottom i tried reaching for the cord right at the back it was too far i decided to move the entertainment cupboard forward so i could get properly behind it i started to slide the heavy unit forward gtcuzdad woah what are you doing gtme i cant get my hand in far enough to get the power cable so if we just slid everything forward gtcuzdad woah no thats where dust lives i dont want that stuff all over the house i sighed again at my cousin who was looking at me expectantly i just waited for his suggestion knowing i couldnt get back to the family gathering outside before all his ideas were attempted gtcuzdad i got it my cousin went over to my spot and gave a swift pull at the cord he managed to pull it out but partially split the outer insulation where the wire goes into the plug gtcuzdad f he quickly gathered up the console and moved it across the room plugging it in right next to the router next he couldnt find the av cords to stretch across the entire room eventually producing an entire basket of tangled cords in which he insisted a long cable was buried in gtcuzdad im not good with knots you know as we started unbundling the mass of cords in the basket i could hear the rest of my extended family having fun at the dining table i internally berated myself for answering yes when my cousin asked if id ever owned a game console gtcuzdad so how is it that everything always gets tangled its like a lifes little joke you know my cousin seemed to answer that question himself moments later when wed finally gotten out the cord we wanted he stuffed every cord back into the basket wed just separated out gtme its a mystery gtcuzdad lets see if this works naturally the service was still horribly slow this time however my cousin was off on another rant gtcuzdad three bars see that three bars of reception and its practically sitting on top of the rooter gtme router and if youre so worried about reception why not just plug it in cuzdad went on a tirade about how that wasnt even an option and how my nephew should be able to play with his christmas presents on christmas eventually he calmed down and decided plugging it in could work albeit temporarily the download did not speed up after eventually giving up we made it too the dining table my dear cousin let it be known to all the younger generation that even i could not get the beloved new game to work he also let slip that i partially broke the power cord which managed to badly upset my nephew i shook my head in disgust at the whole event so a new rule for techies everywhere on christmas you know nothing about technology youve hit your head and forgotten everything for the day 
just another day at my telco when we all get an email from systems about a new policy road techs will now install new software from systemsqa on all the computers of new internet users to ensure quality of service and immediately inform end users if they have any issues with their drivers or anything that may impact service thus reducing call flow gt amelia guys check your mail or your spam folder for those filtering systems were into spyware now and she was spot on as usual its exactly what it was that thing called home with a ton of data that while useful was nsagrade scary and somehow senior staff only learned about it when it was authorized to be deployed in the field what could possibly go wrong gt bytewave nevermind the fact we should have known about this months ago does anyone have a copy of this thing boss gt boss just learning about it too ill get you one right away get out of the lines i need you to test this thing and make sure the only problems with it are legals soon after i get a copy of the software and after some basic tests gt bytewave boss theres a problem or several if you happen to care about osx gt boss color me surprised good news bad news or just bad news gt bytewave well the good news is that all to of our customers who are running the x version of microsofts net framework will be able to be spied on as intended those who arent or are running x however will get this incomprehensible pagelong error as for the lucky winners using osx well these guys dont get blue screens but any attempts to install our new spywa software on macs appear to cause immediate kernel panic or a sad face if youre running really old versions do you need me to test this this on nix or have we already established this is amateur hour on top of the legal issues whenever i see my boss face discolor this badly its a mixed feeling on one hand something has gone terribly wrong on the other i know its not my problem anymore and its going to get fixed promptly gt bytewave so you need me to speak to systems about this or youll he sighs deeply but keeps his usual professional cool gt boss im on it this will be delayed until issues are solved good work that was the last we heard about it for awhile said spyware was ultimately never deployed in the field we long had other tools to monitor quality of service and driver issues either way this smacked of a wide tie trying to come up with a quick way to get some credit for lowering support calls without ever asking tech support how they ought to do such a thing in short business as usual all of bytewaves tales on

i work as a consultant doing all sorts of sysadmin work and general tech support for various companies who hire my employers services like an itjanitor one might say one of our customers has a rather complex system which is maintained by another external party and in the time where this story takes place this other company was doing a substantial upgrade to this system part of the upgrade was to implement an sftp connection which allowed the customer to utilize the cloud instead of storing everything locally however the other party kept running in to problems its not working they said please open port in the firewalls between server and server we knew that the port was not blocked but we did them the favour of at least looking in to it and verifying that the port was indeed open as requested then we heard nothing for two months until they suddenly sent in a new ticket with the same request please open port this interesting email exchange then occurred between me and their lead tech though abbreviated obviously me we have verified that the connection worked using both ftpprogram and otherftpprogram the port isnt blocked him it is too our program isnt working me you have specified port right i mean so that it doesnt default to using regular ftp on port him yes of course me what kind of program is this really him its a script you can see it if you go to programandlocation me ok well i just looked at the script and i can see you are using ftpcommand but you are not declaring the port when calling the command so its clearly using port which is the default here is what you need to change it to correctpieceofcode please correct it and get back to us if its still not working nothing was heard for a while after that i had really gone beyond my responsibilities by troubleshooting their code which i had never even seen before and giving them a solution and i was appalled by their incompetence i thought for sure that they would manage to fix it now but then they came back him we changed the port and its still not working me no you didnt change the port i looked at the script just now and you havent changed anything i have now changed it for you please see if it works after this we mysteriously enough never heard from them again who could have guessed needless to say we reported their incompetence to our customer who had to pay the hourly rates of both me and the other tech probably amounting to hours of consulting for something that wasnt actually an issue in any way
in somes tales im not kind towards the telco i work for even aired some of our dirtiest laundry at times they earned my ire through nonsense ranging from atrocious subcontracting to frivolously clogging courts to brawl with their own orders recently came from on up that every employee be they sorting mail or sitting on the board would have a hour long information security class in language drawn by legal everybody was to be taught via powerpoint and videos that opening email attachments not approved by their boss is worse than being hitler most importantly they focused on the notion that willingly revealing the horrible innerworkings of the corporation to the public would be a crime against humanity when i heard about this i chuckled even though im always careful not to reveal where i work i know theyd pay a bounty for bytewaves identityheadonaspike i simply posted too many tales about whats wrong here placing me squarely on the notoriously incompetent corporate inquisition radar i was about to take my seat and silently savor the irony but the vicedirector previously featured for his keyboard supposed to give this mandatory class to my team tsss got emergency texts fifteen of us working escalation tech support were now sitting in there but his blackberry said he was needed floors up minutes ago and so he walked up to me with a binder a thumbdrive and the projectors remote the irony that i was assigned to teach my colleagues about the benefits of information security despite being unofficially in charge of our shadow had a few of my colleagues giggling five seconds after hed left the room thats often all you can expect when it comes to teaching classes here its a good day when i dont need to make up material on the spot but teaching tech senior staff isnt exactly like teaching new hires nobody sitting in those chairs needed to hear any of this i still looked at the binder for a minute as expected it was all trite inane and worthless nonsense someone with a very wide tie decided would cover their ass appropriately if a few thousand employees were forced to hear it gt bytewave alright folks this is a mandatory hour class on information security dont use weak passwords even though it really doesnt matter dont tell frontline employees things they shouldnt know dont give instructions on recorded phone lines that directly challenge corporate policies and dont be a fucking idiot in general anyone wants to know more than that the class pdf and powerpoint will be on our drive floor open to questions gt frank heh thanks for sparing us i guess we just hang in here for the next hours and minutes gt stephan would beat taking escalation calls from subcontractors gt bytewave well the vd didnt even file this class on formal record lets call it an extended break so we all went downstairs and walked to the bar across the street had a couple pints generally chatting about how insane and inconsistent the corporations stance on information security is and other stuff on one hand theyre willing to spend tons to teach theory to employees but will never spend a penny to make the tools we use remotely secure even though union staff repeatedly pointed out that some practices have been out of league with industry standards for well over a decade theyd rather teach everyone to keep quiet than fix the underlying issues back at my old workplace this would have largely qualified as a working lunch even though all we ate was bar snacks threeish hours later we went back up the tower i was expecting having to say i took the team outdoors and fib a reason why gt lowlevel manager you guys done already class ended up taking closer to four or five hours for most of the staff gt bytewave what can i say tech supports senior staff learns stuff quicker than most all of bytewaves tales on

hello everyone lurker here this story happened a few years back when i was still in school and everyone had to do an internship for two weeks being of highest technical expertise in comparison to the guy sitting next to you in your informatics class i naturally applied for a job in the it field the next town over had a nice computer museum and so i applied knowing the manager helped but being the only applicant did its part too so the very first day i start there under the supervision of the sysadmin i am being introduced to the systems while he explains my main task will be to take care of the exhibits as some tend to be a little fragile and require frequent maintenance or reboots secretary comes in and just interrupts sysadmin with following words the payment server is down since friday todays monday he was on vacation for a week with an absolute pokerface and a blank stare sysadmin quickly shows me one exhibit thats been acting up lately minutes and an easy fix later i get back into the basement walk through the server cabinets up to the very front cabinet where people and sysadmin are standing they all look at the servers and dont say a word problem is one and only one server has no power its the server which manages the payment of the employees power company isp and more tracking back the power cable resulted in an interesting finding it seems as if it was plugged into the psu but someone actually plugged it into an extension cable tracing back that extension cable required us to open the rack from behind only to find that the cable was laying on the ground next to a normal wall outlet sysadmin admins face doesnt move a bit he qickly plugs everything back in and checks if the server is doing fine it seems so except suddenly the firmware is upgraded his anger is not to be seen from his body language but only from his empty merciless stare calmly walking through the office asking every single person if they did something with the server he stumbled upon softwareengineer sysadmin hey se did you do something on the payment server while i was away softwareengineer ah yes i upgraded the firmware for you because i hated that little popup no biggie sysa in the calmest and yet most frightening voice i ever heard and you havent noticed that the server is down since friday se sysa let me ask you a question do you know what a plug is and where it belongs se yes i put it into an outlet sysa and may i ask why you plugged it into an unconnected extension cord se well i needed to reboot the server so i unplugged it as i cant do that via cli and then i needed to charge my laptop and that just plugging the server in somewhere else seemed easier instead of my laptop being far away from the server sysa and why is the extension cord not plugged in se well i needed to reboot it a second time but i was called away and i forgot sysa moe would you mind just grabbing a fresh drink for us from the cafeteria slowly i walked away only to hear sysa lose his pokerface manager ran into the room and tried to calm sysa down but there was no holding him back slowly and scared i got softdrinks and on my wazy back sysa comes up to me looking more refreshed than he did after his vacation happy and smiling he grabbed his drink and got to work completely undo ses mess se was only seen outside smoking one cigarette after another that day
this is my first post to tfts and reddit in general the following happened about a year ago when i as a student was called by a friend to debug the internet at his dorm note that this is a private owned room building so i put some stuff into my backpack laptop extra nic some cables and cycled to my friends place gt friend the internet kind of works but it is extremely slow so i tried some stuff a couple of pings and noted the following ping ping bytes of data bytes from icmpseq ttl time ms i try to log in to the management page but get connection refused clearly this router isnt listening on port gt me your router seems to be broken where is it gt friend in the network closet that hangs on the wall in the hall gt me looks to network closet hanging m high on a wall gt me and you dont happen to have the key for it gt friend no but the landlord will be here on friday can you come by then gt me np so that friday i am back landlord gives me the key and ladder and i climb up there the closet contains the cable modem a large port rackmount switch a piii compaq desktop note that that pic isnt mine i dont think i took any pictures at least i cant find any lots of dust bunnies gt me is that your router gt landlord it could be it has been there since i bought this building years ago gt friend could that be the issue gt me puts hand behind the fan to check the temp it is quiet hot well if it isnt now it sure is going to be in the near future i pull out the compaq wire it up to a monitor and it boots some ancient debian version with a kernel i open it up and its full of dust bunnies gt me genuinely surprised im surprised this thing still runs gt landlord well if i have to get the isp technician come over to fix stuff its going to cost me just in labour grabs wallet and pulls out s here do you think you can fix it for gt me well yes that should work so i walk to the nearest it store grab a cheap tplink n router for put the router inbetween the modem and the switch everything works set up wifi note that there was no wifi before just wired test wireless reception on the top floor just for fun works perfecly put the remaining in my wallet a couple of months ago that friend let me know that the landlord had increased the rent because now there was wifi lucky enough my friend had graduated so he doesnt have to renew his contract ps i took the comaq to a friend and now it is happy in his collection of ancient machines mainly servers tldr internet slow gt broken router gt router is an ancient compaq desktop full of dust gt got to replace it with a new router gt rent increased because wifi edit formatting
about years ago or so i was looking to get out of the job i was in just a lateral move as a network administrator but i thought id find someplace with an actual it budget even a small one after hitting the internet really hard i found a somewhat local school district was interviewing for a network assistant problem number was that even though i was on the border of this school district the main building i would work from was on the far edge of the next county i thought well for the right moneyperks i could live with it so i went into the interview i go in and meet the man who would be my boss if i got the job while being completely socially inept and awkward as hell he managed to tell me that the person id be replacing was only part time the new job would be full time but the outgoing guy didnt like the full time pay ok so thats red flag deeper into the interview the guy started asking me really open ended vague questions after about minutes of back and forth with this guy about my technical skills and him repeating gt its really important to take time every day to learn he asks me what im interested in my natural response was to ask if he means professional or personally ive had interviewers ask either or both to get a feel for who i really am so it wasnt odd his response was one i never heard before gt i dont give a shit about what youre interested in personally i dont want to know you i just need to know if youll work here and with that i got up and told him i most certainly wouldnt work there and told him he wasted his time and mine

i worked on a customer site once management decisions were interesting the one which stood out was the one i got told by the technical lead of internal it the big boss came up to him one day and the following conversation ensued i hear that smtp is not a guaranteed delivery protocol thats true there could be failures on the machines in between our email server and the recip we need a reliable protocol our emails are too important to risk them going astray um smtp is the global standard for sending emails everyone uses it we have to use it if we want to send emails at all i heard theres a reliable guaranteeddelivery protocol er well there might be some sort of custom protocol which will keep trying until confirmation is received yeah good find it and install it on our email servers i want to make sure that all our emails get delivered but nobody else uses dont argue just do it the technical lead paused in his tale savouring the sheer distance that now existed between my jaw and the rest of my face so i asked cautiously what did you do oh what we always do i told charles to go into the server room for a day and surf the web when he came out i told the boss wed done what he asked he went away quite happy ill never hear about it again
 it rule three descriptions are scary and hard just fix it gtlong ago the motor car was invented it was a complicated piece of machinery it was so complicated that the average layperson could not immediately understand precisely what every part did then we invented the computer it was even more complicated the layperson had no chance to understanding what was going on this confusion led to the invention of it gtmuch like our mechanical brethren we get users who do not understand even the basics of computer operation and maintenance fortunately for our car fixing cousins faults in motors are usually inherently obvious or can be described in terms like a rattle unfortunately for us working in it this basic descriptive fault observation becomes suddenly lost when thinking about computers this lack of descriptive prowess usually leads to the following situations youre looking down at a computer for the fifth time the note taped to the screen just says still broken please fix as you boot up the device and watch it perform admirably you scratch your head and wonder what exactly is broken a call to the department leads to a chain people claiming not to know the specifics of the fault leaving you with a headache and a seemingly working computer youll box it up and send it back to that department with a note fixed a user calls down to it naturally the call lands at your desk the screeching voice down the line tells you in panicked tones that they cannot login your insistence that they read out the specific error message is met with confusion followed swiftly by anger at your refusal to just let them get on with their work naturally this caller requests an escalation to the manager as you fetch your manager he asks you whats wrong youll shrug and explain your user cannot login hell ask why and youll shrug again the look of exasperation that crosses your managers face will hurt you come bonus time unicorns will be discovered before a fault is successfully diagnosed by a user i can say this with certainty because if a user can diagnose the fault they can fix the fault however occasionally users with the ability to sustain a diagnostic conversation will arise this will lead to the fault being swiftly dealt with unfortunately these users are usually in charge of the least critical systems the unstable business critical system will always be left with a user too impatient to diagnose they just want resultsfixes sometimes a large error or fault will be discovered by a department but due to shame or its swept under the rug these faults usually build up or are badly dealt with by the offending department until one weekend in the early hours of the morning the entire service collapses a later investigation will reveal a tiny easily fixable fault ended up costing the company millions hopefully the above examples are few and far between regardless here are a few ways to tackle the problem implement a ticket system ensure that the description of the problem box has a one word minimum tickets help work out who exactly is sending things down to the department regardless of their problem descriptive abilities unfortunately a ticket system can also lead to people just leaving equipment to rot some departments are too lazy for tickets and the casual employee that would send things down is now too intimidated by the forms they have to fill out on there one day in the office a week refuse to fix anything without a description of exactly what is wrong your manager will love you enforce graded system were the machines with descriptive faults will be fixed more expeditiously then the undescribed masses that could actually work if youre lucky youll avoid the lack of descriptions with good company culture dont get complacent though it only takes a single company executive to have a problem that you need to fix and youve landed in a minefield with no map out good luck examplestory gtgrumblecake hey so i need this fixed grumblecake dumps a charred laptop down on the table it looks like its been in a war zone gtme er yep i reached out and have it a prod with my pen a charred piece of plastic fell off the side gtme its ruined burnt to a crisp unfixable gtgrumblecake oh i knew that i just need another one a small sigh of relief escaped my lips luckily grumble cake wasnt insane i smiled and tried to work out the model from its charred remains gtme yeah okay i think its a we dont have any on hand but well order one in gtgrumblecake cool cool ummm so when will it be here gtme monday i think gtgrumblecake excellent ill come pick it up tuesday after youve installed all the programs grumblecake had turned and started walking towards the door gtme wait what what programs gtgrumblecake just the same ones that were on that grumblecake didnt turn he just pointed to the black mess of plastic still lying on the table gtme what programs which programs it was too late he was already gone i shoveled the burn husk off the table and went to call the number on the contact form it was blank naturally

tuesday pm working nights is strange the office is eerily familiar but the staff are all completely different eveninglady stood at the door to my office a look of disappointment splayed evenly across her face gteveninglady here again airz gtme i was thinking of making it permanent i flashed eveninglady a jovial smile gteveninglady you know i heard whispers that one of the morning staff and you get along well the implication hung in the air my mind went into shock gtme what gteveninglady oh you know the one if you work nights all the time youll never get to spend time with her gtme nice try eveninglady hung her head and started shaking it the phone next to me started to ring as i picked it up a growling voice shouted down the phone gtgrowl the printer is broken gtme ahh to whom am i speaking gtgrowl youre it right gtme i am eveninglady started symboling something to me her arms flailed about in a mad panic something about hanging up gtgrowl why is it then that you dont know about basic technology gtme sorry what gtgrowl caller id you know that thing that tells you who is calling god where do we find these technology professionals gtme my phone doesnt have a screen growl had already aggressively hung up i looked up to see eveninglady continuing to signal at me it was a rather amusing performance and i was tempted to let her continue gtme he hung up what were you trying to signal gteveninglady thats growl gtme sorry who gteveninglady growl hes the most unpleasant person at the company eveninglady went on to explain how growl was a businessmen who was so distasteful so unlikable that no one would work with him hed driven so many secretaries to tears that he didnt have one anymore hed decided to work nights because apparently less stupids were around the office gteveninglady basically hes a b gtme okay thats fine and all but where is his printer i knocked at an impressive door to an office id never visited before id never even been to this part of the building before it looked nice gtgrowl come i opened the door and looked around the office it was an impressively large office with large open windows overlooking probably the best view possible for the office i couldnt see a printer a graying man sat on a swivel chair behind a huge desk he did not look pleased gtgrowl are you here for a social call gtme social no im here for the printer from it gtgrowl ohhhh it you can probably imagine why i was confused since i called so long ago id just assumed youd completely forgotten i glanced at my watch it had been almost exactly minutes since hed called i decided to just ignore the barbs he wasnt worth it gtme the printer growl ambled up from his chair with a grunt gtgrowl its in the other room id let you find it yourself but im afraid youd get lost once you opened the door i just shook my head at the man who seemed to take the smile on my face with offense his face had soured even more then i thought possible we approached a printer it looked reasonably new its screen proudly displayed ready gtme and the problem with the printer is gtgrowl ah gtme gtgrowl well i was wondering to myself how is it that someone who turns up so late and cant grasp basic technologies even has a job turns out you just get everyone else to do your work for you normally i would take offense to the stream of insults but the smiles i gave him seemed to be making him even angrier it was much more satisfying gtme it does seem to be working gtgrowl youve not touched it i wish i could have your job amble up everyday take a quick nap go home i turned on my heel and flashed an even bigger smile making a beeline for the door gtgrowl where are you going gtme naps sleep rest whatever takes my fancy i hope i dont get lost on the way back my voice said the words in a wistful way the subtle implication of teasing masked in the tones of an idiot growls face was that of concentration as if he were trying to work out if he was teasing an idiot or someone was teasing him gtgrowl the printer cannot scan to a usb drive fix it gtme it cannot or you couldnt get it too gtgrowl it does not growl shuffled through it pockets for his usb drive eventually producing it after pulling out a deck of cards and a handkerchief from his pockets gtme i think you plug the usb drive into the printer first i was talking extra slow in the tone of a teacher making sure to annunciate every word gtgrowl you think i knew i should have just let you leave this is useless i dont need a step by step guide just get it done gtme then you press scan to usb ill just find the button print no direct print no dont want that one either fax i was playing up the idiot vibe hard now it was too fun i read out each individual option on the printer as if examining them carefully growl eventually pushed me off the controls after i deliberately skipped the usb print option for the second time gtgrowl geez he hammered the scan to usb button hard glaring at my bumbling nature i stood smiling at him the printer sprung to life as the document feeder grabbed the paper and fed it through the machine i heard a faint sigh of finally gtme oh see you can do it good job i patted him on the shoulder like a coach would a star player the printer eventually finished its screen lit up for the finish i awaited that glorious job complete notice that signaled i could leave this hell error gtme oh gtgrowl an error i cannot believe it you think after calling professionals theyd get it done just incompetence if anything youve just wasted my time i realized then the problem with playing up the idiot vibe what if something really went wrong youve lost all the respect to get it done even if it is fun gtme calm down let me fix this gtgrowl fix i doubt you could fix me a coffee let alone fix something as complicated as a printer insults about my coffee making skills this guy

hi all this happened a few weeks ago but ive only just discovered this wonderful subreddit im sure ill have lots of content to post here as i am the only on site tech for an office of about other smaller offices so a user calls in complaining that he recently changed his expired password and now his account is locked and he cant log in we use standard windows and active directory i check ad and surely enough his account is locked i tell him that after bad attempt it will lock he thanks me for unlocking and hangs up minutes or so later he calls again complaining that his outlook is prompting him for a password all the time i check his account again in ad and its locked again strange i unlock it and say if it locks a rd time i will investigate further surely enough minutes or so later he calls and says it happening again the most common cause of this is personal phones or tablets which have had work email added them failing to autosync properly and causing a bad attempt i ask if hes got a personal devices added to his work email and he says yes just one phone i ask him to remove the account he reluctantly does so despite already having a company issue blackberry with his email on it the account continues to lock every minutes or so i call him to confirm that he doesnt have any other personal devices at home which may be autosyncing with the old password he gets a bit aggressive and says ive told you already no now fix this so i can get back to work as internal support i never get this kind of tone i like to think i know most of the users here on a personal level and can chat happily away while fixing problems i say that ill work on it and go ahead and contact our infrastructure team for help one of the techs tell me there are other devices trying to connect to his account he will work on telling me exactly what in the next hour i call the user and tell him what i know he snaps back at me this is absolutely not my fault i am so tired of it problems every week i will speak with your manager about this trying to avoid the obvious and point out that this is the first problem hes every called in about i tell him that its best if we wait for the logs before we make any final decisions he just huffs and puffs and hangs up on me what a dick at request they give me a log of all the login attempts to his account and even device ids i find the problem as suspected not only was there the one personal android phone he told me about there was also the following devices with his work email attached all of them had attempted to sync with his email in the past days two android tablets an ipad a sony android phone a google nexus phone some model of iphone a macbook pro now either this guy is handing out his login details to friends and family or he has synced with work email with devices who even owns devices i call him and share the results there is a long silence i break it by telling him that we cant allow his work email with sensitive client information to be snyced with all those personal devices there is a reason we have issued him a company blackberry he then tells chews into me saying he needs to be always connected and its essential to his job and blahdeblah tired of his shit i straight up tell him we have issued you with a lightweight yet powerful laptop worth over and a blackberry which gives you access to your emails on the go why do you need other devices which do the same thing ignoring the point i made entirely he instead says he has recorded the conversation what and will be taking it to my manager to in his words show my utter incompetence at getting even the simplest thing fixed i go to my manager first show the emails and logs from infrastructure and tell him to expect a snotty email from the user my manager who had been away for a few days preventing him from stepping in sooner gives me the go ahead to disable his accounts and sends a wipe request to the blackberry server on the grounds that he is unable to keep his client information secure and adhere to our iso standards manager then called him and told him to come into the office for a meeting during this meeting which i sat in on just observing he was basically schooled on how to use a blackberry securely and to absolutely never sync another personal device with it again under threat of account locking i fed on his sweet sweet tears thank you for reading edit formatting edit thank you kind beautiful stranger for the gold i shall cherish it dearly

i used to work weekend customertech support for a tech company that provides software where the user base is supposedly technically inclined the story starts with a phone call as many do ampnbsp me thank you for contacting x sup train whistle pierces my eardrum port is that a train customer yeah sorry about that we are at a train station me well that would explain that gathers enough info to start a ticket the customers company is a train company which means train whistles going off in the background at various points ampnbsp the issue is that our software isnt able to communicate with other computers running of our software the customer mentions several times how he the network admin and the cio couldnt figure out what was going on while i gathered info to create the ticket they had a call with their ceo fulminated in all three of them calling us while still in a conference call ampnbsp admin reads the error message which is something similar to no connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it me ok so it looks like the issue is network connectivity can you ping computer x admin lemme check nope cant ping me well it sounds like you need to find out why the computer itself isnt responding admin starts to go off on why this is an unacceptable answer when cio interjects cio wait so would it help if that computer was on ampnbsp now you would think that years of working help desk would prepare you for questions like thisbut when three people two of whom are it and paid more than you fail to realize that something has to be powered on to work you get stunned this stun meant a few seconds of silence on my end while i tried to figure out exactly how much more they were paid ampnbsp me yes yes it would edit i can google how to format reddit posts 
ltlftp ive wanted to write up this story for a while now and since its the end of the year and things are looking a bit slow now might be the right time for the record im a web developer which means i develop websites and web applications for a wide arrange of customers when i first came to work at a company with my freshly printed bachelor degree one of the customers had let build a website that was rolled out into multiple countries with multiple domains and multiple languages because the static content was the same for every version of the website we used po files for translations which is still standard procedure afaik one of the first tasks i got was to sit and think with a senior developer about the chinese version of this website as it turned out a certain form on the website gave a validation error whenever a user tried to fill in an address the weird thing was that this only occurred on the chinese production environment and not on development testing or acceptance environments this made the entire issue a lot more complicated since we had no easy way to debug the error after a couple of weeks of thinking hunches trying consulting and failing we still werent getting any results to the great frustration of our dearest customer of course now let me remind you that this was back in the day that browser did not have built in language detection or translations after all this time my fine colleague decided to translate the production website he discovered that the fields of address and zipcode seemed to be switched around on the chinese production environment and only that environment using this lead he was able to finally track down the problem as it turned out the chinese moderators of the site wanted the address and zip code fields switched around because we dont understand a single chinese character they had access to the po files we use for translations so instead of asking us to switch around the fields they switched around the labels on the form this resulted in the zip code field being labeled as address and vice versa which resulted in users filling in their address in the zip code field which obviously resulted in the validation error this is the weirdest story i can remember from my career thus far maybe ill come back to write up another story in a while for know now i wish you a happy edit fixed tpyo edit as pointed by ubduddy i probably mean postal code rather than zip code

so this started off as a reply to another story and turned into a full blown if short tale in its own right it is kind of a brag but oh well if you dont like it downvote it a while back i was working a weekend shift when a lady called in with a vpn issue specifically she needed vpn and the two factor authentification app installed registered and tested this takes about twenty minutes start to finish and goes faster when i just remote into the computer and do most of the setup myself which is what i did now the place i work uses a rdp app that causes the wallpaper to disappear as soon as i arrive in the pc usually people kinda freak out when this happens this ladys response was completely different gt her hey my wallpaper has disappeared gt me dont worry your wallpaper will return gt her no i like the solid black is there anyway i can keep it gt me seriously you want to keep it gt her absolutely it is so much easier to read gt me okay then let me show you to do this turns out she has a vision issue that made it hard for her to read the names of icons against the normal default wallpaper something to do with contrast anyway when explained this to me i introduced her to the high contrast themes that windows has available for this purpose then i set her up to use vpn edit more of my stories can be found 
in the same vein as my other pilot story i thought id share a more cringe worthy one our runway was being repaired so all of the aircraft where operating out of a local army helicopter field for about weeks everything was going good that was until the best damn pilot ever needed to log some hours we marshaled him out and he immediately goes the wrong way we call the tower and tower radios for the pilot to stop because there is no room to turn around the pilot proceeds to not listen and goes nose off into the field around the taxiway this is where it gets good there was gravel where they ended up running off the way taxiway instead of listening to the tower who told them to cut the engines while we get the two vehicle to pull them out they proceed to throttle full reverse this was a c i then heard the horrific sound of of the engine ingesting gravel and fodding out completely they then shut the other engine down the pilot and rest of the crew go to leave when our colonel shows up and asks them where they were going the pilot who made the call to reverse told the colonel that since the aircraft was grounded he was going home i have never seen a colonel lose his sht before but it was the most hilarious and frightening thing i ever saw the next day the best damn pilot ever was out with use helping change the engines while the colonel stood there making sure he was doing the work

i originally posted this to tales from retail but it never got approved sohopefully its moderately technical enough for here this is aninteresting tale it happened mostly a few years ago and i decided to keep it to myself because i didnt want to expose anything as the tale will tell though i dont believe i need to hold back any more my current job is somewhat retail related i do mostly pro av system design and sales while we have a small store front with some display cases most of our clients are big corporate education and government the store front is for all intents my office the flip side of this company is production services we do a lot of concerts corporatehotel av festivals and oneoff events in our area wireless microphones are the flavour at most of these events and the prolevel ones we use all take a v battery we will always change batteries during breaks or after an act to make sure things dont drop out we often wind up with trays of halfdead vs for recycling after a show as a courtesy to some customers we will give out some of these vs theyre still mostly good and they will run small things like a radio or a guitar pedal for a few hours so if asked were usually pretty generous with them one day about two years ago a guy pulls up in a rather expensive car not naming brand because it might narrow things down and asks if we have any used v batteries kicking around sure i say and grab the beer flat theyre sitting in out of our repair bay the guy grabs a dozen or so and heads on his way a couple days later he shows up again this time with a multimeter in hand he explains to me in a clearly not satisfied tone that some of the batteries were completely dead and they didnt work so he was going to test them this time a bit irritated about being reprimanded for the free batteries he wasnt happy with i grabbed the box and let him have at it as he picked through them getting a little bit upset about how many were dead i asked what he was using them for oh im the landlord in an apartment complex i replace all the smoke detector batteries with these ones at this point i took my tray back and told him to get out we werent going to be a party to him being a cheapskate for not spending a couple bucks on v batteries no incident he just left what makes me tell this story is what happened today however i see the distinctive car pull into the parking lot which i remember because its rare around here and one of my dream cars c hey you guys used to have used v batteries here can i have some me no sorry we dont give those out anymore c oh i used to work at a theatre and wed come get them from you all the time me yeah some ahole was using the dead ones in his tenants smoke alarms so we had to stop i looked him dead in the eyes he knew i knew who he was he just nodded and left at that point dude dont cheap out on the safety of people under your roof im not going to be a party to it and now youve forced me to tell this online tldr cheapskate landlord goes up in smoke

i was a guest at a big amusement park i cant remember which one at the moment coming off one of their flagship roller coasters the exit led you right through a little pavilion with about eight selfserve kiosks where you could view and order overpriced prints of yourself looking foolish at strategic points on the ride there was one young lady circulating among the kiosks helping guests with any questions one kiosk was powered on but with an out of order sign displaying a message like connection to server lost on the screen waiting for my anklebiters who wanted to ride again leaning against the wall by the offline kiosk i noticed the ethernet plug was not fully seated in the network jack on the wall actually thats an understatement it was just barely inserted at all held in place by rainbows and happy memories and virtually nothing else gtme excuse me miss this kiosk thats offline i noticed it isnt plugged in to the network and that would explain the error on the screen gtparkemployeepe oh i really dont know anything about computers or networks or anything gtme im an engineer at bigtech and while i dont know your system here i can tell you with certainty that this network plug is not inserted correctly and could very well explain this error message it really cant hurt to go ahead and plug it in gtpe i dont think im allowed to touch those i dont want to get in trouble gtme ok just so were clear you did not give me permission to do this and i plugged the cable in the error message went away gtme hey look it fixed itself gtpe i but you cant just uh i mean thank you gtme for what it fixed itself remember 
so i was fresh faced in my first real it guy job the day i started i found out after weeks with the current it guy id be on my own as he was moving to another position we dicked around a bit in the morning waiting for something to do and then bill called bill started with the company about years ago he installed air conditioners and now hes been at the company longer than just about anybody a lifetime of hauling loads up ladders had ruined his knees so hed been parked in the office scheduling jobs for those younger than him still out in the field after my trainer hung up the phone he warned me bill is a pc destroyer he is the definition of murphys law get used to it youll see a lot of him and he was right for the first two months i worked here i saw bill more than any other employee it was infuriating why didnt he just stop fiddling with settings the issues were never big there was just so many of them no one else gave me these issues so i just asked him im a tinkerer bill said i guess after all the years of finding ways to install the air conditioners i get a bit bored with the daytoday in the office i thought this over and it made sense so i started to take a different approach with bill when he had an issue instead of giving him the fix and sending him back to work i started showing him how to fix it himself if i didnt know i showed him how to google a solution over time bills calls dropped from a week from bill to then to ill never forget leaving work one friday and bill grinned ear to ear at me he hadnt called me once that week so now we fast forward to a month ago the company had grown a lot since i started and recently changed ownership my workload was getting a bit big to handle on my own the new owners were all about efficiency of course their first order of business was to remove users internet access they were kind enough to let me put a pc in the break room for employees on lunch and what happens when you let people have access to pc that none of them need to do their job it gets treated like dirt at this point someone told me the fbi wanted money to unlock the internet computer i put my head between my hands and sobbed i had so much to do this could wait until tomorrow come the next morning i check the computer and it boots just fine i asked the girl from bills team who had reported it to me yeah bill fixed it last night hes so good with computers i was gobsmacked the constant problem that was bill had googled a solution and fixed it for me turns out hed been the first point of call for his whole team before they came to me for a few months now then we come to weeks ago as the newly named head of it though for now it was still just me i was sitting in on my first management meeting we were discussing a new it hire i was given approval to seek out someone to be my assistant and that is how bill came to work it it this guy in his early s has a thirst to learn that most people half his age lack hes big enough to admit to a mistake and is willing to take on any challenge this morning during a quiet period he proudly showed me a website he had built in wordpress for his nephew all self taught he never ceases to amaze me goes to show that some users are idiots others are just untrained it staff 
i do desktop support for a k private school and do freelance work on the side due to the nature of my job many of my clients are referrals from users at my day job usually their home computers or mobile devices or kids computers or the like a couple of months ago i got a call from a recently retired staff member who used to be the administrative assistant for the athletic department surprisingly for her age she is actually decently tech savvy but still at a user level she figured out that she had accidentally gotten a virus and wanted me to make a house call so i get there right after work conveniently her development is about feet maximum from the school yeah she worked there a while i jumped on her computer and took a look everything looked fine except for a file in her downloads folder it wasnt an executable though it was a jar file gt me well thats funny it looks like the virus is written in java im sure its harmless ill make sure its no longer running and youll be good to go i did a cursory check and it seemed like it was running from the downloads folder so i deleted the jar and went on my way thinking that was that no such luck a week later i got a call from her at work gt athaa i think theres a big problem with my computer my bank account was hacked and the hackers transferred from my savings account to my checking account and tried to do a transfer out of the account luckily i caught it in time and the bank is monitoring but i need to get this fixed normally i dont do freelance on the clock but given the urgency of the situation i decided to make an exception i had her fire up teamviewer and remoted in gt me okay lets take a look here thats weird java is running the jar had of course copied itself to the appdata folder cursing my careless rookie mistake i went into damagecontrol mode i took a look around the appdata folder and found a text file that looked a bit weird i opened it gt me oooh this is not good theres a bunch of stuff in here that looks like usernames and passwords yep that harmless java virus was actually a keylogger they stole the password to her bank account that way i did a significantly better job of cleaning her computer this time and a week later i managed to verify that i actually had cleaned it properly but i am getting ahead of myself here two days later around am i received an email from her sent over one of our distribution lists gt from athaa gt to all faculty and staff gt subject important gt please refer to the attachment carefully gt thank you gt attachment paymentinvoicejar yep thats right a jar file the people who were using the keylogger to steal passwords had stolen the password to her school email account and sent out the virus to everyone in her address book we suspended her email account but the damage was already done as the athletic department administrative assistant she had previously sent email to all the faculty and staff she had sent email to parents and to athletic employees at other schools she had also sent email to the lost and found list to which everyone at the school with an email account was subscribed this included all faculty and staff plus all students grades of course users being users many of them opened the attachment the rest of the morning was spent in ultra mega allhandsondeck damage control mode most of the students who clicked on it had macs that did not allow the jar to open because it wasnt from an identified developer or chromebooks which do not have java a few people tried to open it on mobile devices which also didnt work but about two dozen facultystaff tried to open it on schoolprovided desktops or laptops and about half of those people got infected we did a lot of reimaging that day i also took her computer home at the end of that day to reinstall windows but ended up figuring out that i had properly cleaned it the second time after seeing this virus on a dozen computers i got pretty good at seeing the symptoms tldr dont judge a book virus by its cover
first time poster with a short one for you years ago i was the de facto tech support for a small company we had a fairly new manager to handle relationships with the banks he tells me that he hates his windows pc and needs a macbook because everyone says that macbooks are easy to use foreshadowing i order his macbook and get to work making sure everything is ready to go for him the next morning printers shared folders email accounts all set up i set it up on his desk hook it up to the external monitor and other accessories and give the whole set up my nod of approval an hour and a half into the day i had become suspicious at the lack of questions about his brand new setup when manager appeared suddenly at my doorway gtmanager i have a problem he motions for me and without saying a word i pursue him to his office he walks to his laptop calmly sitting on the desktop he points exaggeratedly and says gtmanager how do you open the damn thing i honestly had a lack of words my mouth opened but i was speechless i regained my composure leaned forward and with a single finger lifted the lid of the macbook gtme like this gtmanager sigh nods head we cant even look at each other after that i force something out along the lines of you let me know if you have any other questions but we both know there will be more questions a lot more
im not a professional tech support but since im a programmer i do it sometimes for my family or friends and their families someone has recomended me to their friend so i got another job as soon as i got to the place i follow the mother to the room with a pc it seems that this was a normal family with a semitechsavvy son and two rich parents who got him a giant gaming pc while the machine was booting up after i pushed the power button the mother said that since they bought the pc for their son on his bday he sits more in his locked room so the windows booted up she points the daemon tools icon on the desktop shes sure that this is satanic program and it keeps her son there i hardly resisted to facepalm the next mins i spent explaining this that its not devils software and this program is needed for cd to work i didnt want to explain her what is emulation and why its needed good thing taht her son came back and with his help i explained her that this is not evil well i knew that most people in poland are very religious but i havent met someone so faithful no offence edit i know whats a daemon ive been using linux for years now somehow she tought that its satanic demon
 as arrived back down in it not even the crowd of begging users could dull my mood i grabbed a coffee and headed straight for my office with a smile on my face i was met with redcheer who oddly hadnt left my office gtredcheer airz back so soon gtme everything is sorted i smiled and took a victory sip of sweet coffee gtredcheer so quickly but how did you wait where is defiant gtme causality of battle im afraid dont worry hes in a better place now i couldnt help but joke around id won redcheer looked at me oddly but took it as a sign to leave i decided to get some real work done email time i read the first email it was from the vp new email to all heads of department recently its come to my attention that it has older pdas it is handing out to staff these pdas are mostly for notation and as a diary however ive personally looked into the market and found newer models with wifi and emailing capability i believe these would greatly help heads of department day to day therefore im convening a meeting this afternoon to decide which pda would be best for all heads the vp gtme oh god the phone on my desk started to ring the coffee in my hand told me not to pick it up but i had too gtvp airz its the vp gtme oh gtvp gotta make this quick but can you make a presentation on the different pda choices for the meeting this afternoon gtme wha gtvp great thanks gotta dash bye the vp had hung up as i sipped my coffee i realized this wasnt the coffee of victory it was the coffee of defeat i pushed it away with disgust i went to get another coffee a planning coffee upon arrival at the meeting i was jumped by an eager looking vp gtvp thanks for this by the way he proceeded introduce me to room gtme ahem okay first off id like to ask if anyone has any pending concerns about pdas i was staring directly at headhr who was trying her best to avoid eye contact weirdly the head of security had his hand up gtheadsec does this presentation come with a slide show my head fell in defeat as i realized headhr wasnt going to honor our initial agreement luckily i had anticipated the reluctance of headhrs help now the vp wanted pdas gtme yes headsec bounced off his chair and eagerly collected the usbkey i held he was strangle attached to slideshows i smiled at the audience and prepared myself to start plan b befuddle everyone to death with useless information and make the choice of pda murky and delayed and hopefully never happen gtme and thats why the dell axim with its video card will have d performance for some applications i took a sip of water and looked around id just finished a minute speech on the difference between almost identical pdas half the room had tuned out however the other half was still wrapped in attention gtvp i see well thank for for that enlightening talk airz ill open it up to the floor for discussion which device do you think would be best talk of lifedrive or tx filled the room accounts seemed enamored with the dell axim it was pandemonium no one could agree i heard headmarketing fighting with headcleaner about the ipaq as a brand over palm the chorus of fighting seemed to make the vp angry however the louder the room fought the bigger my smile gtvp everyone stop the room eventually quietened down gtme vp can i make a suggestion if we waited just a little we could see the newer models come out theyd have even better features i smiled conspiratorially to the crowd nod were seen throughout the room the vp however was not nodding gtvp no no i think we can all agree that windows for desktop is easy to use therefore windows for mobile should be easy to adapt to uh huh

in the earlymid s i worked for a small firm that did software devtraining and hardware repair for local businesses here in the uk a customer firm had an issue with one of their users whenever she typed she would get spurious characters appearing in documents wordperfect mainly i think the characters were generally space characters but others could appear too the customer it dept had tried replacing the keyboard hardware drivers performed virus checks and all the usual stuff and were at a loss as to how it was happening also they couldnt duplicate the issue either when they tried using her machine it only happened to her so anyway my companys tech guy got called in he was a mildmannered vietnamese man whose english wasnt perfect but by golly he knew his stuff he visited the user and as per the previous attempts he couldnt duplicate the issue nor find anything wrong a little perplexed he asked the lady to do her usual work while he observed and thought about it the problem started happening again almost immediately and he could tell why the lady was middleaged very short very round and very unsupported in the ample breast department this poor man this mildmannered meek man this man with a less than perfect grasp on the english language had to explain to the lady that the cause of her problem was her great big tits bouncing on the keyboard as she typed problem solved she required a different kind of support
ill be fair to this lady and tell you up front that her native tongue is slovakian that said i get a helpdesk ticket that basically says that shes been working on a project for her class shes a teacher and shes lost the files she was working on in a specific folder so i log into the school system and have a look to be honest i cant even find the folder shes talking about so i email her back asking if shes sure thats where the files are that shes lost i literally do nothing except to look for that folder about an hour later i get an email back i havent lost any files i just lost the colour blue in the files but the problem is fixed now thanks for taking care of that for me totally confused i consider trying to figure out what had gone wrong think better of it and send her back a nice no problem email 
 im doing tech support at a little computer store in the mid s one day im asked to meet with a few lawyers who want to start their own firm and need someone to set them up with all their it needs theyre starting with nothing i spend about minutes talking to them i work harder than i should to come up with a fairly tailored approach to save them money but also in the hopes that i can ask them for work once i finish law school my pick list is fairly short new imacs or powerbooks for the lawyers and paralegal cheap nas for file storage microsoft office licenses a monthly fee for mailweb hosting laserprinters various sundries like cabling switching and the like somehow they get sticker shock i walk on over to talk to them about it jerry is the most tech savvy while gary is finance minded garywhich of these can we do without mewell not much unless you have some existing hardware or licenses jerrynope were all making a clean break from our firms so we wont have anything garywhat about this line why am i being charged a nas fee meits a component that you store files on garycant i store files on my laptop mewhat if you want to share it with someone else what if your laptop breaks or is left in your car garythats not my problem meok what if jerry asks you to cover a hearing for him and you dont know what its about you could just grab it from the file share on the nas and bingo youre ready for the hearing garywed have to do a lot of hearings to pay off that nas thing jerrywhy do i need to buy email hosting mewell id imagine youd want your own domain name jerrybut my mac has mail already meright but it would be cheaper to use a mail host than give everybody mac accounts itd look more professional too jerryturning his laptop around to show the mail applicationno my mac has mail already meright i thought youd want separate email addresses so you can keep work separate from personal email privilege and all that garywhatever why do we need so many office licenses mewell law practices tend to be word and excel heavy makes sense to give everybody access to that tool jerrybut office comes with macs heres where i screw up mewell if you have a cheaper source for office licenses have at it we go back and forth some more even to the point of quibbling about the lengths of cat cable to string everything together eventually we come up with a proposal without the office licenses we set up the macs in their new office configure shares on the nas and leave them be until days later when their demo licenses of office expired i never mentioned that i was a law student i realized that id rather work at a retail computer shop than work with these lawyers

another short tale from days long past only partially related to the actual tech support part forgive me a few years back i was working for a travel agency in the it department and we had an issue with our airport desk tldr router hardware failure so the desk computers werent able to connect to our network and they couldnt easily verify flight reservations etc as you can probably imagine a huge issue so off i went to restore the connection now of course i was it no uniform i was wearing blue jeans and a geeky tshirt since the network equipment was at the front desk i took a seat there and got to work with the two ladies actually working there standing at the next desk maybe five metres away from me and to make things extra clear the sign on top read desk closed try to picture it two desks for the same company one staffed by ladies in uniform waiting to help people the other for all intents and purposes closed with someone sitting there not wearing any kind of uniform or looking up at all i wasnt sitting there for five minutes when the first people came to me to ask for assistance even though i was pointedly ignoring everyone as best i can tell it was simply because i am a man eventually as i had to spend several hours there until i had everything up and working again i made a little sign out of paper simply saying next desk with an arrow to the correct desk and placed it in front of me and still some people came to me first xposted with some edits to ridontworkherelady 
company recently fired their it staff and outsourced it to my company as a thirdparty the cfo of the company is very paranoid that the old it staff still has access to their network and computers despite reimaging their machines and locking down the firewall earlier this week the cfo came storming into our room where we were at theyre hacking my computer right now i asked whats the issue she responds every time i try to highlight a word the entire page gets highlighted theyre highlighting everything on me they have to be moving things around i turn my head back to my computer and say ill be up in a second looking at her desk she has a gigantic stack of papers all over the place on the corner of her laptop sits the biggest stack of papers right on the shiftkey i move the stack of papers and all of the text highlighting goes away we joke that we need to bring tinfoil hats into the office when were here but some days i feel i truly need one

hi everyone i work tech support for my local internet provider and although i get many calls a day regarding issues that are eye rollingly easy to fix this one really takes the cake let me start off by saying i am no expert i was trained and have been working with the company for over a year now though and in terms of fixing the internet over the phone i know my shit i get a call today a new customer whos just received his router and stuff in the post the first thing he says indicates exactly the type of person he is and i know its going to be an excruciating call customer hi i got your gear today and its not working already i knew i shouldnt have signed up to you guys its absolutely atrocious me okay sir i apologise for any inconvenience youve experienced whats the name of the router youve received its worth noting that whilst i ask these questions im pulling up their account and line on the computer my side hes right the router hasnt signed up to us yet and the line is showing as inactive we also send out a few different kinds of routers depending on what the customer wants and usually asking them is quicker than bringing it all up this side customer gives name its not working me i can see on this side the router hasnt come online as of yet customer exactly its absolutely ridiculous the service im on the verge of cancelling ive only just bought the damn thing the engineers have noted that it all should be up and running so i carry on despite him shouting now thirty seconds into the call me right okay and what lights can you currently see on the router theres a long pause where i almost think hes put the phone down but no hes still there customer well none me so not even the power light customer no i cant see anything on there me are you near your router right now customer yes its still in the wrapping its brand new here i actually pause for a good few seconds he said its in the wrapping so has he unboxed it at all so far me so the router is still in its original packaging customer yes so by this point after listening to countless insults not included here because its too long to type out it got me a little irate so i was a bit blunt with the customer me so how do you know it isnt working customer well i just assumed ive heard stories me so you assumed your internet wasnt working instead of trying it out yourself customer i was right though i want to slam my head on the desk at this point me how do you know youre right customer cos its not on me sir thats because you havent tried to even plug it in yet thats like buying a car and never driving it because you just assume it wont work customer oh well ill try it and plug it in me okay sir once you have see if it works if you have any more trouble give us a call back i put the phone down keeping his line up i check his line five minutes later and magically hes online its amazing what happens when you actually plug in your shit before assuming its all broken i honestly thought this was a hoax call but the guy was being deadly serious 
a few years back i used to work for a computer repairs company and i was the one receiving calls and assigning techs to jobs one of the things i learned early on in the job was to ask customers exactly what the fuck nothing works means generally by asking them to boot up their machine and talk me through what theyre seeing this was because nothing works most times means this software im trying to use doesnt work the way i want it to one morning i got this call guy my mac wont work me ok sir what do you mean guy what do you think i mean i turn it on and nothing happens me can you please go to your computer and turn it on walk me through what youre seeing or whats happening exactly now i hear the guy walk through a few rooms and sit down on a chair guy its loading me okampmdash guy theres the windows flag on the screen now me wait what guy the windows loading screen thing im not sure why youre having me do this i already told you whats the problem me sir i thought you said you had a mac guy yes this is my wifes pc me i asked you to boot up your computer guy but mines not a computer its a mac face meet desk

everybody reading my tales knows i work as a senior tech for a unionized telco but one topic ive not written about yet is that ive also done quite a bit of it for the union itself it was many years ago i can live with pseudonymously airing corporate secrets more easily than our unions but still there are a few tales worth telling safely by now including how it all began one morning at work many years ago while i was pushing tickets in my cubicle there was a bit of a commotion a rare celebrity had just been spotted below my halffloor the union vicepresident for call centers flanked by a few stewards and a secretservicelooking goon since most it personnel in north america is nonunion it may seem weird but here we say your manager is the boss you hate and this guy is the boss you love always had our backs always the guy in the way if management wants to fire someone without extremely serious cause if he shows up people drop any work just to get in line to shake his hand he shook many but eventually came to my desk i hit the hard switch on both my phone and my wireless headset he nodded at one of the stewards with him and asked me quietly to meet with the guy downstairs over the break i was already known to have the unions interests at heart but that was the day when i learned they trusted me back downstairs soon after gt steward gotta be brief we think the union offices might be bugged we need someone from tsss tech supports senior staff to go over everything and say if theres any chance the company are using their network to spy on us and if so to offer to the executive the best options to ensure this is no longer possible people on the council vouched for you but its going to be offhours offbooks in or out that meant despite the unions ability to formally order the release of any union employee from work hours with full pay id be doing it on my own time because it was too sensitive for the company to know id even be over there i was flattered but i was definitely not a sweep for bugs guy gt bytewave in but im not sure you want me it should be handled by one of our union rf leakage guys if you think our offices are bugged there is a huge union team dedicated to rf leakage working closely with regular road techs previously wrote a story about the kind of work they do even uses equipment theyd be familiar with as our rf leakage teams multipurpose gear is entirely able to deal with bugdetection too gt steward well uh just come around its not a rf issue and so i did ive never been too shy to admit my primary loyalty is to my union over my corporation and the mere thought the corp might be eavesdropping had me torn between being angry at the corp and being disappointed that the union were actually using the telcos network at all weak move whether theres foul play or not later that evening at the unions headquarters downtown after going through the sergeantatarms and the security door while sadly there was a perfectly normal door without any sergeantatarms in the back i was greeted warmly by the executive its not uncommon they work till pm the steward from earlier led me to the evidence poured me a whiskey like were in a movie just as he powered up the computer i was meant to look at gt steward so weve had this series of bouncebacks since last friday dozens of them its from some weird email address but has the telcos business domain name this means theyre trying to spy on us but screwed up somewhere right it just took a single long glance before i groaned just because you work for a telco doesnt mean you have any technical expertise there are dozens of departments here with zero tech knowledge whatsoever in fact remarkably few union people are working technical jobs from sales to recoveries to dozens of others many routinely call inhouse it because rebooting is hard im still not sure how they made the leap from bounceback to spycraft though gt bytewave yes its a bounceback no it doesnt mean the telco hired james bond to screw us over i took out my phone and sent an email to the same address instantly got the same bounceback gt bytewave they have an email that were constantly mailing to that is simply no long valid on their domain the weird email address was simply the default for corporate replies and the hr person the union was communicating with had left under unclear circumstances without notice meaning a disabled corporate email within the day because this guy used to be a liaison with the union he was automatically copied on several lowprioritysecrecy emails just as the union was on several of hrs everytime the union automatically mailed something to the nowdefunct address on their domain they obviously got a bounceback i explained that this whole thing was about a lowlevel hr goon quitting and then i started scolding gt bytewave over the last dozen years weve had more than ample evidence the corporation isnt playing fair im not here to fix stuff anymore im here as a duespaying member expecting reasonable representation from my labour union under the labour code and the union charter i want to know who the hell okd that the union headquarters use the only network where we can be plausibly spied on without any shred of trace or evidence nor any involvement by the authorities by the company which repeatedly suggested everything would be better if there was no union at all and played dirty at every chance those who read all my tales will understand that i wasnt kidding about the company not always playing fair union execs soon wanted to hear my point of view and thanked me with free chicken before taking me to the basement after dinner at union hq sensitive conversations are held in the basement because nobody is physically allowed down there unless they are completely trusted no computer or smartphone ever made it down those stairs as unhealthy as it may be you can still smoke down there and nobody cares thats where they asked me to be the unions tech support days later i got a release card simple name but theyre offered only to union execs stewards and critical unionrelated staff they only work up to just about a dozen thousand hours a year as per the work contract afterwards the union has to pay the release costs therefore the union cant give them to just anyone and its a bit of an honor to get one without being elected to union office it meant that i could afterwards just walk away from my job fully paid and without notice on union business at my own sayso from that moment on for about a couple years on top of my normal job as senior tech support staff at my telco i was also my unions tech support and theres a few tales ill write about that gt tldr my union confused legitimate bouncebacks for spycraft then hired me as their formal it guy it meant privileges including being able to discard my work at any time because they were impressed i figured out their nonissue in six seconds all of bytewaves tales on 
so this is not a tale of networking heroics nor is it tale of inept users instead it is a wonderful combination of happenstance that i think you all will get a kick out of so i work for a small company only or users and i do pretty much all the tech work including maintaining our servers we recently added four more into our rack for another company that we work closely with who is also in our building so the other companys tech guy and i are working in the server room diagnosing some network issues he is having with his new servers i am at the back of the rack pulling wires while he is working on the machines twiddling with network settings i hear a small braaap and then smell a horrible foul smell the other tech has decided to rip a massive fart in the tiny server room which was immediately pulled in by all seven of our servers warmed up to a lovely hundred degrees or so and then blown directly in my face by about exhaust fans 
and old lady extremely technologically illiterate called to ask how to keep people from tipping her monitor upon further probing i discovered she was upset because the icons on her desktop were reset neatly to the left side every time she logged in she had called previously and the agent she got on the phone told her the icons were sliding to that side because her monitor was getting tipped to the left

previous tale id like to thank the three kind souls who have gilded this post i am opening an account for frodo named college and studies histrionics aka cash he has a future now thanks to you guys foreward im looking after my godson yesterday and today and probably tommorrow too because of no school and his parents work we played video games binged on pizza all the fun stuff you do to spoil a kid due to the oncall nature of my two jobs condo building general hardware it stuff and sysadmining for theboss i brought him along on my calls most of them were pretty basic and not worth tales here but here are the tales that he solved cast frodo my godson the hero of these stories absorbs information like a sponge my pfy of these stories named thus because his mother dislocated two of my fingers in the delivery room i was there due to fate kicking me down and then stomping me repeatedly afterwards coincidentally his hair is curly too eight years old theboss client im sysadmining for seen in a tale guilty of repeating previous issues thefiance fianceassistant to theboss seen in previous tale ecurity head of security at the condo complex takes his job seriously listens to instructions only calls when necessary all the makings of a good user luser desk drone from hell will complain about any and everything she can think of inspections are really useful yesterday pm get a call from ecurity a security camera is down this was an important one too it pointed directly at the playground it was mostly a redundant camera but it has a closer unbroken view of the playground in case anything happens knocks on wood its had a troubled history and usually goes out when it rains so we head out to the security office make introductions exchange pleasantries drink an obscene amount of coffee check the security monitors yep its down switch ports still no go so we decide to go check it out its raining pretty good out a nice freezing rain check out the camera through my cell phone camera nope no ir light so in my infinite wisdom i decide that the camera is broken i leave frodo with ecurity and go fetch a replacement and a ladder i return to see frodo on his hands and knees looking at something on the ground with ecurity crouching next to him gtfrodo what do you think it is gtecurity looks like a gasket a gasket eh i come up to check it out too not wanting to be the guy left out of things gtme looks like one of the gaskets for the conduit box that holds the camera ba crap so i head back to the storage room for a balun and an umbrella and head over to the security office to unhook the camera i return get up the ladder open the umbrella and unscrew the conduit box cover while water is just draining out onto my hands good thing i unhooked that cable v is a joke but it feels annoying take off the cover and unhook everything dry it out and hook up the new balun and reattach the cover with the gasket have ecurity go back to the office and hook the power cord labeled into the socket he gets it right on the first time with nothing catching on fire he radios me to tell me the camera is up i climb down the ladder and confirm with my cellphone camera yep theres the ir light showing up take the ladder down hand frodo the camera and we head back to put everything back i call both the building it guy and ecurity and have them schedule a meeting to talk about better camera systems as we are currently using analog signal to dvr and while not quite bad but not as advanced as the owner would like he wants everything digital redundant systems blah blah blah im rich do it in this case i agree with him me and frodo go back to the condo for showers and celebratory coffee his was heavily watered down with milk and sugar but hey its a start i email maintenance to report about the gasket and to find out who lost it because it sure wasnt me reading sure is useful today am this morning i did not feel like cooking breakfast for us so i brought us over to theboss place to mooch i mean see if everything is alright yeah lets go with that one naturally thefiance is making breakfast and offers us some i help her out with setting the table and whatnot while frodo is watching tv in the office all the while i can hear grunts of frustration from the office just as im about to go over to see whats wrong i hear gtfrodo whats wrong gttheboss cant access company x files if you have read my last tale you can see where this is going gtfrodo reading out loud company y computer what does that mean my signs worked yes he was being sarcastic sure enough i hear the chair wheels skidding across the floor some typing and a relieved ahhhh thanks kid thefiance and i are trying to laugh as quietly as possible those pancakes tasted like victory as we are heading back to our condo gtfrodo are they all like that gtme who gtfrodo everyone you help gtme no hes aggravating at best but hes not the worst i can get check my phone come on lets go enjoy ourselves for a bit we have one of the worst ones up later a pfy is born imagination is the key to dealing with lusers today pm after a good binge of minecraft pizza and grape soda we head down to the it room for the thin client deployment that i have to do for someone that couldnt come in due to car trouble for the condo office on our way down i explain what i do know about thin clients to frodo and what we have to do frodo is excited this is something he can finally help with in his mind anyway he was tons of help in other places we get the cart of eight thin clients and go to the desks i unhook the old thin client and hook up the new one i give frodo a bracelet with the security cable key on it and threatened him about what should happen if he loses it he puts it on and says he wont lose it i watch him set up one to make sure he sets it up the right way four cables and a security lock unlocklock would you believe that he plugged in every usb cable on the first try every time i make a mental note to test him for witchcraft take him gambling ask for his secrets later i finish my half and am on the phone with the head of it when frodo comes back gtme can you cancel lusers rdp its lunch break anyway session im not going near her you know how she is he agreed and did it and while luser let out a cry of dismay and ran off me and frodo got to work we almost made it of course if we did make it i wouldnt be posting this in here typing in all caps is tiring and wrong just imagine her shrieking and the text is in caps gtluser what are you doing gtme upgrading your thin client it has more gtluser why i liked my old one better gtme im just doing what im told and this one has more gtluser what about my files i swear to god if you lost my files i will end you please note that i am dating the owners niece and i am probably as bulletproof as you can get well as long as i dont break anything important set anything on fire etc gtme these thin clients dont work that way everything is server based gtluser no it doesnt you ruined my files frodo walks up to the windows gtfrodo actually thin clients are like this window closes the blinds see you are logged out opens blinds now you are logged in see that tree thats your files closes blinds and walks to the window next to that one and closes those blinds this is another thin client it is logged out opens blinds to that window see the tree is still there i am shocked im standing there with my mouth open that was pretty accurate and it worked luser just sat down and stared at her monitor until we left were back in the office of it head and frodo is explaining thin clients again the it heads reaction was the same as mine he began furiously taking notes gtfrodo can we head back now i think our ores are finished macerating the moment is ruined and we went back to our minecraft server ive been showing him the insides of a computer since then and he even put one together sans processor under my supervision he has drank the it koolaid this kid is eight and better than most users i just found out school is cancelled tomorrow too so i might be back with more then edit clarification on computer building edit spelling errors
back in december when gawker got hacked and their million passwords leaked i was following the breach and downloaded the file with all the passwords just to verify that mine wasnt part of the ones released mine was safe however i found around or email addresses belonging to my university with cracked passwords and usernames i decided that id shoot off a quick email to the users involved hoping that they might at least pay attention to me if only because of the fact that the email would come from a university address i typed up the below message and sent it out not expecting to hear anything back but felt good that i might have prevented at least one or two people from having a major security issue gt hey guys gt gt i dont know any of you personally but your name is on the list of compromised gawker passwords if you havent already heard the story go read one of the articles here or here long story short these guys got into gawker and took million usernames amp passwords gt gt thought id pass this on from on university student to another stay safe out there i got a few scattered emails throughout the next week or so from people thanking me for the heads up and i figured that was the end of it fast forward a few weeks i get an email from the campus post office telling me i have a package to pick up i know i havent ordered anything recently so i have no idea why id have a package to pick up i decided to trek over and see what it was when i got there they handed me a small box with an amazon label on it now even more confused i open up the box to find a white beanie and a gift label with the following message gt hey there gt gt i looked your address up on the campus directory i wanted to give you a little something as thanks for letting me know about the gawker password leak heres a white hat for a white hat happy holidays tl dr random guy gives me a white hat for telling him his password got leaked

a client comes in buddy of mine older gentleman says he cant remember his password ok no biggie lets go through the password reset steps first question last digits of your social no problem he puts that in second question ein number got it rd and last question what is the color of your first car he types in black and white black and white i saypuzzled then ask him why wouldnt you just put down one color so its easier to remember he just shrugs and laughs i said ok try just black doesnt work try just white nope just try random colors i suggest green now its his turn to look at me puzzled green he says totally flabbergasted i was like yea or blue just try typical colors of cars car i thought it said cat he squints and presses his face up to the monitor shit i need glasses at this point im roaring why would it ask you the color of your first cat he laughs too i dont know thats why i said black and white and then was confused when you said green ah good times he finally got the color right but that point his account was locked out from trying too many times we put in a ticket with the system and got it unlocked i see him almost every day and im not going to let him live this one down 
a quick tale while im on my lunch break so i host a minecraft server that me and my friends play on while im not the primary administrator of this server i do step in when im needed we recently encountered a problem where the server was pegging a core on the host at usage and nobody could connect long story short i was able to use a java debugger to find the block type causing the issue but we couldnt connect to remove it we spent a few hours trying to fix the issue including loading the world in an external editor mcedit to remove the block nothing worked then one of our nontech savvy users piped up umm dont you guys have a backup cue every tech person in the chat room facepalming between the five of us nobody had thought to restore from a backup i mean this is exactly the reason we have backups isnt it yet nobody thought to use them so we restored from a backup and all was good the next day i get a message from one of the users note that the user could not have known the block they were using was bugged gtuser i promise i will try not to fuck up the server again but i also want to thank you for your hard work last night gtme heh not that i did anything useful gtme no worries then this happened gtuser being in it is often a thankless job just wanted to make sure you knew how much i appreciate that someone was in a position to help gtuser and dont say you didnt do much you put serious effort in and made alot of progress much more than i did just throwing ideas around this this user gets it and now the world is all blurry edit me fail english thats unpossible
although i work in a retail store my actual job is tech support so i felt like this would be the proper place for this story i work for a cell phone provider as an instore technician a customer came in today because he couldnt get into his gmail account this was his rd visit to a store for this issue i have reset hundreds maybe even a thousand gmail passwords in the last years doing this job i find out that he has step verification enabled on his gmail account and that he wasnt getting the text message verification code from google i suggest that we try to login to the account on a desktop computer instead i swing my monitor and keyboard around for him and tell him to sign in i guess he expected that i was just going to do it for him because he makes a big show about how hard it is to use a keyboard he says this is all foreign to me im used to typing on my phone he goes on to ask me how to make a you hit the button with a on it he was also using caps lock to capitalize letters after several attempts he finally gets the password entered correctly next step is to enter his cell phone number to send the verification code this is where it gets tricky it turns out that whoever set up his gmail account for him not only enabled the step verification but also typed his phone number wrong which is why he isnt getting the verification code he asks me to call google and fix it for him at this point im starting to get frustrated with him and i inform him that no i cant call google for him a reasonable person wouldnt expect their cell phone service provider to call google for them because they are locked out of their personal email account i explained multiple times that i was not going to call google but did offer to physically dial the number for him so he could talk to them apparently that wasnt enough because he left in a huff because i just didnt want to help him if he hadnt been so lazy in the first place and set up his gmail account himself he probably wouldnt have been in this mess today and i do not have sympathy for people who are not willing to do things themselves 
ive been reading tfts for a while so i thought id give back im not in tech support but i was always better at resolving issues than most lusers so i was made a power user for my department not quite helpdesk but the first line of defence before their first line you can imagine what a wonderful job that was so i worked in a government department that dealt with property taxes and employed about people given my elevated status i was often given the more complicated accounts to manage this job also required me to run certain quarterly reports normally these were fine except for a set of around accounts these accounts were for large organisations that rented out property and each account contained several thousand properties to manage under one account i had to run a report on one of these larger accounts and after sitting there for a while the report timed out this never normally happened so i called one of the more helpful members of our helpdesk and told them about the timeout issue they were pretty surprised too they said that it shouldnt happen and that i should try and run it a few more times until it worked a little alarm bell began ringing in my head i felt like a user that has a problem with a print job and was expressly told to hit print another times so i dutifully reran the report as instructed rerunning it every minutes each time it timed out while i was waiting for the report to run i was doing some other paperwork blissfully ignorant of the chatter around me slowly ever slowly i began to hear more cries of its not working again or is it running slow for anyone else that alarm bell began ringing a little louder but the alarm bell was punctuated by the friendly beep of my outlook delivering a priority message to all staff informing them that our system was down we couldnt take calls from customers couldnt access accountsthose alarm bells were getting pretty loud i was just about to lift the handset to call up my friendly tech when i see someone standing in front of my desk you also know its not good when you look up to see that its the head of itand not just the head of the helpdesk but the head of it gt what did you do and how did you do it the buttock clenching nervousness that one experiences when you have a clearly peeved executive in front of you is not pleasant what none of our helpdesk knew was that despite the report timing out on a users machine it still doesnt kill the process running on the servers so each time i reran the report it created a duplicate job running simultaneously so half a dozen reports analysing tens of thousands of properties in total trying to pull back around at best guess around million transaction recordsoops its no wonder i managed to crash the servers in the end a reboot and my recommendation of an addition to the report about only allowing accounts with up to properties to be run in real time sorted the problem head of it was actually pleased that id managed to find this issue and help resolve it now that he knew my name it actually worked out pretty well and we collaborated on a few projects from then on my colleagues were pretty pleased theyd managed to get an impromptu minute break too they were a little disappointed that the helpdesk patched the hole so they couldnt intentionally crash it again i was able to theorise how we could still do it again and work around the new addition to the report but i thought it best not to arm the lusers with such a dangerous piece of knowledge working in a government department it seems that they employ a higher standard of luser theres a few more stories of my time there which i can share if theres any interest

hello obligatory first time poster long time lurker etc some background i work as an it manager for a large private jet catering company as well as head tech for my high school im a senior in hs so i often have to leave class to answer tickets briefly anyway this tale comes from the catering company to preface this even further all of the computers at the company have been custom built theyre not anything crazy with graphics cards or anything like that but theyre certainly a step up from the hp computers from best buy or something anyway so my day is just getting started and i receive a ticket that says ram fell out computer wont turn on immediately red flags go off for various reasons i walk over and this is how the conversation goes skull gtso the ram fell out what were you possibly doing smartypants gti decided to try and upgrade this work station so i bought my own ram to replace the stuff in here i look to see multiple sticks of ram laid out on the desk and the computer turned on its side with the side cover off i confiscate the replacement ram tell him that the ones we have in the pcs are fine and why did he do this smartypants gtmy station was having issues and i determined it to be the ram after reading somethings online so i tried to replace it as i didnt want to bother the it department so after hearing this i replace the ram in the machine and boot it up before the os loads i spam the the delete key to enter the bios to make sure this tech savvy user didnt try to screw around with any settings after realising what key i was pressing and he grabs my hand and pulls it away from the computer and says smartypants gtwhat are you doing quit trying to delete my computer i have important files on there edit for visibility some have and fairly so i certainly dont mind answering questions doubted the legitimacy of several aspects of this situation so let me clear those up ive responded to several comments but im putting it here for visibility on the subject of a work schedule i only go to class hour a day as i only need one more credit to graduate hs i applied to this company to start as just a regular in the department and after the previous manager quit i had been working just over a year and a half and could dedicate more time to my job that and combined with having past degrees of leadership in the past marching band i was given the position of manager i used the term confiscate rather poorly and for that i apologise i was trying to convey that i removed the user brought in ram from the picture i gave it back to him a he did technically own it but i of course told him not to try and put it in any work computer again a while before i started working the company invested very heavily in a server overhaul and of that money went to it but our rather tech knowledgeable boss approached the previous it manager and asked for a sort of bulk parts list for computers to replace the older dell machines that were previously in use the department ordered parts for of these new customish pcs as those were all that were needed at the time the company has since grown to about and the machines are mixed between the older dell machines the previously ordered pcs and varied other off the shelf computers that had to be hastily bought to accommodate employees we divvy up the computers by basically having highly essential jobs operate on the better computers in this specific case i was dealing with an ordered pc to address previous question posting i will admit that they are basic but they come from several places some of them are for my personal use at home some are just legitimately lack of knowledge as in the business its my belief that its not necessarily the info you know but more so how to obtain the information sometimes questions are asked because i want to verify the process of doing something or making sure it is an actual issue lastly im not on some crazy fixed salary as a senior im still technically paid by the hour

recently i have gotten a new job as a technician about a few days into the job i had a situation where a guy brings in his laptop because it blue screens on startup its no big deal since his data was backed up and a reimage didnt take that long while i was documenting the incident my trainer was there watching me making sure i did everything right i was typing in bsod on startup when i was stopped trainer you cant put that in me what do you mean it was a bsod trainer i know but you have to use blsc me ok thats kinda odd is bsod used for something else trainer no thats not the case even though bsod is a standard industry term some manager over at the west cost was offended at the words of death so it became company policy to use the term blsc me you are kidding me trainer no i agree its the dumbest fucking thing ever update blsc stands for blue screen its bsod without the death update i am keeping my job one little thing like blsc is not going to ruin it

 i sat staring down at the screen assembly that the vp was slowly easing onto the pda in front of him gtvp so the orientation is this way up correct gtme yep you could just let me handle this my back was aching from leaning forward to watch the vp trying to repair pdas for over an hour gtvp no i want to learn its my project after all i should know the fundamentals the vp smiled away as he slowly tried to push the parts together every slight resistance he would stop and reevaluate it was taking forever gtme would you like me to show you again i held my demonstration pda in hand pressing the pieces together firmly and ignoring the snaps of plastic that indicated it was firmly in place gtvp no no thanks but maybe just watch youve years of training behind you you know youre not going to break it gtme you wont break it it just needs a little more force to clip in gtvp my problem is i dont have your years of experience yet so i have to take it a little slow gentle gtme it wont ever go in unless you just press down i reached out to grasp his screen assembly and push it down firmly however the vp pulled it away sharply gtvp see airz this is why we need a team building weekend we need to learn to trust each other let me go at my own pace i sighed heavily and sat back in my chair as the vp continued to daintily press upon the screen never committing to an actual press gtvp speaking of are you excited a whole three days off work gtme oh yes you mean the team building exercise gtvp it should be fun everyone camping out together with activities and delicious food gtme wait what camping the vp smiled and looked up he loftily held his half assembled pda in hand i was tempted to reach out in fix it myself gtvp dont worry were in cabins not tents gtme i thought it was just a day thing gtvp no no were going to place far away gtme executive is going on a camp an actual stay out of towncity camp the vp nodded his head vigorously i tried to swallow my rising panic the vp gave the screen a slightly stronger tap a small snap could be heard as a connector clicked into place gtvp ahhh gtme its okay thats the sound its meant to make after a few screws in the back and face plates reattached the vp held aloft his reassembled pda i smiled as he powered it on grateful at the chance to finally leave unfortunately the screen did not display the manufactures logo as expected in its place was a giant crack across the screen gtvp oh darn i think i put the broken screen back in i must have got muddled gtme thats okay its exactly the same process with a broken or nonbroken screen do you think youve got it vp nodded i got up from my chair happy to finally be able to leave gtvp no no dont go i havent even fixed one yet i watched as the vp started un assembling the pda he reached for the screwdriver gtvp like you told me before lefty loosey righty tighty which left was it again my mind chanted hes trying to learn hes trying to learn hes trying to learn it became my mantra to keep me sane

 one of the first rules of consulting is that you never give free advice even if you know the answer you make the potential client wait until theyve signed a contract one of the rules of being a decent human being is that you never let a fellow techie spin around uselessly sometimes these rules come into conflict usually professionalism wins over human weakness but this is a story about going the other way jeanette is a fellow techie at big sprawling organization bso bso has a reputation for being a good place for techies to make their bones but it has a reputation for a kafkaesque bureaucracy technical debt and legacy stuff going back years im supposed to meet jeanette and hang out for a few hours but shes stuck in a dilemma shes stuck between a few different policy requirements data must be classified according to its sensitivity sensitive data must be encrypted if it leaves bsos control if the data doesnt have a classification its to be treated as sensitive until determined otherwise data older than the document retention policy must be securely destroyed obsolete and unrepairable it components are to donated to a specific recycling company that makes no guarantees about security jeanette wants to clean out a pc graveyard in a basement a gamma minus checkbox checker in compliance issued an edict to comply with the rules above jeanette will mount each drive encrypt the contents and ship them to the recyclers where they may be destroyed or reused of course once mr checkbox checker has made their ruling they are routing phone calls to voice mail and email to devnull so jeanette cannot enjoy coffee with me instead shes got to begborrowsteal every idegtusb adapter and go through a wall of systems i bring two gocups of coffee and meet her in the basement shes perturbed by a daunting amount of pointless work but the great compliance has spoken or at least mumbled incoherently i see an obvious solution methis has to be be the dumbest shit ive heard this week jeanettei know im going to be catching up for weeks meno no i need three things and this problem is solved we need an intern a maul and a philips screwdriver jeanette if compliance thought we could just destroy the hard drives dont you think they would have mentioned it meof course not if a bureaucrat has a choice between them doing work considering the problem or you doing work fixing a problem theyll pick you every time jeanette looking at me sideways like she knows im going to say something crazybut we cant just recycle the drives me were going to recontextualize the problem hard drives containing data must be encrypted before they go to the outside vendor but aluminum scrap well is just aluminum scrap it doesnt contain data jeanette is looking at me with a worried look as i rummage around and pull out two steel cased desktop pcs which i place on the ground about inches apart from one another mejeanette trust me clients of mine with tons of hipaa data have approved this if you get arrested ill represent you we can do it ourselves but this is really a learning experience for an intern jeanettesigh fine jeanette leaves me alone in this basement i look around and find an screwdriver that looks like its only purpose has been to open and stir cans of battleship gray paint i also find a fist sized hunk of steel with a very nice heft jeanette returns with sanjay an eager young it intern shes found him a white lab coat safety goggles and a philips screwdriver mesanjay do you know why youre here sanjayi think so metheres the task at hand and theres some stuff to learn follow this procedure exactly first place the drive between the two pcs sanjayok me putting the big ugly screwdriver on the casing of the hard drivesecond place the tool halfway between the spindle and the edge of the platters sanjayok i raise the hunk of steel above my head i wait a second then shriek ia ia cthulhu fhtagn then drive the screwdriver through the hard drive jeanette looks annoyed with me and sanjay seems startled i pull the drive off the screwdriver and shake the drive the platters are clearly shattered mesanjay there are a three lessons you should learn from this exercise if you want to be an it professional one there are rules for a reason two knowing when to bend the letter of the rules to follow the reason behind the rules is the mark of a professional sanjay and the third mewhen you can have fun doing it jeanette and i left sanjay to his work as we walked back to her work area she asks one question jeanettedid you have to do that mei figured a pentagram might be offensive 
i asked an old coworker if he remembered any good stories from our time as small network admins so i could share with reddit he said remember that time you came back to the shop bleeding and muddy and said you didnt want to talk about it its time to talk about it it began innocently enough i received a call from one of the sales team about a new client who needed an initial assessment of their network and pcs this was a newish japanese restaurant in a declining part of town this restaurant was the only business still afloat in a much larger building that once held a movie theater and some sort of shipping warehouse i walked in introduced myself to the nice korean couple who owned the place and got to it as i got down to business i was informed all the previous tech work was done by the next door neighbors son i took this to mean were used to paying and a plate of chicken and rice for tech support i was not surprised to find a lot of work to do but nothing out of the ordinary the first complaint was the point of sale machine it was unusually slow even considering the lackluster hardware i could not bring it down as they were still checking out the last of the lunch rush so i brought up msconfig and decided to see what i could disable and turn off i remember going to the startup tab and thinking wow what a bunch of crap scrolling down holy cow scrolling down ok were turning everything off and instead looking for what needs to be turned back on after this it was working better but still needed some deep cleaning or a reformat for some reason the internet was still dodgy i pulled up a command prompt and did a continuous ping to googlecom and let that run for a few minutes when i came back i found high latency and lost of lost packets no big deal well try to reboot the router and modem and see if that helps so i asked what i considered a simple question where is your router and modem to which i received in answer a puzzled smile they were not sure what i was talking about as they had only recently moved from dial up ok time to switch gears who is your isp no idea who do you pay for internet access nobody apparently they used to pay for internet access but the teenager set them up with free internet big red flag was raised this just got slightly interesting i tried following the network cable but it disappeared into a hole in the floor similar story in the back office with the accounting machine so i tried to log into the router and at least get an idea of what i was looking for i encountered the ddwrt password prompt thats cool i prefer tomato myself but weve got a tinkerer a tinkerer who thinks its a good idea to change the default password for lan access why i point out the network cable to the owner and ask him if he knows where it goes as he looked at me the room grew dark and foreboding it got noticeably colder the crawlspace im not sure what that cable goes but he took a whole box of cable into the crawlspace and then we had internet ok can i call him i asked no hes gone off to college thats why we hired you a second later im standing in front of an open trap door in the floor behind the stock room shining my flashlight into a dark void there is a dirt floor and it smells an old stepladder is there but i dont trust it and just jump in with tools and laptop case in hand my first thought was surprise at how big it was my flashlight didnt reach the far two walls it was a forest of concrete footings and steel supports there was a lot of power conduit and water pipes to duck under but for the most part you had about feet to stand up it stunk like death and decay i found the two network cables and an extension cord and start off on my trek do you remember the aliens movie i forget which one where the guy is following candles in the dark hallways and there are monsters stalking him this is what it felt like i tell myself that it cant be that far because extension cords are only so long at the end of the cord is another plugged into it then another plugged into that one ok well at least they cant run cat cable longer than feet its quiet and stinks worse all the time i keep thinking i hear something or multiple somethings moving around eventually i see green leds ahead of me and find a small network switch the two network cables from the pcs plug into the switch which is powered by the extension cord and another cable continues onwards my only hope of a feet max was dashed i had always thought i was the type to keep a cool head in an emergency i didnt think i was the type to panic well i learned something new about myself a few score feet beyond that switch as i continued to recall every scary movie i had ever seen i shone my light ahead and saw two glowing yellow eyes looking back perhaps feet away a chill ran up my spine and the hairs on my arms stood up something in my head snapped and an ancient primal part of me took over for reasons i still dont understand i hunched over and screamed into the silent darkness an alligator and just like that it became real in my mind a foot alligator with long teeth faced me like a pudgy uncoordinated ninja i grabbed my screwdrivers punch tool and wire crimp and threw them at the eyes and then i ran screaming like a little girl i must have hit my head in my disgraceful retreat because i ended up with a small cut and blood in my hair i got back to the stepladder and found they had closed the door what kind of monster would close somebody into a pit of alligators like that i threw it open and jumped out in a single leap i found myself face to face with the waitress who screamed i screamed back at her the owner rushed in and looked me over with great concern i managed to compose myself and said she startled me i think i bumped my head may i use your restroom i splashed cold water in my face and was ashamed of myself an alligator really here where we have more snow days than warm ones it was likely a stray cat and i might have just killed it so i am back in the hole retracing my steps i keep telling myself im not afraid but i still wish i had my target pistol in hand i get to the switch and then beyond it my tools scattered over a large area the slot head screwdriver had blood on it which frankly amazed me that i actually hit the poor creature in my panic so with the bloody screwdriver in one hand and a flashlight in the other i continued my search for that modem at the far wall i found the router standard linksys blue box zip tied to something holding it up and nothing else no modem how in the heck were they getting internet i plugged in and tried again to guess the password without luck then remembering some of the features of ddwrt i checked for open wireless signals of which there were two from establishments on the other side of the road so my best guess is the teenager had bridged the router to one of those open wireless connections and thus provided free internet for the restaurant i power cycled the device which didnt help at all and went back i must have been a sight the owner quickly agreed with my suggestions and promised to call the local cable company come install their own internet tomorrow i was ushered out the back door without even a glass of water we kept that contract but the restaurant owner requested a different tech be assigned as he was not sure about me i did not complain imagining he must have heard me screaming and crying under his restaurant and then screaming at his cute waitress i really didnt want to face him again
today i tell the tale of a user in peril an emergency indeed if we are not careful they phoned me up in a panic indeed i deleted all my pictures the wrong button i have keyed further questioning revealed the recycle bin was empty this might or could actually be an issue maybe dont worry i cried ready to man action stations ill pop down in a mo and well sort this situation down i hurried thinking to myself in puzzlement did the user confirm a permanent deletement in i went to see the user in a panic i sat down at the desk ready to get at it of course i immediately see the fix and solve it with a mere two clicks but how he asks bemusement abound im sure it was gone i even clicked around as i left the room i paused turned and said you deleted the library the thing that points at it so my readers when issues happen and it gets in your head just remember users always lie even if they dont know it editspelling
working in a medical office were required to wipe all data off of a hard disk before we can dispose of it even though we access all our information through rdp so nothing is stored locally but whatever if i have to do it i may as well have some fun this is how i do to explain for nonmedical people yes thats an mri machine yes the disks are practically floating on a single corner no the oxygen tank is not magnetic as its designed to be used inside an mri room no i did not take my camera into the room but zoomed in from the doorway which explains the crappy quality yes the windows behind the machine are still shielded so there is no interference
so this happened quite some time ago so all of this is well behind me but it was quite nervewracking at the time i was and had taken a lowlevel tech support job at a local branch of massivecorporation for the summer before university my responsibilities were primarily for restructuring data files but i also helped out with basic software support for people that didnt want to bother raising a proper it support ticket word got around that i was a useful dogsbody and eventually id get calls about hardware issues as well usually just turn thing off and turn it back on again one day i get a call from alice from department id never met alice or even heard of department before i dont even have access to that floor but my number had somehow made it to her alice was an accountant a few floors above me but she had a frantic issue with one of the printers i start going through my usual troubleshooting spiel but she cuts me off and explains that it have been there and replaced the printer twice before and cant find any electrical fault she explains that shes getting electric shocks when she touches this printer and it happened with the previous two printers as well and it people must have wired it wrong and she cant go back to them and she cant use the printer and wants me to come fix it she seems very worked up i begin to suspect i know whats happening but i want to be sure so i ask her may i ask what sort of shoes are you currently wearing alice replies what and i repeat what sort of shoes but she just hangs up bit odd but i get back to my data files and quickly forget about it about two weeks later my boss comes to me furiously and tells me i have to attend a disciplinary meeting the next day and that i ought to spend the rest of the day packing up my stuff not that i had any and getting my files in order going into this meeting i have absolutely no idea what this is about i know that my data work was kinda slow but i didnt think it was that timesensitive im and this is first real job and im terrified my boss is there my boss boss bob is there and the head of hr bob goes through a long speech about how at massivecorporation they take sexual harassment in the workplace very seriously and that hr is going to interview all of my colleagues about me and that they expect me to fully comply with whatever action they deem necessary and how this might affect my university applications and future career i nervously stutter out that i have no idea what theyre talking about and the head of hr explains that this is about a lewd phonecall i still have no idea and my boss bursts out youre saying youve never called department i then finally remember alice and then explain that she called me about an issue with the printer hr asks if i recall making lewd remarks i say that i dont but i explain that i was asking about her shoes because i suspected that she was building up static charge insulated by her shoes if they had rubber soles or some such and she was discharging when she touched the printer and experiencing an electric shock my boss asks why shed called me rather than it and i explain the whole thing about how i help out with tech support sometimes they ask me to leave and talk amongst themselves i dont hear anything more about this for days ive not been told that ive been fired and im still being paid so i nervously turn up to work every day eventually i see a companywide email about it support policies reminding all employees that it support issues must be raised by the ticketing systems and that outside support will no longer be tolerated im only there for a few more weeks after and my boss acts as if nothing had ever happened and i never hear about it ever again edit ive had many years now to think about this it kinda shook me up for a long time afterwards even after i graduated i was worried that there was some sort of permanent file thatd crop up when i was applying for jobs and i havent really told anyone about this i maybe should have said it differently explained why i was asking about her shoes before i did or something i was never really angry with alice for the misunderstanding but i am kinda angry that there wasnt anyone in the meeting on my side i now work for a small company and im quite distrustful of layers of corporate hierarchy

part target trevor wanted for sabotage of enduser equipment history of terrible work and stupid questions objective terminate before end of shift time left minutes with the mission parameters clearly defined i get to work first step is to call the subcontractors batphone i could end this in minutes if i got ahold of the floor manager there and explain the situation of course nobody answers because it cant be that easy check his boss schedule been gone for well over an hour i could just send an email and let them sort it out tomorrow but that would fall short of the mission parameters sure theres the angry customer but mostly if you want to be an epic waste of my time i want the kill gt systems systems gt ubytewave hey again systems i got the info i needed this time i have a login for you trevor this subcontractor has voluntarily and repeatedly compromised the service of a enduser and its ongoing as youll see if you look at the logs you sent me cant reach their floor given a customer is affected by this right now can you shut down his station and disable his system and diagtools logins gt systems well yeah but i need a managers authorization gt ubytewave yeah well mine left i can fetch an entrylevel suitamptie if we must but this is timesensitive and youre the guy who sent me the evidence hours averaging manual resets per hour i listened to their call it was bad and he purposely avoided logging it in remedy before starting his resetvendetta this moron is done gt systems hey all you gotta say is that your manager approves and ill do it i just need a name to put in the file i was grateful but also a bit disappointed just need a name really no written authorization with systems this lax any halfdecent social engineer could have the building metaphorically collapsing on us in ten minutes if not the network gt systems alright this trevor is locked out how does this play out now if you didnt reach anyone over there gt ubytewave seems their management cant pick up their phone but i have other options all good hey systems gt systems lima charlie gt ubytewave whats your name gt systems gregory gt ubytewave thanks for your help gregory im adding you to my inhouse instant messenger if you need something from the tech senior line dont hesitate was a good deal we need them more often than they need us numbers and contact infos are one of the most precious weapons in my arsenal everyone has a list of phone numbers every department theyre supposed to interact with emergency contacts stuff like that i like to go deeper cellphone numbers of executives i have no reason to interact with directly just in case okay plenty of people like to collect that the number of every single security desk in every building we own or that works for us now thats not anywhere on the intranet gt ubytewave bytewave senior staff at isp this is a timesensitive call given we were unable to reach managers systems has just disabled access of one of your companys employees trevor we have hard evidence that trevor was repeatedly sabotaging a endusers equipment his ability to damage the network has already been contained on our end he will be fired in short order but for now its critical that you ensure no physical gt zealous underpaid security i get it going in now crap hats move never quite understood that thats military terminology for secondtier british parachutists extremely weird to hear that from an hired gun in canada but whatever works i guess and again grateful for unexpected cooperation but what the fuck teach the guards something about social engineering i wasnt even idd a random john doe with the number could have called this in within a minute their security was all over trevor im told he was calling systems from the lab to figure out what was wrong with his computer and that some security kid actually drew a taser on him thankfully didnt fire for zero reasons hey why not some guy we dont know told the boss he was a bad guy he was then temporarily taken to a secure room almost like they were all padding their resumes to apply for city police after this went down the floor manager was suddenly a lot more interested in answering the batphone gt floor manager but that cant be done without telling us first gt ubytewave when you dont answer your batphone and a customers service is being actively sabotaged looks like it can be done ill cc you on the report ill be sending to his manager mine and our subcontractor quality director itd be nice if we had a reply confirming termination before the latter sees it ah the sqd this guy is betrothed to his blackberry hell know all about this before everyone else given his title and his job his informal nickname is oxym because his title and his entire job description is an oxymoron and also rhymes with his first name the floor manager was immediately cooperative after he merely heard the title as usual its practically cheating almost done but i still had a guy on hold gt ubytewave hey thc you enjoyed your half hour break gt thc huh has it been that long gt ubytewave yep but thats alright problem was caused by the previous guy subcontractor was resetting the modem id say it was an half hour well spent hes being terminated we cant tell the customer that explain the minutes resets issue is solved with minimal details and schedule a service call for saturday am for the rf issue gt thc hah seriously he was doing it like on purpose gt ubytewave yep i know right you got to have absolutely zero professional ethics to work like that gt thc heh heh yeah thats fucked up alright i got the rest thanks for the assist see you man the story of the subcontractor who reset a modem times in hours and how he was ultimately effectively fired in a secure room before his manager even knew about it eventually became public knowledge within the company but thankfully the few who knew all the details never revealed my name i didnt want that kind of fame polarizing figures cant get anything done ultimately just a bucket of water in the sea but we take what victories we can get mission complete all of bytewaves tales on 
i was relatively new as a union representative at my telco i was sitting in a room where i was certain a union employee was getting fired the department director his manager a new manager the union vp the employee and myself were there the employees official sin was using company time to improve the intranet they had been on his ass for awhile because he did not meet their performance targets but it wasnt ill intent or lazyness the guy just had a hard time to strictly adhere to procedure and statistics if he believed he had a better way to do things and he did he spent a few hours rewriting code for the companys intranet and shared his results with many of his colleagues essentially creating a better shadow intranet union staff loved his work it was a clear step up over the crappy intranet we used back then but for his direct manager it was a great opportunity to pull the plug on a guy who didnt make the performance targets something they cant fire anybody for under our work contract by underlining he had spent employment time doing something not ordered to by management something they can fire you for gt director so we have ample evidence of misuse of company time the facts are not even in question as per the logs we are terminating employment on time theft grounds effective immediately as per the work contract the union is now free to voice objections if they believe there is cause to do so usually this is only something they say because they have to but that day the new manager in the room sekou was the first to speak he had nothing to do with the union and he was a relatively new corporate hire didnt even have his citizenship papers in canada yet a fresh immigrant from gabon africa he was hired by the corporation due to extensive experience both as a system administrator and a manager back in gabon but nobody truly noticed him until that day sekou was quiet and effective nobody had any problems with him back then management saw him as useful the union saw him as balanced and neutral gt sekou before we get to that we have to look at the improvements to the intranet three people on my team came out to say they made their work easier and more efficient and i agree i dont know why wed punish this employee for improving the gt director come with me sekou lets speak outside for a moment we never knew for sure what they spoke of outside but its pretty obvious if you dont toe the line and you are nonunion staff the hammer will fall down almost instantly the next day we knew he was leaving to pursue new challenges aka politely fired i was having lunch with the same union vp when our cellphones beeped with confirmation this was happening gt bytewave its not the first time he stood up for union staff he successfully argued before in front of the whole management team that multiple of their policies ensured workers could not reach the upper echelons of maslows clearly he had spent quite a bit of time studying the concept and cared about it deeply some union staff nicknamed sekou as maslow ever since the union vp was curious and so i explained at length sekou correctly believed the company was overly focused on productivity and that it harmed employees ability to have a balanced life and that it in turn damaged productivity thats extremely unusual for any manager to say aloud they typically always toe the line our conversation over lunch infuriated the union vp he wanted to save this guys job but he couldnt sekous resignation was already effective but with an important twist despite essentially firing the manager they agreed to give the employee who improved the intranet one last chance over his plea years later this employee is still with us thanks to the fact this manager spoke out but even without hindsight the union just couldnt let someone who lost their job over one of our own out in the cold the union immediately tried to get sekou a union job somehow but its not easy management retains the right to hire for a few days it seemed unlikely we could get him a job because hr would block moves through proper channels but the union doesnt always go through proper channels i suggested a few unorthodox possibilities and one stuck a few days later we came up with a potential solution gt vp are you sure they wont be able to tell gt bytewave no i cant he still has the same name just because wed be putting his curriculum vitae straight on top of hrs epile doesnt mean they wont figure out he was a manager a week ago but were not tied to it and he has nothing to lose and we know for a fact they dont do proper background checks right and they still dont sekous lightlyupdated and unionredacted cv was picked up by the company huge hr department and they gave him an interview for a union sysadmin position as opposed to his previous nonunion management position given his new union sysadmin job was in an entirely different city nobody immediately figured out the scheme after his extensive mandatory trial period was over and he had full union protection the story got around and everybody laughed their guts out sekou is currently one of the better sysadmins we have over at networks and the top contact my department technical supports senior stafftsss has over there union staff learned the story and he has had a nickname ever since maslow all of bytewaves tales on

im the it manager for my company system administrator well im the sole it guy for my company and im responsible for pretty much everything that plugs into an outlet or runs on battery needless to say im busy several days ago i had one of our head salesmen approach me regarding one of an inhouse program we hand out to customers that essentially spits out assembly specs for different things we make and sell its not too complicated but it was written by one of the previous it guys about years ago so there is no support for it this program needed to be updated to include new parts and specs for existing parts but modification was password locked by the creator apparently this has been a growing concern for months but nobody bothered to tell me about it until friday afternoon at this point it was top priority and required me to put other projects on the back burner sales hey zero we have this program and its password locked can you get into it me i can physically open the program yes i dont know what the password is though and theres no documentation of it anywhere sales cant you like do some hacker shit with a password cracker program from the internet or something me no but ill see what i can do as i started looking into it i realized i had no idea how this application was written aside from the exe basically every other file extension was some obscure file type i wasnt familiar with it ended up being written with pellesc after days of intermittently trying to figure out how to get past the password lock i finally posted the application and my issue in rtechsupport after cross referencing to the guys in rreverseengineering it only took hours before someone had successfully modified the application to allow me past the password screen i know it was something simple but i dont code in c so it was beyond me told the boss that i called in a favor with some people i know which made me look great and earned me some brownie points sales was happy boss was happy and i was happy thats how reddit helped me do my job thanks guys i owe you a beer

this reminded me of something similar that happened at my last job it too involved shared files it too involved failure to understand the word off surprisingly it also involved people using the shared drive like they were supposed to seriously though most people there were reasonably competent most of the time you only hear about it when they werent one day one of our nas servers had to go down for some reason whatever reason that was also meant it had to go down in the middle of the work day which was highly unusual systems guy was usually much better about that sort of thing so heres how it went down gt event minus one week flurry of emails between everyone in tech confirming that this has to happen this way event minus three days email warning goes out to everyone affected and then some email follows our normal downtime notice template which goes something like gt scheduled downtime the nas in the suchandsuch office will be down on date from time to time for scheduled maintenance this change means that the foo drive will be inaccessible this change will affect larry moe and curly teams because the bar baz moo folders will be inaccessible insincereapologies ctorubberstamp event minus three days the evening replyall bomb ensues in all its glory everything you could possibly expect from a replyall bomb happened the responses come in fast and furious for several hours then slow to a trickle which continues until event plus minutes tickets begin flowing in from people complaining that the files are down tldr we all know that i acknowledge i have read and agree to doesnt mean shit edit added detail for additional cringe
hello again since working at a tier support desk last summer ive moved on to a saturday job at a small computer repair place even though its not paid very well i enjoy working there i get along with my colleague pretty well my expertise is appreciated there and most of the time its pretty quiet my boss is a bit of an odd character though often overselling our services or being notvery honest to get a sale yes your computer is definitely dead but i can give you an offer on a replacement after coming in yesterday and solving their internet outage that had been ongoing for two days in under an hour they had replaced their router while the fault lied at an unmanaged switch which had been connected to itself because of poor cable management my boss pointed me in the direction of a printer gt me uhm what do you want me to do with this im not a printer tech in shape or form im a networkinglinux guy mainly gt boss the heads need to be cleaned its printing bad gt me surely you cant expect us to put hours of work in a cheap retail printer gt boss its easy just google it and so i did i found a video for disassembling a similar but not quite identical printer after about half an hour of mangling ribbon cables i had managed to disassemble the head and i had the offending part in my hands using a combination of a syringe lukewarm water and a general sense of confusion about the whole ordeal i cleaned the part while making a very artistic ink pattern on the walls of the kitchen area and my shirt there it was done or so i thought reassembling the printer proved to be much more difficult since some of the ribbon cables i pulled some unnecessarily proved very difficult if not impossible to reconnect and also very flimsy after trimming some plastic parts with some pliers and hiding the plastic shards to gain access at the connectors i had a sense of relief the printer was in one part and then i pressed the power button the printer screamed at me like an abomination from hell and had a very cryptic error message on its screen prompting me powercycle it which didnt help after pulling all the ribbon cables and reconnecting them with the same result i was at a loss gt boss well youll have to reassemble it again gt me i just did that gt boss no matter shortly after that my boss left the shop so i promptly made a crossgesture in the air with my thumb to declare it dead and put it back on the shelve where i found it im glad i dont have to break the news to the customer then again it was probably time for a new one anyways tldr was told to fix a printer i am not a printer tech the printer is now dead

so at my current job i am discovering that one employee is going to be something of a reoccurring thorn she claims to have come from another company where she used to work in the it department and loves to question my every action here are a few short stories from the past couple of weeks ticket he avellion my printer hasnt been working this morning can you come take a look i walk over to the office to find her there with the person who has a problem me so a printer isnt working her i already looked at it for you you need to order a new one for her me interesting i spend a minute or two checking all the connections to make sure nothing is loose her i already checked that i crouch down under her desk and see the breaker on the isobar under the desk has been tripped i flip it off and back on and then the printer starts up fine i smile and go back to my office a few days later and another printer is making really horrible noises and not printing she is waiting there again her when are you going to replace these printers me when they need to be replaced i open the tray to see some paper caught in the rollers clear the jam a little wd and the printer works fine her this wouldnt be a problem in my old office they listened to me and replaced all the old equipment me i think these old girls still have some life in them about an hour ago i get a ticket from her saying that the company programs have stopped working me what seems to be the problem her these crappy dells you buy cant run our systems me alright can i see your mouse for a moment i sit down and immediately notice something is wrong me is this windows her yeah is out of date and i decided to update my computer since you wont do it me i see you do know that our tools are developed internally and they only work on win yes her win is out of date you need to update the office i know i used to do your job at my old office i ended up taking her computer and am currently letting it do a slow format while i drink my afternoon coffee she has been in a private meeting with the gm who was rather upset about the situation when i told him what happened after i walked past his office with a pc tower under my arm edit for formatting update for all the people saying i need to lock down her computer ect dont worry i have update of the update alright sorry it took so long but i got stuck on the phone with a certain cellphone provider for hours you know because thats how long it takes to transfer the number from an old cell phone to a new one the excess of crappy hold music also left me in something of a fey mood so after i finished placing our image onto the troublemaker pc i locked her out of booting from anything other than the hard drive from the bios and then password locked the bios to keep her out of it i also changed her access level on the company web filter normally neither i nor the office managers care if people are on facebook ebay amazon twitter ect so long as they get their work done but technically it policy says they shouldnt be able to unless they are managers im currently working on a script that will run on start up that will pop up a message with a copy pasted text of the company ip policy concerning modification of equipment without the consent of it think of it like the fbi notice at the beginning of home movies for those surprised to find out she isnt fired the gm decided to give her a second chance but if she screws up again he is going to boot her out i dont want one bad apple to give a bad impression of the office everyone else here is great and easy to work with 
worked for a hosting company back in the day tier techs took front line callstier helped tier with front line calls on occasion but mostly handled escalations and more technical cases beyond tier capabilities and tier were like baby admins with root access helping tiers amp i was a tier tech getting assistance from a few tier and friends to start learning some more advanced stuff so i could apply for a tier position while talking to a tier tech about something new to me i think we were talking about raid but i dont remember some doofus tier guy keeps interjecting with stuff trying to help me learn i looked to tier t who discreetly shook his head no t whispers just ignore him giddypanda is he wrong t he is literally the last person you should ever ask for help from giddypanda really hes a tier though so he should know more than i do t he only got that position through stupidmanager hes completely unqualified stupidmanager actually wanted to promote him straight to tier but the admins wouldnt allow him anywhere near a server and give him root access giddypanda that bad huh t yeah giddypanda what did he do to get on their bad side t oh lots of stupid things like one time a server was running slow so he told them to kill apache because it was hogging resources he was totally serious so hes permabanned from being promoted anywhere hes stuck where he is forever edit for the web hosting layman telling a sysadmin to kill apache for taking up lots of resources is like telling a mechanic to remove a cars engine because its hogging gas without the engine it wont go and people pay lots of money for it to go fast
back in the days of big iron a modest sized computer was the size of refrigerators the expansion cabinet was another refrigerators and each disk in the farm was the size of a small washing machine they were large and there were a lot of parts lots and lots of parts boards and cables and more cables and all sorts of bits and pieces here is a pic for your viewing pleasure the it department and back then the term it had not been coined it was the computer department bought one of these modest sized monsters now this was a major purchase and had to approved by several people including the vice president of engineering better known as the mad dutchman now dutch was the type of guy who added value to the organization by cutting costs as opposed to generating new revenue he was a bean counter extraordinaire this purchase was no exception when purchasing one of these monsters the manufacturer would send you a quote listing out all the components and the price of each component dutch carefully perused many pages of the quote and started crossing out items he considered noncritical such as the console terminal and keyboard hey we can reuse one in house right and he crossed out cables to connect the cpu cabinet to the peripherals cabinet cables to connect the peripherals cabinet to the disk drives cables to connect everything else together i mean theyre just cables we can have our hardware techs make our own cables right of course we can were engineers we can do anything and wow look i saved on a order i am a financial genius so without having the computer department do one final check on the items being ordered and really why would you have technical people review technical decisions made by a guy who isnt technical the order goes out and the manufacturer ships the equipment exactly as specified on the hacked up quote and the equipment arrives and is placed in the computer room and field service comes on site to do the installation but then field service starts asking questions like where are the data cables for the disk drives where are the bus cables from the cpu to the peripherals on and on all these pesky little missing cables proprietaryonlymadebythemanufacturer cables someone investigates and discovers dutchs dastardly deed ok so everything will be delayed for another month or two while a new purchase order gets generated and approved to order the cables or so they think you see these cables are not normally sold separately they are sold as part of a package a package that includes a computer there are no ordering numbers for these cables there is no way to tell manufacturing hey just send us a few parts no one can figure out how to sell us these parts and just these parts and no doing a mirror of the quote with all the delivered parts crossed out isnt going to work so the computer sat in the computer room unpowered for months while this snafu was unsnarled if we look at this in terms of engineering man hours lost months is weeks one week is hours there were about engineers who were going to use the machine and figure that back then one engineering man hour was worth about so about lost man hours plus a paperweight maybe i should have called this cables we dont need no stinking cables

user called with some rather strange logic today gtive been getting a fan error for the past couple of days but my temporary fix no longer works and my computer doesnt turn on anymore i ask the user what he has done to his computer to fix the issue assuming that he has been using compressed air to blow out his laptop or something likewise gtwell since heat is a good thing for computers i decided to use my wifes old hair dryer to help the fan error i used that aluminum duct work tape and attached the hair dryer to the laptop so it wouldnt burn my fingers but it would blow the nice hot air into the computer and provide good dust removal while attempting to not be a condescending jerk to this guy i calmly explain that he needs to remove the hair dryer and tape and this should not be done in the future as heat can greatly reduce the life of electronics then explain to him that i will assign a ticket to his deskside group to come pick up the laptop so they can assess the laptop next time dude just call tech support you probably ruined that computer thanks bud 
this even got me baffled so worth the share i think call from a user gtuser hi matvalicious for some reason i am unable to draganddrop emails into my archives anymore gtmatvalicous thats pretty odd let me take over your computer for a sec i suspected a faulty mouse or something but to my surprise i wasnt even able to do it remotely gtmatvalicous ok whats going on here let me do another test and try to drag an icon across your desktop to my surprise we were unable to drag any icon anywhere gtmatvalicous well user im flabbergasted let me google that real quick ok try the following click and hold any icon on your desktop and while doing so press escape gtuser hey it works again thanks matvalicious dear diary til click hold and escape is a shortcut to disable the drag function edit the system was a windows x enterprise two of my colleagues tested it and it worked with only one of them worked on me as well also his escape wasnt stuck google drag not working windows and you will find multiple people with this issue on microsoft forums and the suggested fix
howdy tfts first time poster i work in software development while not specifically it it does land me in doing it related things because i know computers this sadly isnt one of those times this story starts a few years ago i was in charge of an app for a certain client this app was installed on scanner devices to allow our client to keep track of their stock basically every box bag drum barrel and basket in their warehouses had a sticker with a bar code on it you scan it into our app and it fetches the relevant data from the database wherewhen it was produced how much of it is there is it reserved etc and allows a few basic operations from the app mostly marking stuff in the database its around june and our client puts in a request to redevelop our app so they can do their endofyear inventory with it this involved allowing the peons regular worker folk to directly mess with the data concerning quantity of stock something we strictly control and is otherwise almost entirely automated good times fast forward to those awful few days between christmas break and new years the app has long since been updated and the peons were finishing up their jobs i was investigating a bug with the way we visualize this particular data and i run across something strange the bad kind of strange a few hours of juggling emails while digging through the database and logs the following sequence of events becomes clear gt peon p scans the identification sticker of a box and it decodes it as box gt p is then prompted to enter how many packets of nails are in box gt p scans the sticker again and to his dismay nothing happens gt p calls over senior peon sp for help and explains the scanner isnt working gt sp tells p to manually enter the box code if the scanning device cant read it gt p enters into the packets of nails field and clicks ok gt p sees a warning popup the developer specifically put in to prevent this scenario begging the user to doublecheck their input before proceeding gt p is fresh out of amps to give and clicks accept gt system now thinks box has packets of nails instead of the actually accurate gt p continues on his merry way repeating the process for the next minutes royally screwing up months worth of records gt unwitting developer stumbles onto this mess completely by accident and now has to spend days cleaning it up tldr theres a reason access to data is limited edit to the people pointing out this should have been a twostep process i agree completely unfortunately management deemed that notion too disruptive to the workflow
 a little background first i am a manager at a security company we basically install security cameras in households or small businesses and if they so desire and are willing to pay keep a remote database of their video footage for them all our software is home made and we need technicians to maintain the code networks hardware etc two months ago we hired an intern at the company he had a lot of trouble finding his way around the code and maintaining it so we tried him out in customer service instead thing is when you are in customer service you become for a lack of a better term the face of the company you work at other than your relatives no one knows you work at x company if you do only background work the first contact one day intern meets his uncle on the phone while he was shopping for a security system uncle decides it would be a great idea to tell interns aunt about the fact that her nephew intern is working at a tech support company which we are not the next day aunt shows up at our front desk thing is internship at the company isnt a small deal for us since were a small business interns dont do exclusively a single job we try to make them do a bit of everything until they find what theyre good at andor enjoy doing and take a full time job intern was mostly busy learning how to maintain the software at the time he wasnt doing customer support all day a aunt m me gt a hi id like to see my nephew i believe he can help me fix my tablet gt m intern is busy working hes not doing customer service at the moment gt a well id like to see him anyways hes certainly not chained in the basement is he gt m ill go get your nephew just for this time but please be quick hes very busy at the moment aunt proceeds to explain the multiple problems she has with her tablet to intern while i go back to work feed a man a fish aunt came back or days later but now for a computer problem i have no idea why but because we were good with computers she thought she was entitled to free tech support since her nephew wasnt there i think one of intern decided to step in and help her out of misery big mistake this reinforced her beliefs that we would always help her out nephew or not i wasnt too concerned at the time i thought this was most likely be a one time thing she comes we help her we never see her again except it wasnt the case she came back maybe one or two weeks later with a problem with her printer if i recall correctly since it was around the last days of interns internship a bit redundant eh he decided to help her out one last time out of generosity honorable thing but huge mistake here again he plugs the printer finds the issue in minutes says goodbye and goes back to his job a few days time later the internship ends and since intern is still in trade school hes not going to be taking a full time job any time soon isnt it my personal tech support a few weeks later aunt comes back for more tech support while i try to politely decline since you know her nephew doesnt work here anymore she asks to see goodguy the employee that helped her with her computer problems when intern wasnt there while i agree this might be my fault for agreeing to this but believe me i didnt think this would become what it became i tried to convince goodguy that he shouldnt feed the troll and let her be he insisted to help her i try not to worry too much and let it pass once again aunt comes back the next day to complain about goodguys help a aunt g goodguy gt a goodguy helped me with my tablet yesterday he didnt fix the problem its still happening it wouldnt have happened if my nephew fixed it gt g ill try to find the issue and fix it but i cant guarantee anything gt a you see this is the thing you dont want to help me you just want to get rid of me gt g not at all i willingly left my break to come and help you gt a no you did not you left your boringass job thats what you did you could see goodguy was really starting to get pissed but didnt do anything because you know hes a goodguy after a few minutes finds the issue fixes it gives back the tablet to aunt and she goes away angrily later that day aunt comes back with her husband uncle our actual customer a aunt u uncle m me gt u my wife told me you didnt treat her accordingly gt m sir have my most sincere apologies but we can only supply tech support for things related to our product anything else isnt in our contract nor valuable of our time to deal with gt a you see this is the problem right here intern actually enjoys his job enough to take the time and help me while your employees just do it to get rid of me gt m thats exactly it maam no one here enjoys helping someone they dont know and waste the companys time absolutely for free gt a but my nephew enjoyed helping me why isnt he here gt m your nephew doesnt work here anymore maam he gt a why did you fire him gt m we did no gt a why did you fire my nephew he is a hard worker he is the best in the domain and he is willing to do everything to fix my problems which your employees are obviously not competent at you just fired what wouldve been your best employee gt u following his wifes tantrum if you fire my nephew you lose me as a customer no nephew no business gt a if you do not call him immediately to hire him back youll lose us as customers gt m maam this is not possible to hire him back gt u well thats too bad you just lost some very loyal customers they both left and never came back i never got the chance to explain why their nephew wasnt fired but actually hired since he signed a contract with us that we would grant him a job as soon as he finishes studying as long as he maintains a good average with his grades oh well cant say im too sad about losing them both edit typos
sorry for any formatting errors i am a long time lurker and had to create an account to share this with you second day of work and was receiving an error message for this story it is important to note our it guys are in the same office and their pod is about feet away from my desk me hey paul it guru im receiving this error message i tried to restart my computer and got the same message i tried googling it but still dont understand what its asking me how do i enter a ticket for your queue paul if youve done both of those things you dont enter a ticket into the queue i will work on it right now by the way i think i like you off to a good relationship i think
i was enjoying my morning it was a quiet one i was going over backups and running quick random file restores everything was going great until gthelp ticket gtgt my computer ate my keybadge and i cant leave to go to lunch until i get it back or replaced this was a rather confusing help ticket since we dont have keybadges and her computer shouldnt have been able to eat something that doesnt exist i decide to go see what she has lost in her computer i head up to her office gt me heya lady what exactly did you computer do your help ticket didnt make a lot of sense to me what do you mean it ate your keybadge gt lady what do you mean thats what happened i showed my computer the keybadge the computer took it and now it wont give it back gt me im not aware of any keybadges what are you talking about how did your computer eat it she looks at me like im an idiot and to be honest i felt a little dumb for not knowing what she was talking about then she pointed at my id badge gt lady there youre wearing a keybadge thats what the computer took i look at where my id badge is hanging off a csi lanyard and look back up at her even more confused gt me this is an id badge its got nothing to do with keys how did you give it to your computer how did your computer eat your id badge she scoffs at me and tosses up her arms then mutters something about me being dense the she points under her desk at something i lean over and see her computer gt lady just like every morning i come in and turn on my computer i eject the badge reader and i put in my keybadge so i can log in to the computer without setting off any alarms i ask her to show me the keybadge reader she reaches down and pushes the eject button on the dvdrom drive the tray slides out a little bit then hangs and goes back into the computer gt me oh ok i see what happened let me get to the computer i reach down and eject the dvdrom drive and grab it as it opens it whirs and tries to close but i dont let it i lean over and see a flat laminated card in the drive i slide in a letter opener and the card pops down then the tray comes completely out of the drive she claps and does a little happy hop then holds out her hand for her keybadge i close then reopen the drive a few times and it seems to be ok ill have to send someone around to test it before she actually needs it i get up and i start to let her know its not a keybadge but i decide i dont want to try that fight and go a different route gt me you dont have to put it in the computer every morning anymore just lay it on top of the computer or hang it on the side of the monitor ok gt lady wow really when did it change gt me its always worked like that i just think someone forgot to inform you we havent had to put them in the computer for years i shake my head then head to my office and close the ticket a few minutes later i get another one from her about removing the keybadge reader i close it out with gtgt keybadge readers have been converted to audio cd players but you have to get approval from your manager to listen to music at your desk about an hour later her manager comes around asking where his keybadge is and if his reader plays audio cds too 
so this story happened a few years ago but i recently remembered it and felt like sharing i was working for an instore tech support service at the time for the most part we were supposed to try a quick troubleshoot at the counter and then check in the unit for further repairs however that being said our prices werent that great not that i could change that so it wasnt easy for everyone to put up the money for repairs depending on how nice a person was we might sometimes give them some more time and maybe some service at the counter if it was simple enough fix one day a nice older lady came in with a year old laptop vista with a couple minor issues i dont really remember the extent of it but one the final issues was a bit harder and we ended up getting about of us working together to get it fixed when it finally worked she starting getting sad and asked me how much she owed me and i declined saying it was no charge heck we probably gained more from learning how to fix the issue for future times it occurs she was very thankful and got all our names so she could let our manager know overall it was a great experience now for the good part the next day im working again and i see her walking in again but this time with a big bag full of something i get worried that maybe the issue had come back or she was bringing in more stuff for us to fix nope turns out she was bringing us bbq pulled pork thank god for carolina bbq and peach cobbler she told us to have at it and shed be back in a few days for the dishes we all thanked her and dove in during our lunch breaks man it was good the best part was a manager from another part of the store came back and saw we had this and tried to say we were not supposed to accept that another coworker said it was fine and not to worry she responded back but what if it was poisoned at which point my manager turns and says well were not dead yet are we we had a laugh while she went off in a huff goddamn was that some good food
as i wait for an email from the big boss i wondered if all jobs are this worrying probably thirty seconds after i had put down the phone gtnew message gt airz head of security and it has alerted me to the theft of a rack i have told him to do nothing the boss i took a sip of my coffee it tasted calmer it tasted like instant i hate instant a knock sounded on the door i looked up and it was one of the night shift it members gtnightit hey so remember level three was having connection issues about an hour or two ago gtme oh yes gtnightit theyve still got them the words shook me down to the core i had almost forgotten about the users what was i becoming gtme right yes theyre missing a switch in comms room on level three can you go find an older switch and patch them up till we can get some new gear in gtnightit sorry they are missing a gtme switch look dont worry about it not important the nightit looked at me a little suspiciously gtnightit okay but could i get that in writing i almost chuckled and forwarded him the email the boss sent to me nightit went off to fix the switching whilst i found the box of locks that the vp had forced me to order they hadnt been installed yet mostly because the install order kept getting lost before it found its way to maintenance i needed a drill maintenance had a drill i walked down to maintenance and found it was deserted and the door to the tools was locked would security have a key security did not have a key only maintenance people had keys and all maintenance people go home early especially on friday as i walked back to the it department disheartened i dream of an easier job brain surgeon perhaps when i arrived at the it department i wondered if the small drill we kept around it would get through the door i dismissed it immediately we didnt have the drill bits lost in thought i practically walked into the sales manager who was standing in it gtme sorry i was in another world gtsales airz there you are the big boss sent me down here gtme its late on friday why arent you at home gtsales the big boss sent me down here he said youd be amenable to giving up a box of keyboards gtme sorry what gtsales i need another box of keyboards gtme its been a fortnight how gtsales the big boss said youd need the key to the maintenance tool room so ill trade you one box of keyboards for the maintenance tool room key oh and one added extra i looked down at my hands no coffee not even instant coffee was this fast gtme whats the extra the sales manager looked down at my desk where a box of locks was sitting gtsales dont install the lock on the second floor break room do all the others just not the second floor gtme what i looked down at the box then it hit me gtme oh no no no i just need to catch a rat gtsales im not sure we have any rat traps gtme hahaha dont worry youve got yourself a deal on one condition you owe me gtsales i owe you for keyboards gtme its been a terrible financial strain only a small favor gtsales whats the favor gtme nothing too big so deal the sales manager looked hesitant gtme cant do many sales without a keyboard gtsales fine deal the sales manager handed me the key to the storeroom i installed a lock on the door after nightit had fixed the switching situation inside i went down to the office and picked up my coffee allies in hand it felt better coffee is a good ally i took a sip tasted like the start of somethingsomethingbig 
this happened about a month ago this womens laptop kept wigging out in her words sometimes it wouldnt boot up sometimes she would be working and things would start typing randomly it couldnt be explained i thought okay maybe her keyboard on her laptop is getting a key stuck replaced the keyboard same issue sometimes it would be fine other times you couldnt get the thing to bootup without beeping constantly on one foggy morning though i stopped by her office while her backpack was opened and behold a wireless keyboard in her backpack turns out she would use it from time to time along with her wireless mouse oyi i bet she felt dumb
i work the night shift as a support specialist for a fairly large healthcare system in my state nights are usually slow and we dont get a lot of calls except to change passwords or unlock user accounts tonight that changed mehi this manimality in it can i get your name please user gives me his name me sir it doesnt look like youre in our system have you called in with an issue before userno i dont think i have and my issue might be a little weird methats fine well do what we can to help you userwell this girl and i were having sex a bit ago and the condom came off likein her mesir this is the it department we handle computer related issues for the hospitals and their clinics you should really try calling the emergency department userwell i tried to google it and cant find any help on my computer methis is still a medical issue and you should really call the ed to get some help userok can you give me that number and so ended my conversation with this guy ive been working here for a little over a month now and this is really my first brush with holy shit did that just happen hope you guys enjoyed it as much as my coworker and i did 
now a short disclaimer this information went through two technical people before coming to me so i may have gotten some bad information at my previous job i was responsible for managing a large number of laptops out in the field basically they would come in i would reimage them and send them back out as needed sadly the guy i replaced was bad at managing his images so we had four laptop models and all the images were in terrible condition half the laptops would come back because for some reason something didnt work right so i set about redoing the images and got two of the four models reimaged the field supervisors thought i was the greatest thing ever and told me their emergencies had been cut in half in the short time i had been working there they were sleeping better there was less downtime and i had gotten everything so efficient i was able to reimage any number of computers that came in and get them back out the same day well something important to note was that they had a multiinstall key for microsoft office they refused to give me the key and one of our images that i hadnt gotten to fixing didnt have the right key well we had to send out this laptop and had no extras to send in its place originally it was going out in a month but the next day it got bumped up to the end of the week and later that day to in two hours i needed the key the head of it wouldnt get back to me so i used a tool pcaudit to pull the registry information and obtain the corporate key one threat assessment later i was let go its a shame too i really really liked that job
this happened around the company i worked for was a vendor for large corporations i worked on a team that provided server administration for one particular customer it was the policy of the customer and probably every other than when file servers ran out of space we were to delete all audiovideo media file types we usually had few angry phone calls come our way when we cleared space one particular incident got so heated and just down right nasty that the customers senior vp of it gave us his mobile number afterwards and told us to escalate these calls directly to him as it turned out i received the very next irate phone call of someone looking for his missing mp collection the guy on the phone was beyond deranged he was barely coherent his rage was so great i popped up the vps phone put the user on hold and called him up informed him of the situation he had me to conference him in to the phone call which i did the second i got back on the line with the end user he flew into another rage that was even worse than before the vp sat silent when suddenly the raging end user stopped and stated an instant message popped up on his screen and it was more important than me then i heard the customers hold music come on the vp stated he got an im from me hang on just a second canopyflyer sorry for wasting your time i just replied that i was here for as long as he needed me at that moment i really needed a large bag of popcorn screw that i wanted the biggest bag of popcorn in the history of humankind the end user came back on the vp then proceeded with one of the best even toned dress downs i have ever heard the end user was sobbing seconds into it i received an apology and then the call ended about two weeks later i traveled to the customers headquarters along with of my coworkers this was a normal trip we usually visited once a quarter during normal times or much more than that during roll outs and projects the vp took us out to dinner while there he handed me a name plate the type that you put on an office door it had the users name and former title on it the vp smiled and told me its yours tldr were sorry the number you have dialed has gotten you fired 
this isnt strictly a tech support story but i figured it would be enjoyed here first a small bit of backstory i am a regular member at my local hackerspace where we keep a rather large supply of pc parts most of them fairly dated about months before the story i picked up an old wd to use on my pi until i could get my tb drive back from western digital amazing customer support by the way due to various reasons yay ap tests i didnt even look at it for a few months i was working on setting up raspbmc on my pi so i could use it to store movies and tv shows from my dvd collection once i had the software up and running i realized i needed something to use as storage thats when i remembered i had the drive tucked deep into the narnia that is my desk drawer i plugged it into my home pc to figure out what filesystem it was using so i could reformat it thats when i saw the files the drive was nearly full out of idle curiosity i dug around a little bit in some of the folders the previous owner left a massive amount of personal info on the drive there was insurance info tax data addresses even bank account info i figured that since this drive was left at my workshop it must belong to a memberprevious member so i began searching our forums and wiki for the names i found on the drive i found nothing i couldnt find any info on the internet about this person after a few days i started looking again on the drive for more info this time around i found some chat logs and based on the date i assumed they were irc logs with nothing more than a few nicks and channel names i set off to search the internet again i tried every irc network i could think of i trawled the internet and searched every irc network that had those channels i found nothing finally after a week i was ready to give up and just wipe the drive i decided to give it one more try finally i found him hed thankfully for me been using the same irc nick for almost years most of the logs were dated late s early s heres a chat log ive changed the names and whatnot obviously irssi starting query in ircnetworkgoeshere with driveguy ltmegt we need to talk ltmegt trying to find the owner of a hd i found ltmegt i think it may be yours are you insert name here ltdriveguygt hd ltdriveguygt who ltmegt hmm ltdriveguygt oh fuck ltdriveguygt a hard drive ltmegt what ltmegt yep ltdriveguygt shit ltdriveguygt i bet one i donated ltmegt yep ltdriveguygt im doxed eh ltmegt no ltmegt i dont intend to do that at all ltmegt i was actually going to try and return it ltdriveguygt jesus ltdriveguygt thank you ltdriveguygt how did you find me ltmegt well ltmegt irc logs ltmegt a few screenshots ltmegt and some documents ltmegt zero your drives dud ltmegt dude ltdriveguygt i thought did ltmegt if literally anyone else got this you would be toast ltdriveguygt sounds like i got rid of a drive i didnt intend to ltdriveguygt ltdriveguygt fuck ltmegt well do you still live in the hometown area ltdriveguygt i moved to florida for work ltdriveguygt but ltdriveguygt i can have my best friend pick it up ltdriveguygt i am fucking endebted ltdriveguygt what would you like ltdriveguygt seriously ltmegt ltdriveguygt you deserve something for being a good human being ltdriveguygt i could have been owned ltmegt i wouldnt even know what to ask for ltdriveguygt do you need a job ltmegt i think im a little young for you to hire me turns out he used to be a hacker now he works for a security company and now ive got tickets to an epic security conference next year he wouldnt let not accept something in return for returning the drive tldr found an hd and using year old data tracked down the owner and returned it

im sure this happens to all tech support technicians but there is nothing i find more frustrating than being blamed for anything that has a plug going wrong in the months after i work on a site prime example last month we deployed avg cloud care dont judge me not my call to a small business of about machines and a file server a week or so after cust ever since you played on our pcs our printer hasnt worked me sorry to hear that sir are we talking about the hp laserjet in the corner cust no the brother printer me puzzled i dont remember selling them a brother printer ok and when you say its not working whats actually happening cust my customers are sending faxes and nothings coming out me ahh so this is your fax machine not a printer cust same thing me a little sarcastically yes yes but is the fax machine connected to your pc or even the network a short conversation establishes that no it isnt cust so youre saying its all just a mighty coincidence convenient that me well could i get you to go and have a look at the fax machine and read out what it says on the display you can see where this is going in this case it was a paper jam the single most annoying thing is that you hang up knowing that despite all reason and logic they are still blaming you for it happening and will still be bitching about our services to anyone who will listen
good morning or afternoon or evening my fellow it brethren this is my first tale here so ill keep it short and sweet i am fairly new to my it career and most of it has been at generic msp managed service provider monthly cost for it support for companies that dont want internal it company genm one of our newer clients at the time was a group of dental offices mainly running an evergreen project to upgrade workstations and deal with a few networking issues as they came in until this call i received one afternoon gtme genm this is noremac speaking how may i help you today gtuser hi this is user from dentaloffice our xray machine is not working gtme what seems to be the issue is the workstation not receiving the images gtuser no its not taking pictures gtme have you tried calling the vendor gtuser no we havent we figured since youre our new it service that you would be able to fix it gtme unfortunately this piece of machinery is out of our area of service so youll need to contact your vendor for support overall it was a pleasant conversation but i dont think the owner would be very happy if some random it people started fooling around with a very expensive integral machine in their operation tldr user drives airplane to local mechanic edit added a description for msp

i might have to post this on rtalesfromretail as well as here since i was working as a computer tech in a retail store at the time of the incident i had a customer in probably his mid s bring in a computer that was having problems booting up the machine was about years old and had obviously not had extreme care given as soon as i looked at the computer and saw all of the symptoms for myself i knew is was a hard drive failing i called the customer to give him the diagnosis and some options for repair as well as prices he then asked me if i could recover any of his music because it was apparently the only thing he used his computer for i asked if he had ever made a backup he said no of course i then told him that our data recovery service was additional to the general laptop repair he just couldnt fathom that i would charge him more just to recover his precious music this was when i knew he was going to be trouble i tried to explain what went on with a data recovery and how long it took and why it took so many man hours i also explained to him that if we werent able to recover the data that there would be no charge he wasnt buying it i told him that if he wanted the new drive put in and a new system installed that i could do that while he was deciding about the data recovery he balked at the price again ugh essentially he tried to tell me that i was trying to rob him and that he could get it done any number of places for cheaper i as politely as i could told him he was welcome to call around and check and i would wait for him to call back about an hour later he calls back and in a very defeated tone he said go ahead and do it he also authorized the data recovery i replaced the drive and started the data recovery i worked myself to death trying to recover that data all of his documents movies music etc were recovered i was so proud of myself it took much longer than i expected so i decided to knock off some of the labor price from the data recovery as a gesture of good will i worked for a small business and we really needed repeat customers so i was authorized to do so this is where the story gets stupid the man comes in to pick up his computer with all his recovered data he understandably wanted to look the computer over before he paid for it so hes looking through all his music and seems fairly pleased then he says why doesnt my toolbar look the same i explained to him that that was one thing that seemed too corrupted to retrieve was some of his user account data so i had to create a new account and his dock wouldnt look the same he flipped shit started yelling at me and stuff he was screaming in the store this is a fg ripoff or youre a bunch of mf scam artists then the jumps toward the counter waving his hands at me and grabs all of his stuff and runs to the door the computer with the new drive the old drive and all the recovered data all i could say was sir if youll stop yelling in the showroom well figure this out he kept yelling finally i warned him twice that if he stepped one foot out the door that i would have to report the theft and that we have cameras recording in our store at all times and that i would have multiple ways to prove he didnt pay he then starts shouting well then sue me youll have to fg sue me you bunch of liars and then walks out the door and gets in his car to drive away i told one of my coworkers to call the police and stepped outside to take a photo of his license plate what this gentleman didnt understand was that when he dropped the computer off we required multiple kinds of contact info so we had his name phone number email address and street address i had the serial number for the machine the drive and now i had his license plate number the police came and took a statement from my coworker and i then called the owner of the store and asked what he wanted to do the pd was really helpful they told us that they were allowed to press charges on behalf of us for theft of goods and services im not sure what happened to the guy but i understand that the police went to his million dollar home yes this guy lived in a very nice country club neighborhood and took him in in front of all of his neighbors we did get all of our money for the repair but im not sure if any other damages were paid that was in the top most stressful days of my life 
most people ask us to do things for them but some people like the diy route and would rather just borrow the tools one such guy came in and borrowed a phillips screwdriver i gave him the size and asked if it would work he said yes then he came back and asked to borrow some solder and use a soldering station but what kind of solder does he need imagine that he doesnt know he leaves to find out he is unable to figure it out and asks for regular i wasnt in the mood to explain how that works so i just gave him whatever reel was closest he then returns later and says it must have been wrong because it doest stick he wants to know if we have other kinds i say that different kinds are for different purposes assuming that this time he would go off and research and come back with an idea he came back with a laptop and asked what kind of solder do i need for this screw and pointed to a screw on the bottom it turns out that he wanted to replace the hard drive in his laptop rather than ask for help he decided to diy it and ask for the screwdriver but the phillips was too large rather than ask for a smaller screwdriver he decided to ask for solder his plan was to apply the solder to the screw and jam the screwdriver into it while it was still hot then let it cool then he would remove the screw because in this magical world the solder would stick and turning the solder would turn the screw voila of course this wasnt working for him so we got the appropriate screwdriver size and removed the screw the old fashioned way instead the moral of this story is that phillips head screwdrivers and soldering irons are not often interchangeable tools people who think they are should not be lent either
i used to have a few computer stores but sold them when the book money started to dwarf the store income i took off a few years enjoyed life but the guy who bought my stores asked me to come back and help him open up a bunch of them all around the state wife and i talked it over finally decided to do it first i had to get the original ones back into shape since theyd pretty much been run into the ground thats where ive been lately btw anyway last night this batshit crazy woman came in id had a few runins with her before claiming that i was obligated to give her the windows anytime upgrade license key huh i showed her that windows anytime upgrade wasnt specifically a version of windows but a program through which someone could upgrade their version of windows from home to professional or ultimate she didnt believe me and kept repeating that shed spent an hour on the phone with microsoft and that theyd told her shed have to talk to the people whod sold her the system i kept telling her that there wasnt an anytime upgrade version of windows so finally she navigated to the properties screen pointed triumphantly at the windows edition and the copyright notice underneath and said accusingly you didnt even sell me a current version this one is from and i bought the computer in maam thats the copyright notice there is no specific version of windows its constantly updating are you going to give me the windows anytime key or not it was at this time that i finally lost it my employees were shaking with laughter tears streaming down their faces trying to hold it in and failing maam i cant give you a key to something that doesnt exist she glared at me took out antiseptic wipes cleaned everything id touched grabbed her computer and left i cant wait to see her again apparently shed been causing the employees hell for over a year and the ones that were left that i didnt fire actually it was a massacre hated her and have really enjoyed seeing me interact with her good times edit oh and btw i like getting random snapchats from people so if youre bored holla at warlizard edit at the store busting ass but holy sweet mother of god the snaps im getting are awesome ive had gorgeous girls crazy guys pics all around the world and one guy sent me a boob shot not at all what i expected but thanks for the fun during a really annoying day keep em up i snap like a fiend usually nothing important but hey you guys made my day
i absolutely lost my sht on a call with a vendor yesterday since they were brought on a year ago ltcontractorgt has never been able to do anything right since april weve been trying to get a change order in place with them so we can remove many of the devices that were decommissioning from monitoring but they have been unable to provide us with a list of the devices that they are actually monitoring when they provide us with a spreadsheet its missing devices they are supposedly keeping an eye on when asked they cant give a straight answer as to why theyre not on the list but they claim that they are monitoring them and alerting on them a little over a month ago i decided to test them on that i took down a switch that they claimed to me monitoring but wasnt on their list i never got an alert i did it with another device not on the list but supposedly monitored and received the same result when i informed them of what im seeing and what ive done they started trying to run me around in circles they kept telling me that they would have a meeting about it next week when some key people were back off vacation so i informed them that i would not be letting my boss pay the bill until we had this sorted out after all they arent providing the services that were paying for and billing us for things weve asked to remove the entire time were trying to get this list straightened out theyre charging us full price because we never signed the change order i havent signed it because its never correct were not talking about pennies either this bill is over k per month after that email they were miraculously able to get that meeting together that afternoon last thursday yesterday was when they were going to give me the answers to these questions i had it just so happens that at am yesterday one of our datacenters experienced an outage bgp went down for right at minutes and while my network management software caught it theirs didnt during the meeting they were making all kinds of stuff up about what was being monitored and what wasnt i brought up the fact that a datacenter went down just an hour and minutes earlier and i never got an alert on that which i should have immediately after giving them the ip and hostname i sat there and listened as the excuses started rolling in they said their software didnt show any missed polling data and i must be mistaken that it went down gthow do you know it went down gtmy nms server said it did i had them make me presenter and i shared my screen to show them gtdid you verify that it really went down gtheres my still open command prompt window open with the failed pings gthow do you know it wasnt just your computer gta ping to another device in that datacenter but on a different circuit worked fine gtdid you verify on the device itself that it really went down i dont see anything in the logs i show them the bgp summary where bgp has only been up for an hour and a half then they told me that the subnet their server is on must have some sort of other route in it to get to that device that my nms server and laptop dont have my nms server and their server are on the same subnet in fact theyre both vms on the same physical server but i showed them the backup nms server at a different location just to prove that it had no connection too they kept telling me that it must be something with all my different servers because theyre polling that device every seconds and they have no missed polls another technical resource from their side decides to add his two cents gtwell we didnt receive an snmp trap that it went down and according to the configuration youre showing us its configured to send those traps so it must not have really went down a couple other guys on their team immediately come to his defense to explain to me that hes right if theres no trap then theres no problem i had a simple question gthow is a device going to send a trap when theres no network connection between it and you bgp was down there was no route i check a different log file and sure enough it shows the trap being fired they didnt get it because there was nowhere for it to go what i didnt tell them is that i called a buddy of mine that works for our mpls provider and had him kill the connection for me all these things they are coming up with are just them reaching at straws because they cant explain why their stuff doesnt work thats when the manager thats running the show decides to open up his cake hole gtwell that device isnt on the list of devices you said you wanted to monitor going forward gtyou mean the list we sent you yesterday that brought you down from devices to the list that you replied back that you wanted to have a meeting about with senior management about sometime next week before you sent us the change order because it cuts the bill by gtoh im sorry thats my fault i sent that list to the overseas team and told them to only alert on the devices that were on it thats why you didnt get an alert because were not going to be monitoring it once we get the change order complete gtdude your team has been telling me for minutes that your server had no idea the device went down and now youre going to make up some excuse about telling the overseas team not to alert on it gtim not making up excuses that has to be what happened gtor your software is garbage and you team dont know how to use it at this point my server guy pipes in he lost some drives in the san last week on two separate occasions and they never alerted him on that the excuses on that start pouring in the longer were on this call the more they are trying on my patience what made me snap was when we told them that we only wanted updown monitoring on that list of devices and would be removing all application level stuff prior to sending them that list we had an internal call where the engineers were asking for them to be fired but management wouldnt allow it plus somehow or another they managed to sneak in a requirement that we give them days notice before ending the contract and my previous boss who hired them to begin with and left for another company a few months back had signed a new contract with them just a couple weeks before leaving where he said wed be keeping them until the end of august im pretty sure he got a kickback from these idiots its the only thing that can explain all this the manager decides that hes going to try to sell me on keeping the other monitoring over just updown gtkc are you sure that you only want updown monitoring youd be losing gtyeah im just going to stop you right there i wont be losing anything if it were up to the engineering staff your ass would have hit the skids months ago i want to replace you with a small shell script fortunately for you management wont allow that i then tore into their ass for a good or minutes gradually getting more and angry to the point that i was verging on unprofessional i have tried to hold these peoples hand through this i even took a week out of my schedule to fly down to their offices and walk them through everything it did nothing in all my years of working in this field i have never run across a vendor that is more inept at their job than this and to think that we pay these people over a quarter million dollars a year to service this account today they had the audacity to have the salesman call me to try to change my mind about dropping their services down to nearly nothing not the managed services director not the technical lead no one to tell me that theyll fix the problem they sent a salesman to try to get me to spend more money with them sorry this is so long and ranty im just at the end of my rope with the yahoos and if i could id plaster their name all over this post so you could use my experience as a warning to not use them but unfortunately i cant what i can promise you is that once this contract is over i will be posting an update with that information edit guys stop pming me i will not tell you who the company is

here is a tale from a previous job i had in outsourced it i worked for a small company and handled all of the incoming commercial client calls on this day i was out at another small business installing their new server i had everything packed and ready to head out the door and the phone rings it was one of our biggest clients they were having all sorts of strange issues after listening to the complaints it took me minutes to determine there was something on the network fighting with the dhcp server i told my boss the owner what was going on and that i need him to help them figure out what it is i told him it is likely a wireless router in one of these two geeks offices they were the types to get new toys and want to play then i head off to the server install i have scheduled i dont get any updates on the situation so i check in with him the next morning to see how things are going apparently it was much more serious then i thought after taking a look he decided to hire an outside consultant who has done some shady work for us from time to time the consultant concludes they are being hacked from china and he changed their internal ip structuresubnet to thwart their hacking atttepts of course this brought their network to a screeching halt dozens of servers printers etc on static ip addresses abandoned and alone i hobble my way out thereoh yeah im doing all this on crutches with a broken foot btwand start to work on changing the static addresses after doing this for awhile i notice im still having weird issueswhat is this address i keep getting assigned lets go to the gateway netgearhmmthey have a sonic wall i hobble my way up the stairs to the first of the two nerds that i asked my boss to check with yesterday he is sittting at his desk i hobble around him without saying a word amd unplug the damn router behind him dont plug this in i go back downstairs problem solved it was a full week before the last of the residual issues were fixed from the ip structure change to this day the client thinks china attacked them that was the day i updated my resume and vowed to get a new boss
heres one on the lighter side of tfts so i was dealing with an employee for one of my client offices having trouble connecting to their terminal server from home he stated it wasnt the normal error hes seen before and i taught him very patiently how to take a screenshot paste to blank email then send it to myself so i could resolve the issue for him we went through the process multiple times and i thought he had it down pat the next day while im out at their office he comes up and hands me his screenshot of the error turns out he couldnt figure out the darned screenshot key at home and decided to draw this fine error out for me i mean look at the detail in the x on the left anyway i wish all employees gave at least half this mans efforts when they come across an error or problem really helped me resolve his issue quickly with little hassle screenshot here 
long time reader first time poster so this story happened to me yesterday and i thought you all would love this i work at a universitys technology help desk we have computers that we checkout to students so this one student lets call him macbook bro comes up to the desk and checks out a mac laptop he comes back a few minutes later gt macbook bro this charger doesnt work gt me okay ill swap it out our chargers get abused a lot so i thought nothing of it when he said it didnt work about minutes later he comes back again this time with the computer gt macbook bro hey this computer doesnt charge and it wont turn on gt me huh okay lets swap the computer out gt macbook bro yeah i opened the mac to make sure the battery was connected and everything i had not had enough time to check the charger so i figured it was just the mac that wasnt working and that the original charger was fine at the time i didnt hear that he said he opened our mac to make sure the battery was connected i realize i should have said something at this point so i checked out another mac to him about minutes later he comes back to return the equipment gt macbook bro so listen i spilled water on my personal laptop and i wanted to use one of yours to test my components to see if they still work so i took apart two of your macs but when i put this one back together the keyboard stopped working so he told me all of this and i was at a loss for words i really didnt know what to say i was more surprised that someone would do this to equipment that they dont own gt me youre not supposed to do this youre not allowed to open up the checkout equipment gt macbook bro oh i didnt know that wtf why would you think its okay to open up a laptop that you dont own and then mess it up even if he didnt tell me i would have caught on to what happened since our checkout system keeps track of who the last person was to get the equipment hope he enjoys paying for macs edit tech looked at the second mac that had the messed up keyboard looks like the ribbon cable was bent he fixed it and now the keyboard works but wifi is not working correctly not sure if its hardware or software so im going to just reformat it and see if that fixes it still waiting to see whats up with the first laptop edit the second laptop the client took apart is working fine now reformat fixed wifi issues the first one on the other hand is fried waiting to see what the cost is to fix it
backstory i work as a sysadmin for a userbase of onsite and offsite users at any one time we may have roughly half of that in our multistorey building any desk may have either a desktop or laptop depending on the users job description and if they may work offsite today our power went out which is unusual all the laptops were fine but obviously all the desktops lost power each floor has a local ups to support the networking switches and in turn the poe wifi aps as does the server room the practical implication of this is only those with desktops were really affected although it was a little dimmer than usual with only the emergency lighting when the power failed we started moving through the floors checking our users were okay zabbix already told us the rest wifi still running for those who rely on it esxi hosts and routers are online internet accessible no stress conversation with user myself everything okay over here user no its all down i cant do anything myself what do you mean everything should be running fine you have a laptop user no one is on skype look receptionist isnt online myself thats because receptionist has a desktop which isnt running because of the power outage look anotheruser is online user oh true tldr todo put receptionists skype availability into zabbix
in my younger days during the golden age of it midlate s i was called in as the citrix consultant to a major ad agency in midtown manhattan seems their citrix server had gone bellyup as a result no one across the enterprise was able to login to hyperion i get the call from my boss please go assist he just got off the phone with their cfo and was really concerned cfo had already contacted compaq was a proliant server and microsoft two consultants respectively had been there all morning and couldnt bring the server back online i was to build a citrix server asap if the original server couldnt be salvaged i walk into a server room with older gentlemen cfo and sysadmin staring at a black screen displaying os loader loader not found or whatever was the windows nt winframe message back then i ask them is there a floppy in there the consultants of course chuckle we are way beyond that kid i asked if i can take a look let this punk kid through said the ms consultant pretty unprofessional i thought in any event i make my way to the server reboot it and notice only one hot plug drive is flashing with drive activity raid i shut down the server partially slide out the drive without activity and power on booma few minutes later we have a booting server i turn to the compaq guy and tell him to get a replacement drive turn to the ms guy and tell him something to the effect an nt bootable floppy would have probably got the server booted i made these clowns look bad in front of the cfo and sysadmin got more business for my it company and was given the rest of the afternoon off 
so a couple years ago a local business was turned to me to acquire a server on the advice of a local consultant when i asked the office manager why they didnt go with the consultant for the work he said that he felt like the price was inflated and he declined fair enough i suppose so i asked him what the consultant recommended and was handed the sheet apparently this office was using local accounts on winxp for authentication no backups and no network filer they used simple file sharing to share files in the office ugh so the consultant recommended a server for ad running sbs with cals so they had room to grow and it had volume shadow copy so if something got deleted it could be recovered easily the owner was also recommended to buy tapes for backup but he nixed this idea saying he didnt want to have to deal with tapeswat whatever he wants to take it in the pooper once his drives fail thats on him then he hands me a sheet of paper with his requirements i found this odd since he is not technically capable of using his computer much less dictating hardware requirements but lets see what he has quad core xeons gb ram tb sata drive with no raid ummm wat so i first ask him if hed rather use raid in case of drive failures nope ok then what about the machine are you planning on running virtual machines hosting your own email internally running a busy sql server nope nope and nope huh ok so i tell him that for his purposes a single quad core xeon would be more than enough with gb of ram nope he is adament that it has to be that exact specs i ask him if he got those specs from the consultant nope but i know thats what we need your money guy so i go out and spec the server with the sbs license and cals print it out with an invoice for bucketsomoney understandably he flips his shit manager so why is this so expensive pavix theres an itemization on there indicating the price of everything i wouldnt be able to cut the price in half but id be able to reduce the cost by metricshitton if we went with a single xeon solution with gb of ram which is more than enough for what youre using it for manager no it has to be the exact specs i stated pavix if you dont mind me asking who gave you those specs it seems like someone at least a little familiar with it work since the specifically referenced xeons sata etc manager look i dont know what youre getting at weve already hired a consultant just do your damn job i would like to point out that this is typically where id nope right out but i wanted the money so whatever i got the manager to approve the budget ordered the kit and left i get a call a week and a half later saying the order is there and asking if i could drop by to get it setup sure so i get there toss in my earphones and start building the server get it racked plug in monitor mouse and keyboard and begin the sbs install as im about to grab another refill of water and hit the can the manager comes in with some kid thats about or manager hey pavix this is jeremy pavix hey jeremy whats up jeremy nothin im just coming to help pavix help with what manager well jeremy has got software he needs to install on the server once the server is up pavix what software if its licensed and was installed from the old server i can do the migration for you once i find the media manager this is something only jeremy can do just let him know once youre done hmmmdafuq whatever i dont have time for this crap so i go around getting the names of all the employees get ad setup create accounts with default passwords for everyone and go around joining their computer to the domain theres a few squabblers of how the new system is slower and why did we have to change if the old system worked worked huh if by worked you mean no way to remotely manage accounts easily no way to easily apply security permissions no easy way to reset a password if you forgot yoursoh well of course you will have to use a password to get in so after everyone is logged into their domain accounts and the computers are on the domain i set about setting up shared network folders when jeremy comes into the closet jeremy are you almost done pavix umm in a bit what did you need jeremy well i wanted to get this software setup pavix what software jeremy bf dedicated server pavix umm what are you the one that gave the manager the server specs jeremy yea i went on a forum and asked this group what server stuff they had so i could get it too and host my own server i walk into the managers office and explain what was just told to me he told me that it wasnt my responsiblity and to finish the install so i go back get shares setup to match what was preexisting setup ous added the users with correct levels had users reboot and test copied all the files over after configuring vss i goto the manager and explain that its done but that i wont be offering any support to this network in the future if hes going to let his kid host a bf server on the domain controller after about minutes of yelling saying im unprofessional and how he knows more about it than me and that a bf server wont affect the server or its security he begrudgingly cut me a check for my hours his number is now on my verizon block list because fuck that edit wow front page thank you so much update yesterday since this was a somewhat popular post i decided to reach out to the consultant who referred the customer to me and ask if he ever heard from them again of course he has where else was the customer going to go geeksquad anyway i know this post is getting long in the tooth and if this should be a new posting feel free to let me know mods first things first it was mw not bf he was hosting off this new server my apologies for the confusion ive never setup a server for either so i wasnt aware of the restrictions originea has for servers so after i left jeremy tried downloading his shiny new server software if what im being told is correct its run through steam but anyone that has logged into a windows server with an administrative account knows that ie runs in hardened mode to protect novice admins from doing something stupid but jeremy wouldnt be thwarted by some geek engineers from ms oh no he went back to the forums asking how to get the software on his machine and the internet being incredibly helpful suggested he download firefox on another machine put the installer on a flash drive and plug it into the server so there was jeremy with an unrestricted browser downloading whatever he wanted oh boy and i know what youre going to askbut what about his firewall wouldnt that block him im glad you asked when the network was setup the contractor was quite adament about using private ip ranges but the ladies didnt want to have to deal with pesky vpn to rdp into their machines and couldnt be bothered to change ports that corrispond to each of the workstations nope instead every machine in the office has public routable ip addresses this of course includes their network printer and the server oh joy and they dont restrict inbound or outbound traffic in any way after a week network shares were unavailable jeremy stopped all services that the helpful gamer forum didnt recognizetheyre gamers so they should know all things it rightwhich included volume shadow copy service so backups werent being done oh and the ladies or jeremy found some way to enable c shares on all workstations so after jeremy started to get the scary fbi virus warnings on his machine the entire office got it as well this is a real estate office so hippa doesnt apply but im sure there are some legalities so my friend got called in to quote a price to fix it he said he wouldnt fix it except to nuke and pave all workstations all servers and that he wouldnt hand over administrative credentials until a paid it staffer contacted him they politely declined im guessing the manager tried my phone was told there are call restrictions in place and moved on either way i have securely noped my way out of this

i used to work helpdesk for a plus organisation in west london the company was spread across three sites and this was in the days before teamviewer etc so i actually lost weight during the two years i worked there anyway one day we get a ticket from someone at the site half a mile up the road saying my mouse has got reversed i immediately thought someone had got into the control panel and reversed the leftright mouse clicks for a joke i tried to talk him through fixing it on the phone but it was clearly beyond his skillset so i put my coat on and stepped out into a wet teddington when i got there i looked at the laptop and saw that the mouse buttons had not been reversed i pointed this out and the guy said oh no its not the clicks its the mouse itself its on the wrong side it used to be here he indicated the left side of his laptopand now its here he indicated the right someone had used his machine and put the mouse on the right hand side and he had raised a ticket to have it come out and pick the mouse up and put it back where it was before i did it wordlessly and walked away not even a thank you 
define timelurked short define postnum first i work in a very seasonal industry and so the office ends up being closed months out of the year and opening the office after months of inactivity can sometimes be an adventure server and computer software and hardware to update what have you the fun comes when we start trying to print out reports when the printer starts beeping plaintively responding to the cry i went to check the printer out not saying its out of paper not saying its out of toner a jam and then i open the paper drawer to horror during the months the office had been closed termites decided that the paper would satisfy their appetite as well as wood would and had turned the ream that had been left in the printer into their nest gt me boss printers bugged help me clean it out gt boss wait what oh edit after cleaning the printer worked just fine and never gives any problems normal alerts for being out of toner or paper are not problems tldr termites like paper raid isnt just for hard drives
i work as senior tech staff at a telco and a few days ago got a call from a dispatch manager asking me to call a field tech who couldnt activate several cable boxes while out on the road rather unusual unless theres a problem with the tool itself this is usually resolved by frontline staff gt bytewave this is bytewave from tsss a dispatch manager asked us to get in touch regarding stb activation issues out in the field gt roadtech oh thank god yeah i need a full test auth profile on a cable box and im in the middle of nowhere and my tool isnt working i tried calling both dispatch and tech frontline twice but they couldnt figure why and neither can i im going through the wireless provisioning software as usual tried three different boxes put in the mac addresses as usual this one is abd they all gave me a mismatch error no specific error code can you tell me why its not working the ticket software doesnt say theres any provisioning issues right now the system hes trying to use is pretty simple generally not something we use much as devices are usually preprovisioned since he gave me the mac address of his cable box i could have activated it for him in ten seconds on my end but i wanted to figure out why he was getting errors first though ran a quick check and there were no obvious reasons why it shouldnt be possible for him to activate this box remotely the system that allows field techs to do that on the road uses our mobile network to ensure that even if theres no physical access to the cable network a tech out there with nothing but his phone can put a valid profile on any modem or settop box stored in their truck remotely its handy and simple you plug the device in your trucks wireless system put in your employee id in a portal your trucks id the devices mac address or serial number and boom you have whatever profile you select from a basic cable package to a unlimited test profile theres very little that can go wrong besides the box being unauthorized on the network clearly not the case after three different tries or putting in the wrong data gt bytewave okay i can confirm theres no issue with the tool youre using just ran a quick test clearly you have wireless coverage otherwise you wouldnt have even gotten to the screen where the system lets you input device data and im going to assume you didnt mistype macs and serials three times in a row and that you know your employee number gt roadtech yes obviously which is why nobody can figure out whats wrong out here gt bytewave that leaves us with the truck number being the only option left you sure you typed it right gt roadtech yes of course i double checked and you know we use license plate numbers for this right pretty hard to get it wrong but in case you need it this truck has bc plates ren every and each of our trucks out there is remotely traceable with tools escalation staff has unless somebody physically remove their gps so i ran a quick loc on the plate just to make sure its comms were working fine they were its in downtown vancouver everything looks green except theres no reason to try and provision equipment over wireless if youre literally standing meters away from a key headend and tech depot gt bytewave uhh please confirm your location gt roadtech km out north of fernie east kootenay the oh ffs gt bytewave youre typing in the wrong license plate thats why the system is rejecting your requests no modem or cable box in the truck will be provisioned unless you know what plate number its supposed to have the truck which ought to have this plate is in downtown vancouver according to gps data im provisioning the mac you gave me right now as soon as youre done with your job drive to the nearest depot and call dispatch and you probably shouldnt speed because right now im betting the insurance papers in the glove compartment do not match the plates on your truck gt roadtech whaa uh thanks but how the hell did this happen gt bytewave youll have to sort that out on your end do let me know if you find out tldr road tech out there couldnt remotely activate cable boxes because the system that allows them to do so ties each box to a trucks license plate and the plates physically present on his truck were supposed to be on a different company truck altogether hundreds of kilometers from there all of bytewaves tales on 
after the unexpected success of my last story i thought id share another one from a couple of years ago its a bit unusual for this sub but i think it still fits i was out on the town with some friends one night and we were about to head home we all got in the car the driver turned the key and nothing not even the normal dash lights the thing was completely dead praying it wasnt the battery we got out and popped the hood now i know quite a bit about computers i know almost nothing about cars normally in this situation id be happy to step back and let someone else figure it out however it quickly became clear that everyone else in the group was equally clueless alright self i thought lets put our heads together and see if we can think this through it has to be an electrical problem right so the logical place to start is the fuse box i found the fuse box and rows of neatly arranged and cryptically labeled fuses greeted me my years of reseating ram jiggling cables and blowing on n cartridges told me the proper course of action was to pull each one out and put it back in what have i got to lose either it works and im a hero magician or it doesnt and were no more stuck than before five minutes later we get back in it turns over like nothing happened and i get high fives all around
so years ago i had a user decide it would be a good idea to play games at work specifically world of warcraft when he played at work it created a few security violations that made the network send me lots of emails during my employment there several take home computers became a thing for certain members of management the guy wasnt too untech savvy himself and im pretty sure he used a home computer to do it but i dont know exactly how he installed wow as he wouldnt tell me saying well you dont deserve your job if you cant figure it out he kept yelling and sending me pretty nasty emails after talking to higher management about what happened and forwarding them the emails they literally said gtwell he doesnt deserve his job if he isnt going to work do us the favor of telling him hes fired gtrreally gtyeah my next email to the guy was hey im being told to fire you he replied you cant do that im above you i replied not anymore ill be down to your office shortly to take all the electronic equipment to make a long story short he was escorted out he broke his laptop at home as he didnt have it at work and he kept telling me i was the one who was actually fired not him all while security was forcing him out i was later told that i was to inform everyone in the next meeting that they would be fired for intentionally violating policys surrounding computer security and that i would be the one to send the emailmaking the phone call i didnt enjoy firing anyone else which was only one other person i got a very small raise out of it because i was super polite to him not sarcastically so the entire time undoubtedly my most satisfying day at work ever it felt like justice was served
as stated in an earlier post i work for a company that issues blackberrys to employees who have no business being issued a blackberry here is another fine example why ring ring ring ring me this is the robot i know more than you what did you break luser my blackberry isnt loading the screen when i push the power button anymore me does it do anything or does not even power on anymore luser it powers on but then it just shows a red screen forever me when did this start happening luser after i pulled the battery out me why did you pull out the battery luser it started to erase everything and i didnt want it to me hang on let me start piecing this together to make sure i understand were you trying to enter your password to unlock the device luser yes me did you get a message that you were entering the incorrect password and were now on your last attempt luser yes but i was entering the correct me shhh shh shh did you try to enter the password on the last attempt after being warned that your data would be erased on the last failed attempt luser yes me did the device start to wipe your data luser yes me did you then proceed to remove the battery despite the message on the screen that said warning do not power off device or remove the battery during security wipe luser yes i didnt want it to wipe my data did that mess it up congratulations on your new 
 i wrote this while on an hour long call this morning its not art but i amused myself the guys at work thought it was worth sharing so i share enjoy edit holy crap wow thanks all look youre in a hole i do not know if you fell or jumped in the hole im not here to judge and i honestly dont care i do know these things i did not dig the hole you do not want to be in the hole i responded to your plea for help i have a ladder if you do not like this ladder i cannot help that its not my ladder personally so no offense taken if you want i can try and find another ladder but it will take time if you dont want this particular ladder it makes little difference to me im not the one in the hole id like to help you out of the hole however it is ultimately on you but ill help you however i can as best i can until you are out of the hole all i ask really is that you just stop fucking digging
four weeks ago the hr manager asked me if i could do a favour for her they had got all of the or so staff records scanned by an external company who had given them back a folder with named pdf files all of these files are in different folders about or so per folder moving all of them by hand is going to take a very long time so could i write a program to do it automatically each file is named with the users name they have staff folders in the hr network share named the same as the staff name the mission move all the pdf files into their corresponding folder i request access to the folder to work on it from group it two weeks later i follow it up after getting no response a couple of days later i email the team leader over there to ask what is happening no response eventually i get a garbled response from group asking for authorisation i point them to the hr managers email further up the chain nothing happens by this point the hr manager is getting a bit annoyed at waiting so i write the code to move the files test it and try and find a time when i can go to her desk and run it to move the files finding a time that she is free takes another two days eventually we manage to find a time to do it and i go across run the application and successfully move about half the files hr managers immediate response was what can you do about the rest of the files why cant you move the rest i had to explain that the program is only going to get the files that are named exactly it will also not overwrite any file with the same name because these files are very important and im not taking any risks the rest of the files will have to me moved manually and i dont have the time to do that all the rest of the files did not move because they either had a same named file in the staffs folder already the staff had left or the file had been named incorrectly by hr i have now spent hours chasing group to follow process try and get access officially at least hours in meetings with different people to try and get the actual requirements and full file paths hours coding and debugging hour explaining why the program does what it does and why after all that i get in to have to explain to my boss why there is now a complaint about me only doing half a job this was me going well outside my job descriptiondoing you a favour and saving you hours of manual copypasta hell no thanks just complaints 
was reading this pair of and was reminded of a story that happened years ago when i was attending a global game jam event in my town for the uninitated you show up on friday evening make a team of several people they give you a topic and you got hours to make a game then present it to everyone so sunday evening rolled around and all the teams were getting their stuff ready the guys who were up first all huddled around the projector and were taking their sweet times setting up apparently nobody thought to bring an hdmi cable not just these guys almost nobody in the entire building participants and organizers alike brought an hdmi cable as if by miracle one of the guys on my team lets call him frank was there to save the day he groaned huffed and sighed then produced a spare cable he had packed along with his laptop its a good thing computers dont get stds because that cable got passed around an obscene amount that night that was not the end of it though most of the guys doing their presentations had various problems their game would crash or refuse to load the resolution would be fucked up the sound stops for no reason etc frank had the brilliant idea of prerecording our game instead of doing it live and our own presentation went off without a hitch throughout the whole thing he kept repeating the mantra in the tldr tldr do not anger the demo gods their fury is swift and just
awhile back manning the phones as tech senior staff at my telco i got a panicked escalation call from a field tech who had to retreat as per protocol as he had been threatened with violence for trying to gain access to a courtyard to disconnect service to a nonpaying customer of course we can remotely kill any cable boxes modems and cellphones but we still gotta send a guy out to disconnect your analog cable access physically as it can almost never be done remotely except in huge towers with special panels we err on the safe side when it comes to threats to employees you dont exactly need to point a gun in our techs faces for them to go away and leave your analog alone a strong no a closed fist and a death stare will get them to retreat and return with cops later but in this case the tech was slightly shaken the nonpaying customer had been unusually aggressive normally recoveries handle these situations but it was outside their office hours and as the only senior department tsss inherits a few youre in charge of this random mess now calls like this now and then only thing surprising was that the houses mta and dhct were still online despite a clear disconnect order something i was able to rectify in seconds with the kill list in retrospect the explanation why will seem quite obvious below gt bytewave okay dont worry were handling it you seem pretty shook up i recommend once were done you give a quick call to the emergency employee hotline just in case get everything written down and sent to the health amp safety board as a precaution they will confidentially hear all about how you feel and recommend options if you wish as for this address dont worry im on it i cant disconnect analog remotely but theyre not going to be browsing reddit after treating you like that whole place is now on the kill list the kill list is simply the top tool we had to deny service to customers who we determine should never be in business with us ever again it scraps provisioning of every digital device in a file of course faster than we could through the standard process but most importantly it scans everything we know about the account the customer and the potential all the way down to who has been listed as authorized to the account what email addresses they used mother maiden names birthdates security questions competition profiles and more then adds all the data deemed relevant to a special list that makes it quite likely any new attempt to register a new account with us under a false name will get picked up by an algorithm which determines who you truly are and fastforwards a full profile to recoveries and then black marks to credit rating agencies if warranted its the best tool we have to keep disconnected customers from lying and getting a clean slate and when our recoveries department is closed senior tech support often has to make these calls the original name was intended to mean youre dead to us now the tech felt reassured and happier and i thought the matter closed everyone working the field or tech support knew what the kill list was and what it meant he knew techs would go back there flanked by cops in a few days to disconnect the analog line by force if necessary and that this customer would never again have an account with us all ought to be well matter closed except for one thing though i had no way to guess or know that this house turned out to be under some kind of surveillance by authorities of some kind perhaps it was city police csec csis a clandestine us op on foreign soil i dont know the single point of contact for them with the telco is a department known as internal security in my tales whose primary tasks are to make anything happen if you have a warrant while largely ignoring a flood of copyrightinfringement claims that almost inevitably reference the dmca even though were in canada is is also a fellow union department and we quietly share infos about most things except truly sensitive details but unlike techs is had no idea what the kill list was there are too many tools for everyone to track of and nobody has access to them all one day i got to work and there was an alert from internal it that the kill list had been renamed to emergency blacklisting tool and that there were no operational impacts but that employees were to use the new terminology from now on it had a whole new skin and logo within the hour i shrugged it off typical bureaucratic nonsense they shuffle names around sometimes even if its rare for highlevel tools month later downstairs an is friend of mine tells me about what happened once it was a fully closed matter gt is so yeah back then we got a priority call from the authorities with paperwork in order wont say which exactly and they said we were then technically failing to comply with a live warrant and to fix service to that location at all costs by yesterday gt is so i went to have a look at all the tickets about that place and since they werent all that clear i listened to a call between you and some field guy i decided to recite verbatim what you said but the guy panicked a tad even after i added some context about how its certainly something more mundane than it sounds and how we dont have any squads of hired guns that go around murdering terrible customers had to let him listen to the recording then he put me on hold for half an hour i might have been sweating had i heard that in a timely fashion but it was a month after the tool was renamed and nothing had been said to me so i knew it was a big misunderstanding i explained what the kill list ebt is to him and he laughed his ass off gt is no i swear to you they took it that seriously i tried my best to downplay it but cya is strong when you have a badge too i was told once he finally came back on the line this is no longer a matter which will be handled at our level i have to send this vertical someone with a really good suit will get a call from someone else here later tonight i argued it was already well past business hours but it still happened anyway the next day at dawns light we got the same email you did from systems renaming the kill list to ebt a month ago i was chuckling pretty hard it meant an higherup in law enforcement woke up one of our vicepresidents in the middle of the night to discuss whether or not our telco was operating a kill list and what it meant and that said upper manager then spent part of the night ensuring we immediately rename a tool to deal with the confusion all of bytewaves tales on tldr a poorlynamed tool meant to ensure we can internally shut down enduser modems and dhcts really quickly in a bind scared law enforcement into waking up key upper management to make sure our telco wasnt running a shady program on the dl to take out our worst customers or anything of the sort
i supported remote sites including drilling rigs one of them called and stated the network goes out every day at exactly the same time it comes back after about an hour the rigs get all their connectivity from a selfaiming satellite dish on a trailer all their it stuff is contained on that trailer for portability and ease of use by technophobic roughnecks this seems odd but he called at so i troubleshoot a few things and watch his connection at exactly it went offline no warning nothing just gone the phone is voip so i lose him too an hour later he calls back and everything tests perfectly he assures me that they do not lose power all his boxes have the right flashy lights i ask him to call back tomorrow i want to see it again and prepare tests he does and all tests show it offline and at his end a cell call from the drilling manager verifies that the site is dead and it is always down so i load up the company pickup with tools and spare parts and start the long trek out to the drilling site i time it to arrive at pm and give me time to test check and try to find the culprit while still observe the outage if nothing turns up it is all good everything is in perfect condition then promptly at pm as he does every day the drilling manager pulls up and parks his pickup right in front of the satellite dish
over the holiday i was visiting some family out of state which includes my monthold niece that i rarely get to see being a baby in the year she has many toys that light up talk sing and move andor dance one of these toys is a stuffed animal with buttons in the hands feet belly etc when turned on it says lets sing and play when turned off bye bye one afternoon were sitting around watching tv when i start hearing lets sing and play short pause bye bye lets sing and play short pause bye bye in a continuous loop i look over and theres my niece turning on her toy pressing a different foot and getting no sound then turning it off and back on again i was so proud i almost cried edited for punctuation
phone support at a large busniess a user was having problems with her laptop shutting down randomly i assumed it may be a defective battery as we had seen a few of those from a past batch of laptops i asked her if it was plugged in is what plugged in she said is the power plugged in i replied after a long pause she responded how do i determine if it is plugged in
as the aircraft touched down with an audible thump i couldnt help but feel the jolt of my life changing uncertainty had crept into my mind even as i tried to force it down i had accepted a job to help a company deploy a new computerdatabase system i remembered the words of my boss as i left my home country who cares that you dont speak the language confidence talks youve got this internally i questioned my ability to lead a team id never met in the deployment of software i had never even heard of before i decided to just shake if off as the famous song goes whilst simultaneously questioning the validity of advice from a pop song luckily my home company had supplied its own interpreter for the trip my boss seemed to suspicious of the entire deal so this was his attempt at getting another man in play the interpreter waited for me as i exited the terminal she was a tall professional looking woman who subsequently drove me to the office wed be working at i tried pleasantries but eventually i had to get down to business gtme so what are we working on just the roll out of this database gtint i am sorry mr airz i do not know remember i work for you this is my first day as well i slumped in my chair as we arrived at a soviet inspired cement office block a man with a gleaming smile ran to the door and opened it his cheeriness seemed to contrast nicely with his surroundings in what i can only assume was a slum gtgleam mr airz youve arrived gtme you speak gleam gave me a big smile he opened his arms wide for a bow gtgleam but of course although the others are a little rusty gleam waved me inside eager to give me a tour of the facility in all honestly it was just one massive cement slab of a building every floor was the same gleam eventually started to explain what i had flown all this way for gtgleam were doing a national roll out all at once swiftly like a hawk youre here to make sure it all runs smoothly as he said the word smoothly he gestured his hands outward as if feeling the word gtme and what exactly are you rolling out gtgleam its the pride of this office we built it from scratch im assured well they tell me it works perfectly would you like a demonstration gleam introduced me to the entire team that had been working on the project i asked them to show me the database which a young worker joyfully did after translation he produced a web form which you would fill our with various details then showed off the backend retrieving data seemingly correctly gtme so its just getting roll out to the areas that need new terminals a quick lesson with how to use the forms for query and logging new data and easy money i thought as i smiled at the team assembled as soon as they saw the smile they seemed to all noticeably relax some even sat back down and stopped paying attention gtgleam thats all it is so how long gtme how er long the question seemed to come out of nowhere gtgleam two weeks gtme well how many people are we teaching how many users do we roll out too whats the server situation gtgleam im afraid those questions are bit too technical for me i leave the details to you gleam walked away seemingly unconcerned with the fate of the pride of his office the team assembled was a mash of various people none of whom seemed to be currently doing actual work i looked around for direction it took me about a minute to realise i was here to direct them i decided id get a better acquainted with the system theyd developed i walked over to the same young worker as before and got him to show me the program some more the interpreter had to translate everything i wondered what gleam meant by a bit rough with my language when he clearly meant to say theyd none after getting a general overview i decided to delve a little more closely gtme show me the feature you worked specifically worked on gtyounggunthrough int my feature age birthdate updates automatically younggun through a translator seemed to be talking very excitedly and avidly about his feature however int didnt seem to bother translating gtint hes saying how hes even included days in the calculation something about on your birthday it will update i thought the phase something about was an odd one for a translator to use surely youd know i decided to just leave it and look at the code more carefully it seemed to take the date of birth and calculate the age gtme can i see your test data so i can pick a name for a demonstration after a few moments of interpreting younggun finally seemed to understand i was fairly sure the code looked solid it wasnt until younggun pressed a freshly printed sheet into my hands that i started getting worried i must have frowned because younggun started pointing at various names on the single sheet of paper gtint he says this is the test data which one do you want to check gtme this paper has five names on it the interpreter looked at me oddly but dutifully translated the message gtint he doesnt seem to understand he wants you to pick a name to test the code gtme ask him if this is all the names in the test data gtint he says yes thats the test data my internal unhappiness was bubbling up slowly like a freight train gathering speed and much like a freight train i could do nothing to stop it younggun seemed to be frantically tapping at his keyboard providing proof that all five names did infact work seemingly declaring to the entire office his success gtme when this rolls out how many customers will be on it younggun said a number that number was not in fact it was a multiple quite a lot larger then five gtme okay tell everyone were retesting all the code with at least that many customers there was a general murmur nothing you could pinpoint on a single individual just a bunch of voices whispering gtint theyre saying if it works for five six and seven data points it will work for a million gtme will it after the interpreter translated that phrase everyone seemed to stop whispering i ordered new test data be made up orders of magnitude larger then the current gtint theyre complaining itll take days or weeks to input that much data gtme its made up randomised data should take minutes blank stares were thrown around the room gtme google it apparently those words do not need translation as soon as id uttered the words they all seemed to turn to there terminals and start typing i decided to let them get on with it and made it to the break room for a coffee whilst trying to wrestle the coffee machine into making something that didnt resemble black treacle i was accosted by a man inexplicably holding a plate gtplate new man gtme er plate smiled at my incomprehension and watched as i attempted to beat the coffee maker into submission gtplate new guy you must come to a party this weekend gtme i errr have other plans personally i loved the phrase other plans it could literally mean anything in this case it meant anything but socialising gtplate this is okay we party friday friday is a good day no what do you say to that no yes gtme the coffee machine do you know how to get it to work gtplate coffee no friday yes gtme sorry who are you he seemed very persistent gtplate you me were the same you unmarried i unmarried we go like brothers into the night would be legendary i wasnt sure if or he didnt seem but in my confused state i decided to go back to the computers without answering a few hours later the team had managed to assemble some data younggun hit the enter key to test the data the computer froze then hung then crashed we checked the server it had hung it had crashed a few minutes later gleam managed to arrive as if summoned by some force he wore and upbeat smile as if completely misreading the situation however all the workers seemed to be smiling now with him gtme im afraid you arent ready for roll out yet youve got to do a whole bunch of testing and bug fixing gtgleam youve two weeks a few of the programmers started to subtly whisper at gleam to be honest it wasnt exactly subtle but they seemed to want to all avoid eye contact with me gleam was still smiling even after id told him two weeks wasnt enough gtgleam go back to your hotel youve had a long flight over here and a long day go on i couldnt be bothered to fight it i walked away the whispering between the programers and gleam only seemed to get louder as i left my interpreter jogged to catch up with me gtint theyre saying you broke the code one of them said youd given them a virus gtme wha but i my head had filled with rage id almost completely turned around when the interpreter grabbed my arm firmly and walked me out the door to the car gtint no dont you wont win like that gtme but theyre liars they know nothing about database scaling gtint just get in the car thanks for all the emails while i was awaydoing taxesselling my card printing they really helped me get back to writing 
as senior tech staff at my telco part of my job description is having to review frontline technical performance whenever management asks me to that usually means sitting down for an entire day listening to the recorded calls of a tech with subpar performance and then taking an hour to write a synopsis of their strengths and weaknesses my analysis is then used to prepare a training plan to help get them up to speed in extreme cases if a union employee fails to improve after training theyre reassigned to what we call an envelope position formally its called mandatory reassignment under our work contract a lowskill union job where they keep their pay but might be required to do nothing but sort mail all day long because they can no longer do what they were hired for it means youre a lost cause and your boss hates you but you get to keep a job because we have a strong union not an enviable situation to say the least the work contract clause about this was meant to give an out to wellintentioned older employees who have trouble adapting to major technological changes but management sees the whole thing as a dustbin to get rid of employees they no longer want any employee forced into an envelope position no longer falls under their budget and they can easily blame it on the work contract almost as good as being able to fire them gt frontline manager id like you to review a frontline union techs calls and send me a report names maximilian emailed you a time range and general metrics it demonstrates that hes well below average performance we tried already to give him additional training and things have not improved takes less than three calls per hour even though we expect six doesnt seem like bad faith on his part so we think its just incompetence were considering mandatory reassignment at this point and the union has been notified that unless we witness improvements after whatever measures you recommend were going there i knew who he was talking about offhand maximilian is an uncommon name these days pretty damn decent tech as far as i knew so it seemed odd he got to the point where they considered mandatory reassignment either way writing up a report about any employees performance falls under my job description and a day listening to someone elses calls is nothing to scoff at gt bytewave sure thing i can take friday off to listen to his calls expect a report by end of business week the performance data that the manager sent me was minimal but i had full recordings at least so come friday i listened to max calls for an entire day he was outstanding he was able to solve difficult problems without unnecessary escalations i listened to a call where he swiftly dealt with a major mobile intercarrier issue that could have had some techs in my own department tsss reeling theres no way this guy only takes three calls an hour on average so i started digging according to all recordings and tickets max was a topnotch employee of all the times ive been asked to do a full review of a frontline techs performance this one was downright ridiculous and entirely unjustified so i wrote him a glowing review and even threw in that given enough seniority i believed he might be someday tsss material too formally added that the metrics mailed to me did not match the quality of calls i listened to at all and that i was recommending no additional training measures come monday i was hastily summoned to a meeting with my manager and maximilians manager and a union steward was called in too usually that means they are going to accuse you of something serious and want to follow protocol in case theres a grievance max manager looked like he was about to hand me a letter of reprimand my boss looked like he was annoyed to have to attend a useless impromptu meeting gt frontline manager please first tell us on record what relationships if any you have with frontline tech employee maximilian adler by then i could tell something went seriously wrong but when i dont know what i just go through the motions until i figure it out gt bytewave formal professional relationship only as tsss i help him on recorded lines whenever he needs our teams assistance i sometimes have mild banter with him in formal break rooms and at office parties outside these settings no contact whatsoever now unless im told what the hell this is about i might walk out with the stew for union advisory and well resume in an hour with max in attendance the manager seemed taken aback and confused but he kept going gt frontline manager i guess youre allowed but the statistics dont lie this guy has a hard time taking three calls an hour under half of average your whole review glosses over that and we paid you for a full day for this gt bytewave as im well aware ive listened to all calls in the time range you asked me to and looked at your metrics i said they dont match in writing ccd to my boss here and everybody involved in his training plan i stand by that gt frontline manager accusatory tone exactly you sent that to everybody without explaining the discrepancy gt bytewave as i was supposed to i didnt file your teams payslips either that would be entirely outside the mandate and gt union steward outside his job description i read his report its complete and exceptionally professional anything more would be grounds for a grievance over a union employee being ordered to do managerial work without union authorization tsss is only allowed to review technical expertise not metrics the stew was right but truth to be told i still had no knowledge of what went wrong didnt have the data to figure it out yet just knew the calls i listened to for an entire day did not match at all that of a subpar employee this much i was certain of so i kept a calm face as usual but i was more than mildly annoyed to be put on the spot like this for no valid reason whatsoever the frontline manager started to sweat the steward had noticed too so i decided to press the advantage gt bytewave given the tone this far unless this meeting is over perhaps it would be proper for the union to order we continue this under a full disciplinary board while that might seem like a bad thing whenever a manager is overreaching this is one of our strongest tools according to our work contract whenever either party demands it it simply means two managers two union stewards and all parties concerned and respective lawyers if parties believe its warranted have to get in a room and fully discuss differences with recordings admissible in arbitration its a step up over filing a grievance previously featured in a tale about listening to the wrong if a manager is in the wrong it gets them in hot water really quickly to have it put on formal record as their powerful legal department reviews full recordings of each instance the frontline managers sweating intensified the union stew was just about to call it as i hinted then my boss who had been sitting there quietly finally spoke up gt my manager this meeting is more than over from now on i want all requests to my team for frontline personnel performance reviews to be dispatched exclusively through me i will be reviewing them directly floor director will be notified in writing by noon thank you for your time no manager below middlemanagement is as powerful on support floors than the ones in charge of either senior staff teams even though officially subdirection managers are all equal could have ended there but im never happy unless i know what really happened gt bytewave its not quite over not after this i want the whole file you have on this employee full detailed metrics included ccd to the union too well get to the bottom of this and figure out who screwed up and why cause it sure wasnt me and we dont take proceedings like this lightly the steward nodded i expected it to be this specific frontline managers fault and thought that by reviewing records id be able to prove it and get him in hot water for being an ass without due cause he objected just as my boss agreed and soon after i was at my desk reviewing everything the whole analysis took an entire minute with just a glance at the full data i could tell the person barely taking calls per hour wasnt max gt bytewave boss theres a contractor with the same employee number as max internal employee numbers and contractor employee numbers are tracked separately in the same database it turns out max a union internal employee was blamed for the terrible performance of a contractor with the same damn number it wasnt supposed to be possible but obviously was max manager was looking at the wrong performance metrics all along soon after every contractors employee number was incremented to ensure it doesnt happen again all of bytewaves tales on tldr good frontline tech was blamed for poor metrics because he shared an employee number with a terribad contractor and i almost got into trouble for giving him an allclear performance review strong union and a good boss ensured i didnt get in hot water and could figure out what was going on 
college tale again i was working hard to wire in a new network segment cables at around an metre run per cable against a deadline when my pager went off it was the s report to the it suite email down first port of call was the server room but the mail server was churning away happily sending and receiving messages so i thought that it would be an easy fix a config issue on outlook i get down to the it suite to find a student waiting at the desk for me i follow her to her pc and she explains that shes trying to send an email to her friend and it wont go i check the address its internal so it shouldnt be stopped by any of the outbound rules the name resolves so theres a connection to the mail server then i check her mailbox its just over the limit we delete around a hundred or so emails empty deleted items and try again still not sending i check again and shes an it student which means shes on a different server that we were having issues with its also her last day as the exams are over and shell be going off to university next year shes telling me this as i attempt to manually edit her user profile so that the correct settings are propagated after a quick edit of the mail profile and purge of the old data we send a test message and its successful she retypes the message and sends it as i watch it successfully sends not bad minutes to get the message sent but now im minutes behind schedule on a more important job on the way out she sees the friend that she was emailing gtgirl i just sent you an email gtgirl what did it say gtgirl proceeds to repeat entire message she just emailed to girl thereby making my minute fix irrelevant 
my coffee looked expectantly at me it was the first cup of the day the it break room door having been dehinged near moments ago i looked down at the black swirling vortex its warm colour mimicking my happiness at the thought of a doorless break room i took a sip tasted like triumph a knock at the door woke me from my whirlwind romance it was the sales manager who had just been made temporary building manager she was smiling gtsales how are you today feeling well just here to do a quick measure of this office she produced a tape measure clutched in her hand gtsales also the vp would like to see you i stared at her for a full minute i got up and put down my mug my hand felt cold without it as i made my way towards the door i hear the sales manager clear her throat gtme i wont get in your way i better pop up to see the vp now i just wanted to get out of the room away from the strangeness that is the sales manager being odd nothing good can come of odd gtsales actually i was hoping you could help me measure this before you leave gtme measure this gtsales just this room i went to find the building plans for the dimensions but they arent where i expected gtme why are we measuring this room again gtsales oh just building maintenance stuff i wouldnt worry about it gtme feels like i should worry we quickly went around the room its rectangular so it was very fast gtsales thanks for the help actually one more thing how big is your desk gtme no idea gtsales a man should always know the size of his desk she proceeded to sweep the measuring tape around and bang it down on the desk as the measuring tape reeled back from its holster it caught the lip of my mug coffee was spilt it felt like the first blood of a war i made my way to the vps office only on half a coffee but thats all id need or so i thought old stories ten vp saga eleven vp saga twelve vp saga thirteen vp saga fourteen vp saga thanks to anyone who managed to get this far 
a small bit of background i work as the is manager for a small company with about six branches and under employees about a week ago we had an issue where one of our scsi hdds burned out in our mail server it was raid so i replaced it and let it rebuild but i began to closely monitor the server in case anything odd began to happen i say this because i normally dont monitor our mail logs all that closely otherwise unless people are having problems our company employs a team of third shift workers to pull product for trucks that depart in the morning most of these employees have been with the company for over ten years and are mostly all over the age of fifty theyre all good guys just not the most tech savvy which is fine theyre also unmonitored all night for the most part we also dont run any content filtering software so all websites are open for browsing our ceos thoughts are that if we hire someone we expect them to be adult enough to know when its appropriate to browse websites for personal use and when not to and what sites are appropriate to begin withwhich is okay for people who legitimately arent going to download the worst viruses imaginable on accident but i digress one employee in particular well call him stew doesnt like not being savvy and every morning hell wander over to my desk with a plethora of questions that im more than happy to answer for him theyre usually things about which phone he should look at buying or how to do something with the computer he had never done before so its nice to just shoot the shit before getting on with my day well a few days ago stew walks over to my desk and begins asking me some questions about craigslist his issue was that when he clicks on an email address on craigslist to email someone it opens a bunch of options that i have no idea what to do with i think on it for a second and then figure its probably because the computers in the warehouse have no default email client they all use web based email because so many people share the computers out there so i tell him that if he just copies and pastes the email address that will work or he can just type it by hand which is what i believe he did because the next morning i walk into work and begin searching through email logs we have a queue of bad emails that couldnt be delivered for one reason or another and more often than not its because someone sent an email to the wrong address by mistyping a letter or some such thing so was the trouble with poor stew you see as i found out that morning stew was using craigslist at work to solicit sex from people creating fwb posts there was a message from stew stuck in the bad message queue to whoevercragslistorg instead of craigslistorg and it had been rejected both the subject and message were there in all of their glory describing in detail what this year old man wanted to do to this supposedly year old busty blonde college girl i lost it and absolutely could not stop laughing i legitimately felt bad more than anything else i wasnt going to tell his boss or call him out on it because he needs his job but it was obviously not appropriate so before he left that morning i met him in the warehouse i pulled him off to the side and let him know that regarding his question yesterday id appreciate it he not use his work email for craigslist if thats what he planned on doing as sometimes it results in increased spam for the company its only been a day now and i havent seen another email go out but i just absolutely had to tell someone because i really dont have a team at work and i dont think anyone else could appreciate it as much as you guys
its been awhile but i finally have something thats tfts worthy a little background i work as a tier not quite tier permissions but i do more than the usual tier support guru at localgovernmentagency localgovernmentagency is quite large for our area about k users supported so we get a good crosssection of the general population calling in now onto the story we recently moved from office to an office environment during the transition everyone was instructed many times over to move their pst filesfolders over to their new mailbox because we were going to delete everyones stuff at deathdate howtos wikis presentations training sessions and anything else you could think of was done to communicate this i was part of the communications committee that created all these different avenues for the project so i had a sense of pride behind our creation of course theres a large number of people that ignored everything we sent out which you would have had to be under a rock to not notice fast forward to today we send out another round of notifications telling everyone the day of pst rapture is upon us in a couple of weeks the calls ive been dealing with today so far about have been exactly like this gtme thanks for calling support how can i help you gtuser i dont understand this pst email thingy that i just got can you help me gtme have you read the links in the email itll show you how to prepare complete with pictures and video gtuser no i havent can you just show me do it for you gtme please try viewing those links first and call back if you need further assistance gtuser but i cant read it gtme have you even tried reading the info in the links i already know the answer but at least i can tell my boss i tried gtuser i cant read it how some of these users continue to breathe and walk at the same time boggles my mind sometimes edit spelling edit holy upvotes thanks everybody
im in college right now and i like to hang out with my friends at the catholic student center thats across the street from campus the center has fun activities that usually include food and it has lots of room to spread out and do homework it also has a pretty fast wireless internet connection this school year the wireless connection has been very unreliable weve had a local it specialist come out many times and had our router sent off for repairs once my friend thinks the dhcp lease time is too long though recently the connection has been pretty reliable so last week i was doing homework on a large table with my girlfriend and her wireless connection kept going in and out while my computer was staying constantly connected she was getting frustrated so i thought hey ill just bridge connections with my laptop like i used to do with my old xbox that didnt have a wireless card then i looked around a little bit found and ethernet cable and connected our laptops together she was really happy that her internet was working again a few days later my girlfriend mentioned to the franciscan monk who runs the center that we were in a relationship we were keeping it on the down low for a couple weeks he said you know i suspected something when i saw yall sharing internet following it with now thats an appropriate pda 
i am a semi retired semi burnt out old tech who retired to a small rural town to spend my declining years supporting small businesses and rural clients i had a customer who had lost their internet connection they where a long way out of town like over km of rutted dirt track out of town so i started out fairly early in the morning to get there by am their internet was down and this far away from anyone they relied in a satellite connection no sync i checked the connections to the modem and even climbed on the roof to see if the dish had moved due to the recent strong winds no visible problems but when i tested the modem it was faulty a satellite modem was not an item i kept in my spares kit so i called the service provider and waited for the tech to organize a replacement now i dont know how you are treated as a field tech where you are from but in country oz australia every visitor is offered at least a coffee or tea this place pulled out all the stops coffee fresh baked cookies and two different types of home made cake where laid out while i was finishing up the call i gave the client the news that it would take a couple of days for the replacement modem to arrive and that i would have to come back then to install and configure it the farmer thanked me for my effort and paid for the service call i apologized that i couldnt fix the issue in one call and that i would have to come out again before they would have internet access he smiled and said that i was welcome any time and suggested i try to be there for lunch next time tldr happy clients that pay promptly baked goods and an invitation to lunch i love the life of a country tech 
so i recently finished a yearlong contract with a very large company with an internal it helpdesk i was on the helpdesk and took st level calls basic issues computer wont turn on internet connectivity is bad etc while i was there it was basically months in infrastructurenetworking which is why i went for it and months manning the phones so whilst i was in infrastructure we were rolling out a massive roughly clients vdi system using citrix this was a really cool project and was a lot of fun so anyway to the meat of the story were rolling it out starting with a group of people in the retail department to trial the new vdi environment this went well and we went live with it everyone who didnt need a dedicated desktop went over to vdi and things were great the network was handling it pretty well at a local level the hardware for this was freaking unbelievable btw a lot of effort went into this and for the most part it went swimmingly well im sure a lot of you here could sympathise with how much of a pain a massive rollout can be at this company we had our main office then we had remote sites a lot of these sites were on g uplinks back to our pdc which was patchy at best offices were on microwave uplink which was almost as fast as being local one of these sites lets call it officek was on such a connection and was also our tdc i got a call from one of the floor managers at officek she had asked for the vdi to be set up at officek which just so happened to be a hour drive each way away gt me it this is abraumente how can i help you today gt floor manager yes could i please speak to the helpdesk manager gt me im sorry hes in a meeting in the moment is there anything i can help you with gt fm i dont think youd understand what i am talking about i want to get the bti set up at officek it took me a few seconds to understand exactly what it was she was talking about when i clicked gt me oh vdi well youre in luck i was on the team which set that up your office happens to be on the microwave uplink so i cant see any reason why we cant do that for you guys ill have a chat with my manager and get the allclear from him and give you a call back after if thats okay gt fm yeah well i guess that will have to do she hangs up she was known for being rude my manager gets back i run the idea by him he says its a good idea as it will allow us to test the network with it i call fm back gt me hi fm its abraumente from it here just ringing to follow up on the vdi install gt fm its called bti by the way and yes what did you need to follow up for i let this one pass gt me just wanted to book in a date for me and a few of the guys to come over and set up your new computers for you is tomorrow okay we actually have guys available to come out gt fm sigh yes i guess tomorrow would have to do wont it at this point im already regretting answering the phone earlier gt me okay great myself and the others will leave here tomorrow at am so we can be with you at around am gt fm alright do i need to do anything gt me nope well transfer all of your local files across to the server during the day and have it all ready to be plugged in and go tomorrow is there anything else i can help you with while ive got you on the phone here gt fm no see you click my manager was listening to the call and when it ended he looked up at me and gave me that oh boy youre gonna have a good time tomorrow grin i rounded up the other guys we transferred data across got everything ready and went home at in no way expecting the complete shitstorm which was to ensue the next day am the next morning we arrive at officek unload sign the log book and go about setting up new computers everything is actually going pretty smoothly until fm gets out of her meeting she bursts into her office where i currently am setting up her new vdi desktop now i cant really explain what exactly happened here as i honestly have no idea she flips out into this psychotic rage picks up the vdi desktop and smashes it against the polished hardwood desk dells are tough as nails a bit of case damage but thats pretty much it her desk however has a nice three inch gouge in it she gives it another go this time on the floor computer busts into pieces i see ram and fans flying in all directions she storms out screaming i didnt ask for this over and over gets her nametag aroung her neck caught on the door handle as she scans herself out falls over knocks herself unconscious and kinda lies there for a while meanwhile im standing in this room with a broken computer holding a keyboard in one hand and a mouse in the other my mouth wide open completely flabbergasted one of my coworkers quietly walks in asks what the hell happened and kinda stands there with me she eventually comes to and has a coworker help her up she sits up against the wall the exec gets called in she explains that i was stealing her computer and that i dont even work for company police arent called but she was put on three months leave with pay turns out her husband had just up and left out of nowhere completely disappeared she must have had some of psychotic episode from stress anyway finished up as best as we could in officek got in the car and headed back to head office by the time we got there word had spread and we were met with cake and beers i loved that job tldr woman asks me to install a new computer for her flips out when she sees me doing what she requested accuses me of stealing her pc falls over goes away for months i get cake and beer edit jesus almost upvotes thanks for reading everyone ive got more stories if youre interested in hearing them most of them arent as interesting as this but theyre still pretty cool thanks for all the love 
the old boss quit under the stress created by our hormonal female manager who always backed the customer not the service desk tech i interviewed for the position but narrowly missed the grade a new guy who had only been working there months got the job and made my life a living misery we were all told that desktops team were the only ones to go out to a users computer us on the service desk were relegated to callcentre like status despite being the only one with any meaningful experience on the service desk i was constantly denied opportunities it was a thursday as a first aider i had attended the mandatory meeting which superceeded any teamrelated nonsense off the back of that i had a fire warden meeting in the same room my boss had put me up for both roles as i got back to my desk after minutes i delved into my work first call to install a card reader cant do it remotely as the machine has to be logged in as an admin and logging off the user disconnects my session its a minute fix and the machine is seconds walk away desktop support are so busy that their lead time is days i sneak off to the toilet and fix it director has a faulty monitor sure hes on my way home so i can replace it after i leave at i get procurement to allocate me one and schedule desktops to collect the faulty one i take a few cables just to be sure local councillor cant connect to the internet he lives opposite the offices ten minutes to determine if its machine config or faulty internet and the isps problem ill do that as im waiting for the bus to see the director communities team need software removing and reinstalling theyre based minutes from my house ill drop in before i get home i got did all of that then got chewed out by my boss on friday for doing the work that other people should have done he said i was doing it for the glory and refused to understand that these people deserved better than a simple fix will take days worse the manager backed him as she thought i was betraying the team i never claimed overtime flexitime or any extra for that work i just completed the work for the good of the customers and in the most efficient manner possible i quit the following year
oh hey look a call from corporate and its actually daylight outside lets see what theyre up to fm hello george hey flyingmonkies its george well this isnt good i explained in another post george was one of the group of people affectionately known as the four horsemen of the apocalypse if a case got to george something had gone seriously wrong at a customer site and whoever george was talking to was about to have a verrrry long day fm hey george youre calling to make me cry arent you george not my fault what some endusers do speaking of endusers i need you to go onsite customer went ahead and deleted root on the backup server fm you mean homeroot george no i mean root sigh background on the customer this was during the dotcom days someone came up with a brilliant business idea and their business plan called for a windows environment one of the large unix providers didnt particularly like hearing they were being cut out of the order based on windows so they gave a major discount to the customer for buying their unix machines management had already hired a bunch of windows admins but the discount was good enough that they decided windows unix and purchased the servers the backup servers we sold ran on unix but didnt host any of their business apps their words not mine so the windows admins took to testing things on the backup server now back to our story fm how bad is it george youre talking to me after ive spent three hours trying to scrape this out of the ditch how bad do you think yes george knew the nickname we had for him and the three other horsemen he reveled in it fm bare metal recovery it is so i drive the two hours to the colo site to meet the customer and he shows me to the server its sitting at an okgt prompt about where you would expect a dead server to be sitting on the plus side hes already got the os disks sitting on the server i throw disk one in and start the reinstall fm so what happened customer well we logged into the server and saw a message that this net file system was full i didnt have anything in there that id needed so i went ahead and did an rm rf net to clean it up when suddenly the server panicked facepalming in front of a customer is never a good idea especially when you get to explain something to them again that youve already had this conversation three times previously fm net customer yeah not sure why that would have affected the server fm remember the last couple of times i was here and asked you whod exported to net then mounted it back to itself on the backup server customer yeah fm do you remember me telling you not to do that customer i remember but i dont remember why it was bad fm well when you did that youd exported the root file system via nfs then mounted it back to net as id said before anything you did in net was going to affect root by doing that rm rf you deleted the root file system customer fm you shiftselected everything under c then hit the shiftdelete key customer ohhhhh fm you want to find the person who did this and beat them preferably with something heavy customer but we never did that sure the server just decided to randomly do it to itself again fm did you ever lock down the box as i recommended with individual user accounts and sudo requirements export logs to a log server customer service is allowed to recommend we dont setup if they want us to setup something thats a professional services engagement which costs money no one wants to spend money to get something setup for them customer well no fm ok then youre not really going to be able to figure who did this im going to need the disaster recovery report from the last backup so we can do the recovery when the os installpatching finishes we had this great report that ran at the end of every backup of the local machine all of the information you need to perform a bare metal recovery of the backup server in the event something goes horribly wrong like when you delete the root file system customer that email report yeah we stopped the server from mailing those to us fm customer we didnt like receiving the email every day fm so you dont know what the last tape id used by the server for the self backup was customer well its in the library looking at the tapes in the library unit fm well you have tapes there which specific tape is it customer how would i know fm well its listed in the disaster report customer started to figure out exactly how sad of a day he was going to have at that point he was able to find a copy of one of the reports it was only six months old fortunately the tape from that backup was still in the library so we were able to use that the customer then got to manually import the or so tapes that were created after that report so they had the ability to restore files from other machines only took a week or so to import them all
so this happened months ago i was playing with my laptop at home and my year old little champ niece hit my laptop hardactually she hit the dongle connected in the usb port and bang i saw a pink transparent on lower half of my screen i was worried very much because the laptop has passed the accidental warranty period months ago and i was am just a jobless year old i immediately called the hp tech support and they asked me to come to the service center thats the procedure in india which is kms away from my homeroughly a hour travel on bus also they said to me that it would cost around rsroughly to change the display and then i was really worried not only because i have to travel kms but also rs is far fetched at that point of time for me so i was worried for two days and then went to a local pc assembling shop and i explained to the techie there that i cant really afford k at that time he listened to me with cool head and asked me to power on the laptop and then when the pink transparent part showed up on the screen he just placed his hands on the edge of the monitor like on the exact point where the top of the pink layer starts and pressed his thumbs hard and bang my screen became normal and he didnt charge me for anything which was so nice i am not sure whether he saved me which is more likely because the hp techies always try to charge money for simple problems but he definitely saved me hours of travel thank you techie edit fixed lap to laptop after umsstark comment edit typo previously referred niece to he gttldr local techie repairs my laptop with his magical thumbs i always regretted not thanking him on that day as he was very busy but for him i thank you all techieslt

the general formula of having customers undo your hard work isnt new i know but this one just broke my goddamn heart because it was so stupid a laptop had a failed hdd i failed to feign surprise the customer hadnt backed up any of their thousands of photos from the last years i didnt even try to feign surprise instead i upgraded it to an ssd reloaded windows stuck all the usual free useful software on there activated it by slic because the coa had worn beyond legibility and when he brought his cameras sd card in did some data recovery to get back some of his photos all good he had a windows retail pack in his hand when he came to collect it now if id been thinking i mightve asked him more about it because it tells a story it says the coa on the laptop wasnt windows it says he bought a pack himself and upgraded it it says he likes to tinker still i showed him the machine working showed him how to do a few things showed him the software id installed it was obvious he no longer needed to use it obvious right right i got a call from his wife today not hours later reporting that shed put windows on as per his instruction and now everything was gone the recovered data the programs the shortcuts i probed with a few questions and yes sure enough hed told her to stick the windows cd in and install windows quote well need this on there theyd done it from within windows too theyd put the cd in and followed the autorun installer while windows was booted up because they thought they needed windows me why did he think that needed doing her he said it wasnt on there the data was retrievable from the windowsold of course his dignity probably wont be

so at my office were spoiled in that we only have three models of laptop to support its a case in which the initial batch model the oldest was bought four years ago for everybody as people came on board afterwards they were provided the next generation of laptop model as model was no longer being made model came about the same way model no longer available but it was provided to new people now the office is looking at model which is going to eventually be slated for a mass replacement of all the model s generally speaking the model s are pieces of crap s and s are actually really nice it will be good for everyone having the s out and having wellrunning equipment all around anyways we have a demo model of the for testing in our office cue cluelessguy cg hed been told to come in for a bios update to fix a known issue usually this is about a five minute process and of course he comes in and spots the demo model and immediately starts asking for one gtcg just give me one of those that will fix the problem this thing runs like crap im a bit puzzled because hes got a model ivy bridge i gb ram gtmakesnosense thats a little strange youve got one of the newest ones here already but im sorry youre not due for replacement yet those are coming for the people who have model s gtcg well you should give me one anyways i can barely get any work done on that piece of crap will this boss upgrade help gtmakesnosense it will at least resolve your battery charging issue but i cant promise the computer will run better this shouldnt take long but before we get started i see you have a few documents open the process requires a reboot so could you please save and close all of your documents he gives me a look as if i had just told him we need to put wasabi in his eye gtcg are you serious i have to close all my stuff we go back and forth for a few minutes while i explain and in a huff he starts savingclosing and savingclosing and five minutes pass still savingclosing so i start counting how many programs he had open at he says its nothing important anyways can i just push the button im not real keen on that but the problem is already obvious i do a shutdown and windows yells that there are programs open force them all closed do my thing and i explain that if he actually closes things as hes done using them then his computer will run much better i have no idea if he understands or not some quick math programs closed that i counted plus more that were left when we shut it down for programs the five minutes of saveclose he may have been doing four windows per minute for an additional windows total of programs or more sorry dude no computer is going to run well when you have that much stuff open no way no how edit yay formatting edit you all rock thank you for all the feedback and upvotes to answer a few questions no cg did not get a new machine we are stuck for years once an asset is tied to us he had a mix of programs open handful of our proprietary software probsbly a dozen or so powerpoint presentations maybe excel spreadsheets another or so word documents etc we are a large enterprise environment so we tend to run a bunch of crap in the background too on an idle windows session we have processes running to begin with i dont think he didnt know how to close windows rather i think every time he needed something he just opened a new copy of it he seemed to genuinely not know what he was doing was incorrect during a follow up conversation and yes i agree with the responses that he should be doing something that doesnt involve a computer anyways he does too and i edited my confusion of cue and queueu
had an elderly man roughly years old come in and say his allinone isnt turning on all the way i turn it on device posts then says no bootable device found at this point im thinking the hard drive is corrupted failed etc proceed to open it up to pull the hard drive to check the condition and check the possibility to retrieving data when i finally get the thing opened i understood why it was not detecting a boot device there literally was no hard drive in the allinone trying to explain what the hard drive does to an year old man has proven to be difficult question in what scenario would an year old man somehow just randomly lose his allinone hard drive one day the device was not easy to open
i work as an it support specialist for a medical company in the southcentral arizonan valley its a fairly easygoing job and often times problems are rather simple one of my tasks is to set new hires up with user accounts in active directory easy enough we had a new hire start working today and i had passed along her account info to her supervisor as i usually do not twenty minutes into my monday morning i get a call on my personal cell phone which i dont mind too much seeing as i made the choice to put it on my email signature i just would have preferred that they opened a ticket instead our conversation went a little bit like this me this is basilthebatlord nh new hire help i cant log in the username and password you gave me are wrong me is that so let me take a look for you i remote into our active directory server and reset her password to what i emailed her supervisor just as a precaution me give it another try for me nh its just returning to the log in screen red flag number one i try to remote into her computer but apparently teamviewer wasnt running no big deal ill just use windows rdp to get in windows remote desktop connection is not enabled on this pc i was a little bit frustrated at this point but i held my tongue and went out to her office which was just up the road again no big deal once i arrive at her office i have her log in for me as she types her password she uses the caps lock as the shift key red flag number two she then proceeded to click the cancel button without reading it thinking it would magically log her in i almost slammed my head directly into her desk when that happened i tell her to log in again but this time to press the return key and not click the cancel button so she does exactly what she was told and clicks the cancel button again nh oops force of habit lol how can you have a habit if you cant log into a computer to use it it took her a third try but once she got in she was grateful why arent basic computer skills a job requirement at my company
office rumor mills are always fast but sometimes they beat comprehension i walked into the office after the meeting with hr and youngsec where he was moved to it i needed a coffee colorblindit and greypantssuitit came up to me as i reached for the beans gtcolorblind so i hear were getting a new member gtgreyit and youre not happy about it grey it was always blunt she was the sledgehammer of the office no finesse just on the point she was sorta the best gtme yep youngsecs coming to work for us gtcolorblind so how are we going to punish him gtme sorry gtgreyit he did pull the network down for two hours gtcolorblind lets get him to test the switch he fixed by counting the flashes all day gtme haha could we tell him its wrong and to do a recount everyday for a year gtgreyit i think for every hour he wasted for us he should have to man an it help desk gtme ohhh too harsh exposing him to users would be too mean gtcolorblind how about we find the oldest computer we have and get him to use that gtme that might slow him down probably not slow enough though gtgreyit we could get out an old punchcard system and get him to punch everything he wants to write into a pc on to cards gtme er do you know how to punch those cards i took a sip of my coffee the camaraderie was a nice change gtcolorblind no sadly no it was at this point that youngsec walked in he looked happy he didnt realize hed recently pulled down a proud it teams network an it team who was now with him all day it was like a lamb to the slaughter ps i realize the no pranking tales rule however this story is about comrade at arms in the it sector we didnt play any of the pranks listed to anyone

this actually happened today and its my first post to tfts so be nice please i went over to my uncles house for a barbecue this evening and i wanted to show my sister a video i found on youtube no problem i set up my uncles wifi a few years ago and as far as i knew nothing had changed when i looked for his network it wasnt there and had been replaced by a generic named unsecured wifi channel instead i immediately looked up and mentioned it to him mind you my uncle is about years old now and has never been good with technology he let his neighbor install ubuntu onto his decade old desktop because it was running slow and thats easier than replacing the shitty old windows xp machine apparently i have no idea how he learned the os but it runs worse than xp ever did on his computer anyway thats a headache story for a different day i looked up and told him that his wireless network wasnt secured and that anyone nearby who wanted to could jump on it without a second thought i was definitely concerned about it instead of being worried and asking me to fix it which would have maybe taken two minutes of my time he simply looked up and said oh we dont use our wifi its not a problem i could have gone into why he should still be concerned but there were yummy burgers in front of me and i was on a time limit i work overnight shifts at a hour help desk so i bit my tongue and let it go im waiting to get a call from him saying somethings wrong his computer because someone joined his network and played around with other devices on it minor edit tensing

long time reader first time poster a tale of the three kingdoms inside the weird world of traffic engineering the tribe of smashysmashy civil engineers the kingdom of fuck that its less than v electricians and the republic of what do you mean we have to do computers now electronic engineers the worst failures across the system occur when these three groups of engineers have to deal with one system these are their stories cue law and order dun dun i am a proud citizen of the republic the republic currently consists of fullyfledged liam neesons who all have a very particular set of skills and me the roving trainee in addition to our normal duties we offer rd line support to anyone who puts money in the big jar marked beer this story involves my personal favourite liam neeson a man who once wrote code in order to avoid finding a ruler to measure a line at the time of this story i am his padwan he is my jedi master our republic received a communication from yonder gttraffictrainee hello third line technical support how best may i drop my daily duties and sort out your problems instead gttraffic networker we need this mag stud working we need it now the entire traffic network of the city will come to a screaming halt if we dont the planets rotation will be effected cats and dogs living together for those of you not in the know can i be one of you please magnetometer technology has just started to be implemented in ur roads collecting ur traffic data its a simple system really a magnetometer stud buried in the road which has a magnetic field when a car passes over the change in the magnetic field electromagnetism makes the magnetometer send data over domestic wifi frequencies to a wireless repeater which is mounted on a pole tree or stationary pigeon above ground which then sends its information to a wired access point which relays information to a local outstation to the instation back on the call traffic networker has begun to hyperventilate i have a standing pact with another member of the republic to have a bullet shot into my brain should i ever care that much about traffic there have been a lot of these failures recently so much so that the engineers who regularly deal with these are so overworked dealing with the faults that weve started wondering whether theres something deeply wrong with the devices themselves gttraffictrainee let me just talk to our resident ruler of all things magnetometery and lo there he sat my jedi master no doubt trying to hack into our secure network in order to get a nonapproved but genuinely really shitting useful piece of monitoring software working i knelt down on one knee and basked in his aura gttraffictrainee master i implore you i have a message from the yonder department of traffic network a young traffic networker is seeking resolution of a fault gtjedi master but ive got nandos in my calender tho i nodded accepting my masters dilemma he was unmoved by the traffic networkers pleas although i could still hear traffic networkers sobbing over the line however i am afflicted with something which needs to be beaten out of me during my jedi apprenticeship empathy for users it was my job to fulfil the obligations which my master was unable to lest he be unable to enjoy his periperi chicken so i had to cart my butt to site on getting there and opening the cabinet i proved connection from the outstation to the instation that was the easy part now i had to deal with the bullshit that was the outstation system as i said before communication between the magnetometers wireless repeaters and access points is in the domestic wifi range you know the ghz channels dealy so its really great that theres no such thing as channel congestion where local domestic wifi devices can clog up a channel right and its even better that were not in an extremely builtup area where were likely to experience a high level of devices across all channels yeah yeah the little lost stud was in an absolute sea of domestic wifi it was drowning amid the local high schools multichannel wireless internet and so every time it tried to squeak a vehicle detection to its wireless repeater the message was lost in the ocean i tried to call out to it desperately to get it to change its freaking channel to one less congested but it couldnt hear me it was jack and i was rose my heart will go on and on so i had to pull out the big guns and by big guns i mean a wooden box which my jedi master constructed in his garage which consists of a big fuck off access point which i could place on top of the magnetometer stud to yell a hell of a lot louder but still it was deaf to me trapped in some sort of sensory hell nought for it but to pull it out i called up my contact in the tribe gtugg politely ugg gttraffictrainee me traffictrainee you ugg you pull out shinyshiny from road with suitable tools i stand far away for fear of being hit in the face by pavement you replace with new shinyshiny i configu uhh make more worky gtugg decisively ugg of course it was going to take some time for ugg to arrive and pull out the stud so i set up a new magnetometer stud far away from the north atlantic sea that was that stretch of road i put it on a band which was far less congested wifi analyser ftw set up the wireless repeaters and access points to accept the new stud when its put in and left it in the cabinet for ugg to put into the road home reddit food reddit sleep reddit back to the office the next day gttraffictrainee hello third line technical support gttraffic networker sounds of gunshots in the background children screaming the end is nigh its not working its still not working shit now at this point im still a trainee so im having a minor crisis in my knowledge of the system from my point of view its quite simple but there might be something i overlooked my calender is quite sparse so i opt to go out again rather than distract my master who is busy borgifying small animals designing a small camera with livestream capability to put onto his rabbit at site i see the stud is gone from where i left it and in its place a stone tablet etched with drawings i recognise as being uggs report of installation i fear the worst but as i lionel ritchie out into the system hello is it af youre looking for i can actually communicate with the new stud its a miracle but its still not detecting anything i drive my van over it a couple of times still nothing i know the device needs to be trained but at this point its flat out ignoring me i wonder whether the stud is faulty a possibility especially with all the recent failures pointing that way either way im a feeble electronics engineer who hasnt picked up a tool bigger than a hammer in her life so i call up ugg gtugg happy ugg gttraffictrainee me traffictrainee you ugg you meet me at site i buy you tea with sugars deal gtugg decisively ugg when i meet ugg i stand well back as he pickaxes his way into the tarmac and brings up the poor magnetometer which never had a chance to live speared on the pointy end as ugg danced around his kill i notice that the way it had been installed gttraffictrainee uhm ugg when you put shinyshiny in ground where was arrow on top of shinyshiny pointing ugg gave me a wide eyed stare and pointed to his god the sun i try not to facepalm and instead point to the wording written onto the new stud and indeed on all studs gttraffictrainee arrow is to point in direction of traffic ugg so in this case that way uggs eyes went even wide im not really bothered considering that id rather it be an issue with installation then my shitty setup or the congested wifi its a simple fix but ugg started pointing desperately at the back of his van i raise an eyebrow and follow him throwing open the back of the van i blink in the back of the van carnage a mess of halfdestroyed studs and tarmac boxes upon boxes of spent magnetometer casings i realise what ugg is trying to communicate with me with a sinking feeling gttraffictrainee ugg how many of these studs have you installed recently ripping off his shirt and falling to his knees ugg howled at his sun god for forsaking him and that is how i spent the next week recommissioning over one hundred new magnetometer studs just because some genius didnt think that civil engineers might be perfectly nice guys but completely unable to read english edit gold gold i dont even know what that is but i love it
ill say it anytime ive retold this story i dont think anyone has ever believed it i have to be honest i wouldnt either however me and at least two other people in the world know this to be absolutely true i was doing a contract for a major national public sector organisation obviously no names but if youve ever been to london youve been a customer it was your standard high staff turnover pay em till they get bored throw them the bs tasks kind of role anyway one day myself and another contractor were set the task of a machine hunt basically the network was a hodgepodge of bolted on spokes using various standards practically held together with poor soldering and bits of gaffa tape however there were a list of umpteen windows x machines which were apparently alive on the user subnets which needed reimaging to xp or replacing our job was to do the preproject hunt to determine who was using them and where they were i say preproject it wasnt exactly thought out it was some task that appeared from the ether which would most likely be refiled into the ether this is the same organisation who only a few months prior saw a shipment from dell literally get delivered outside their offices which nobody retrieved or was aware even being ordered and over the course of the next hours were promptly retrieved by members of the public yep it got left there overnight and there were only docking stations left good use of public money eh anyway we hunted down an old compaq on our list serial matched ip matched now to talk to the user the user was a guy who wore a grey suit impeccably turned out but who looked like he was about to wet himself with fear he asked us several times who we were what we wanted what for where was this information going etc after placating him as much as possible that it was just an upgrade programme and we were it support he finally relinquished his name it just so happened another machine we were hunting for was right next to his desk our decision to wait around for this user to return was overshadowed by his worried glances after a few minutes of uncomfortable im pretending to not acknowledge you silence we went away aiming to return later ideally when he had disappeared a few days later the same contractor and i were out on a pub lunch the guy happens to come in and immediately notices us hes weird really weird he walks quickly to the back of the pub hovers glances at us and then makes for the door of course now were talking about him like wtf he makes an about turn at the door and comes up to us he nervously asks are you definitely just it support we reply and say yep and he just immediately leaves with an ok thank you of course were weirded out but whatever we just put him down as a fruitloop again another few days later were out on a smoke break this guy appears again seemingly on a smoke break too his eyes are wide as soon as he notices us but as hes already lit his cigarette he kinda has to come out now were wary of him this guy is a fruitcake he tries to make small talk it seems to me hes probing so i just come out and talk about what we do all day pretending to moan about our menial duties anyway it turns out after a few more chance encounters he kinda settles down and starts talking mainly about f racing etc he shows up again on a friday afternoon drink this time with his wife in tow it turns out that he has every right to have been nervous this guy was initially hired as part of a major projects team in the organisation he applied for a role got accepted gave in notice at his old job and duly showed up for work as prescribed however as it turns out in between getting confirmed for his role and actually starting the entire major projects department had gotten nuked the manager who hired him had left the business members of the team were scattered far and wide yet he showed up some receptionist showed him to his desk where he was to wait for someone and nobody showed up he made enquiries all he ever got told was that someone would come talk to him eventually but nobody ever did for the last years he had shown up for work nobody ever hassles him nobody ever asks him for anything sometimes he just doesnt show up and nobody questions it he gets paid every month gets a statutory annual pay rise and thats it hes been filling his time writing books for the past years on this that and the other and that is literally what he does every day as the physical office hes in also has a high staff turnover theres no time to make relationships or for anyone to even really acknowledge him of course he was slightly inebriated at that point i just thought he was plain outright nuts permenantly resident in psychosville i didnt believe a word of it its too hollywood to be true that was until the monday morning we had to check sure enough hr systems showed his dept had indeed been nuked mere days after he was recruited and his active manager on the hr system had indeed long since left the business everything we did to verify his story checked out we even performed a few random dropins and sure enough there he is with word opened and hes tapping out page for a novel he never seems to do anything of course hes back to being nervous again as he let his guard down while drunk and told someone even his wife at the time seemed to corroborate his tale i left the contract a couple of months later but as far as i know hes still there i still even questioned the reality of such a situation however on my first day of that role i duly asked where it was i was told to go with a massive group of people to induction i passed three checkpoints where security guards asked my name and though i wasnt on their list let me through with an ok must be a mess up one even said whos your manager to which i replied i have no idea ive only just arrived he too allowed me through what i went into was an entire days induction for permenant staff a lot of sensitive stuff got said a lot of activities went on nothing catastrophically major dont get me wrong but there we have it on leaving and switching my phone back on i had several voicemails from my recruiter demanding to know my whereabouts i told him id been in induction which surprised him it took me another minutes to track down which it department i was even supposed to be in and even a day later got told i was still in the wrong place while i was armsdeep into laying some network cable this place was so disorganised i cannot think of anything to discredit his account other than how absolutely jawdropping it

edit i meant w not w im dumb edit a w is a form you fill out when beginning employment for those who arent familiar with the treeannihilating abomination that is the american tax system between my junior and senior year of university i declined an offer to go back to my previous internship for a few reasons the main one being the culture and my dads insistence to get out while i can of course this left me without an internship for the summer until my rich professor rp heard of my plight he offered me an hour at almost full time state laws prevented a full hours this is the story of my first day the company rp currently owns is a utility services firm we contract out to telecoms and the like to do their projects the project the company was on during my time was a shutdown of an extremely dated cellular network to repurpose the spectrum for lte our job was to document each of the ish cell sites and determine whether shutting off power to the old equipment would cause other issues usually it was another cellular technology or the tower lights but im pretty sure i saw a microwave oven at one point the business used a step process analyze the images and report sent in from the field techs because they tended to be less than reliable resize rename and zip rrz the files to meet the specifications of our client and upload the zipped files to the clients project management platform on my first day after being given the lay of the land i was assigned to work on rrz each site took minutes for this process and like any good techie i got bored i realized there was a way to break it down rotate any images in portrait orientation resize the files rename them with the site name and an incrementing number add them to a zip archive i downloaded python and got to work three and a half hours later id automated the process and even managed to squeeze a better compression ratio out of it rp saw that the rrz backlog was almost empty and came up to me gtrp how are you doing that you cant actually be processing everything gtme i wrote a script that does it automatically just drag the files from the network share and it takes care of the rest gtrp show me two minutes and several sites later rp was a believer he brought me into his office gtrp do you know what youve done gtme gtrp you turned our three step process into a two step process heres your w gtme just glad to help gtrp you saved us hundreds of manhours i think we can afford to pay you a bit more than your offer stated an hour or two later i went home with a hour raise and a promise of something much more interesting than just processing sites but thats a story for another time next
