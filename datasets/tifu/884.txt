So, I recieved a new watch a few days ago. It's a pretty decent one that runs apps and connects to your phone to allow you to read your notifications on the watch. It's lazy, but it's cool.

In any case, my morning was going as normal as ever, until I decided to go to the restroom. Now, this was no ordinary piss - the force was strong with this one. A few seconds in, I felt a vibration from my watch, which was conviently on the hand which held my pisser. I instinctively turned my wrist to look at my notification, only to realize the error of my ways as the yellow stream came my way.

This is where my second fuck up came in. Instead of doing the rational thing and moving my head away, I opened my mouth in shock.

That is the story of how I accidentally pissed in my mouth.
