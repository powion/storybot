This happened this morning. I'm Australian, so it's still morning, and I'm still shaking. 

For background I'm female, mid-20s and work a corporate job at a big firm. I decided to work from home today. There's lots of perks working from home, one being that clothes are optional. I set up my laptop and sit it in front of my naked body. We just got this new program set up where any call that comes through to my office phone is transferred to my laptop and can be answered on screen, using the inbuilt mic. Brilliant! Lets test this baby out. I first call my mobile from the program and all works great. I then proceed to call my boss (45 year old awkward male) from my laptop and, like a baby boomer using Skype for the first time, lean up close to the mic to test the audio 'Hi Boss! Just testing the new program out! Hows everything going?' I don't hear anything except slight background noises for a about 10 seconds, then he hangs up. Hmm I'll call my colleague (mid 30s nerd-like male) instead. 'Heyy! Can you hear me??' A stumble of words come out from my mic, I hear a faint gasp, a laugh and then after a few seconds he too hangs up. I give up. Maybe it's broken. 
10 minutes go by and I receive a call from a lady that works in the project division. I answer with a 'Hi Patricia!'. There's a long pause. I lean in further to my screen, boobs perked above the keyboard 'Patricia, I'm working from home today, can you hear me?'. I hear a 'oh my god' Then she too, she hangs up. Things are getting weird. 
Not 30 seconds go by and I receive an email from Patricia: 'swallowing_panda, sweetie, put some clothes on'. 

I want to die.
