This happened just umm 20ish minutes ago. 

I was browsing Reddit and happened upon an especially funny thread. Usually nothing I read here makes me laugh, but that one made me break up. I stifled the laughter forcibly with a mix of fake coughing and just keeping my mouth shut. 

Unfortunately this made my face turn red and my co-worker think I'm choking. She proceeded to tackle me (what?) and do some bonecracking huggy thing she thought was Heimlich. This caused quite a commotion and other co-workers came over to see me pushed against the wall, with the female co-worker sitting on me and crushing me while my face is all red and I'm huffing and puffing. 

On the plus side, my face was in her cleavage for a few minutes, I kind of did enjoy that.
