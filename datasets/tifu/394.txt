This happened a few days ago.  I was out with my two youngest kids at the grocery store. When we were pulling up, in front of the Christian Book store next door, there was a mother and two young kids, probably about 5 and 3, holding a sign that said they were "poor and hungry, please help." I am trying to teach my children about giving back at a young age so they grow up to be good, helpful and respectful people. Since we were going into the grocery store anyway, I picked up a small jug of milk, some bread, some fruits and two pieces of candy for the kids (since it's the holidays and it was starting to snow, the candy was more of a bonus for them being forced to stand outside in the cold). I explained to my boys what we were doing and they were excited to help out. We paid for all of our things and walked out. I was feeling pretty good about myself at this point. We walked over to the family standing in the snow and I handed the mother the bag. Her reply was "No, I would like cash" 

I'm sorry, but if you're "poor and hungry", you should be more than excited that someone would go out of their way to buy some essentials, or even accept it for the children, because the children definitely looked like they have been missing more than a few meals recently. She, on the other hand, did not. I set the bag down next to the children, said Merry Christmas and went on my way. I watched her eat the candy out of the bag and set the rest next to her. Luckily, my children aren't quite old enough to realize what happened and still think we did a good thing. I will continue to let them think that.

TIFU by trying to help a family who claimed they were poor and hungry, found out only the children are (probably) hungry and were being used to get cash.
