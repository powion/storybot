Super open-ended common title, I know. What could have gone wrong with this redditor's masturbation session.... It's a wonder any of us here at /r/TIFU even masturbate anymore..... Oh but we do.
Anyway, when I originally posted this it had happened this only moments before, but I forgot about the rules and so now I'm trying again, on a week end. This cant have happened in vain....    
    **Context:** So I've been trying not to masturbate lately for personal reasons. (Now before I get any comments or PMs referring me to /r/NoFap, I know already! This isn't a serious rule for me or anything, I don't need anti-fapping support, don't worry. But it is a lil' goal I set for myself.) I've been doing alright! Haven't gone to town on my down town playground for a normal amount of time for a decent human being. The Gods of General Genitals were pleased.    
    **The FU:** Now, I'm getting ready to go meet a friend, and so I hop in the shower to create some sort of illusion of being human. And in there, I see my shower head. I think to myself "You know.... This isn't exactly going along with the promise I made myself but HEY, I've done pretty good. I can give myself a little reward..."    
    I grab that handy-dandy shower head, and start applying it to the necessary areas, using all them massage settings. (Oh yeah, you know what's good.)    
    So, we renovated fairly recently and in the beginning my shower was having all sorts of problems settling on a temperature to be. It would jump from freezing cold, to scalding hot all the time. But it's been a long, long time since anything like that happened, and I figured all that was behind me.    
    WELL I WAS WRONG.    
    Just as I was climbing to the point of hallelujah, the Gods decided to punish me and the heavenly cascade of water quickly turned to jets of burning hell-fire targeted at my very most sensitive area.    
    Much swearing, awkward angles of checking out the damage and a bag of frozen peas later, here I am writing all of this to you guys.    
    **TL;DR I boiled my clam.**    
    /u/Cyae1 made this nice video thus immortalizing this horrific moment in his lovely voice.
