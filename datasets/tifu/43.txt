I just witnessed/accidentally participated in one of the worst public break-ups I've ever seen in my life. *(About 3 hours ago now - this is a copy of my direct post to Facebook upon occurrence)*. 

There's a couple standing in front of me on the tram [Melbourne trams = endless, *endless* entertainment], when the bloke receives a text message and his lady just happens to see who it's from (no matter that he tried to frantically hide it from her view - we are woman/we are eagle.)

She IMMEDIATELY starts screaming at him and slapping his business suit and going on about **"HOW FUCKING DARE YOU"** and all that. 

The tram stops.

She rips off her engagement ring, storms off the tram, and throws the ring back at him....which I inadvertently/instinctually catch **on the full**. 

With one final "**FUCK YOU TO HELL!"** - the doors closed and it was just me and him standing there in silence for like a solid minute. 

Me: "Uhh...do you want this? *Orrrrrr*...?"

Handing back that goddamned ring in front of all those people watching was one of the most awkward things I have ever had to do IN MY LIFE. 

Real.

Edit: Went to sleep with 1 upvote - woke up with a whole wolf-pack. 
Cheers for the read, guys! I'll get on replying to you all while pretending to work at the office today (props for the excuse to not work on a Friday as well)
