This fuck up actually happened 6 years ago and i think my family will never let me forget it.  
&amp;nbsp;


When I was 18 me and my BF decided we should have sex for the first time! All went well...yay us!    

Life goes on, a couple of months later and I am sitting at the doctors appointment. After I tell my doctor I am no longer a virgin she informs me I should do a pap test and I was like "oh ok, yeah, maybe I should". (For those of you who don't know, a pap test is used to look for changes in the cells of the cervix or vagina that show cancer or conditions that may develop into cancer.)  

She goes to set it up but the hospital computer system wasn't working so she says "I can't set up a date right now, your mother is scheduled to come here next week, can I tell her the date or do you prefer that I call you?"  I was very social awkward so I say "No no, just tell my mother the date and she will tell me".  

This is where the fuck up begins...  
I am home, both me and my older sister are helping my mom preparing dinner, you know, just chopping onions, potatoes while goofing around and I tell her "So, hey mom, next week when you go to the doctor please ask her the date for my pap test" complete and absolute silence...and I was like "hey mom? you heard me?"...and she looks at me strange and puts down the knife and just keeps staring while my sister facepalms really hard. So I realize something is wrong and I start to get nervous. My sister says "we will be right back" and pulls me to the living room while my mom just stands there looking at me in complete silence.  
I was so confused, and my sister starts laughing and says "WTF are you doing? Are you stupid?".  I didn't understand what this was about and my sister realizing that starts laughing even harder "ooooh my god! you didn't know? At this age the only reason for you to do a pap test is if you had sex". As soon as she ends that phrase in comes my father and he just looks at us and asks "who had sex?" oops...it was at this moment I knew I had fucked up.

&amp;nbsp;  
 

tl;dr: Told mom my doctor was going to inform her of my pap test date. Sister laughs, pulls me aside and explains that the only reason to do a pap test at this age is if I had sex. Father arrives and hears everything.
