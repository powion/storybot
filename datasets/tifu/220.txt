Okay it seems that I must post that this wasn't today but like 18 years ago in HS.

I was set up on a blind date by a buddy of mine. I was the quiet but funny and nerdy kid who was essentially the king of the band geeks. She was a conservative and quiet girl about my age from the rich part of town. 

We talked on the phone for a few days (as was the style at the time) and I worked up the gumption to ask her out on a date-date. 

She said yes. 

I picked her up, and after some basic pleasantries with her mother, we drove off in my car. 

"Where are we going?" She asked.

WELL SHIT. I hadn't actually connected the idea that I needed to plan. Normally I just wing it. So... I winged it....

"Where nobody can hear you scream" I replied. 

I chuckled and kept driving, thinking that she got my "joke". A minute of awkward silence later and I asked "Where would you like to go?"

"Home" she said with the defeat in her voice that you'd expect from a 10 minute date-gone-wrong.

Shortest date ever.
