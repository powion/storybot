My boyfriend and I have been dating since high school. When we went to prom together three years ago, I asked him what color dress I should wear, and he disgustingly told me, "anything but purple." The last three years, I have been avoiding wearing purple, buying purple, decorating with purple, etc. because I thought he hated the color purple. 

Today, I told him I found a shirt that I liked but I didn't get it because it was purple. He was extremely confused, so I explained to him why I have been pretty much avoiding purple for years. He laughed, and told me he doesn't remember saying that and that he was probably just messing with me. So much wasted time and energy trying to keep purple out of his life so he wouldn't have to look at what I thought he believed to be a disgusting color.

Edit: Everyone is taking this post way too damn seriously. I thought my boyfriend didn't like a certain color, so I didn't fill our lives with that color, it's not like I put myself into some extreme hardship or something to think about what he likes, too. It is possible to take into consideration what other people like while still having respect for yourself. Damn.
