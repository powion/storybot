This wasn't today, this was about 18 years ago, but it haunts me every day.

When I was about 6 I had a friend from school who wasn't quite with it. I'd been lumbered with him as a result of my mum and his mum working together. His mum was really worried about him and felt that he was acting strangely because he had no friends. When I say acting strangely, he had recently collected all of his parents' clothes in the front room and set them on fire, then sat by the window waiting for superman to arrive. "Strange behaviour".

So he's at my house one day and we're playing some stupid superhero game when he comes out with, 'You know The Flash? I can actually run faster than him.' So I call bullshit and he says, 'No seriously, I haven't shown anyone because I don't want them to take me away and do experiments, but I'll show you if you promise to keep it secret.' So my 6 year old brain is now becoming slightly more convinced and he suggests as means of proof that we should get my hamster, bring it to the top of the stairs, throw it down and he would super-fast race down and catch it before it hit the ground. So off we pop, hamster in tow, he throws it down the stairs, before he even takes ONE step it smacks against the wall at the bottom. I stared at him for a few seconds in utter shock. I have a sobering moment of clarity thinking 'of course he couldn't do it, why the FUCK did I think he could?' I burst out crying, mum comes out, sees dead hamster, I never see that kid again. Don't even remember his name. Fucking idiot.
