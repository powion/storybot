So I made [this sex calendar](http://i.imgur.com/th1wVCM.jpg) as a joke for my boyfriend who's in town right now. I put it on the fridge so I can reference it from time to time ... specifically when I want it. 

Fast forward to yesterday, for some reason my power wasn't working correctly, in some rooms it was on, in others it wasn't, so I called my dad over to see if he could figure out what was going on. I completely forgot about the calendar on my fridge and he walked around the apartment checking appliances to see what worked and what didn't. It wasn't until I went to get something to drink from the fridge that I saw it and realized I had to hide it immediately, which I did. I wasn't sure if he had seen it, but he hadn't said anything so I hoped for the best.

Then, in the evening I get a call from my mom. She just wants to talk like always, but then she says my dad said I have very interesting choices of fridge decorations. I didn't know what to say, I just laughed and pretended like I didn't know what she was talking about, but now I have no idea how I'm going to look my parents in the face the next time I see them.

tl;dr I made a calendar that said I want my boyfriend's dick every day and my dad saw it.
