So this actually happened about 15 minutes ago and it still hurts, man. 
I'll keep this as short as possible. So after finishing work and having dinner I decided to take a shower and get ready for bed. After the shower I decided to just put on a t-shirt and a pair of briefs. No pants required as I would soon be in bed. After returning to the wife who was on the couch watching television I decided I would go outside for a quick cigarette before watching a little tv with the wife. So we have a glass sliding door which leads out to our deck and while I'm outside having a cigarette the wife can see me. I can see her glancing at me about every 30 seconds or so. This is when I decide it would be super funny if the next time she looks at me my nuts are hanging out the side of my briefs. So I wait till she turns away the I get my nuts out. Now I'm standing there smoking a cigarette with my nuts out. Just as she starts to turn to look at me again I was taking a drag on the cigarette. And that's when it happened. For some reason the cigarette got stuck to my lip. As I went to get it off my lip I dropped it and it landed straight on my ball sack. Bad times. The wife thinks it's the funniest thing she has ever seen and I can still here her laughing. Now I'm her running my ball sack under cold water while I type this.

TLDR: dropped a lit cigarette on my balls.
