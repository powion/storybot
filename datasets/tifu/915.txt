I work in a hotel as a night auditor. For those that don't know that is basically the front desk person that works 11pm to 7am ish. Anyways, one of my jobs is to deliver receipts under all the doors of people checking out. I start on the bottom floor and I work myself up to the top floor. Tonight, when I got to the 8th floor (top floor) I decided to take the elevator down. The hotel was very quiet around 4am and hadn't see anyone in several hours. As I was on the elevator down I had to fart. No ifs ands or butts about it. I NEEDED to fart. So i did. As I get to the ground floor there is a guest standing there waiting to get on the elevator. In my head i'm like "Damn I shouldn't have farted in the elevator." As the guy walks into the elevator I just hear him gasp "OOHHH man! Seriously?" and I didn't see him after that. And thats how TIFU, but it was super funny at the same time.
