**A**pparently we made an unpopular decision in making this a subreddit devoted to animal GIFs, and for that we’re sorry. **P**eople were loud and clear with their distaste for what we thought was a nice way to change the subreddit, and we have heard those cries. **R**egarding the state of the subreddit, given those cries and anger, we the mods of /r/TIFU have decided to restore the sub, effective immediately. **I**t’s our deepest regret that we did not listen to our subscribers, and for that we are sorry. **L**ooking back on things, we did not anticipate such a backlash, and thought the shift in direction would be welcomed whole-heartedly. 

**F**inally, we would like to apologize for how we handled the situation. **O**bviously, we could have handled it much better and in a much calmer way, but we did not. **O**bviously we should never have done the whole thing in the first place.

**L**et’s put it this way: We were the ones who fucked up today, and we’re sorry for that.

**S**incerely, the /r/TIFU moderation team
