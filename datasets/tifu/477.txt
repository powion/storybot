Its 9:40am in sunny Scotland as I write this, a quiet Sunday morning. I woke up with a pretty bad headache, but after a couple glasses of water the headache still hadn't left me. I decided to step out onto my balcony for some fresh air and a smoke. as soon as my front door closed behind me I realised - Today,  I Fucked Up. I had grabbed my smokes and my lighter, but no keys, no phone, no money, nothing. And my beloved flatmate is out of town until Monday night, even if I could have called her, she wouldn't be able to get to me. Thought about asking my drug dealing Eastern European neighbours if I could borrow their phone, but if they did let me I don't know who I would call - all my family's numbers are stored on my phone. Locked inside my house. 

At this point you may be thinking, why didn't I borrow a phone and call a locksmith? I literally cannot afford one right now. So what did I do? I smashed my fucking kitchen window with a fucking potted plant. My landlord will repair it but it will most likely come out of the deposit I dropped on this house. 

Don't smoke kids. If it doesn't give you cancer it will put holes in your house.

**Edit, the people asking about my doors automatically locking - yes, the deadbolt locks behind you if you dont leave it up - which I usually do. I'm blaming the headache this time around.**

**Edit 2, Yes I smoke the occasional cigarette, can't believe there are actually people who are talking shit about that as if it's the worst thing ever. Or trying to lecture me about the health risks. I smoke sometimes. Deal with it.**


Thanks for the gold. Made the broken window less of a blow to the soul.
