Posted this 3 days ago. Was removed due to rules. Reposting now that it's the weekend. Enjoy.


This did not happen today. And I'm a rebel so I don't care if you have a problem with it.


My housemate often has his girlfriend over, and she's kind of noisy during sex. Not in an annoying way; I just hear her a lot. He has apologized to me about this repeatedly. I never really get bothered by it, but a few weeks ago we had a bright idea to show her what it's like to listen to another couple have sex.


First I had him "bring up" with his girlfriend the fact that my girlfriend and I are into some seriously kinky shit, and it's a little bit disturbing to overhear us. Then I had my girlfriend agree to play along in the shenanigans.


So my girl comes over at night (Claire), and my housemate's girl (Jess) is already there. I hear Jess and my housemate talking softly in their room, so it was time for the show to start. My girl and I start talking a little louder than normal, and we essentially [re-enact this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lQ0-dwl7wo) (she's a great voice actress). 


Then the real fun begins. I start saying some shit like "Yeah, spank me, spank me like a baby" and shit. She slaps my ass really loud a few times. I can hear Jess from the other room saying "oh my god..." really softly. I know my housemate will keep a straight face; his acting is like kevin spacey-level. 


Claire then says some shit like "Mmmm I always loved it when you used to fart on my neck. Will you do it again?" and I'm like, "I'll give it a shot, babe." Then I just make pushing/straining sounds for about 15 seconds, then tell her I'll get to that later. Things heat up, we say a few more ridiculous phrases, I drop the obligatory South Park reference "Oh you do that just like my father..." etc.


But then we took it too far. Jess is in the other room obviously hypnotized by our 'activity' and she keeps whispering to my housemate, "omg! listen! are they serious??" and laughing and stuff.


Then I get a real bright idea, and say, "Oh yeah, oh yeah, baby stop, stop." Claire goes "What?" and I say, "pour some of that candle wax all over my asshole." Claire ALMOST loses it, but maintains. We remain silent for about 5 seconds. Jess is utterly silent. Then I start **shrieking** at the top of my lungs, super high-pitched, as though I'm in severe pain. I hear Jess say "WHAT THE FUCK!!!!" and then she and my housemate start arguing. He tries to calm her down, and tells her it was a joke, but she gets furious that we pranked her and storms out. Now they'e in a fight. And she thinks I am an asshole/psychopath.


**TL;DR: Never pour candle wax on your anus**


edit: spelling

edit 2: Jess and housemate are fine. Jess is slightly irritated/embarrassed that she got pranked, and that the pranking was a commentary on her clownish sex noises. I understand why she is not happy with me and I have apologized. Claire is overjoyed that people on Reddit think she's a keeper.


Whoever narrated, thank you.
