First up, this was a near fuck up, but it still makes me cringe when I think back on it (like most of my life). 
I was driving home from work late at night (part time waitress) and had my music blasting. I was really getting into the song, as always with bohemian rhapsody (fucking A+), when I notice behind me the red and blue flashing lights. I pulled over, turned the music down and thought back to everything that could have been illegal in the past 5 minutes of driving. The policeman comes over and asks if he knew why he pulled me over and although all the reddit advice on this matter says to own up, I legitimately had no clue. The  officer sighed (like a disappointed dad) then told me it's because I was using my phone, holding it and using it on loud speaker  is still illegal (where I live). Now, this is where I realised I sorta fucked up. I had to explain to the officer that I wasn't holding my phone at all and it may have looked liked it because I using my hand as a pretend microphone to sing into. He then, in all seriousness asked for a rendition of the song. I felt like my life was on the line when I nervously spat out 'I'm just a poor boy from a poor family' and he just shook his head and walked away..not sure if he was in awe or horror but I didn't get a ticket and will not be pulling out the "microphone" while driving again.
