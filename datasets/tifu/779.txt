So this didn't happen today but back in high school. My cheeks still get red every time I think about this.

My boyfriend my senior year of high school lived in the same neighborhood as I did, so we saw each other fairly often. He was hanging out at my house after school one day, and my parents decided to leave to go pick us up some food for dinner. We had been dating more than a year at this point, so they were okay with leaving us alone. Well the second they left, we got down to business and the blow job train was a'rollin. 

Since we were both really into it, we didn't hear the garage door go up or the downstairs door open. Next thing I know I hear my dad calling my name coming up the stairs. My boyfriend's pants are down. I've got slobber all around my mouth. Apparently my dad had been calling me on my cell this whole time asking about a clarification on what we wanted to eat, so he had a pretty good idea what was up. 

My bf puts a pillow over his crotch and I wipe the side of my face and sprint to the door. I open it right as he's standing outside of it. 

"Hey Dad, what's up?"

"Hey v_jax, I brought y'all the food you wanted from Moe's, but it seems as if you've already eaten."

Cue silent walkaway. I hang my head in shame. Boyfriend leaves. I eat my quesadilla alone in my room.
