Okay so this was about 6 months ago, but my boyfriend just reminded me of it. Stayed round his house and he climbed out of bed (over me) because there's a wall on his side. I'm a ridiculously heavy sleeper but he actually woke me up for once. 

My face felt all hot and wet so I stumbled out of bed, half awake, to go and use the bathroom to investigate what was up. I was leaning on the wall with my cheek resting against the corner of it because I felt a little lightheaded, so my face was kind of peering round the wall at the bathroom door. I couldn't remember where the light switch was so I just waited in the dark. 

Boyfriend opens the door, the light makes me squint so I cover my eyes, and then he screams. It was the most terrified scream I've ever heard, and looking back on it, it's pretty amazing that a 6'2" bearded, tattooed guy can reach that note. 

Turns out I'd had a bitch of a nose bleed in my sleep, and my whole face was covered in blood from where I'd most likely smudged it in my sleep on the pillow. It had also trailed from my face onto my white nightie, and that combined with my insane bed hair meant that I looked pretty fucking terrifying. I'm no longer allowed to wait in the hall if I want to go pee after him. He also refused to face me when he went to sleep for a while... and he had to scrub my blood off the wall. 

TLDR; had a nose bleed without realising, waited to use the bathroom in the dark, boyfriend came out and screamed when I had blood all over my face in the hall when he thought I was asleep.
