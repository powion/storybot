This was around last week, but anyways, a bit of back story. I am a high school student at an all-boys school. Even so, we have a few female teachers, my french teacher being one of them. I'm not the most popular kid. I'm that kind of guy who doesn't say anything so that people don't hate me if I say something stupid. Because of that, I am always quiet and respectful in her class, which is filled with jackasses, so she really liked me. 

Anyways, I was doing some work while the teacher had been helping others who needed it. My nose was running like a bitch, and so I had to keep getting up to get tissues. At one point, she was bent over helping a group of students with some work when I went to grab a tissue. I tend to sway my arms really hard when I walk, just habit, really. While I wasn't paying attention, one of my hands flew towards her and slapped her ass really hard.

She instantly stood up and screamed "EXCUSE ME?!?!?". She turned around and saw that I was the one who did it. She instantly calmed down a little and allowed me to explain myself because she liked me and knew that wasn't what I would normally do, but my social skills are so bad that I wasn't sure where to start or how to explain it. So I stood there babbling quickly while everyone else was laughing their asses off. We used to talk after school, but now all conversations are plain awkward. I'm seen as the god of the class now, but that isn't the attention I want.

**TL;DR Got up to get a tissue, accidentally slapped her ass. We're super awkward now.**
