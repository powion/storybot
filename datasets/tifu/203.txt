So this was on valentines day and I was making my girlfriend a nice card because she always liked me making her stuff instead of buying her stuff. She was really happy reading the card until 20 seconds in she just looked at me with angry eyes. She threw the card at me and said "seriously?" I felt strange that she did such a thing. At first I thought she was mad because the card wasn't good enough but it didn't really make any sense to me so I picked the card up and read it. Everything was normal until the last line.

"If I was asked to put a price tag on you I couldn't because you are just too WORTHLESS"

I don't know how I could fuck up something so simple. I meant to write "priceless". Even after I explained it to her she was still unhappy about it and I basically ruined our valentines day.

TL,DR : Told my girlfriend she's "worthless" instead of "priceless"
