I'm partially deaf in both ears, and have been since birth.
The technology I use to get through school life consists of a receiver that connects to my hearing aid, and a microphone that teachers have to wear so I can hear them in class, it acts as a kind of walkie talkie type of thing. It has made things much easier, and has helped me on many
occasions. 

But not this one.

So after the teacher leaves the room to go somewhere I think nothing of it, and everything
continues as usual. 

Couple moments later I hear the some cracks in my ear. Whatever, it's probably nothing, just my hearing aid playing up. Then I remember the teacher still has the microphone thing around her neck. So the next few moments were a blur of hilarity and horror as I heard a sequence of rock hard lumps of shit hitting the bottom of the toilet . She was taking a shit and i heard every second of it.
I started laughing in the middle of the lesson but nobody knew why.
The teaching assistant tried to calm me down and asked me what I was laughing at but I refused to tell her.
When the teacher came back into the classroom, I could not look her in the eyes, as I had a vision of her sat on the toilet taking a shit.

Deafinitely wouldn't want to experience that again.
