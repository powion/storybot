So my wife and I are done having kids at this point, and I decided to volounteer for a vasectomy as it is supposed to be much less invasive than her permanent options.   Any time I started to freak out about the upcoming visit to Dr. Diddle, I soothed myself with thoughts of endless, condomless, pregnancyless, sexy hump days.  It's the promised land.


First of all, the doctor didn't use enough freezing.  You know that feeling when someone cuts into your scrotum?  No?  Well I do.


Second, you know that feeling when someone is tugging on your testicles?  No?  I do.


Lastly, you know that smell of your balls being burned?  I wish I didn't.  As a bonus, I could actually see the smoke wafting lazily towards the ceiling.  


TDLR: 1/10, would not allow doc with knife near my balls again.
