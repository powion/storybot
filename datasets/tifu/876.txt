Backstory: I'm from the west coast and have moved to the south. There's a lot of things I don't know.

My boyfriend and his friends had a get-together last night and were hanging out, just chatting. I normally let them have their guy time but was in the dining room getting some pizza and just saying hi. They were talking about football: what they'd do if they were a coach, made their own team, etc. I don't know anything about football but just wanted to add in for the fun of it. I thought for a second and came up with a clever idea. My favorite animal is a raccoon and our state animal is a raccoon. I quickly piped in, "If I had a team, I'd call them The Coons!"

They looked at me for a second, completely shocked. Half the table started laughing hysterically and the other half, especially the black guy, were just giving me the most 'WTF' look. I had no idea what I'd said. Finally they explained it to me and everyone got a good little chuckle out of it and I'm never going to live it down. Needless to say I think I'll just let them have their guy time for now on.
