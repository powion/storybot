I hate all the excessively long posts so I'm going to keep this short.

My little sister is 6 years old. The way I convinced her she was invisible was simple; I took a picture of our couch before she was on it. Then, I called her and she came to me and I pretended I couldn't see her. Naturally, she didn't believe me. So, I told her to sit on the couch and I'll take a picture.

BUT HERE'S THE ZINGER: I showed her the old picture with no one on it. This was all it took to convince her.

Unfortunately, people react differently to learning they are invisible. She was skipping around tormenting my other family members (they were in on it too). It was pretty harmless until she started picking her nose and whatnot.

We had to stop the gag when she began to undress. We gave her some honey and said it was anti invisibility potion and that was that.
