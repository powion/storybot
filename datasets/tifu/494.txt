Like the majority of stories here, this didn't happen today. Here it goes.

My cousin has a cabin right next to our house, and every once in a while, him and his family would come to visit the cabin and we would hang out. My mom had this old creepy babydoll that looked like it had the soul sucked out from it, so we thought it would be funny to prank his dad with it. We found a broom and tied the baby to the end of it so we could lift the baby up to the living room window. Now it looked like this creepy-ass babydoll was hanging in the air by nothing. This would surely scare his dad. Or so we thought...

We left it there overnight, and the next day we went over to their cabin to hear what their reaction was. Apparently they had visitors with them, who were the first people to wake up. Now, this seems like a pretty harmless prank, but the fuck-up was that the family had a miscarriage, and now the first thing he wakes up to see is a lifeless floating baby hanging in front of the window. He apparently had to take valium to calm down. We felt pretty shit afterwards.
