This happened tonight while I was out having a beer with a friend from work. I live on Guam and we get a ton of Japanese tourists through here. It's like Japan's Mexico.  Today was especially hot (about 93*f), so I was wearing a tank top shirt that exposes a tattoo on my left arm.

In walks a Japanese couple obviously on vacation. The man spoke pretty good english and decided the bar was a perfect place to practice his english, so he asks me, "What tattoo on yo arm-uh mean?"

I told him, "Oh this? My grandpa worked on the flight crew for a B-17 bomber in WW2. This is the pinup from his bomber jacket."

After it came out of my mouth and the look on the guys face...I don't know the word for the emotion his face showed...I realized what I had said.  He just exchanged a few words with his female friend and they both dourly walked out of the bar into the night.

Guys, I have never felt so bad for something I've said in my life.
