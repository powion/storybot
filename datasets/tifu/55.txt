At the Canadian border, driving to Vancouver from Seattle with friends:
Canadian Border Agent: "Gentlemen, do you have any drugs, firearms, or dangerous materials in the vehicle?"
I lean out the window towards the officer and whisper: 'Yeah, sure man, whaddaya need?"
Result = a 4 hour delay for being a wiseass.
