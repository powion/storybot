So I got off early from work today and came inside. My wife had been over at the neighbor's place and was just coming back inside. I was just about to leave the bathroom (right next to our back door) and impulsively thought I could be really funny. So, waiting for the perfect moment, I opened the door and yelled right as she walked past.

It was perfect. She screamed and jumped really badly, and then began to laugh really hard as she realized what had happened. But there was one thing I had not taken into account during my impulsive decision. My wife was 39 1/2 weeks pregnant. Keyword: WAS.

Yep. I scared my wife into labor. At first we thought it was just flase contractions again, but very quickly realized that this was the real thing. Thirteen hours later and we have a beautiful, healthy baby girl.

Everything worked out well, but during labor my wife was NOT amused (though the doctor was a little) when she told him what had caused her to go into labor. Still, lesson learned: do not try to be funny by scaring your heavily pregnant wife.
