This actually happened today, so i guess i get bonus TIFU points!

 Well, for some background first: I'm a 17 year old guy, currently in high school. Iv'e had a girlfriend for almost 2 months and today we decided to go ahead and have some fun. I'm a virgin, she's not. Had, a condom , felt pretty relaxed about the whole situation, all that jazz. Overall, i thought stuff was gonna go okay.

 Alright, so i go to her place, we get in bed, start making out, i get a hard-on from the start of it. Stuff was going pretty well, but slow as fuck. It took me like 30 minutes to see her bra. Fast forward a little, after about one hour and 30 minutes im only in my boxers, she's in her panties.

 After having my dick up for almost 2 hours, my heart sinks when i notice i went soft, at this exact time she wants to get to fucking. I try to play it cool, go on with some more foreplay, try to stealthily rub it, but it's dead. It's fucking dead, it feels *numb* by now, im barely even feeling it when she goes for a grab! I try to go call for a bathroom break, i take a piss, try to mess around with it a bit more, but still nothing.

 I go back to her room, and there she is, with a ripped condom wrapper in her mouth. Good luck playing pool with this rope sweetheart! Before  i can even say anything she pulls down my boxers, and boom, no boner, only tiny bald mole in here. She tries to grab it, suck it, whatever man, i don't even feel her down there anymore.

 Seeing as i won't get anything done, i try to cut my losses and go for some fingering. I get pretty turned on by moans, so by some sort of miracle i get back up. She notices and goes in for a blowjob. At this point i should mention iv'e been standing around naked for almost an hour and its pretty cold in here. I realize im actually shivering. I start shivering even harder to the point where im basically having a seizure, dick still in her mouth. During my little seizure i manage to lose it again. With my cock *inside her goddamn throat*. I don't even wanna know what it's like to deepthroat a guy and feel his dick retracting...

  I decide go back in for some more fingering, this time stuff gets pretty heated, i actually raise the fallen soldier again, and as i take my hand out to grab the condom before its too late... Period blood. Motherfucking period blood on my fingers. She notices, and just kinda starts sobbing , and just ran away to the bathroom, locked the door behind her.  

 "Well, no fuck" is all i could mumble as i stood there, butt naked with period blood on my hand and my girlfriend crying in the bathroom.

**TL;DR**: Got to have sex with girlfriend, too much foreplay leads to dick getting tired.


 **Edit**: Apparently my gf browses reddit every now and then. That seems like a pretty bad thing right now, but it makes this whole thing even funnier.

**Second edit**: This shit blew up. I don't know which one of you crazy motherfuckers glided me, but damn i feel like i just got a medal for not getting it up. And it's awesome!
