This FU happened this afternoon, when I was in a meeting with my boss and the CEO. This is my first job and I have been doing it only for 6 months. I talked to the CEO about work sometimes but this was the first time I had to sit in a meeting with him. When the meeting was going to end, he asked me if I got what I had to do and I responded him: "Yes, m'lord"

My CEO is British..

Update: Since some of you asked, this is what happened after 
"CEO: Did you just address me as "My lord"?
  Me: No... Yes.. It was unintentional, Sir
 CEO: You don't have to call me Lord or Sir, instead i will make the guys in the office call you "My lady" if you can reach [this number] (double the target for the project we gonna do)"
He left after that, not sure if he felt it offended or funny but my boss burst out laughing.
I mentioned he is British since he is not local and i thought he might feel offended thinking I was sarcastic.
