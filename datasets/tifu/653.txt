This didn't happen today, but I didn't have internet or reddit when this happened. I feel like sharing it with you.

When I was really young I used to think that there were 2 types of diseases: the ones that can kill me and the ones that won't kill me. The ones that could kill me were the ones that I saw my mom being seriously worried about. Between them, cancer and pneumonia.

Eventually, when I was around 7 or 8, I became sick. I had bacterial pneumonia. My mom got worried. As a consequence, I automatically thought I had a killing-tier disease.

The next day at school I could only think about the possibility I could die at any moment. I felt obliged to tell my friends I was sick, but I couldn't remember the word "pneumonia". As it was a killing-tier disease, I thought that calling it "cancer" would have the same impact. As you can imagine, it didn't.

All my friends told their parents I had cancer. A shitstorm proceeded to happen. During the following days, my mom received several calls from parents trying to share some hope and strength with her. When she went to school to pick me up, people would stop her to talk about my condition.

My mom had to spend several hours of shame explaining to people how stupid her son was.

One week later I was healthy again and glad I wasn't dead.

EDIT &gt; wow!! thanks for the gold, stranger!
