This morning like every morning I got out of bed stumbled down to my bathroom and undressed in preparation for a shower.   

Now, I have one of those enclosed cubicle showers and when I opened the door I noticed a small moth in the corner of the shower.  
"Fuck," I thought to myself. "Here's another bloody thing I have to deal with, I don't want a fucking moth flying all around the place while I'm trying to shower."  

So I turned on the shower a little bit to encourage my little friend to vacate the premises, of course it starts freaking out and flying all over the place just as I knew it would. However it finally finds the open door, comes racing out, hooks around and crashes smack-bang into my crotch, where it became entangled in my pubic hair. Now, being a single male who never had much luck with the ladies, I've had no incentive to maintain it, so it was tangled up there well and good.  

Having a live moth in your pubic hair is not a fun experience so letting out a slew of expletives I attempted to remove the moth with a gentle flick... which caused the moth to explode.

It was awful. It was like a scene from predator; desecrated corpses in a jungle.

Needless to say there was much shampoo and soap used that day.

**TL;DR A moth kamikaze'd into my pubic hair and when I tried to remove it it exploded into little moth pieces**
