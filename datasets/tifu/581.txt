Since so many people asked for updates, I wanted to appease the masses with an update to this thread:  https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3ex772/tifu_on_a_job_interview_that_went_well_until_the/:

The resume, which was now in the garbage in 8 pieces, could easily be reconstructed to find the candidate's email address.  I then typed up this email:

&gt; Dear [Name],

&gt; Thank you again for your interest in [company].  During the latter stages of our interview, there may have been an event that could have been perceived as a negative reaction on my part.  Any such misconception is regrettable, and so I wanted to connect with you to clear up any misconceptions.  In fact, in our company's 7-category scoring metric for interviewed candidates, I even scored you as "fairly competitive".  Best wishes here or elsewhere in this exciting stage of your employment search journey.

&gt;Best,
&gt;[name]

Next, I copied and pasted the email to Reddit and deleted it since actually sending it would cause many Redditor's heads to literally explode, and furthermore the candidate might respond by returning with a new resume and stapling it to my warm misunderstood heart.

Finally I went up to the hiring manager and we discussed the various candidates. As there were several that were essentially equally qualified and also several positions open, a gentle nudge in her direction was enough to get the woman hired.  (And there was much rejoicing.  Yay...)

ADMISSION 1:  This was never quite as dramatic or tragic a story as it might have seemed, as the position is for a part-time adjunct professor.  Since usually they will teach classes at 2 or 3 colleges each semester, getting or not getting a job from one college is probably not the end of the world.  Of course, my original action was always a horrible gaffe that needed correction!  But since we were able to get her hired and since I'll see her shortly, I'm not going to awkwardly reach out now but instead laugh it off together when the time comes.  

ADMISSION 2:  Through much of the first thread, I felt like a wealthy land owner during the Communist purges, with the furor of the working class proletariat really rising up at me:  It was something to behold, although I seemed to quickly develop a Stalin-like ability to dismiss negative feedback at will (ah, but never to downvote it!)
   
Tl,dr:  She was hired :)
