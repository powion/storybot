This was a TIFU, eight years in the making. I vaguely remember creating this account and forgetting the password I made... until only minutes ago. 

After giving up attempting to log in about two years ago, I stumbled upon a torn up piece of paper in my closet. And there it was, my long lost password and username. I may have created my account eight years ago, but this is my first post.
