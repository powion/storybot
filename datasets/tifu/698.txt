This happened many years ago, at a crucial point in childhood when a kid's life begins to be set out in front of him.

So, I'm sure like many of us here, I was awkward as all fuck when puberty hit. Puberty itself was the spark on top of many years of shit; from growing up with a violent sister with borderline personality disorder to physical attacks from complete strangers due to my skin color throughout a chunk of my childhood. Probably one of the biggest things that kept me out of touch from my peers was the fact that they were from rich families and I was not.

My grandparents were wealthy and provided us a great education through private schools in a very high-end, uptight community, but my mom had been hellbent all her life to not rely on them for anything else (except for her vehicles, apartments, houses, Starbucks addiction, and other things, while keeping up the facade of being a "Make it all on my own" type of woman), so, I went to school with kids who had parents that were doctors, lawyers, successful-ologists of all kinds, and their lifestyles reflected it. They always had the hottest clothes, the newest tech, and could watch the popular shows on cable and satellite, while I had thriftstore clothes, no tech, and our TV only received Fox. My friends loved the new show Spongebob and would laugh about certain scenes, while I had no clue what the hell they were talking about.

I had one best friend though. He was fun, nice, frequently up to sleep over, watch movies, etc...

It's somewhere around 2002-2003, and my mom had a laptop for her writing that she would let me use at times. The wonders of AOL instant messaging, anime chatrooms, and Gaia Online is where I found like-minded individuals that I could relate to, and I felt like things were okay. I started spending less time outside and more time on a computer, but, even so, I felt good about myself. So, from gaining confidence after a few months of making online friends, I ask my best friend the AOL screen name of my long-time crush.

This girl was "that one" that I had been crushing on for years. From 1st grade to the, at the time, present grade of 7th.  So, I gathered my recently-manned-up balls and sent her a message. I don't recall the exact words, but the interaction went something like this **(I've included my screen name at the time for added cringe)**:
  
**CuddlesTheKitten:** Hi.  
**Her:** hi?  
**Her:** whos this?  
**CuddlesTheKitten:** RadicalElation, from school.  
  *(I used to roleplay on forums and chats, so I was all about capitalization and punctuation)*  
**Her:** oh hey whats up?  
**CuddlesTheKitten:** Not much, but there's something I have to tell you that I'm having a hard time trying to tell you...  
**Her:** ok  
*(After a couple minutes of staring at my screen, trying to feel courageous again)*  
**CuddlesTheKitten:** I like you. I've had a crush on you since 1st grade.  
*(Another couple minutes of silence, but this time I'm in shock over what I just actually did)*  
**Her:** i'm sorry. i dont feel the same. we can still be friends tho  
**CuddlesTheKitten:** Oh.  
  
After that, my amazing internet social skills kicked in. Anyone who spent plenty of time on Gaia, Neopets, and various other sites, knows that there were ways of talking, and terms, used that don't translate well to people who don't frequently browse those places. There was one term in particular that, outside of those awkwardly social worlds, was normally a pretty bad one. Scary to some, even. On those sites, though, it was playful, common, and relatively "normal".
  
**CuddlesTheKitten:** That's okay. **Then I'll stalk you!  n_n**
  
That's it. That's the sentence that ruined my life.
  
**Her:** omg what?
  
Not 10 seconds later, messages poured in...
  
**Her "BF"**: what the fuck did u just say to her  
**Her best friend**: omg u creep wtf is rong with u???  
**Her other best friend**: y the fuk would u say taht?
  
A couple other people messaged, saying the same sort of thing. I tried to message everyone back and explain, just that I liked her and I didn't mean anything by it. I started feeling cold and shaky, and had no idea what the hell to do, so I closed the computer, curled up on my bed, just relived it all over and over and until I fell asleep.

I faked sick the next day. I knew everyone at school knew what happened, so I didn't want to face it. There were only 3 grades with each split into two separate classes, about 15 kids each. It was a small school, everyone was friends with everyone, and most of us had been friends, going through the private school chain, since preschool. None of them remained my friends though. 

I went back the day after and no one spoke to me. Just to each other, and then whispers when I was near. I felt more out of place than ever before, and not even my best friend would talk to me. He told me himself, those words, *"I don't want to talk to you."* Followed by, *"We can't be friends anymore."*

That was the last day I went to school. I faked sick every day after, which resulted in numerous doctors visits with no one able to figure out what the hell was wrong with me. I became a master of it, managed to get a hold of an identical thermometer that I'd heat up to swap out with the one my mom gave me every morning, and even scalded my mouth by holding hot water in it at the doc's office, swallowed right before my temp was taken, and fooling the quickie digital thermometers they had.

It must've become clear that the problem wasn't physical, because I ended up talking to a therapist every two weeks. The guy was an asshole though, even my folks agree to this day that he wasn't much of any good.

My days were spent asleep, while my nights were spent online. I made more online friends to fill the hole caused by my fuck up, and ended up feeling like they were enough.  It eventually got to the point where my mom stopped trying to get me to go to school, and then, after a year or so, I moved in with my dad. I became even more reclusive, despite efforts from my dad, and the local public school system, to try to get me out, in school and around people. 

This continued until I was 15, until there was a knock on the front door at 4:30 in the morning. Two large men were there to take me away to a therapeutic wilderness program several states away. I spent nearly 2 years away from home in wilderness and boarding schools, which provided many crazy stories of their own, with the last facility losing all records of my credit history, so all the hard work I put in with the "school-at-your-own-pace" system they had was lost. I was just credits away from graduating. Came home at 17, just a couple months before becoming 18, no credits, no friends, no nothing.

And that's how one sentence ruined my life.

**Edit**: Since people are asking, I am doing great these days. What I went through made me a better person in the end, so I have no problems with what happened. Even though I have no desire to try to talk to anyone from middle school, I don't hold any negative feelings towards them. 

The reality is that it was just the straw that broke the camel's back. It was really one of the least damaging incidents in my life, but it caused what remained of my beaten-down mental state to collapse. Still, I caused it to happen by being socially inept, which is why it's my fuck up. 

I'm in a very happy place in life with people I love, even if I'm not a success in any financial or social sense. My home is lacking some walls and flooring, and my kitchen counter-top is made of Dollar Tree paper table paper, and I will likely not be able to do anything about these problems any time soon, but I am happy. This was just a cringe-worthy, depressing moment in my history, and it is far in the past.

I hope all who read this are happy as well, and if some of you are not, I hope you get there. I'm open to be talked to if anyone is struggling. I'm no professional, but I have an ear ready to listen.

*Edit #2: No more gold! Thank you peeps, but I've now gotten one on this, one privately, and one for the image of my arm on fire in the original AskReddit I posted this in. I NEED NO MORE!*
