This happened a few days ago, during my honeymoon.

My wife and I were on an adventure tour of Ecuador. One day included a whitewater rafting trip with a group of 4 Germans we did not know. For safety's sake, we were all wearing helmets and life vests. After an hour or so of rafting, we pulled ashore for a bit. My wife and I got off the raft at the same time, with me a step behind her. After glancing over my shoulder at the river, I turned around, reached out, and patted her on the butt, saying "Would you like to go for a swim?"

Two things happened. First, I heard my wife laughing hysterically, but from about 10 feet away. Second, the person who I had just patted on the butt turned around in shock. And she was a 16 year old.

After I rapidly explained what happened, and people could tell from my wife's reaction that I was not lying, everyone had a good laugh. Well, maybe not me as much as the others.

The girl was not bothered at all. Even her father, who was also on the trip, thought it was amusing. My wife is now going to make fun of me for at least the next 50 years, and I deserve it.

TL;DR - A brief case of mistaken identity facilitated by rafting gear led me to pat the butt of a 16 year old girl instead of my wife.

Edit 1: I did apologize profusely to the girl.
