This happened just like 10 minutes ago, I'm still shaking and terrified to go downstairs.

Okay, so in the U.K it's Mother's Day on Sunday. 

Earlier I went to get my mum [a few chocolates etc.](http://i.imgur.com/9TQJgrA.jpg) to go with her presents, and as she was at work, I haven't wrapped them or anything, they were just on the side in my room.

My mum gets home like half an hour ago, and there's a knock on my bedroom door.

''Can I come in?''

I look at the presents, in clear view to anyone who walks through the door, and need to think of a reason to tell my mum to not come in without sounding suspicious...so what do I shout back?


''NO, DON'T COME IN MUM...I'M HAVING A WANK!''

&amp;nbsp;

I'll now never be able to look my mum in the eyes again.

Edit: 

To everyone saying ''why not just say that your presents are in plain sight'' obviously that would have been better than what I did say, but when I decided to come up with an excuse I thought it would have been better than ''I'm having a wank''.

Also, thanks for the Gold
