Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I just need to share this with somebody.

I have had, since ~1 week, a swollen 1x1 cm area on my body. Kind of similar to a pimple, but without the white stuff inside. Just swollen, curving out of the skin a little.

But this "thing" hurt a little. More than swollen tissue normally do. And it also slowly grew in size. So after a week, I began to wonder wtf it was.
 
The best thing would of course be to go to a doctor. But this was located on an awkward place on my body: ~3 cm diagonally upwards from my little-man. And shy as I am, I prefer not show my privates to random people, even not doctors. So I decided to investigate it myself. :(
 
So I grabbed a needle and a small knife, thinking that it might be a pimple that just was a bit under the surface. I have had many of those in my past (and those were easily popped with careful use of a needle). 

I did, however, found out pretty quickly that if this was similar to those I had in the past, this was located a little deeper.

So I removed the top tissue carefully with a knife, and was surprised that there was almost zero blood coming out of this small would I was creating.

And then I saw it. Something was fucking moving. And I feel absolutely disgusted even thinking about it while writing this.
Let's not go into lots of details for everybody's sanity - but let's say like this: I now have, after an insane session of digging, a massive fucking hole close to my poor little-man, and things crawling in my bathroom sink.

And I am scarred for life. Literally. 

I am, in all honesty, afraid of even looking at my privates after what I found - and I think my relationship with sexy-times where I am included, is forever ruined. 

I might even say that my relationship with my entire body is **forever** ruined. (Why the fuck should I believe that the rest of my body is free from these things?!)

This happened 30 minutes ago. And of course I can't tell *anybody* about this, especially since how shy I usually am. 

If anybody wants to kill me, this is the perfect moment to do so. :(

TL;DR: Pimple looking, worm filled madness. **The definition of NOPE.**

EDIT 3: Front page..?! Whoa..! 

I posted this just to share/talk about this with somebody, without taking the risk of anybody close to me finding out - and now it has gotten more attention than anything I've posted (using my main account) on reddit, ever? 

Honestly, I'm surprised how many really good and kind people there are at this place, and it made this process much easier to handle than by my own. So thank you. Really, really much.
