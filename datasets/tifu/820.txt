I finally succeeded by basically pressing the razor as hard as I could and vigorously rubbing it back and forth as fast as possible, but I'm so, so raw, and incredibly late.

I guess I should edit this since it's getting a lot of attention.

I was planning to use my electric clippers, but they had been unused for so long they didn't hold a charge, despite being plugged in all night.

I did cut the beard down with scissors after discovering the clippers didn't work. It was originally 3 or 4 inches long before I cut it. But I didn't have time to cut it super well cuz I was late, so I sorta panicked and tried to improvise.

It wasn't a job interview, I was returning to work after being on disability for awhile.  Yes, I still have the job.  And yes, my boss is already well aware I'm a dumbass.  

As to why I waited until the last minute, it's kind of a long story, but I was sort of living out of my car/couch surfing the prior week, then I moved into a new place over the weekend and just finished unpacking the night before.  I'm also very lazy and like to sleep in.

I'm gonna dip out now and let you all enjoy my stupidity. No further questions.

After work edit, because I care enough to show everyone who's freaking out about me being a waste of human life that I was ultimately successful, an [after picture]( http://imgur.com/F9QVLVJ ) (now with slightly less Muppetface).
