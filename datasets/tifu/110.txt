Last night I was at the bar and ended up bringing a girl back to my place. We hooked up for a while and when it was eventually over we both begin to fall asleep. After a little silence she leans over and asks, "do you reddit?" A little drunk, a little tired, and really surprised a girl like her would be into reddit I reply with an enthusiastic, "Yes! Do you?" the only problem is she didn't ask if I reddit, she asked if I "regret it" as in regretted hooking up with her and my enthusiastic "yes" was not the answer she was looking for. She responded with an angry "Fuck you", got dressed and stormed out before I could put two and two together.
