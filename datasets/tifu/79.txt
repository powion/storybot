Okay so today I was clearing out a house I just bought when I was flipping the bed over (I got I cheep it's an absolute hell hole thought "I can flip this" what a fucking idiot iam) I stumble and I've landed on literally 30 used heroin needles with all the old cooking spoons and empty bags I'm now in hospital getting my blood checked making sure I'm not gonna turn out like Charlie sheen. 



Fuck my life I'm nervous as hell right now

EDIT: Hi guys thanks for all your messages just been reading through them at work cant believe how many people commented the comedy and the advice really has settled me so thank you reddit ! I was in the hospital for 4 hours after taking 4 samples of my blood they've give me an injection for Hep B and now im having to go on a course of treatment just to be safe, I find out in 2 weeks for my blood results. 

EDIT*: Just to clarify no guy called AJAX gave me the shot
