Hi there, this didn't technically happen today but I thought I'd share it anyway.

Backstory: When I was in high school all of 17 years old I had a part time job at the Wal-Mart nearby. I pushed carts every shift and honestly was Damn good at it too. Now there was a boy my age named Kevin that also went to the school who was mentally challenged, I don't know what he had but basically he couldn't talk, mouth always open, wrists bent and he smacked them on his chest, you get the picture.

Now the way you had to bring the carts in was through a smaller doggy door type opening in the front glass, it made visibility quite low upon entering the door especially as you had to duck down to get through.

So there I am one day kicking ass at my job like usual. I have about 16 carts in a line that I'm steering/pushing from the back. Approaching the doggy door I look and see that I have a clear path inside. (I mean who walks behind the cart area anyways right?) As I reach the inside of the building coming through I see it.. Kevin is just sprinting out of nowhere across my path. I can't stop the momentum of the moving carts from the back, not for lack of trying though. That's when WHAM I blindside his ass and he just goes flying onto the ground. Screaming and hollering like a dying animal. I run to him to see if he's okay and he just stumbles off and runs to his parents.

Frozen I stand there for about 25 seconds. NO ONE saw it happen.. And I mean he couldn't tell anybody. His parents were on the other side of the store for God's sake, who let's a kid like that just run around unsupervised? All I know is every time Kevin saw me at school from that point on he would scream and run away, nobody but me ever knew why.

Tl;Dr Bowled a mentally challenged kid with shopping carts, scarred him for life.

Poor Kevin.

Edit: Wow, front page? You guys rock! Especially you, Kevin.
