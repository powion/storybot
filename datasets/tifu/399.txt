This happened a year or two ago, but I have only recently discovered this oh so glorious subreddit, and deemed this story reddit worthy.

This story occurs in Florida. This has a little bearing to the situation, because in Florida, the tidal pools are made the ocean washing over large divots in the sand and the receding tide, leaving large pools of water only a foot deep that little children love, and parents feel comfortable leaving there children in. That is, before I enter the story. It was the afternoon and I was hanging out with a few of my friends, surf fishing. One of my friends catches a bonnethead shark, and one of the larger ones I've seen at around 4 foot 3 inches (that's 1.3 meters for you non-muricans.)As a kid, I remember I always enjoyed seeing what the fishermen brought in when they were surf-fishing, and a few of my friends agreed that it would be appropriate to take the shark in a large bucket we had to show the children. So I scoop up some seawater, unhook the shark, and run off to the tidal pool teeming with children from the ages 2 to 4. As I near the tidal pool, the shark seemingly decides its uncomfortable and shifts around, and I, not paying attention to my footing, trip and drop a 4 foot shark into the kiddy pool. The shark instantly starts swimming off into the deeper parts of the tidal pool, and I move faster than I ever have yelling at the top of my lungs, "THERES A SHARK IN THE TIDAL POOL THERES A SHARK IN THE TIDAL POOL!!!!!" Mothers grab their children, babies are crying, and I'm dashing around in a foot of water trying to grab a bonnethead shark. I eventually managed to scoop it up in a net and get it back into the bucket, and then to the ocean. I decided to leave earlier than I had planned after receiving all manner of dirty looks from the mothers.
TL;DR I caught a small shark and went to show it to the kiddies when I tripped and dropped it in their tidal pool.
