So my two buddies and I dropped acid in my empty house.  We ordered pizza for dinner since we couldn't go anywhere.  time passes  by and we realize it's probably time to get our money together. the three of us go out to the main foyer to count money. my one friend asks, "what do you got b?"  and since I recently broke a hundo I had a bunch of cash in my wallet so I started fanning it out.  He asks again, "what do you got b?" this time more  of a chant.  I start makin it rain with my money and now my two friends are chanting "what do you got b?! what do you got! what do you got b!? what do you got?!

Im now making it rain and dancing while taking my shirt off like its a dance circle.  we are having such a good time, vibing, laughing, that other friends follow suit, one taking his shirt off, both emptying the contents of their wallets on the floor, all three of us chanting, "what do you got b? what do you got?!" and dancing in front of the front door totally forgetting what we were supposed to be doing when all of a sudden there is a pound on the door.  WHAM WHAM WHAM. 

all of the color drains from our faces and turns to unadulterated laughter. we open the door, the three of us shirtless with money and cards and shirts all over the floor, scrambling to find $25.  
sent that pizza guy back with a nice story.
