Happened recently.

The Wife has pinched off a couple of kids, so her stomach is...not taut. Anyway, we were getting a bit froggy and, instead of thinking with my smaller brain, my actual brain decided it would be funny to knead her stomach like a big lump of dough.

"What are you doing?"
"Kneading the dough."

If looks could kill, I'd be dead twice. 

**TL;DR**: Soured her dough

**Edit**

For the record, I love my wife's body. I also love the pun thread and all the great comments. If I could change one thing about this whole fiasco it would be this: the TL;DR would've simply said "D'oh!"
