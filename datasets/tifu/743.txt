This actually happened a while ago, but i fucked up bad...and its still not funny to this day. My family has had good luck in the wisdom teeth dept. My mom never had hers grow in, my sister never had hers grow in..and up until a week prior to this, mine never grew in..but all the sudden it happened and I knew i was in for a fucking nightmare recovery for a week (ive had oral surgery before and im a whiny bitch about it)

So i get there and im nervous and i immidiately say "please...whatever i say during this, dont let it leave the room" they agree and I go under..I remember being told to please stop talking a few times..but other than that..they kept their word and i had no idea what I said...oh but that is NOT the same story for my gf....she picked me up out back after I got wheeled out and this is her story of how it happened in almost exactly her words "You got in the car and I offered to drive you to get a milkshake for later, at which point you grabbed my breasts and started whispering "the wheels on the bus go round and round round and round round and round" and then fell asleep on my shoulder for about 2 minutes...we hit a small bump and you woke up, you thought it would be a good idea to get a new headset for xbox because yours is getting old, you then said that I looked like a jockey from l4d right now....but then as we pulled up to the drive way you asked me to have a threesome with my younger pregnant sister and pee in her belly button because pregnant girls turn you on...(they dont idek wtf) and you said you would slap her stomach like a bongo and you were donkey kong".

At this point i start to remember what is going on...i went inside and fell asleep on the couch...my gf was apparently pissed and told her sister what i said. She figured "drunk words are sober thoughts" more or less. So now her sister thinks im a wierdo and my gf thinks i want to fuck her sister all the time...reddit i have nome of these fetishes, and i have never had the urge to play a pregnant woman's stomach like a bongo..i can see how itll be funny in a few years..but reddit..it isnt funny now -.-

sorry for misspellings..im on a laggy phone :(
