This happened in November. I recently found out about this subreddit and felt an urge to share this.

Backstory: I'm a ~40 year old man from Sweden. My parents and I were born in Iran. I work as a professor at a university in southern Sweden. I have a magnificent beard.

After a week in New York City I was on my way back to Sweden from JFK airport. I'd been to a conference for 3 days and doing tourist stuff the other time. This was my first time in NYC and it was amazing!

JFK is a big airport and it took me some time to find my gate. I boarded the plane, found my seat and sat down next to an indian gentleman with a red turban. I closed my eyes and mentally prepared for a long flight back to Europe. After literally 2 seconds I hear a woman shouting "LOOK ARABS HOPE TO GOD THERE NOT TERRORISTS". Opened my eyes to see a ~70 year old lady staring at me and the indian with evil eyes. Everyone in the plane was now standing up and looking at us.

I felt more pity then anger towards her as I asked her in a calm way if she thought I had something hidden in my beard. The angry look on her wrinkly face changed to pure fear. "SECURITY TERRORISTS TERRORISTS TAKE EM DOOOWN THEY HAVE BOOOMBS" she yelled.

Lets just say the indian gentlemen and I missed our flights and I was searched in ways I didn't think was legal. In hindsight I acually feel more anger then pity towards the wrinkly lady..

**EDIT: Wow this really blew up, even got some gold. OP not delivering beardpic tho. Thing is...I wrote this to prove how easy it is to fool y'all. Wrote it in 10 minutes tops. Don't believe everything you read! I mean, a sikh without a beard? Pff**
