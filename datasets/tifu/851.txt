So I'm a newly recruited member of a dance company. As such I am keen to please and promptly carry out any task that is asked of me. Yesterday the company director (Christian, softly spoken and very 'proper') asked me to send her a version of a song I was going to use for a performance. In my haste to comply I looked up the song on youtube, wrote her a quick email saying "My version is better quality but this is just to give you an idea of the performance piece", hit ctrl+V and send.

Note the part where I didn't actually copy the youtube hyperlink. That's very important. 

What WAS on my clipboard you ask? Oh only this delightful fellow: http://i.imgur.com/mh1I7LM.png 

I linked the real thing and tried to smooth it over but she still hasn't replied. What does the fox say? The fox says IFU.
