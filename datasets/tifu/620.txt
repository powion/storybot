I recently started indoor rock climbing as a way to stay in shape, and finally got my friend to go with me as well. He started to get the hang of things and we were having an awesome time.

A really skilled climber went in front of us (about 10 ft. away) and he had a smallish tattoo on his shoulder.

It looked like this really shredded guy really struggling to get to the top of a climb, which I thought was a pretty badass tattoo for a climber.

"Dang, that's a baller tattoo, maybe I can get one down the road if I get better at climbing. Do you think the guy in the tattoo makes it? I don't think he's going to make it."

My friend looked at the guys shoulder, looked back at me, turned red, called me an asshole, and stormed out of the climbing gym.

That's when I saw that the tattoo wasn't of a climber making a climb, but rather Jesus struggling to survive on the cross. I have never felt so embarrassed in my entire life. He hasn't talked to me since.

Bonus fuck-up: my friend is a very religious Christian and I am Jewish.
