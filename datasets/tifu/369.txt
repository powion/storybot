Bought a bottle of coke and a sandwich on the ground floor of the main building at university. I left the shop with the coke in my hand rather than putting it in my rucksack and went to the third floor to meet my friend. As you come out of every lift in the building there's a walkway to the main floor and on each side you can see right to the ground floor. Slipped and lost my footing, coke bottle rolled along the bannister and then went over the edge. guy behind me was just like oh.. as we both watched my coke hit the ground floor and explode everywhere...
Edit - The bottle didn't roll under the bannister, instead it rolled along the handrail and then over the edge
