So this just happened, and my face is still red. McDonalds as some of you may know is doing this "Pay it with Love" promotion. My girlfriend and her son came to have lunch with me and the only real kid friendly place near work is McDonalds While ordering the cashier says "you can pay this with love, you can give a hug, or high five, blow a kiss". So I turn to my right with the intent to hug my girlfriend, as I do I reach one hand to give her butt a playful grab while my left hand goes out to a guy standing there to give him a high-five.


It's then I realized my girlfriend was standing on my left, and I was just hugging and placing my hand on a strange woman's backside, all while trying to get a slap hand from her husband. The couple looked to be in their 50's or 60's.


What made it worse was not only did the husband start to go for the high-five and stop, but when I realized my mistake and tried to correct to hug my girlfriend, she recoiled too out of pure awkwardness, making me out to look like some weird fast food molester...


I will be "paying with cash" from now on!

*edit. Holy cow gold! Thanks! And I though the only thing I was gaining from this was free artery clogging food and the memory of cupping that round cheek.
