So I've had my dog in training for about 9 weeks. The first seven were ok. Standard sit, stay, lay down- whatever commands. 

So each session is 7 weeks. I was wondering why the "intermediate" training was called "novice 1" but I never bothered to ask. They'd have him sit on an elevated box...I thought "oh cool! He learns how to sit on a scale properly for the vet office." Second training session is really paying off!

Other things too. The trainers would have me do"figure eights" with my dog around two other dogs and I figured it was a way to train him to "leave it." Also the head trainer kept telling me I should repeat the first level. "Why??"

The trainers are super strict. They yell at me when my dog lays down in the sit-stay position and force me to prop him back up. Ok, they're super dedicated. Why does it matter? He's still staying! They want me to correct his sit position because he sits kind of crooked. Ok.

Today I'm doing figure eights with the head trainer and I/ my dog do something that's not up to par and the trainer comes to yell at me (as usual). 

"Get your dogs nose up!!! In competition this would never fly!!!"

In competition this will never fly.

In competition. 

I've been training my mutt for competition for 9 weeks.

this is why the trainers are so hard core.

this is why everyone was so curious to what his breed is.

they think I'm taking my rotten scoundrel to competition. 

Tldr: my "training" class for my dog is actually a competition course and it took me 9 weeks to realize it.

Edit: childish abbreviations. Also sorry I'm on mobile.

Double edit: I know it's late but hers a pic of the dog in question. He's the one on the left. http://imgur.com/5ZWBDbX
