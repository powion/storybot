Nope, not actually today but recent enough, my son (now 3, then 2) and I went to play in the square, had our usual jolly old run-around and all round fun time, right up until he climbed down into a ditch and then asked me to lift him out. No problem, I thought as I reached down, took hold of his wrists, and lifted him carefully, in much the same way as I've seen a thousand parents lift a thousand kids in the past, the only problem being that for some reason I fucked it up and the next thing he was screaming like he had a broken arm. Horrified at hurting my child I balled him up in my arms and carried him straight home, apologizing all the way and assuring him that daddy loved him and didn't mean to hurt him. Turned out to be a sprain, no biggy, but it was a shock nonetheless.

Anyway, cut to later that night and the discovery that a child of two is more than capable of holding a grudge and being a vindictive little bastard, because no sooner had I switched off the light and lain my head on the pillow, lying peacefully on my side with my wife and son tucked up comfortably behind me, than I felt someone move and realized my son was standing over me. I turned my head and in the half light could barely make out his eyes, cold and without feeling. He opened his jammies and I had just enough time to cry out in horror, "No!" before he whipped out his tally-whacker, took a very deliberate aim, and pissed all over my head.

He'd never done any such thing before, and he's never done any such thing since. It was revenge, plain and simple. And it was a dish served...warm.
