This actually DID happen today. I was merrily browsing TIFU before work when I came across this little gem: http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3ahtzb/tifu_by_not_wanting_to_show_a_girl_my_flaccid_dick/
Well, I learned what "a grower not a shower" is. Turns out it is not someone who gets taller but goes unrecognised, or, basically, people don't notice that he has gotten taller.  I've been calling my little brother (a 7 year old) one for years. Before you ask, I did get strange looks and embarrassed my parents on multiple occasions, but I never really understood why. 
I have said this in front of MANY people, including many of my relatives and my parents friends. NONE OF THEM TOLD ME WHAT IT MEANT.

TL;DR -Described my brother's penis to my friends and family
