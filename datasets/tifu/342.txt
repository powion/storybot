I was browsing reddit just a bit ago and saw a tiny little spider crawling on the wall behind my monitor. I get up and destroy it with 1 smack of a peice of cardboard I found lying around.

I thought to myself "hmmmm, if that was just a baby then there is most likely more" 

So I look around on the wall, see nothing

I look up and right up on the ceiling above me is this huge fucking spider just staring down at me

I can't reach the ceiling with this cardboard so I grab a golf club and gently inch close enough to it so I hit it with 1 tap.

I missed

It falls down and is now behind my desk somewhere...waiting

Help
