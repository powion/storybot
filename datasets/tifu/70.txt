Little back story, I've been dating my girlfriend for almost 4 years now and would never cheat on her. We have a very intimate relationship and live together. I am very close with her family, who like me a lot. I naturally have her father, mother and sisters phone number.

We have been planning Thanksgiving dinner for the past few days (We switch off every year with her and my family) with her family on where to have it, I've been out of town for the past week for work and have been communicating through text with her and her family. This is where everything went wrong.


I was texting my girlfriend and her sister. I was texting her sister about her staying out our place after dinner (She didn't want to pay for a cab back would be $100+). Meanwhile my gf starts sexting me from home. Giving me some NSFW pics and dirty messages. I am responding back and forth. She asks me "Show me what you've go right now". Right as I read that I got a call (Work stuff) and have to take care of that really quick. Mid-way through the call my gf's sister texts me back about staying after thanksgiving. In my horny rage I didn't notice she had responded, I just took a picture of my dick, clicked the first option on my phone and sent the pic saying "You think you can handle this?" About two minutes later her sister texts me back "I've been wanting it for the longest time". Needless to say, my response to her wasn't what she wanted to hear, and my girlfriend is pissed. Thanksgiving should be fun!

Tl;Dr: Was sexting my girlfriend, got a call from work, mid-way through call gf's sister texts me, I don't notice and send her a pic of my dick, she says she wants to bang. Thanksgiving is going to be a blast.

*For all of you asking. My girlfriend is the hotter sister.*

Edit 1: People asking if I told my gf. Yes I did, she was angry but understood it was a mistake and I didn't mean it. She's more upset at her sister.

Edit 2: To those asking if her parents know about this. No they do not, we are going to see them next weekend though and we're going to tell them then. I don't like secrets.

Edit 3: You guys seem very on the side of don't tell the parents. This isn't my choice just so you know, I am completely leaving this up to her. She said she wants to because she wants this out in the air. I told her we could do that with just us 3 talking. I'll let you guys know how that conversation goes.

**Edit 4: She has decided to not tell her parents** after your guys comments. Rest assured this will stay between the 3 of us.

Edit 5: To those of you asking "Why did you tell your gf in the first place?" You've never been in a long-lasting relationship. Secrets are basically non-existent, honesty is the best thing. In retrospect could I have kept this a secret? Maybe, but I'm not willing to take the chance of her finding out down the line and being upset with me and losing her. 

Edit 6: Front page! Girlfriend is happy this experience happened now. You'll all be mentioned at the wedding!

Edit 7: A lot of people giving me shit for telling my girlfriend. Calm down people, I handle something one way, you can handle it another. You never know what you'll do until it happens.

**Edit 8: For those wondering how the conversation went between my girlfriend and her sister**. Its as awkward as you can imagine. To the sisters credit she confessed that she actually is attracted to me and apologized for responding. I apologized for not looking who I sent it to. My gf and her talked privately for a while (I left the room). All seems well they hugged and she's staying for thanksgiving... she's on close surveillance though.
