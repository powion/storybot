This actually happened yesterday but whatever.

Okay, here we go. A little background about me. I'm young (mid 20's), I'm a guy, I'm white, and I'm a huge Philadelphia Eagles fan (American football). For this of you who aren't familiar with the sport, the Eagles and the Dallas Cowboys have a huge rivalry that has existed for years.
Here's where I fuck up.

So I'm at work (fast food), this day I had decided to wear my favorite Eagles shirt underneath of my uniform because why not. An older black guy walks into the store wearing a Cowboys hat, t-shirt, lanyard, and jacket. Upon seeing him most of my co-workers greeted him with a smile and a hello. I on the other hand, without thinking, greeted this 60 year old black guy with a "we don't serve your kind here". It instantly registered to me what I had said when all my co-workers looked at me in disbelief. I also realized that this poor guest couldn't see my t-shirt under my uniform. I instantly began apologizing and explaining. I took my uniform shirt off, showed him my phone background, my credit card, literally anything I could to show him I was trying to make a sports joke and not being a racist little shit.

After about 30 seconds of me explaining he started laughing so hard I thought he was gonna piss himself. Then he told me not worry about, and that he understood. I gave him his food for free. Then the manager wanted to have a little chit-chat. I wasn't fired but I was yelled at pretty well.

So that's the story of how sports made me look racist.
