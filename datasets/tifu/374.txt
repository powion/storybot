So I was on a date with a girl to the cinema. The date went well, but it was only a second date, and I still didn't know if she liked me or not. So she went to the bathroom, and I decided to go to the shop next to it while waiting. Now we had gone to see the hobbit and I was starving as i hadn't eaten since dinner before, and I didn't feel I needed a snack during it, and I didn't want to ask her for some in case she thought it was weird. 
So when I went to the shop I saw condoms, and I started to ask myself if I may need some myself. Now I'm a 19 year old virgin, so I'm very oblivious to any signs of interest from girls, and I never had a need to already have condoms. Now I only had enough money for the condoms by themselves, and then I wouldn't have been able to afford the chocolate. So I bought the chocolate. BIG MISTAKE. 
I drive her back to her college apartment, and walked her to the door. She then invites me inside for some tea. Now being inexperienced and kind of clueless I think she genuinely means a cup of tea. So we are there sitting on the couch drinking tea when she leans in and starts kissing me. Things escalate and she's dragging me to her room and we start getting undressed. Then she ask the dreaded question,
"Do you have a condom?"
So now I'm sitting here, still a virgin, with a mars bar wrapper in my hand.
TLDR: Bought a bar of chocolate instead of condoms while on a date, and now I'm still a virgin because of it.

Edit: wow thanks for the response guys it is really helpful. I decided to take the advice of a few of you and rang her. Things seem all good, and she wants to go out again. Pretty clueless as to what I'll do, but I'm definitely not forgetting the condoms.
