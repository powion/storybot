This happened around an hour ago. I have had time to let the blood, tears and shame wash from my soul in the shower.

Tonight I have a bit of a special evening with a girl I have been seeing so I thought I'd have a little clear up of my man forest using the clipper part of my electric razor, as is natural in these situations.

There is a particularly difficult part to this procedure which is the most commonly forgotten region of a man's body - the gooch (for those that don't know it's the bit between fun bag and poop hole). To get to this part it requires a very unflattering squat over the toilet, lifting man parts up, and peering under to see what you're doing. 

Music on full volume and concentrating intensively on not castrating myself what better than my estate agent accompanied by two innocent prospective tennants,  to see me, balls in hand, squatting over the toilet staring at my gooch, and singing "riders on the storm" passionately.

I forgot they sent me an email yesterday to remind me of this viewing.

I made a sound similar to that of a balloon being deflated whilst hold the neck closed. I also embedded the clipper into my gooch which was a perfect way to finish this voyeur.

So now I sit, after showering for what could have been years, with a plaster on my gooch.

I doubt I'll hear back from them. 

Edit: Riders ON the storm. I'm sorry Jim.
