This is pretty short, but is easily one of the most embarrassing moments of my young adult life.

When I was about 14, during those awkward and interesting days of adolescence, I came home from school to an empty house, so I decided to hop in the shower. I used the shower in my parents' bathroom, because theirs was nicer — it was a walk-in shower with a glass door, and one of those 'rainfall' spigots.

Well, as I was cleaning myself, I started thinking about a girl I was attracted to at the time and... please don't judge me... I started kissing the shower door, imagining that I was kissing her.

So here I am, pressed up against the door, getting physically erm... stimulated... when, out of nowhere, my mother opens the door to the bathroom and finds herself face-to-face with her son rubbing up on and making out with the door to the shower. She just does a 180° and walks out.

About 10 minutes later, I head out and came up with some excuse that "I slipped and fell" onto the shower door. Her response? "Well from the look of things it certainly must have been exciting for you."

I have never mentioned it to her again.
