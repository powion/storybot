Welp. I'm a 23 year old dad. I like to be an active parent and play with my son... and today things went wrong.

We have these 3 REALLY COOL nerf swords, that we play with every day. He has actually gotten pretty good at dodging and parrying my attacks and when he starts rushing me i have to try my hardest to not get hit.

To spice things up we always do "power struggles"... Pushing our swords together and then wrestling to make it more fun.

Well today we did that... but his sword gave out and cracked in the middle...

This led to my full force punch cracking him across the jaw and watching him go limp. 

I have never panicked so hard in my life. I felt sick instantly.. a full grown "man" punching a child can lead to some terrible things such as concussion.. or worse, death.

Luckily, he was only down and out for about 4 seconds. Went to the hospital and he has no concussion or anything, just a very sore little face.

Ice cream should cure the wound, but nothing will mend the cracks put into the heart of a little boy getting FUCKING KO'D LIKE A LITTLE BITCH.

Edit: Ok some people are getting offended and threatening me. My son is loved, healthy, HANDSOME AS HELL, and there is nothing to worry about...

This is us [ "Proof" because some people are asking ] : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_7RNmoOAKo

We are very happy and you don't need to go calling the cops over a nerf battle.

EDIT: WHY DO YOU ALL LIKE THIS SO MUCH haha. I've had so many damn offers from this to help support my son and youtube collabs and it is overwhelming. People are even making videos about it within 24 hours: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc_NzYwn5Jw

I appreciate it everyone. Have a good night
