Last night I was hooking up with someone for the first time. I was a little buzzed. I jacked off twice earlier in the day to last longer during sex. She gave me gum before we got to my house, my breath was minty. I was so prepared.

We started locking tongues, clothes flew off, I just punched her ticket for poundtown, choo-choo. 

I started pounding her as hard as I could, so hard the gum flew out of my mouth, I was into it, she was into it, we were in the zone.

All of a sudden I lost my boner... Too much jacking off today I presume. She asked me what's wrong, I say nothing and try to keep going. I look at her hair, gum is tangled in it. She touches it and freaks. I tell her not to panic and I go downstairs then back up with some peanut butter. It's supposed to help get gum out but it didn't work... She asked me what the fuck I'm putting in her hair. I tell her peanut butter. She tells me she hates peanut butter. Peanut butter is still not working. She tells me to get scissors. She cuts her hair out. Her hair is fucked up. She looks up and sees a framed picture of my recently deceased cat (it's a joke from my friend) and says tonight is way too fucking weird and tells me that she's leaving. She laughed in my face as she left.

I definitely fucked up my first time, but at least the gum saved me from the embarrassment of my lost erection.
