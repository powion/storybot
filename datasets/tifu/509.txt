So here I am, just got off work, drinking a beer, standing in this amazing hot shower and browsing reddit on my phone. My wife is asleep and refuses to wake up even though she promised to sex me up in the shower when I got home. She just walked in butt naked and slides the door open to step in and stops. "Are you really on your fucking phone? ....ARE YOU ON REDDIT??"

"Uhhhh.... Yes?"

She just turned around and walked back out.

So here I am. Enjoying my hot shower, cold beer, and browsing reddit. I hate you guys.
