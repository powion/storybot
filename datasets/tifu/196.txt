I was in class where I was randomly partnered up with a girl to do a group project. I have never said a word to this girl but she is a smoking hot 10/10. So we talked after class and decided to stay after school to work on the project to get it out of the way.

So, I arrived home late since I stayed at school and my girlfriend asked why I wasn't home at my normal time. (not in a paranoid type of way...but just curious about where I was). 

So I told her "Oh I have a group project to do and her and I decided to stay after class and get it done"  

She jokingly responded, "oh so she's your side ho now?"

I said "No she's way out of my league"

She said "then how are you dating me?"

I said "because you're in my league"

3 hours later....the bedroom door is still locked and I want to go to bed.

UPDATE: She unlocked the door, called me a moron, threw a glass of water on me and I better do something special tomorrow night. We have been dating for 6 years and practically married.
