So today in class we were writing an essay on the computers, and as any sensible student would do i brought a USB with so i could work at home. Fast forward to the middle of the lesson, i was bored as fuck and looking for anything to entertain me so i just started to roll  the lid of my USB around my mouth and then it just slipped down my throat...
You know that feeling when you swallow a whole ice cube or something where you can feel it still going down your throat but you know its too late to try and regurgitate it out, yeah that was me.

So then, I just continue with my essay without making a sound to anyone around me.

Came up with the new safety warning: "Contains small parts unsuitable to babies under 3, and that one 15 year old idiot"

UPDATE: Holy shit guys, I didn't expect this much of a response. u/markreadsreddit wants to read my post so I'll post the link when he finishes doing his thing. Thanks :D
