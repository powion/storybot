Ok, my first ever post but this has to be the funniest most awful mistake I have ever made. I was composing a message on FB to my sister in law with a pic of her wedding dress in it from a dress fitting she had. I could not find where my photos were on the family laptop so went in to a folder that was marked viber downloads thinking it might be in there. No mini pics appeared on the screen, just little text boxes. I clicked on the first one and it opened up straight into the fb message to my sister in law but I didnâ€™t know that yet. I was shocked to see a pic of my husband holding his bits on screen but remembers the pic from previously. He had an infection and sent me a photo of the infection because he was doing an awful job describing it over the phone.  I suddenly remembers I was composing a FB post to my sister in law..... There is was in all its glory.... of course she was anxiously awaiting the pics of her dress and so obviously opened it the second it came in to her in box. I laughed, then I cried, then I screamed and then laughed again. 

I then explained the pic as she had seen it but not replied. we laughed about it. When I told my husband what had had happened he stood up and said ' for fuck sake' and went to the pub. He later saw the funny side but for the last two days he has been letting off loud cringing noises at random.
