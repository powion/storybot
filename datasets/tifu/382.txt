As with most fuck-ups, this didn't actually happen today. It was over 9 years ago.

My mom informed me that morning that we would be having "Aunt Maggie" over. I had never met this Aunt, but there were plenty of other family members showing up out of nowhere, so I didn't think anything of it. We spent several hours cleaning the house to prepare, and then they arrived. Aunt Maggie and her two kids, a girl around my age, and a boy several years younger. We spent the whole day playing, as kids do, while my mom and my aunt talked. Eventually, as the day was winding down, the three of us were in my room playing with legos. Aunt Maggie called to her kids, telling them it was time to go. We all came out and started saying goodbye to eachother. Before leaving, the girl came to me in the kitchen and asked me if I would go on a date with her. "No." I said, wondering what kind of person asks their cousin on a date. Looking back, my tone of voice was about the worst it could have been, probably sending the message "I wouldn't want to be seen in public with you." She was visibly disappointed, and left. I went back to my room afterwards and found an unfinished message written with legos. "Will you go o" Cute, but I'm not gonna romance my cousin.

Fast forward a few months, when I found out we're not actually related, and "Aunt" is apparently just a term of endearment.

Every time I see this girl, I'm blown away. She's stunning, and I'm a moron.

TL;DR: Didn't date my cousin, turns out she's not my cousin. Kick myself in the ass daily.
