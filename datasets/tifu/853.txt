Okay, so my friend, "Todd" and his ~~girlfriend~~ wife, "Tiffany" are kind of eccentric. Tiffany likes to do that weird European cheek kissing thing. I don't really understand it and it makes me kind of uncomfortable.

I've mentioned to my wife, how it's weird that every time we see Todd &amp; Tiffany she's doing this kissy thing.  My wife jokingly suggests that next time I turn my head and kiss her square on the lips, that would surely make her stop doing it. We both chuckle about it.

Fast forward to last night, where me, my wife and a bunch of friends are at Todd's. Tiffany does the kissy thing when we arrive, of course but otherwise we have a good time and are drinking some. Eventually we're leaving. Todd, Tiffany myself and my wife are at the door saying our goodbyes. Tiffany leans in for a cheek kiss and drunk me decides it would be funny to go ahead and peck her on the lips instead. Because, LOL, that will teach her for always doing that stupid cheek kiss thing.

I move my head with what must have been amazing timing and accuracy and get her square on the mouth.... and then ... I don't know what happened, she was kissed me back. Not quite full-on open mouth, but definitely not a small peck either. I think we were both slightly stupefied by what was happening and didn't pull away for at least a few seconds.

Eye brows were raised. I think someone said "well goodnight" and we left without making further eye contact. It was a very quiet ride home...

tl;dr Romantically kissed my buddies wife goodnight, in front of him and my wife. She kissed back.


**EDIT** Obligatory "well this blew up". Sorry I've been at work.

**FAQ**

* Todd and Tiffany are recently married, and I sometimes still call her his "girlfirend" instead of wife. So sorry.

* My wife was somewhat pissed. Thought I might have a "thing" for Tiffany. Said I shouldn't drink so much etc etc. I think she'll get over it.

* I talked to Todd, he said Tiffany is pretty embarrassed, but he doesn't seem to really care and thought it was kind of funny.

**Conclusion:**

On the minus side, it's going to make things awkward for a while. On the plus side I don't think I'm going to be getting cheek kisses in the foreseeable future either.

Moral of the story: I don't recommend making out with other peoples wives in front of your wife. Unless you've got some kind of understanding first.

**Alternate, swingers-friendly ending:**

Tiffany, Todd, myself and my wife are having an ~~orgy~~ hot tub gang bang this weekend.
