So at work I had this stapler that made funny squeaking noises when the top lid/part was pressed. My colleague (Bob) really hated the irritating sound of that squeaking. To annoy Bob, I placed the top lid/part between my teeth and was making engine noises. Suddenly I sneezed and tried to pull the stapler out of my mouth but teeth clenched it hard in place and stapled the roof of my mouth. I screamed, Bob screamed, sharp pain, blood dripping and Bob totally freaked out. Everyone around me came running and I was taken to hospital. 

Emergency room doctor looked at me, sitting there with my mouth open like a crocodile, asked Bob what was wrong. Bob explained. Doc shook his head and then proceeded to gently use some blunt scalpel type instrument to pry the staple loose and pull it out. GOD.THAT.PAIN. 

Was given two shots and sent home with some painkillers. Was also told not to put anything in my mouth that didn’t belong there. 

I went home, had nothing but juice for two days because I couldn’t even feel my upper jaw and mouth hurt like hell. 

My conversation with HR after I returned to work days later.


**HR:** "Please tell us again how did you manage to staple the roof of your mouth?"

**ME:** Is this not covered in my medical? 

**HR:** All your hospital bills have been cleared. We're just concerned about how you got injured and should we be worried about any future incidents.

**ME:** ... 

**HR:** ...

**ME:** Sorry won't happen again.

I'm never going to annoy Bob again, I think...
