I work as an installation and repair technician for a major phone/cable company. I was working in suburban Philadelphia installing service for one of our customers and while mapping out the job I was deciding where I should drill a hole to bring in the wiring. From the outside I saw that if I drilled to the left of an outdoor water spigot I'd avoid any electrical, gas, and water lines. 

So I grab my drill and go inside to start the hole. And in my head all I keep telling myself is to go to the left of the water pipe and I do just that. What I neglected was that from the inside of the house is have to go to the right side. After about 5 minutes of drilling I punch through and immediately hear a very loud popping sound. Then I see quite a bit of smoke coming from the hole. I then notice that my drill bit is charred and melted at the tip. 

I had just drilled into the back of the customers electric meter. I had to call the fire department and they sent 2 trucks. After all was said and done, I had caused around $13,000 in repair and incidentals. Also I received a two weeks suspension but considering I hit the main electric line for the house I am just lucky to be alive.
