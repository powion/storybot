Today is my day off and my loving wife left me a boiled egg for breakfast. I forgot that she told me about the egg so after while it got pretty cold. 

I decided to warm it up in the microwave with some other food instead of boiling it again. After I took it out I decided to sit in the living in room and watch Californication on Netflix where I stuck the fork in the egg and watched it instantly explode in my face. 

Not only did the egg go absolutely everywhere but I was also pelted by hot gooey egg yolks. To top it off my cat was sitting next to me and got startled by the egg exploding. He ran across my lap and dug his nails into me. 

I just wanted some god damn breakfast. I'm too tired for this shit. Excuse me while I go get the vacuum cleaner.
