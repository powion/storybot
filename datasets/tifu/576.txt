For the past few months I haven't had sex or hooked up with anyone and I haven't even pleasured myself, but last night I went home with this smoking hot guy and I had one thing on my mind: I was ready to end that 2 month streak.  We are on the couch and things start getting steamy so I suggest we take it to his room.  We are on the bed, our clothes are coming off and this guy is turning me on like an Electrolux oven. As soon as he has his fingers inside of me it's like a juice box ruptured down there.  His eyes are wide with surprise, so I think; he hasn't encountered many like this (if any).  He slip and slides it in and he starts giving it to me good and my lady liquid just keeps flowing!  I can feel it running down my legs, my crack, up my back.  I am trying to enjoy this but I am starting to feel a little self-conscious because this guy's face is showing concern. He flips me on top and I go for a ride but this just makes the whole thing worse.  I can feel that his torso is literally drenched in my cum. It's all both of us now.  By the time he finished there was a puddle in the middle of the bed the length of my torso and double the width. We took the sheets off of the bed and the mattress was soaked too.  Now I have been known to get really wet.  My ex used to juice my lady parts on a regular basis and he loved every minute of if.  But I *never* squirted this much with the ex and this guy didn't seem to be all that into it. In fact he seemed a little frightened by it. And then I learned why.  As I rolled away and chuckled, nervously apologetic, he say, "I hope *Dustin* doesn't kill me."  We were in his roommate's bed apparently because his cousin was asleep in his.  Then I was mortified.  I got dressed and left immediately.  Sorry Dustin.
