This all started when i was christmas shopping 2 days ago and i decided to get my parents a Christmas card, i grabbed one that said something along the lines of "happy holidays" and left the store. I gave my dad the card and as he reads it his eyes fill up with tears, he calls my mom near him and she starts screaming out of happiness, i was really confused as it was just a card, they suddenly say "SO IS IT A BOY OR A GIRL I'M SO HAPPY!" I'm really confused now and apparently i found out that the card says "happy holidays grandma" and my parents thought it was a way to tell them i was expecting. They're very upset now.
