I decided to make a quick run to the bank today to deposit a check. I arrived and pulled into a parking space and put my car in park.  I was looking down and reading a text on my phone when I suddenly noticed my car was rolling forward.  I switched into full panic mode.  The only thing separating me from the 40 mph traffic in front of me was a small patch of grass that I would be crossing at any moment now.  I started pumping my brakes to no avail and decided my best bet now would be to warn the oncoming traffic. So I laid on my horn and began wrestling to get my seat belt off so I could bail out if needed.  Keep in mind, because I am being descriptive, it may seem like a while had passed by now, but all of these thoughts and reactions happened within abut a 6 second span of time.  Suddenly, my car stopped rolling.  I looked up and around trying to figure out what had happened. I glanced at the bewildered drivers in the parked cars on either side of me that I had just rolled past. It was then that I realized that I had not left my parking spot.  The other two cars on either side of me had begun backing out at the same time, giving me the sensation that I was moving forward.  In other words, a parking lot full of people had just witnessed me pull into a parking spot and then suddenly have what must have seemed to be a complete meltdown; tearing at my seat belt and lying on my horn as I struggled to evade the jaws of death.  I decided it was best to leave and go the bank across town instead.
