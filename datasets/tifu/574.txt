This is from when I was young, which is quite a few years ago, before internet porn.

First of all, a bit of scene-setting information. Our house was in a cul-de-sac, up on a hill and it was the only two-story house in a neighborhood of single-story houses. We were close to the road, too, so our house was very visible from everywhere in the neighborhood. 

When I was a teenager my parents worked late hours and I had the house to myself well into the evening. Quite often, I would spend a couple of hours leisurely browsing a stack of Playboy magazines that my father thought he had hidden from me. I had a particular jerking method I used. I would go upstairs to the living room, open a bunch of magazines to my favorite pages and lay them out on the floor. Then I’d stand up and jerk off, looking from one girl to another, until I finally came. I’d make this last as long as possible, going slowly when I was close and then picking up speed again at the end. I could go for ages. 

What somehow escaped my attention was that the living room light silhouetted me through the curtains and projected my jerking off to the entire neighborhood, like a lighthouse warning families to keep their daughters away. I did this for years without realizing that everyone knew exactly what I was doing. No wonder the neighbors avoided us. 

LT;DR: TIFU by projecting myself masturbating to the whole neighborhood, like the Batsignal of a lonely virgin. 

Edit: Thanks for the gold!

Edit3: Some people have been asking about how the silhouetting looked, how I knew, etc. [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/X0EdIE0.jpg) is a diagram of the room. As for how I found out, there was no great reveal. It was just a private dawning of realization and embarrassment as the pieces mentally fell together one day.
