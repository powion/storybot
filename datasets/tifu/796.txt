Let me start out the story by saying that I do not normally carry skivvies around in my school backpack, however I had rolled them up in a pair of jeans for when I spent the night at my boyfriend's place earlier on in the week, and I assumed that when I took said jeans out the red lace thong that was carefully tucked within them was also thrown into my hamper. I believed this until I found myself whipping out my spiral notebook from my bag to take notes for a very impatient and vigilant professor with the panties hooked onto the wire binding. Those exact panties were then flung from my notebook, and of course they couldn’t fall out nicely right next to me so I could discreetly pick them up. No they flew through the air in a perfect arch, with my professor’s eyes following them all the way to the ground where they had landed about 5 feet away from me. Mortified, I got up and retrieved my unruly pair of underwear without a word then sat back down with a face that was probably only a shade or two off from the lace undergarment I quickly put back into my bag. The only person who was probably more traumatized than me was the professor who, for the first time in the entire course, found himself completely speechless. 

TL;DR – Sent my underwear sailing through the air at the beginning of a lecture.
