So this just happened a few minutes ago, and I'm typing this out as my roommate is still laughing at me. A little background before we get into the juicy details: 
I tend to get very vocal when I'm alone, which can be expressed in various ways. Singing, talking to myself, yelling at random things, and making new/fascinating noises are the usual things I do, maybe to fill the space or just because I'm weird when alone, I'm not sure, go ask science. 
Anywho, I happened to be alone on this particular day, and decided to take a long hot shower. Standing in the shower I begin to sing the song of my people, while dancing like an idiot. 
Recently I've managed to pick my lazy Cheeto crusted butt off the couch to hit the gym, and today I'm quite sore. Stretching the muscles with hot water running down them was amazing, and so I began to make noises that only the most sexually thirsty person would make. 
Phrases like "Oh baby yes" and "Fuck meeee, oh yeah" and the classic "Do me dirty" were all spilling out of my mouth with the passion of a thousand burning suns. 
Finishing my shower I towel off and open the door, but horror strikes me as I round that opening. I was too excited to be alone for a weekend afternoon that I didn't think WHY I was alone, and as it turns out my roommate's family was out to lunch with him. So there I am, towel around my waist, staring at his mom, dad, and even 12 year old sister, all of us mouth agape.They clearly heard more than enough of my mating calls, and all I'm capable of doing is muttering "uhh" and retreating to my room a red faced embarrassed mess. 
As my roommate tells me, his entire family laughed as soon as I left, not because of the noises they heard, but because I was alone in the shower and there were noises enough for two. 
TL:DR Sang the song of my people, the song should have been on mute
