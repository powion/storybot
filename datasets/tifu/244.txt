Ok so I am the mother of a 12 boy.  Today we were just hanging out and I thought we could catch up on some holiday movies on Netflix.  So I say "there isn't anything on TV you want to just Netflix and chill? " I had heard the saying on TV and social media a lot. His face turned bright red and he replied "what the hell is wrong with you?" I get mad at his response and ask him why not. Basically we have a 20 min conversation about in my mind why I'm not good enough for him to hang out with, and in his mind why I'm not good enough to have sex with! I said things like "don't you love me and want to spend quality time with me?" Finally he embarrassingly explained what it meant.... I said "DO NOT tell your father."

Edit: changed capitalization, didn't realize I hadn't capitalizes not as well. 

TL;DR: today I unknowingly asked then begged my son to have sex with me.
