My girlfriend was over for a few days, and unfortunately I live with my parents while I attend University.

We have a goofy relationship..and more often than not I am doing something awkward or crazy to get a laugh out of her.

She left the room without saying much and I assumed she walked into the bathroom next to my bedroom, as shortly after she left, I hear the door close.

I pulled off my pants and slowly unlocked to door to avoid making a sound...

Got my dick in a full helicopter then burst into the room.

My mom is sitting there screaming at the horror at the tornado of cock headed towards her. (cocknado)

I am so embarrassed.. we haven't made eye contact yet.

Will keep you up to date when the awkward silence ends

Edit: 
Mom: Don't worry about it. Your dad does that all the time...
Me: TO BATTLE!!!!..JK

-She just started laughing while making the salad for dinner and said "what the fuck Michael"

Edit:Turned out OK. We had a good chuckle at dinner and she knows I was trying to bug my Gf but now she thinks I am a weirdo haha.
