So this actually happened on Monday (don't kill me.)
I'm from Britain and I'm currently in sixth form (junior and senior year for any confused Americans)
SO, in college, you get 'frees' which basically are periods where you can do whatever as you don't have a lesson and they're usually an hour long.

In my case, I had three frees in a row, so me and my friend decided to go out shopping for a little while and then come back for our last lesson.

ANYWAY.

Skip to three hours later and we were making our way back to college, near our college there's a church.

This is where it gets bad.

I looked over at the church and saw that there was a family walking out of it, they were smartly dressed so I'd assumed they'd just come from a wedding, as a large majority of the family weren't wearing black. 

And me being me, I can't keep my gob shut and exclaimed
"Congratulations!"

To which my friend turned to look at me in sheer shock/terror. Not knowing what she was so shocked about, I looked towards the family, who's jaws had practically hit the ground.

It was only THEN, I saw a couple holding a large framed picture of a little boy.
I walked as fast I could, not bearing to look at the couple, who I could now hear sobbing hysterically.

TL;DR - Thought a funeral was a wedding, accidentally congratulated a couple on their sons funeral.


EDIT: So I was reading through the comments and couldn't help notice how many people were confused about if I was a boy or a girl; I am a girl.
