So I was in Walmart today with my brother buying some groceries. We are constantly making jokes and pranking at each other. 
I sometimes grab his ass and tell him "Nice ass" 
So there was this guy who looked exactly like him from behind. 
I go and grab his ass and tell him " that is a pretty nice ass you have there". 
He turns around and then I realize he is not my brother. He turns completely red. He was with his wife. Neither of them knew what to do or how to react. 
I stand there frozen and then  I run and hide trying to avoid them under any circumstance.

So there's my fuck up.
