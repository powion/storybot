I’m a teenage girl and my boyfriend spends a lot of time at our house. My parents are fine with it. 

My family has a pretty large lot, and the back corner of the lot has a little group of trees and a hammock. It’s very secluded. 

I was relaxing in the hammock a few days ago when my boyfriend found me and decided to join me. One thing led to another and we started fooling around a little bit.

Then, the hammock decided it wasn’t having any more of our shit. 
It gave out and we slammed into the ground. Hard.

The shocked noises and the sound of the hammock hitting the ground are enough to make my mom come running. My brother and sister followed.

And what do they find?

They find a 17-year-old girl in a turquoise bra and panties attempting to disentangle herself one-handed from the mildly concussed boxer-clad 18-year-old boy lying on top of her. 

My mom jumps into action, because first aid is practically a job requirement when you have 9 kids.

By the time we get inside, our audience includes three of my brothers, my sister, my brother’s girlfriend, and my sister-in-law. All of whom are trying extremely hard not to laugh hysterically in front of my mother. 

In the end, my eldest brother had to take me to the hospital while my mom monitored my boyfriend for signs of imminent brain damage. 

Two days later:

*  I’m wearing a massive neon cast on my left arm.
*  My siblings have only recently stopped giggling every time one of us enters the room.
*  Two of my older brothers have made a jokes about giving my boyfriend another concussion if he didn’t keep his hands to himself.
*  My older sister has offered to take me bra shopping.
* The story (in explicit detail) has been relayed to three different family members.
* I've had to give my younger brother $10 to keep him from telling anyone at school.
* Multiple jokes have been made about how my boyfriend can't afford to suffer any more brain damage. 
* Far too many of my immediate family members have wiggled their eyebrows suggestively at us.
* My mom is still obsessively monitoring my boyfriend’s mental state.
* My dad has asked us if we needed another talk about “safe sex.”

TL;DR: Boyfriend and I broke a hammock during sexy times. Entire family thinks it's hilarious. 

**Edit1:** It's awesome to hear about all of the people with big families on here! There should be a sub for that! 

**Edit2:** Holy crap, gold! Thank you to /u/SteveSnitzelson and two other users! I will pay it forward.

**Edit3:** If anyone is interested, I made a sub /r/hugefamilies because a ton of people commented saying they had large families as well. Parents, siblings, people with large extended families, whatever.
