I really like my girlfriend, and I think she likes me but having a relationship with her may be a bit difficult from now on.
We went to her house for dinner, and everything went smoothly until we were done eating. She has a litte brother who is 5-6 years old (not sure) and he seemed to like me, and we threw his little plastic ball back and forth. He started getting competitive and threw way harder than I'd expected, so as a reflex I slapped the ball mid-air so it flew, knocked over and broke this urn. The urn contained my girlfriends grandma. Without missing a beat her little brother runs out and fucking points the finger at me and said I did on purpose, and the little shit even started to cry. I tried to explain what really had happened, but they gave me the classic "We think it's best you go home now", and my girlfriend took her parents side.
So here I am the day after, and she still won't return my calls or my texts.
We might be done.

EDIT: She saw my post here, since it apparently has made it to the front page of reddit, and broke it off. According to her I'm "childish and unable to take things seriously". Guess first round's on me RIP.
EDIT 2: I must explain since a lot of people seem to think this is fake: I've been a reddit lurker for a long time, and only made this account to share my story with you. Never imagined it would blow up like this, and I can understand you being suspicious. Your comments made me realized how fucked up this whole thing was, and I wanna thank you all! You're the best :) (Thank you kind redditor for the gold)
