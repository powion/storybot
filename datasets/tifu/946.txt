My fuck up happened about 3 hours ago. I went to Best Buy to pick up an order, but when I got there had to pee really bad, so I went to the ladies room. Now, I can't be the only one who does this, but sometimes when I do something dumb like hit my head on something or drop something, I make a comical grunting noise that is sort of like a dramatic "UGH!" So, as I turned and went to use my foot to flush, I banged my knee quite hard on the toilet paper dispenser and made the "UGH!" noise.


Well, just before that, another woman had come into the bathroom. So this poor lady came in and heard *THUD* .. "UGH!" and said, "Oh! Sir, are you okay?" Apparently my dramatic grunt sounds manly.


Of course, my brain went into panic mode, and - even though the voice speaking to me was clearly female - I thought "oh crap, am I in the men's room?!" So, in a moment of very poor decisiveness, I decided to play it off by making my voice deep and saying, "I'm fine!" I unfortunately don't have great control over the lower register of my voice, though, and sounded more demonic than manly. The lady offered a timid, "um.. okay.." and then went into her stall, at which point I ran out of the bathroom as quickly as possible. I did not even wash my hands, to be honest, because I would rather risk the E. coli Zika flu virus than have to face the embarrassment of that woman seeing me.


TL;DR: I exercise poor judgement, and need a new Best Buy.
