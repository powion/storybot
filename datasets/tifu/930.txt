So I went to get my hair cut today, this time I wanted to go with something different I found a [hairstyle]( http://imgur.com/r9amiwS) I want to try. I pull out my phone and show my barber. My phone started to dim and get ready to lock, so I tapped the screen to have it not die. By tapping it I acidentally swiped left to the next [picture](http://imgur.com/iws17ph). To say the least, the rest of the haircut was a little awkward.
