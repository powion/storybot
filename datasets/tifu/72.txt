A minor fuck up: I work in retail on the service desk, I have for five years. It's just a casual job while I study, and the shop I work at is generally rather relaxed - not in terms of our workload, but the attitude of the place - so I tend to have reasonable banter with my co-workers and managers throughout the shift. 

As with most Australian banter, all we do is shit talk ourselves and each other.  So I'm chatting with my manager as he walks past towards the Home section. To summarize:

Me:"I wish you were as good at your job as I am at mine"

Manager: "Mate, you suck at your job."

Me: "Five years of sucking well spent."

Manager: "I don't know how that's happened."

Me: "Yeah, well I'll keep on *sucking* as much as I need to to keep the job."

and then the pause, I realise I've shouted this line as he's now about, I'd estimate, 5 or 6 metres away. A fair few customers are looking my way, a parent giving that awkward glare and slowly shuffling their kid along (who seemed oblivious). Fortunately, the manager was laughing too hysterically to immediately kill me.


**TL;DR:** I implied to all our customers that I give blowjobs to my manager to keep my job. Didn't get punished, got told to remember that I'm too stupid to speak so loudly.
