As everyone knows, school can get to us. Every morning i struggle to wake up and get out of the house in time to catch my bus. This morning in particular, was very different.

 I woke up and frantically checked my clock, because i was late yesterday. Through my groggy eyes, all i saw was ":45". Typically i leave the house at 6:30, so i jumped out of bed and quickly got dressed. I ran downstairs and out the door, ignoring the fact that nobody in my family was awake yet. The fact that it was still dark didn't bother me because where I live, the sun doesn't rise until about 7:30.

 On my way to school, I noticed that there were not as many cars on the road as usual. I kept walking, because I was just focusing on not being late. About 30 minutes later, I reached the main road that lead to my high school. There were absolutely no people or cars anywhere. I thought I was dreaming or that the roads were shut down. I checked my phone to see if i was late or at least close to being late. It was 1:15 AM. I just kinda sat there hating myself for a minute, then realized how much of a fucking idiot I was. I slowly turned around and walked home, wondering if my family had woken up and saw me missing. Luckily I made it back to my room without disturbing anyone. 

TL;DR: I tried to go to school at 1 AM.

I'm currently typing this in my World History class, so thankfully I wasn't late today.

EDIT: Apparently people can't read the multiple replies that I have left earlier about when the sun rises where I live.
