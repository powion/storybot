This literally just happened. I was walking to the spot I normally stand at on the train platform but I didn't have my contacts in so my vision/depth perception wasn't very good. I hear someone say hi so I turn to look as I'm walking and I see my friends sister with her arms outstretched. In my head I'm like oh alright she wants a hug, so I go in and give her a hug. I thought it felt kind of strange, like she wasn't really hugging back so I end the hug and back up to look at her. At this point I realize a) that it wasn't my friends sister but a random woman waiting for the train and b) she was extending her arms to someone who was behind me, who I noticed after the hug. They both looked pretty horrified so I didn't even really try to explain myself, I kind of just walked away without saying anything. 

TL;DR: went in for a hug, ruined someone's morning
