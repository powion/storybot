My parents had just gotten a new car, and unlike my old car, this one had bluetooth in it. So I'm heading home from a baseball tournament and I've got my phone connected to the bluetooth in the car and we're listening to music. Eventually we get home and I go upstairs to my room for some me-time. My room is on the 3rd floor of my house, facing the street. I'm in my room with porn on my phone having some great fun when all of the sudden the sound stops. The video is playing like normal, but the sound is just gone. Then I hear the sound of a car driving over the drain in my driveway, and I realize. I look outside my window, being careful to not be seen, and see my mom in the car outside, all the windows down, blasting the sound of Madison Ivy getting fucked to the neighborhood as she frantically looks for a way to turn it off (remember, new car.) She gets it eventually and turns it off. She doesn't know I know, and I pretend as if nothing happened.

Edit: Well, people are commenting that the bluetooth range an a cell phone is typically shorter than whatever the distance from the 3rd floor of a house to the street is. I truly don't have an answer to that, but I did ask my dad if his phone has ever connected to the car from the house, and he said he's had the same problem (with a phone call, he said, but i've got my doubts....) anyways idk what to tell ya
