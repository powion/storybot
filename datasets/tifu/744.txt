Yesterday afternoon, I was just finishing my homework and ready to unwind with some Mario Kart. Last time I saw the game was in my sister's room. I thought she was at a friend's house, so I barged right in to take it back.

I opened the door, and my heart stopped. My sister was home after all, and she wasâ€¦ having a moment with herself. No covers, shorts down, everything on display. She screamed like something from a horror movie, and I slammed the door.

I stood there in shock for a moment. "Are you getting dressed?" I asked, hoping to convince her that I didn't realize what she was doing. No way she'd fall for that though. I very clearly got the full show, an image that I fear will be burned into my brain forever. Fuck, this is my little sister. I'm not supposed to see her having a hand party.

I've been avoiding her since.
