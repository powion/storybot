So this literally happened like thirty minutes ago. Im walking to my buddies on campus and as I am walking this car proceeds to honk at me. Per usual I flip them the bird and keep walking. Not even thirty seconds later my mother calls me and says "WHAT THE HELL NICK, YOU JUST FLIPPED PFF YOUR GRANDMA!!" As it turns out my grandparents were in town visiting and they recognized me and honked to get my attention and a heatfelt wave. Little did they know when someone honks at you in Cincinnati it usually is not for those intentions.
