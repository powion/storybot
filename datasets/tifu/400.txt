This just happened, Reddit. Crazy, I know.

I work in a large performance venue. I went into the bathroom for my daily 3:30pm case of the dirty squirties, and it just so happened that a co-worker from another dept who I'm friendly with was walking in to sit down and take care of lunch in another stall.

We're sitting there, brothers in stalls, quietly downloading some brown loads when he rips a crisp fart. The resonance in the bowl was beautiful, so I chuckled a little. He laughed back. 

I'm the kind of guy who will always laugh at two things - farts, and other people's laughter. This was the holy grail. 

We basically laughed back in forth in turn, escalating to the point that I laughed so hard that I started farting too. This caused even more laughter.

We both finally calmed down, cleaned up, and left the bathroom.

I should probably mention that the venue I work offers backstage tours to patrons. It just so happens that a tour group had been stationed right outside the bathroom as their tour guide was taking the time to talk about the history of a display in that hallway. 

We had many looks of horror, amusement, and even some of respect. 

tl;dr: engaged in a fartal kombat with a co-worker. tough crowd.

edit: when I am at work later, my coworker and I will record a tribute track to /u/Pineapplefag for gilding my farts

edit 2: thanks to all the compooter programming experts who made me realize I was uploading my brown loads, not downloading
