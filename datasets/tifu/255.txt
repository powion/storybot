I was taking a two hour history final in a tightly packed room. The desks were barely a foot apart. Somehow the desk behind me was pushed up to my chair and the girl behind me was bending down over her exam. I straightened up and stretched my neck by moving it back and looking at the ceiling in a swift motion (to crack my neck). My head nailed that girl on her head and she was so surprised she slammed her head into the desk. She down fell out of her chair holding her forehead and somehow pulled the desk down on top of her. She was alright and finished her exam. (first time posting on tifu)

edit: and I was very, very sorry.

edit: because people doubt the existence of stretching necks. I stretch this way because it straightens my neck and cracks it. I have horrible posture so leaning my head back kinda fixes the orientation. Plus it feels nice. Just lean your head back all the way and stare at the ceiling for a few seconds.

edit: because too many people are hurting themselves. TO DO THIS CORRECTLY JUST LEAN YOUR HEAD ALL THE WAY BACK AND STARE AT THE CEILING.

tl;dr during an exam I reverse-head-butted a girl behind me by stretching so as to crack my neck; she ended up on the ground
