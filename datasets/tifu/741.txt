A couple nights ago I went to a party, and since I don't have my driver's license yet, my mom had to drive me there. The whole car ride to my friend's house she lectured me about not drinking and not doing drugs and whatnot. I patiently waited silently through the whole speech, and as soon as we pulled up, I leaped out of the car and ran inside.

Fast forward several hours later.

The party is ending. I have not followed my mom's instructions like a good little boy, and I am really, really drunk. I'm leaving and walking down the driveway, about to call my mom to pick me up, when one of my friends calls out my name. He's unlocking his car and several others are piling into the rear seats. All of them are drunk as balls, and even though my cognitive abilities are not at full strength, I have the brains to decline and continue walking.

I'm walking down the sidewalk, waiting for my mom to pick up her phone, I hear the start of an engine behind me. I ignore it, and keep walking. Several seconds later, I hear tires screech and think, "Gee, I hope they don't die on the way home." A second after that, the car hits me.

I wake up later in a hospital room, and according to the doctor, I've broken my wrist, hip, both legs, and a couple ribs.

**TL;DR** I choose not to get into a car driven by an intoxicated friend, get run over by the same car moments later.

**Edit:** To answer some of the questions people have, uh, here I go.

My friend who was in that car did not crash. FML. He did get a DUI though. Apparently the cops pulled him over later. Not sure about felony DUI or whatever.

I can type with one hand.

My parents weren't too pissed, they were just sort of disappointed but mostly glad I'm okay.

I'm a forgiving type of guy, but damn. I probably won't be seeing my, uh, friend for a while so I dunno whats going to happen with him.

Also, I have no idea why I don't have head injuries or spinal cord injuries. I got lucky, I guess? Or not lucky, but luckier than really not lucky.

**Edit 2:**

Maybe I should have made the title TIFU by making the *questionably* right choice.
