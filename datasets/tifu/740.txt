When there's a long line of customers and it's busy you look but don't really take in faces as such. So when the group of 6 came in I handed out 5 adult menus, and a child's menu and a pack of crayons to the little one, and everything was great. Until the little one was quite clearly a 45 year old lady who was not looking impressed, and neither is the partner. The family on the whole was looking not impressed. I of course wanted to roll up into a little ball and die there on the spot, immediately, and thank fuck I didn't bring up the high chair

Edit: thanks for the gold!
