So the story goes... I'm male and I posted "I'm pregnant!" on my Facebook wall for April 1st and things spiraled out of control.

But first there are a few things you should know about me.

1. I'm 100% male, testicles penis and everything.
2. I have a GF that my family doesn't like.
3. My family is extremely conservative.

So later in the day my mother calls and when I pick up she is hysterical, screaming, and is basically disowning me. I'm bewildered and entirely confused so try I ask her through the screaming, what did I do wrong?

She says "you got your girlfriend pregnant", and that's when it dawned on me.

My little super obviously a joke facebook post on April first saying "I'm pregnant!" actually tricked my family leading them to chain call each other to gossip about how I got my girlfriend pregnant.

Long story short, my whole extended family is pissed off at me and thinks I got my girlfriend pregnant, I almost got disowned, and I won April 1st this year. FML....
