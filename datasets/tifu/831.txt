I currently work in a It-consultant firm where we use Skype as our main form of communication. 

Today I took my laptop to work, since I wanted to watch some netflix during my break. Instead of using my work computer I used my personal. So after my break, I sit down to do some more work, when my manager asks if I can participate in conference call with my boss and some of the upper management, I tell him that I'm on my personal computer, but can add me by using my name as username.

So a couple of minutes after I get the invite and I accept. So far everything is fine, when suddenly one of the guys from upper management (not the one who invited to the call), says "Who the fuck is TITLER?". That's when it hit me, I really fucked up. I forgot that I have that silly displayname and a pretty fucked up [picture](http://imgur.com/4ij4Knk) to accompany it (NSFW).

So now my boss is kinda pissed, and HR possibly wants to talk with me soonish.

TL;DR: My boss doesn't like tits with mustaches.
