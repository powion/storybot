He always shakes everything out before he puts it on, no matter where he got it from -- floor, closet, drawer. He inspects his clothing thoroughly and also usually folds things neatly even when they're dirty. And usually, if anything's been on the floor, as long as he doesn't need it immediately, he'll automatically toss it into the laundry, even if he knows it's clean. At any given time, his clothes make up a good 70% of the clothes I wash and he rarely touches something that's been deemed 'dirty.' I always thought he was being a lazy weirdo, but now I know the truth.

Because as soon as I slipped my arm in the sleeve of my robe today (which I took directly off its designated hook), a huge [house centipede](http://imgur.com/a7jvQda) skittered out over my hand and fell on the floor. It was so big that it made a *sound* when it landed. It is now setting up camp under our bed. 

I feel so violated and the worst part is I had just finished showering and there is no way there's enough hot water left to wash away the feeling of its skittery little legs. I can't even trust clean clothes that have been put away!

Boyfriend's response: And now you know why.

Edit: No sign of the beast for now. Oh, and as many have pointed out, despite looking like little creepy aliens, house centipedes are good to have around. I just prefer them to not be in my clothes or on my person. Also, I live in Canada, in Quebec, for everybody asking.
