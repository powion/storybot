Last night, I meant to go to bed early, because I had to get up this morning at Five to help my grandpa sort calves we were selling. I WENT to bed at 1130, but proceeded to browse Reddit until four. I only got like 30 min of sleep, and ended up being exhausted during the sorting.
    I was so tired that my reaction times were crap, and didn't get out of the way of an angry mama cow soon enough. She head-butted me up against the feedbunk and cracked 4 of my ribs. :(
    I guess this gives me time to play Fallout 4 for the next few weeks...
TL;dr: stayed up too late, reaction time was crap, broke ribs.
