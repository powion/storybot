This didn't happen today, it happened about 15 years ago..but it's still stuck with me all this time.

I was about 10 years old, hanging out with my friend in my room, doing whatever it is 10 year olds do. We were listening to music when my little brother knocked on the door. Me being the mean big sister ignored him, turned the music up, and pretended like we were having a party that he couldn't come to. I imagine that made him feel crappy and he went back downstairs.

Fast forward to a few minutes later, and my mom knocks on the door, kind of angry with me. She tells me to come downstairs to see what my little brother did for me.

I go downstairs and find a clue, written by him in his little 6 year old handwriting. It lead me to another clue, and another clue. The last clue said to look in the other room for my "Valentine", and there he was sitting on the bed. He gave me a hug. I felt awful. Still do to this day when I think about it.

tl;dr: Ignored my 6 year old brother knocking on my bedroom door, turns out he had put a lot of work into making a Valentine's treasure hunt for me that ended with him as my "Valentine" and giving me a hug. Cue the awful feelings.
