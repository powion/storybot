Today I met up with my family for a funeral and to save money, we all are sharing a hotel room. I am 26 and my family is pretty close so we're fine sharing a room. So this morning we are all up and getting ready for the day. After my turn in the shower, I'm drying off in the bathroom when I hear my dad telling mom a interesting story. Me, being curious, go out and listen to his riveting tale. So here I am, casually drying my hair and listening to dad when I noticed my mom is giving me a puzzled look. She then casually asks "do you know that you are naked?" 

It was only then that i realized that the towel I was using to cover up is currently sitting on my neck after drying my hair, giving my parents and brothers front row seats to the viewing of the family jewels, things not seen by them sense childhood baths were still common. I quickly cover up to the roars of laughter from my entire family. Now I have to sit through a reunion tomorrow and I know my family will let all of our relatives know of the peep show I put on.

*edit: Changed nick to neck. Is this really nsfw?
