My boyfriend's neighbors just had a baby. The husband came outside to say hi. He said his wife was out to dinner with her friends so he was watching The Martian. Thinking that was a cute nickname for a newborn I said "it's okay, all babies come out like that".

He meant the movie. 

^E: ^thanks ^for ^the ^gold!
