So, I've been missing my leg for four years now. I've adapted quite well. I get around just fine with a prosthetic.

However, when I'm at home in my small apartment, I prefer to crawl short distances instead of going through the hassle of putting my prosthetic on. It's jut more convenient that way.

So last night we had some company over to watch scary movies, and I read everyone a few short submissions to /r/nosleep. Everyone was pretty spooked before we went to bed. Two friends of mine slept on the couch, and one of them was someone we have never had over before. So this individual had never seen me crawl without my leg on. To describe it, I kind of move like a very slow cheetah who's missing a hind leg. Like a tri-pod crawl, if that makes sense. So, I suppose it can be unsettling if you're not expecting it. 

In the middle of the night/early morning, I decide to leave my room for a drink. I didn't turn the hall light on so I wouldn't disturb my sleeping guests. There's just enough light coming from the light above the sink to guide me where I needed to go. As I'm turning the corner to enter the kitchen, I see a figure and I hear "OH SHIT WHAT THE FUCK", next thing I know, I'm getting kicked in the face. 
I suppose my friend recognized my foul mouth screaming back at him, because then he turned the light on and started apologizing profusely. 

TL;DR: I crawled through my apartment without my prosthetic leg, my friend thought I was a demon and started kicking me in the face.  


EDIT: A lot of people are asking why I don't just hop. Well, in the accident that took my leg, I also maintained compound fractures in all the long bones in my remaining leg, causing the my femur, tibia, and fibula too all be replaced by titanium rods. Hopping on such a leg causes too much stress and pain to my remaining knee cap. 
Even without those injuries though, it's usually not recommended for any amputee to hop as a frequent mode of transport, even for short distances.
