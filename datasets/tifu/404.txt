So this happened around 10 years ago and I'm using an obvious throwaway account.

In my childhood bedroom there was a heater/humidifier box thing that was about 3x3 feet with black mesh and metal wire around the sides, I'm not sure what it was and I wouldn't dare ask my parents what it was at this point since that would just be odd.

Anyways, me and my sister used to play a game where we took the grill lighter and put it against the side of this air altering box device that was and saw who would hold it there the longest.

One day I held the lighter for a while and then me and her ran off back downstairs. Apparently I had started a slow smolder of the box things mesh since several hours later at night the smoke alarms all began going off, fire trucks are at our house and we get rushed outside to the corner. The flames started in my room and despite my dad closing the bedroom door the flames didn't die out and we watched the flames slowly engulf the house.

Fortunately me and my sister had fallen asleep in the basement so we didn't burn alive in my bedroom.

Nobody had any idea how the fire happened and it was blamed on the heater thing being faulty and having a short circuit of some sort. 

I haven't talked about this to my sister or to my family and think I will just leave this is the dark cobwebs of my life's basement to not mention again.

TL;DR - I used a grill lighter to set a heater on fire in my room which burned my house down. Accidentally.
