So right now I'm a junior in high school but last Friday I asked a girl classmate  who I've crushed on since freshman year to be my girlfriend. She said yes, shoo be doo be doo to me.

Now, every day at lunch ever since last year we've just sat in the library and worked or talked or anything. So today was no different and we're just talking about our plans tonight or something.

All of a sudden, the talk redirects to something very interesting she says.

"Meinster, how long have you liked me?" 

I was taken aback because I've liked this girl since day one for her beautiful looks, smarts, attitude, etc.

"Well I've been crushing mad on you since day one" I said or something. But she wasn't satisfied and told me to tell her more, like my inner thoughts and whatnot.

Naturally, I say "Well tbh after I followed you on Instagram I used to jack off to your bikini pics, that's how much I crushed on you." to flatter her even more.

For some reason she turned red and looked at me in shock, then told me that we're no longer together and she just walked out of the library and to the cafeteria I guess.

...Bad mistake?

*Edit* Thanks for the comments. I'd go for a beer at the bar right now, but clearly I'm underage. Anyways, on Tuesday at school (Monday is Columbus Day) I'll try to salvage this. I'll update then.
