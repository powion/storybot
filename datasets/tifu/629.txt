Take a minute to scroll through the front page of /r/TIFU.  

SEX SEX SEX. Being fingered or having someone pee in your mouth is NOT a fuckup. Some of these posts are [just uninteresting](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2g26da/tifu_by_enjoying_rough_sex/)

Can we stop with it? There is room for NSFW posts to be interesting, but sex alone, no matter how awkward, is not worthy of /r/TIFU. 
To the mods, might I humbly suggest separating these somehow?  

Thoughts welcome, thanks in advance and sorry if I am being annoying as fuck        



**Clarification:**  Sex-related TIFU and NSFW TIFU can be hilarious, when the **"FU" itself isn't sexual.**. When you have sex, however outlandish, and consider it to be a fuckup- it makes me feel like this sub is inhabited by immature teens, and I know this is not the case.  Getting sh*t on your dick during anal is called life, its not special.

Edit: Thank you /u/ij00mini for recommending the fantastic /r/TalesFromTheSheets as a related sub, for anyone who needs to share his awkwards sexual encounters. Great Idea!    
Edit 2: Thanks, stranger
