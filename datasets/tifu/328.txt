Hello Reddit,

Allow me to take you back to 2007 when I was a 15 year old little bastard.

Growing up, I gave my parents a lot of trouble. Started drinking in the 8th grade, started doing pills and smoking weed a year later. Anyway, I'm 15 and Halo 3 was just released. It's mid October and I had finally saved up to buy an Xbox 360. Mom gave me $60 towards the game and I go home from GameStop rather happy. Flash forward about a week later, cute older girl down the street was having a party and invited me and a couple of my buddies. It's around 11pm, parents are asleep, I sneak out of the basement like I typically do, and proceed to party. 6 or 7 beers, a couple joints, and an Oxy 3 of us split later, I am MESSED UP. Around 1am I feel my phone buzzing. This is never good. I look at my phone, it's my mom. I go to where no one can hear.. and she's furious. I tell everyone I gotta go and stumble to my house. I walk through the basement door and there stands my mother, asking me how drunk I am. I throw a few smart remarks her way, but then I hear a voice call my name from my dad's workshop. Mom NEVER gets my dad involved cuz the man's scary as all hell. I step into my father's workshop and he's got a sledgehammer in one hand and his other hand is resting gently on my Xbox. Gives me a speech about how I need to get my shit together or he's gonna smash my Xbox. To reiterate, I am MESSED UP. I look at my dad directly in the eyes, I try to look serious but I'm giggling like a school girl and manage to only say, "NO BALLS". Without hesitation dad lifts the hammer and Thor-smashes it. Again, and again, and again. I cried the next morning when I came to.

TL;DR: Got messed up at a party at the age of 15, got called home at 1am, dad threatens to smash Xbox, I "no balls" him, dad smashes Xbox, I cry next morning.

**edit 1:** To be fair, my father was **NOT** going to smash my Xbox until my drunk ass brain decided to mouth the words that would inevitably send my Xbox into eternal hell

**edit 2:** "No balls" is challenging someone to complete the task they've threatened to carry out by telling them they don't have the balls to do it.

**edit 3:** I turned out okay, graduated college and got a job in what I love doing and all that good stuff. Made bad decisions along the way but haven't touched a drug in years. Thanks for caring those who asked!
