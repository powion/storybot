So I am a type 1 diabetic. I take insulin before eating meals since it take 15 minutes to start working. Earlier I took insulin and placed some leftovers in the microwave for 2 minutes. I then proceeded to start a game of league thinking I could eat while I played.
30 minutes into the game I start feeling light headed. But since we were about to win, I ignored the feeling and kept playing. As the game was coming to a close I could barely keep my eyes open, which is when it dawns on me that I am about to pass out due to low blood sugar. With no one else home and too tired to walk I got on my hands and knees and started to crawl towards the kitchen.
I get to the kitchen and since I don't have enough energy to reach the microwave I open the fridge and on bottom shelf grab an old container of orange juice. Despite the orange juice being old I started chugging until my sugar level came up enough for me to stand again. 
I almost died, but at least my team won?
