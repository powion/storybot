This technically happened yesterday... but you know, I am calling close enough. Also, to elaborate on the title, I am female.

I woke up at what I thought was just ten at night. Feeling anxious, I took an Ambien. What I did not know was that it was in fact five in the morning. This was due to lag on a seven year-old phone I had to reactivate after my brand new iPhone fell in the toilet.

I always go for a quick morning run at six. Which I got up and did as per my routine.

As I was running, I realized that something about my coordination was not quite right. I turned around on a street I do not normally run on to return to my apartment. At which point, I hit a patch of uneven cement (due to construction) and completely eat shit.

I thought that I was fine, just a couple scrapes. I run to the closest place open at that time of day to clean up. I realize that I am covered in splotches of blood, my shoulder and knee are torn up... and my chin is literally split open.

When I run home to my girlfriend, I wake her up to check out the wound. She becomes alarmed and sends a picture of the gash to her mother, who works in the medical field.

I ended up at the ER for stitches.

TL;DR - Went for a run on Ambien. Got 7 stitches. Yes, I fucked up.
