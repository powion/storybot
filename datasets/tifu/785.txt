This literally just happened. 

So my boyfriend and I are long distance, and like most long distance couples, we tend to spice it up via FaceTime. This morning, his sister had just gotten in the car to go to Ikea, so we started having a nice, private session of cyber sex. I was moaning and talking, like you do, when I heard a weird buzzing and stopped hearing my boyfriend's voice.

I kept moaning for a few seconds, and then heard a very scared and apprehensive "Hello?" 

The video was still on my boyfriend's face, so I had no idea what the fuck was going on and was legitimately afraid someone had tapped our phones or something.

I hung up. 2 seconds later my boyfriend calls me back. 

His sister had taken his car to Ikea. The bluetooth was on in the car. When she turned it on, the audio synced to our FaceTime call while the video stayed on my boyfriend. My boyfriend's sister heard me masturbating.

Fuck.

edit: for clarity

edit #2:hello fellow redditors. this is your friendly neighbourhood OP. 
for some reason lots of you don't believe the bluetooth scenario. Clearly if I understood bluetooth, this story wouldn't have happened. 
However, bf's house is a bungalow and his room extends out front, and is right next to the driveway. It's probably about 25 feet? I don't fucking know. 

tbh it doesn't really matter if you don't believe me. it won't make it unhappen. I really wish it could, because now my bf's sister knows what I sound like when I flick the bean. 

goodbye and don't make the same mistakes as me.
