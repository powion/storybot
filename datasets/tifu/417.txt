I was fresh out of high school, working as a receptionist for a fancy computer firm.  It was my 2nd day on the job and the sales manager approached me and asked if I would announce over the company intercom 'that the Sares meeting is beginning'.  I repeated his request back to him and he said, 'not Sares....Saaaaares'.  No problem - I picked up the phone and proceeded to announce to the entire building that the 'Saaaaares meeting is beginning'.  Immediately I knew IFU because the entire building erupted into laughter.  Turns out the poor bastard had a speech impediment and pronounced his 'L's' as 'R's'.  Sales meeting....not Saaaaaaares meeting
