This actually happened today, and I'm still in the library! 

Every Tuesday and Thursday, I have 8am classes. Naturally, I'm pretty tired afterwards and sleep in my favourite library on campus for a few hours before my next lecture. 

I always set an alarm on my phone, put in some headphones, and get my snooze on. 

Today, at around 11:30, a girl randomly poked me awake and told me that my phone has constantly been ringing. 

This is when I came to the awful, embarrassing realization that for some reason, when my phone rings to wake me up, it bypasses my headphones and just rings. (Not sure it's some weird techy thing that happens with these new earbuds I'm using.) I don't realize it's ringing like this, because I sleep with my phone next to me on the desk, and expect the alarm to be pretty loud. 

Now, this wouldn't be such a big deal if my phone only rang once, maybe twice, max three times. But no, I'm an awful, snooze button lover. I had wanted to wake up at 10, but have been snoozing every 9 mins (wtf Apple??) since 10, all the way to 11:30. 

What makes it even worse, is that I've been sleeping in this library every Tuesday and Thursday, for the past month and a bit since this term started. 

Oops. I'M SORRY FOR INTERRUPTING YOUR STUDYING. 

Edit 1: I worked till 12:15am the night before, and had to be up at 6am for my 8am. I'm usually not this bad. Have mercy on my uni student soul. 

Edit 2: I'm now aware that the 9min thing is not because of Apple, thanks ELI5 peeps! :) 

Edit 3: I'm a commuter. No dorm on campus for me! 

Edit 4: Seems like a lot of people who were there are Redditors. If you see me, please let me apologize in person! Especially if you're at that library often on those days. I usually wear a bright red jacket. (Maybe we can even be study buddies. I obviously need the motivation. I promise I won't sleep with my headphones in when we're supposed to be studying.)
