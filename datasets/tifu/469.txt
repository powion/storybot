My five month old kitten was napping beside me while I was laying on my side reading a book.

Felt a bit of a squeaker building up, and thought it would be funny to startle kitty with it. 

Spread my cheeks, and lined up my puckered brown eye to the back of kitty's head. I felt like Lee Harvey Oswald.

Let my little squeaker go.

It sounded like a Wookie coughing.

Poor cat shot about three feet high and six feet forward off the bed.

This was about three hours ago, and he still won't come out for his food and bolts as soon as I try to touch him.

EDIT - Thanks for the gold!

As requested, here's a pic of my victim. Looks as though he's still struggling to come to terms with it.
