This happend just 2-3 hours ago. Today is my first day of my internship at a supermarket. For my internship I need to do a research. They put me in an office with an one-way window that has a view over the store, mainly the cash registers.

I have a friend who works at this supermarket and this is how I got my internship at the store. After 2 hours of my internship I spoke with my friend. She told me that one of the cashiers thought I was cute. I was curious who it was because I never had a girlfriend before and have a low self-esteem. She pointed out who it was. I was really excited.

So I went back to the office and stared at her for a good 15 minutes through the one-way window. She sometimes looked at the window but I was like 'hey, you can't see me through this window' so I kept staring at her. I was pretty sure she was just looking at customers who were near the window. 

I left the office to go to the toilet. While I was heading back to the office I realized I could see through the window. Welp, apparently if you switch the lights on of the office the effect of the one-way window goes away. I have been basically staring at her with a creepy face for full 15 minutes and she knew.

I bet she doesn't think that I'm cute anymore.
