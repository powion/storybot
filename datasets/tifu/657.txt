I'll tell you right off the bat: if you don't know **for certain** how babies enter the world, consider this your **SPOILER ALERT!**

When I was ten years old, daddy knocked mommy up for the 5th time.  Another brother!?  Yes, please!

About 8 months into the pregnancy, my mom approaches me and asks if I'd like to be present for the birth.  Hell yes, I respond, I'm all about science!  Up to this point in my life, I was under the distinct impression that all babies were birthed via C-section, so I'm pumped.  For the next few weeks, I am a damn angel; I knew I had been chosen because my parents deemed me "mature enough" to handle a surgery, and I did not want that free pass to Babytown revoked.  

Fast forward to New Year's Eve, 1996.  Mom is in the hospital, and we are waiting.  No biggie, I got my "I Can Draw Dinosaurs" book, a fat stack of blank printer paper, and a handful of Power Rangers pencils.

I'm on my second Triceratops when things start to heat up.  A nurse hands me a little facemask and some latex gloves.  I snap them on and throw her a wink that would make Ellen DeGeneres weak in the knees.  I'm all business now.  I move up to stand beside my mother, but another nurse pulls me back and tells me to stand closer to her feet, behind the...doctor...

Her legs are spreading...

This can't...be..right...

**ABORT!  ABORT!**

Within thirty seconds I'm fumbling for the eject button, but it's too late.  Before I can pray for Promethean goggles, I'm staring straight down the barrel of Mom's baby cannon.  "Push!" they urge.  "Eat shit and die!" Mom screams.  Now they're going full ham sandwich.  The doctor is reaching into her cheese factory and I view Hell in all its terrible glory, bathed in vernix and the blood of innocents.

Within five minutes it was all over.  The nurses let me poke the placenta with my gloved fingers, but not even that could console me.  I was dead inside.

TLDR: Got punk'd by mommy.

Edit: fixed a word.

Edit 2: thanks for the gold and the Bitcoin tip, you glorious bastards!

Edit 3: I'm trying to convince my mom to come and add her version of the story, but she's not feeling it. I'll keep working on her though.

Edit 4: I got an audio clip of me and her talking about the experience on my phone. Headed home now to upload.

Edit 5: **OP DELIVERS**.  Here's a short [audio clip](http://www.chirbit.com/LustyHitler) where I ask my mom a few questions about the story.
