Reddit..TIFU

Yesterday morning started out like any other Monday. Getting to work around 8am, I grabbed a cup of coffee and started going through the emails from the weekend. 

I have this co-worker in the cubicle next to me who is sometimes quite obnoxious. I've occasionally had to tell her to quiet down when I was in the middle of a call because I couldn't hear the person on the other end.

Well, yesterday morning when I was in the middle of a call, the same thing happened. She was making all of these strange, loud noises, and I couldn't make out what the person on the other end of my phone was trying to say. So I yelled over the cubicle, 'Hey, can you please be a bit more quiet, I'm on the phone!' The noises didn't stop. So I was like wtf, I put my call on hold, and walked around to her cubicle to see why she couldn't stfu. 

Reddit...she was having a seizure and I yelled at her. I immediately called 911 and ran to alert my boss. Apparently she is mildly epileptic and she has seizures occasionally. She understood why I yelled at her, but I still feel horrible about it.

TL;DR TIFU by yelling at a girl who was having a seizure and not just being loud for no reason.
