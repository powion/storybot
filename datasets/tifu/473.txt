This FU as most is not from today but is from yesterday... actually you could argue the FU is 3 years ago or even 4. 

Was in a fairly new relationship with a girl "Tara" for a few months while on a work term in my home town. Work term ended and i went back to school a few hours away. Within a couple months i had received a phone call from Tara telling me she was pregnant. I came home for the weekend and discussed what our plan was and she decided she was going to keep it. 

3 years later my step mom urged my dad that I should do a paternity test since she thinks the child looked nothing like me. Got the results back today and for the last 3 years i was financially and emotionally invested in a child that wasn't mine. Ends up Tara was sleeping around. Now i feel awful for the kid and don't know how to exit the scene. 

EDIT: Since this has been coming up in a lot of comments. I'm no longer seeing Tara for some time now other than picking the little one up every other weekend. I am going to try to ween myself out of their life and go on living mine. For the kid I hope she finds the real father but man thats gotta be an awkward conversation to start. 

EDIT#2: Thanks for all the support and suggestions. Thankfully I don't live in the US. As i mentioned I was in school out of the city so I wasn't as close to the kid as most people seem to imagine. Work also took me a ways away for some duration for the 2nd year. Since i was in school for the 1st year and a half i wasn't able to pay any child support during that time. I'm not asking for any of it back but i fully intend to cut payments from here on out.
