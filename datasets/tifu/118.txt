This actually happened this past weekend. My wife's friend came over to our house to hang out and she brought her 3-year-old son to play with our 3-year-old daughter. The adults chatted in the living room while the kids were in the playroom next to us.

My daughter loves to pretend to be different animals and mimic their sounds and movements. For example, she'll say, "I'm and horse" and run around saying, "neigh, neigh" while trotting about. Well, she runs to where we are sitting and does just that. I say, "Well I'm an lion" and the I start making roaring sounds. Shortly after our friend's son runs in and starts making what sounds like, "meh, meh, meh, meh, meh."  

I wasn't quite sure what he was pretending to be so I said, "Are you a goat?" The kids just laugh and run back to where they were playing so I think nothing of it. As I turn around, I see my wife giving me a very hard glare. I'm not really sure why so I just shrug it off figuring she thought I was just acting immature in front of our guest.

After our friend and her kid leave, my wife tells me our friend's son has a speech impediment. He stutters when trying to talk. The sound he was making was him trying to say something, not an animal sound.

TL:DR - I made fun of a 3-year-old for stuttering.
