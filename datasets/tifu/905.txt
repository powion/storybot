It's hot as hell here today, so I didn't feel like cooking, and decided to order a pizza. Local place down the street offers free delivery and gets the pie over in like 30 minutes, so I call them up and order. I hear the doorbell and grab the money from my wallet, not realizing it was only enough for the pizza and not enough for a tip. (The guys who deliver for this place use their own car, it's the least you can do.) I told him to hang on a sec while I go back in for a tip. Now usually when the pizza guys leave their car unlocked and running, they're only away from them for like 30 seconds at the most, but he was waiting for me to come back. While I'm looking through my wallet, I hear the guy scream, "WHAT THE FUCK?!" and an engine take off down the street. I look out the door and see him standing in the street, and he says, "Some kids just stole my car!" 

The only reason the kids had enough time to steal the car is because I made the pizza guy wait, so I feel kinda shitty about that. I invited him in after he called the cops, though, and we ate some pizza while we waited for them to come by and take a statement. Nice dude, and totally not upset with me about it, but I still feel like it was at least partially my fault. 

Edit: Wow! This got more attention than I expected. Thanks everyone! I get it that it's not literally my fault, but I still played a part in the situation. I just did what I could do to try to make the guy feel better. As a followup for those interested, I live in a quiet suburban town in New England, and this is totally not a common occurrence. Freak accident! I'm thinking of going down to the pizza place this week to check in and see if the police had any luck finding the dude's car.
