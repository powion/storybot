This didn't happen today, it happened on Friday.

I was in Tech Ed class and my mates and I decided it'd be funny to make a fully functioning vibrating dildo. 

Why not right?

Any way we worked on it over the semester and on Friday we decided it was ready. Being the tech amateurs that we were, the dildo had to be plugged in to work.

We plugged it in but the result was very faint, hardly enough to feel, let alone pleasure a woman. It was a good thing we prodigies installed a little knob that would change the "intensity".  However it  didn't quite work as we expected. We assumed that if we made a switch that caused more electricity flow, it would make more intensity. Seems fair right?

Wrong. 

The entire fucking school went black. This is a schools with over 3000 students by the way. We all got suspended, an awkward conversation with our parents, and a spot in the list of legends in our school.

Tdlr: made a dysfunctional dildo and ended up causing a blackout.
