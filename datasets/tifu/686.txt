My 7 yr old and 10 yr old were more excited than I expected for St. Patrick's day. They made leprechaun "hangouts" and went to bed hoping for some leprechaun magic to occur. Among a few other things I dyed the toilet water and the milk for cereal in the morning green. My 10 year old was sitting at the table this morning and says "Mom - you know what I'm thinking? If the toilet water is green AND the milk is green....." Oh well, looks like I'll be finishing off a half gallon of green milk.

Edit: Oh man, I posted this using an app on my phone and I was told the post was removed for breaking rules.  I just realized that it had ever actually posted.  Also - the nsfw tag was added automatically and I'm not sure why.    Anyway - I made little green footprints leading up to the toilet and on the toilet seat - so it looked like a leprechaun had a pee there.  My son then assumed that the milk was green because the leprechauns had pissed in it as well.
