This just happened, unfortunately for me. 

So I'm running across town to pick up my hastily abandoned car from its overnight in-car-ceration near the pub. Beautiful morning, it's 7am, I'm ahead of schedule so things are going ok. 

Once in my car I remember some coffee left from the previous evening. Oh good! Cold coffee! It's 7-eleven coffee, and I'm pretty sure their milk products could survive the apocalypse unspoiled, so I'm not worried and willing to take a few sips. Ugh, dregs. But I need the caffeine. At this point I notice a little bit of extra... texture in there though. Did some crumbs from my granola bar get in last night? I swirl the nearly empty cup and drain it.

Weird... kind of crunchy. I'm still not worried about spoiled milk at this point. The crunchiness is too crumb-feeling, too *healthy* sounding to be a curdle. I swallow a few more crunchy bits before thinking to spit one out and look at it. If this sounds naive, please undrestand I was (and am) very tired, and I was *really convinced* they were just crumbs.

They weren't crumbs. They were bugs. Somehow my car has fruit flies, and they were breeding in my coffee. Ew ew ew ew ew ew ew.

Tl;Dr drank a bug orgy by accident.
