So this happened about 2 months ago, I'm a cook at a small family owned restaurant but I can fill in for the bussers when they need which is what I was doing on that fatefull day. Im a pretty quiet guy so bussing and hosting is a bit out of my element so I was already uncomfortable enough as it was. Then this middle aged overeweight couple came in looking for a table to sit at. These people were probably 300 lbs each, keep in mind I would never judge them or make fun of them. I asked them, as I ask all parties that come in, how many people they had. 

This is where it starts to go south, they said two but in a loud restaurant and being far away I somehow heard 5. They asked to sit in the bar but I told these two overeweight people, thinking they needed a table for 5 that our biggest table in the bar was for 4 but "they could probably fit." The man looked at me funny and said ok... we will just sit here, pointing at a booth that also seats 4. I said ok, "would you like me to get an extra chair to put on the end for more space?" This time the man looked angry and said "its ok, I can fit my fatass in here." At this point I was starting to realize something was up so I tried to explain myself by saying that I just wanted them to have enough space. This didnt help my case. The man now looked furious and asked what my problem was. I then realized what could be the problem and asked how many people were with them, they told me 2 and I then apologized and explained my confusion. The man didnt think it was funny though and I avoided them all night. I did tell my manager what happened and she laughed her ass off.

tl; dr: thought a fat couple wanted a table of 5 when they only wanted a table for 2, repeatedly told them they couldnt fit at a table for 4.
