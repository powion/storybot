I (27 year old male) live with a close female(29 year old) friend of mine.  I have known her all my life and she is like family.  

I came down for breakfast this morning and my roommate made a joke about interrupting my masturbating for eggs and bacon.  It was funny.  I laughed, she laughed, her boyfriend laughed.  To take the joke a step further I joked back that I was not doing that, the way to tell is to hand me something after I leave my room, if I refuse to take it with my right hand then she knows.  Less laughter, awkward silence ensues.  I realize I made shit weird and change the topic.  I put the whole thing out of my mind and go to work.

When I got home from work today I went up to my room to read.  When I came down my roommate walked out of her room, handed me some papers, nodded and walked off.  Every time I would come out of room she would come up and hand me something.  Finally it happened.  I was browsing the internet and somehow found porn... After I go to walk to the bathroom and my roommate hands me two books.  I grab them both with my left hand and start walking away.  She bursts out laughing and runs to tell her boyfriend.  

Tifu by giving my roomie a jerk off detector and she thinks it is hilarious. 

Edit:  Today I came down for breakfast and my roommate hands me toast.  I take it with my right hand, walk to the table, swap it with her toast with my left hand and proceed to carefully eat it using only the left.  She had no idea how to react.  After I was done I washed my hands and left her standing there trying to figure out what to do.  

Edit 2 for clarification.  My room is on the only room on the top floor. It opens to a set of switchback stairs and leads to the hallway. Her room is opposite the stairs. The bathroom is down the hall.  I pass her room on the way to the bathroom.  

Edit 3 for yet more clarification.  I won't touch my dick and then not wash my hands after.  I spent many years as a cook and some habits die hard.
