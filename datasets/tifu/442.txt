So I should preface this by saying that I am a 17 year old male, and I recently went to the doctor for a physical. This practice is located in a converted house that's a little bit older and very small. They started off the process by having me produce a urine sample. They handed me a cup and pointed me to the bathroom. It wasn't until I had already filled the cup that I realized there was no lid. Weird, maybe, but I can't remember if they had given me a lid last time or not, so I ignored it. I walked over to the door and threw it open, forgetting how light the door was and how hard as quickly it opened. I managed to knock a young kid, maybe 4-6 years old, that was standing right in front of the door, onto his ass and before I could do anything about it, had already spilled my cup of urine all over his head and body. I was horrified, and the kid began to scream, along with his mother and several other people in the waiting room. She gave me a death glare, the doctors rushed out to see what had happened, and everybody turned to me. The rest of that physcial was very awkward, and now I likely need to find a new doctor. So, that was fun.
