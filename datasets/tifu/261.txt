There are a lot of stray cats near where I live. One of them, who some of my friends have named Troubles, is actually quite friendly unlike the others. I'm walking to work (about a 2 min walk from my front door), and notice Troubles sitting on the dirt path, sunbathing. He sees me, and meows. I of course, meow back at him, which leads to him walking over to me. I start petting him, and he rubs himself against my leg, purring etc. 20 minutes go by, and I'm still hanging out and playing with Troubles. I am now late for work. I get to work, and understandably my boss demands to know why I was late. I'm then berated for being a "child" after I explained that the reason I was late, is I was distracted by a cat.

TL;DR: I, a 23 y/o man was late for work because I couldn't resist playing with a friendly kitty.

Edit: I left early for work, because I was gonna make coffee there, so even after 20 minutes of pussy petting, I ended up only being about 5-6 minutes late.
