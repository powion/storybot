Last night I was up until 4 am playing counter strike on my laptop, eating doritos and drinking orange crush until I eventually fell asleep mid game.

I wake up this morning to find a terrible smell of cancer-oranges and my shirt stuck to the bed, as well as sheets that were stained a lovely shade of piss yellow. Apparently the cap on my crush was not on tightly so it leaked all over my laptop mousepad, sheets, shirt, and soaked into my matress which will likely now become moldy. To add to that my doritos also spilled everywhere and now there are ants.

**TL:DR sleeping with your crush is a bad idea**
