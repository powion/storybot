This happened last night.

I really enjoy jelly beans. They're definitely my 'go to' for something sweet to have every once in a while. Sours, gourmet, starburst, you name it; I probably have a jar of them in my pantry.

My family knows I enjoy jelly beans, and for Christmas as a stocking stuffer, they bought me a four pound jar of gourmet Jelly Belly jelly beans, a box of sour, starburst, and miscellaneous flavours. Awesome! I have one or two handfuls a day for after meals or just while I'm working.

Life is good. At least until I made a mistake that almost made me cry. 

So last night I'm chatting to friends, munching from my jelly bean jar when I realize that it's about halfway gone. I get the idea, "Hey! I should open the three boxes of random flavours and put them all in the jar and mix them up. Then I can just throw the boxes away and have a full jar again."
And so I did. I opened the three boxes of about .5 lbs of jelly beans each, and put them into the jar, gave it a roll and a shake to mix everything up, and threw the empty stuff away. Huzzah! Refilled jelly beans!

I sit in my computer chair, grab three of my new assorted jelly bean bonanza, and plop the white, black, and red treats into my mouth.
What assaulted my taste buds was probably the most vile thing I have ever tasted in my life. It felt like a nightclub bathroom kicked the door down into my mouth, and started rubbing its nasty grungy tiles of its floor against my tongue in some sort of sick dance.

My face contorted and crumpled into a 'Dear christ what is happening to me?!' expression, and I spat the contents of my mouth out into my hand. It smelled 'awful'. I can't express how bad it was, especially after being chewed up.
Something is DEFINITELY wrong. So I rush to the trash can and remove the boxes to start properly reading the labels.
"Starburst", okay nothing bad there.
"Sours", still nope.
"Bean Boozled", wh-....what is this?

I inspect the box, and it turns out to actually be a little game that jelly belly put together. It has ten flavours within, out of the standard 45 gourmet ones, and of those ten flavours, some of them have been swapped with god awful ones that appear THE EXACT SAME as their partners. To make this clear, they are identical in shape and appearance, their flavours have been swapped.

I pale as I start to read what potential flavours there are. I will list them here for your benefit;

* Pear has a chance to be Snot
* Tutti-Frutti has a chance to be Gym Socks
* Lime has a chance to be Lawn Clippings
* Buttered popcorn? Rotten eggs
* Berry Blue could be Toothpaste
* Chocolate Pudding could be Canned Dog Food
* Caramel Corn is Moldy Cheese
* Peach is Barf
* Coconut is Baby Wipes
* Licorice is Skunk Spray (jfc this guy)

My face gets more and more sad as I read these, and I glance back at the mound of chewed up Satan I spat out to try and gauge the colours of the three I tossed into my mouth.
Skunk Spray, Barf, and Baby Wipes.
It tasted exactly like it said. I'm sitting in my chair slowly realizing what I've done to my Christmas Gift. I've ruined it.
Every handful has a chance to bear one of these god awful, overpowering flavours that will completely ruin any enjoyment out of the rest. I tried, I tried to continue, but the occasional barf or moldy cheese completely ruined my appetite and I had to stop. I'm a man, but I felt like crying. Laugh crying. Staring at this jar of assorted evil.

I went to bed defeated. This afternoon, I have poured out the entire contents onto a blanket, and I've separated out the every member of the ten flavours, good or evil. I found out if you squeeze them and smell it, you can pick up what flavour it is without completely ruining the jelly bean. So this is going to be my afternoon.

Reddit, don't make my mistake. Read your labels, or end up in Jelly Bean limbo like me.

TL;DR - Mixed many kinds of jelly bean flavours, got some Bertie Botts every-flavoured nonsense type, to a magnitude of 10 in the fray. Nearly died from a mouthful of baby wipes and skunk spray, and am now sitting on my floor sorting through good and evil to find the culprits.
