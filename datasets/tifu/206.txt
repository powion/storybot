Obligatory "this didn't happen today" announcement. This happened several years ago while I was in high school.

My freshmen year of HS, I had a science class in the very back of the school that was two connecting rooms-one for notes/lectures and the other was a lab.

After our first test of the year, those who finished first were sent to the lab room so we wouldn't have to sit silently. The lab had a bunch of breakfast bar type of tables, and each one had a gas line with a nozzle sticking out for the burners and stuff. The teacher told us not to worry about them since the gas had been cut off years ago due to low use.

So, I was done before any of my friends and started messing with the nozzle, trying to see how it worked. And then it snapped off. I spent a while trying to secure it back, but it was broken. So, I set it back on so it looked right, but would fall off if it were bumped/touched at all.

The next year, they stopped using those two classrooms because they were so far in the back, and they had rooms in a better place, so I never thought about it again until my senior year.


Fast forward 3.5 years, I'm a senior sitting in my first block Marine Biology class. The fire alarm sounds, and the principal gets on the intercom telling everyone to calmly go outside. We all get outside, take attendance, and then are corralled into the field house for a couple hours.

Right before they sent us home, the principal addressed the school and told us that the gas lines had been turned back on this morning, but no one knew there was a broken nozzle, so the gas leaked and filled a large portion of the school before a class noticed the smell.

**tl;dr** My fuck up took three and a half years to catch up with me, but when it did it leaked gas into my high school and caused a school wide panic and evacuation.
