Didn't actually happen today, but rather a few weeks ago. 
I had been growing ghost peppers in my garden all summer to use in salsa and stuff like that and when fall came around I had a lot left over. 
One night, when I had some friends over, they saw the peppers and begged me to give them some so they could see how spicy they were. I initially refused but a few days later decided to bring a few in to lunch (because I thought it would be funny). 
So first I give a pepper to friend #1, telling him to start slow with a little piece, and he proceeds to eat almost the entire pepper. Within a few minutes he's running around the lunchroom with a completely Red face saying he feels it in his ears. Funniest shit ever. Then a different friend who is Indian and eats spicy food all the time asks for one and I'm like hell yeah that was funny. So he eats the entire thing and basically has the same reaction. At this point the teachers are noticing two kids running around and acting like crazy people so I get the hell out of there and go to my next class. 
I later found out that after I left, a different classmate (who's a huge idiot) took the peppers and tried to lace other people's drinks by rubbing the seeds in there. Karma got the best of him as he accidentally got the residue in his eyes and spent the rest of the day in the nurses office and ended up with detention while nobody else got in trouble. 
So now I'm know around campus as the stupid guy who brought in ghost peppers. 

Edit: A lot of people are arguing that this was a win for me. In some ways it was but it also created some inconveniences for me; my school is pretty strict and it took some maneuvering to not get in trouble. Some teachers/parents don't respect me as much and I had to deal with the wrath of my parents who were furious (not fun). I wasn't quite sure where to post this but this subreddit seemed like a decent place to share the story
