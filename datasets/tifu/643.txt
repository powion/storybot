This happened minutes ago:

My wife is a graduate assistant at a major university in our state. This semester is her first teaching two sections of 20 students. While fixing her wifi connection I saw that she had an assignment open in another window. I added the line "I like dicks. Dicks, dicks, dicks. And vaginas!" Turns out this assignment was about to be posted to her teaching portal.. And she saved my changes. I forgot about it until one of her students emailed her about it.

On a side note, what are the options for a homeless male in a non metropolitan area? 


*UPDATE* 

The file was only downloaded once, by the student that emailed my wife. She corrected it before anyone else saw it. Yes, I know it was a stupid thing to do, hence the TIFU post. It wasn't emailed directly, so no contaminated files are sitting in any inboxes, so hopefully no more damage will come from this. My wife of course is angry, but she is forgiving (some may consider to a fault in this case.)

*UPDATE 2*

I went to my wife's boss and explained the situation. He was unaware that anything had happened, but assured me that my wife will not be held accountable in any way. Only one student saw the line, the rest did not download until it was fixed.
