I've been married for almost two years. Last weekend, I decided I wanted to liven up our sex life. My husband works away from home one weekend a month, and I figured I would surprise him on Sunday evening when he walked in the door after having been away.

I bought some fun lingerie, applied some porn star makeup, curled my hair, and put on some hooker heels. We have a door in the kitchen that leads to the driveway, so I knew he would be coming in through that door. I figured, what could be sexier than my tired husband walking in the door after a long weekend of working to find his wife all dolled up and cooking dinner? 

Here's where I fucked up. My husband called me to let me know he was about 5 minutes away. In my giddiness, I grabbed the first vegetable near me and began chopping. 

It was an onion.

My husband walked in the door to find his wife, all dressed up and apparently bawling her eyes out over the cutting board. My porn star makeup had run down my face, and I could barely keep my eyes open. What's worse is I managed to roll my ankle while walking in my hooker heels to the kitchen sink. He didn't know whether to be concerned or turned on, as his half naked wife limped around the kitchen with tears running down her face. 

In my flustered state I blurted out something along the lines of, "I'm making dinner!". 

TL;DR Tried to surprise my husband by being sexy. He thought I was having a mental breakdown.
