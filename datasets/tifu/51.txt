So this didn't happen today but happened earlier this year.

I was due to attend a university for a guided tour and interview and we were allowed to bring a guest with us. I decided to bring my dad because he's a fun guy to make the trip with and thought he might be interested in looking around.

So I'm filling out all the details on the online booking form and it asks "Who will be attending with you?". Now here's the fuckup, rather than typing in my dad's name, I enter " My Father". Clearly I was thinking a tad too literally.

So I forget about this for a few weeks and we finally end up going. When we get there, they are calling out names and handing out visitor badges in pairs, one for prospective students and one for their guests. I receive my pair of badges, one with my name on and the other simply with the words "My Father" on. I show my dad, hoping he'll laugh it off and I can go explain and get a different name badge but instead he insists on wearing the badge all day, kindly explaining to everyone how stupid I was.
