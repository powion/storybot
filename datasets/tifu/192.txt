I work in the IT branch of a large company wich manages 4 hospitals and a lot of smaller clinics. The CEO clicked on a mail containing the new ransomware called Teslalocker v3 and his PC immediatly came to our offices. Luckily we have great relationship between co-workers. And so we are joking about the dickhead of our CEO who managed to get this virus with a .zip file. With a live hiren's boot cd we discovered that luckily only the files in the shared folders were encrypted leaving a lot of file untouched. So we decided to clone this hard disk on another one, format the original disk to reinstall Windows and copy back the good files. So now i'm in front of [Norton Ghost 32](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/__VCmX9dWoco/RlnjUPsSOKI/AAAAAAAAAB4/dX7Bv0b1UNc/s1600-h/Ghost_select.jpg) with the 2 disks connected and had to decide wich disk to use as source and wich to use as destination. You probably guess where this is going. I had no other relevant information but the brand of the 2 disks and my still-laughing brain inverted them. Time warp 20 minutes the clone is done and I boot the original disk before formatting it to save the files and the PC configurations. On the Windows logo screen i immediately start jerking to why the PC of the CEO was still XP and had a very strange PC and Login names. In a split second the realization kicks in: I copied inverting the disks and completely lost the PC configurations and the good files. I immediately go to report to my boss who had to call the CEO and fake that all the file were lost with the virus to cover me.

TL;DR my boss will never trust me again because idiot me erased CEO hard disk.
