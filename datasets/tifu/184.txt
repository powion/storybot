So, like most, this didn't happen today. Or Yesterday. Not even this year.

In 2010 it was the second quarter of my freshman year of college. It was a pretty typical friday night: I found myself playing beer pong with a person I didn't know and I house I'd never been before and drinking something that I wasn't quite sure of. We had been playing for what seemed like an eternity when I notice two girls from my dorm walk into the room. I am shitfaced by this point and I call out to them despite not knowing them very well.

They come over and we talk about dumb shit such as what're you drinking, do you know of any other parties, etc. One of the girls is maybe the most beautiful girl I've ever seen (sober). The other is... homely, we'll call her A.

So at some point in the conversation A asks her friend if she wants to go dance. She says no since she and I are having an intelligent conversation about the finer points of beer pong. I ask A why she doesn't just go ask a guy to dance with her. She says that she's afraid of being turned down. This is were I fuck up.

Quick point: I can barely stand straight.

I start laying down the most inspirational speech I have ever heard. I tell her to go out and dance and if guys don't want to dance then they are friggin idiots since they don't know what they're missing. She is a strong, independent, beautiful woman who doesn't need the validation of any man to have a good time. I continue for about 15 mins of motivational rambling.

Afterwards she looks at me, I can still see the sparkle of admiration in her eyes, and says, "Wow, thanks brochill! Would you want to go dance with me?"

"Nah." And I turn around and keep playing beer pong.

Tl:dr I helped a girl with her confidence, only to immediately reinforce her doubts and shatter it.

EDIT: Wow, this blew up. I'm glad some many people find humor in my moment of obliviousness.

EDIT 2: The Re-Editing: Thanks for the gold, stranger! I feel vastly superior to everyone else already.
