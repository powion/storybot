Okay so technically this was last night. 

So for some back story: 

I've known him since 2009, in high school. He was the older boy I crushed on, and we were never more than "just friends". Fast forward a couple years (I had a kid with another man and became a nurse, he became a firefighter &amp; EMT) 

We've been together for two years now and he has become the perfect boyfriend/stepfather. We live together, and have talked about marriage and another kid with no real plans. Both his family and I have continuously joked about how he would never pop the question and it's generally the subject of conversation whenever we run into someone we haven't seen in a while ("when will you two ever get married") and he would always have some excuse or reason why he didn't feel he should ask at the moment.

Today (ish) we were coming home from holiday shopping and his phone rang. I answered it, because here it's illegal to talk on the phone while driving and the voice on the other end said: "Hello this is ******* calling from Rodgers &amp; Holland, we were just calling to tell ******* his ring is ready for pick up."

Update: 5 days until Christmas and he refuses to acknowledge said incident happened. Not sure if he's so upset it's out of denial, or if he believes that by not talking/thinking about it I'll forget. Prepare for another update in 5 days.
