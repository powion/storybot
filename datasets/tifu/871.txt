[Insert obligatory this happened when I was 16 here.]

&amp;nbsp;

When I was a teenager living with my parents, I got an adorable, furry, teddy bear hamster. I named him Pipi (pronounced pee-pee) after a radioactive hamster from Invader Zim.

&amp;nbsp;

But I was constantly at school, or with friends. I didn't spend nearly enough time at home, and wanted Pipi to have some company. So, I ended up adopting another hamster, a lady hamster, to be his wife. It was a win-win; I would feel better leaving the house, and Pipi would get laid.

&amp;nbsp;


Thus, I purchased Pupu (poo-poo,) Pipi's wife. This is where I fucked up.

&amp;nbsp;


Firstly, Pupu hated Pipi. She tried as hard as she could to distance herself from her hamster husband. But Pipi liked Pupu. A lot. A little too much. Pupu would run around the cage while Pipi chased her, desperately trying to get laid. It soon became way too disturbing to watch, so sometimes after school, I'd put them in my walk-in closet so that they had some disgusting, disgusting privacy.

&amp;nbsp;


All things considered, Pipi and Pupu were healthy, happy hamsters. Pipi in particular was very happy.

&amp;nbsp;


A few uneventful months went by when one night, I was sitting in my room with the hamster cage out in the open. I got up from my bed and began to walk out the door when I noticed Pupu lying on the bottom of the cage. Worried, I closely examined her. I held my face up to the cage and peered in.

&amp;nbsp;


Plop! A baby hamster was born. Then another, then another. “Mom!” I cried out happily, so excited that I would get to have baby hamsters.

&amp;nbsp;


A million thoughts raced through my mind. What would I name them? Would any of my friends get to adopt them? What would they look like?


&amp;nbsp;


I ran out into the living room and grabbed my mother, excitedly dragging her back into the room. Heart racing and girly hormones a'tremble, I looked at the five little hamster babies, joy spilling out of my uterus. But then...

&amp;nbsp;


...my heart dropped into the pit of my stomach, falling straight out my butt and onto the floor. What happened was indescribably horrific; that hoebag hamster, Pupu, changed my entire concept of life as I knew it, and her actions would forever alter the way I thought about owning a pet any less intelligent than a house cat.

&amp;nbsp;


Pupu reached over, and without any hesitation, stuffed one of her babies into her mouth. My eyes widened. She bit it right in half, snacking on the hamster's face as unenthusiastically as a fat guy on a couch eats a bag of Cheetos, watchin'  the game.


&amp;nbsp;


Before I burst out into a fit of uncontrollable sobs that would last for minutes, Pupu managed to eat several of her babies while Pipi chilled in the top corner of the cage, probably thinking something like, 'Dumb ho said she was on the pill!'


&amp;nbsp;


Turns out, hamsters eating their young is a really common occurrence. When it happens to a teenage girl's married hamster couple, it's a little more dramatic than it sounds. But that's the truth of it. The mother hamster will eat them either due to shock and fear, or having a lack of resources in her body. Apparently, Pupu was freakin' anemic or some shit, because none of her litter survived.

&amp;nbsp;


After that, I was absolutely scarred. I caught Pipi, once again, trying to mate with Pupu, likely thinking something like, 'Hey, she dumb, but she hawt!' I couldn't take it. So I gave Pupu away and kept my rapist teddy bear hamster, the father to five deceased children, cannibalized by their own mother, ultimately, Pipi's now ex-wife.

&amp;nbsp;


The good news is that Pipi lived out a normal, healthy life. He died of old age. And I will never, ever, EVER have a hamster again.

&amp;nbsp;


Tl;Dr: Got my hamster a wife who was forced into mating, became preggers and savagely devoured her children.

&amp;nbsp;


EDIT: Front page?! So excite! Much happy! Wow! :D
Thank you Redditors for all the support. I really appreciate all the lovely comments about your lulz, and my writing style. Really, like, you have no idea how...how much I...OH GOD IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN ~joy seething from uterus~

&amp;nbsp;

PS. I was a dumb 16 year old at the time (redundant statement.) I am much more pet savvy now and believe research should be done before getting a pet. I also have a kitty who was abused by her former owner, and now she is happy. And no hamsters.

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT 2: Thanks, everyone, for telling me your stories too! There were so many replies I couldn't respond to most of them. But I did go through and read everyone else's traumatic experiences. It seems everyone, including myself, thought we just had some crazy experience which actually turned out to be super common! Nature is daaark, man.  I also appreciate the advice, like getting a bigger cage, or putting some meat next to the mother when she has her babies. Ultimately, I learned that hamsters are solitary, and that a lot of people (like some derpy 16 year old girls) just don't know the best way to house them in order to prevent this stuff from happening.

&amp;nbsp;

So, thanks again! I love having friends, so if you see me on teh subredditz, wave!
