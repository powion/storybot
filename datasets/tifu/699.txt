Obligatory "didn't happen today", this was a few weeks ago.  
I was playing with my dog when he rolled over so I could scratch his belly.  As a good dog-mother I dutifully obliged,  until I saw  something that concerned me.. what appeared to be a possible  infection in his doggy nether-regions. I immediately got up and went to my husband in the other room and  told him  "The dog has what kind of looks like  pus coming from his pens! Is it infected?  Should we take him to the vet?!" Cue my husband looking at me like I'm an idiot until I finally realized what the goo coming from my dog's dick was and promptly did the heebie-jeebie dance.  Things between the dog and I haven't been the same since. 




Edit: Holy shit, front page!  Glad you guys could find joy in my disgusting discovery.  Also,  I've learned way more about dog dicks today than I ever cared to.
