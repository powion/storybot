Throwaway for this.  So I am a dispatcher for my town's police and fire departments and I worked an overtime shift last night from 1800-0600.  I usually work the swings so I was dead tired by 0530.  I was doing police dispatch and unusually, our department has the PD dispatchers pick up 911's as well as the calltakers (most dont).  For good reason.

At 0530, I was working a burglary in progress on the radio and without even thinking I picked up a 911.  I love answering the phones.  911 lines are my favorite.  Were, anyway.  

Long story short, I mistyped the address while trying to respond to my officers on the radio.  The call was for a 48 year old male, conscious and breathing but with chest pain.  4600 and 6400 on this street aren't too far from each other, but they are seperated by a river, so the fire crews had to go all the way south to the nearest bridge, head eat on the bridge then back north to the street and address.  

the delay was 14 minutes.  fourteen agonizing, awful minutes.  because after i called them back to get the correct address, they called back a minute later saying he was not conscious anymore.  And he died.  

Not sure how I feel right now, or if it even matters how I feel.  That guys family just lost him because of my human error.  my stupid fucking inattention to the most basic thing about my profession.  GET YOUR FUCKING ADDRESSES RIGHT.

So yeah, that's how I fucked up.  I am going to go get very, very drunk now.
