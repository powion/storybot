So i'm at the hospital, browsing reddit cause i'm bored, when an acidental nsfw picture pops up and a spark was lit. I tried to forget about it but that didn't really work. So then i just decided i would go. I stood up and walked to the bathroom at the end of the hallway FORGETING i am taped to a portable heart monitor that sends my pulse right to the nurses room. well i'm in the bathroom, COMING as a nurse starts banging on the door and kinda hystericly calling my name. I in the middle of my climax answers in a really weak voice "yea i'm here" then there are a couple seconds of quiet until she finally asks "mister
 turbobomb is that you?" And i respond . I walk out of the bathroom to meet a very annoyed nurse looking at me with a grin and tells me "i told you to keep your pulse down", and than walks away. And i leave standing there with a face red as a tomato in shame.
TL;DR: jerked off in a hospital bathroom and a nurse got angry.
