My sister-in-law is an absolute technophobe. She has always had some shit mobile phone but recently upgraded to an iPhone due to some pressure from her kids. She was having some problems with certain aspects of it, certain things draining her battery etc and asked me if I could have a look at it. So, me being the absolute evil genius that I am, entered a text shortcut so that when she typed the word 'Jay' (which is her husbands name) it would come up 'you're a fat bitch! Lol jk'. I know this is hardly an imaginative prank, and an infantile text, she would try and text her husband 'Hi Jay' and it would come up 'Hi you're a fat bitch! lol jk' which seemed like a pretty harmless joke that he wouldn't really be offended by. So I sit back to wait for the outcome.

Fast forward a couple of hours and I hear an ungodly hammering of my front door. I answer the door and she shoves past me, "WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO MY PHONE?!?!" I am completely taken aback by how angry she is and was like "Sorry Kelly, it was only a joke, was Jay pissed off?" to which she replied "I didn't fucking text Jay, my friend's mum had just died, I wrote to her on facebook to say 'So sorry for your loss, thinking of you, love Kelly and Jay'" What she had actually written was "So sorry for your loss, thinking of you, love Kelly and you're a fat bitch! lol jk"
