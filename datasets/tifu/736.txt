Due to some anoying genetics from my dads side I have quite a hairy ass, and lately its been getting on my nerves so I decided to take action. After having some less than plesent experiences with waxing and not wanting to put up with scratchy stubble between my cheeks I decided to burn it off. So with lighter in hand I went into my room and sat down infront of the mirror and looked for a spot to start. Not wanting to go too fast I began with a couple of spots on my cheeks, so far so good everything looks pretty smooth I'm feeling confident so I go for a patch on my taint, big mistake. The fire travled up my crack and set alight to a patch of hair under my balls and stayed there I jumped backwards and frantically tried to pat the fire out and managed to escape with only scotch marks to my balls. it's been 5 hours and my ass has only just stoped hurting but the smell of burnt hair is still strong in my room.
