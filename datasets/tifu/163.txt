So I moved from north dakota to virginia.

I have been applying to jobs for months.

I havnt got a single call. Well, I dont know if anyone actually DID call me, but this entire time I was using the phone number that ive always had in north dakota. It turns out when i reactivated my phone in virginia they gave me a new phone number. Ive been applying to every single job with the phone number i no longer have.
