So, my coworker recently showed me /r/unexpectedjihad and we currently have a running joke in the office with the microwave, which most people can hear from their offices.  Well I came in from lunch a little late and did not realize there was a meeting going on in the conference room.  I have the door to my office about 4/5ths shut and did not see who walked into the kitchen. I few mins go by and I hear the microwave finish "BEEP BEEP" and bellow a solid "ALLAU AKBAAAAR!".  I just hear a confused "What" from an unfamiliar voice.  It was a middle eastern guy that is our company's main contact for a large account that we manage.  I run out and try to explain that it is a thing on the internet and just a joke, but it one of those things were you are walking on thin ice around a dicey subject and you start digging yourself deeper into a hole

Edit: grammar 

Edit 2: Can gold be converted into a monetary value I might need it jk and thank you stranger :)
