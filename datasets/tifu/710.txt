I'm a graduate student in Oklahoma and I work in a greenhouse. One day while chasing a lizard around the bay where my experiment is kept, I stumbled across a black widow female. I trapped her in a water bottle, brought her home, and put her in a cage with crickets. She ate quite a few crickets and doubled in size while laying two egg sacs. I had smeared Vaseline around the top of the cage to prevent her from escaping, but the thought of having hundreds of baby black widow spiders in a tank just feet from my couch gave me the heebie jeebies.
today, I decided that I would remove the egg sacs from the tank. However one egg sac had already hatched, and there were hundreds of small brown spiders crawling on the web. I was unnerved by the sight of so many spiders, so I picked up the tank with the intention to move it outside. That lasted for about 2 seconds. The lid came off the tank as I held it away from my body and the tank crashed down against the sofa and carpet. Spiders, crickets, and web flew out on impact before I could even realize what had happened.
So, now I'm going to have to bug bomb the entire house, but not before having to spend one very uncomfortable/itchy/nerve wracking night in the bedroom, 12 feet from where I dropped hundreds of miniscule, nearly invisible black widows.
