Reddit, My whole life, I have been fluffing up, and here is why.

You may think the Shampoo before Conditioner rule is simple, no? Well, so do I now, but, until less than a day ago, this was not so clear too me. I'll start at the begging. My entire life I have been washing my hair the incorrect way. I have been putting conditioner in before my shampoo. Every morning I would get up and assume that everyone experiences their hair to be a texture like the dried up ground of mars, or to think that theirs was very similar to thousands of pieces of straw. But no, it wasn't until I was talking to my friend about how they wondering what would happen if they put conditioner in before shampoo, that I have been doing it all wrong.

This morning, I tried putting my conditioner and shampoo in the correct way round. After my shower, I put my hands through my hair, and it felt like a great goddess and had got a beautiful piece of silk from heaven and replaced it with my hair. It felt so glorious, I realised what I had been missing out on.

So yes Reddit, my whole life I have very much been fluffing up.
