So earlier tonight I ran out of my dorm to greet and pay the cab driver who was dropping my girlfriend off from the airport. The driver was this big Russian guy with a heavy accent, so it was pretty difficult to understand him at times. 

So after exchanging pleasantries, I asked him how much the cab fare was and he responded with something that I couldn't quite make out, but I saw "$24.00" on the little dashboard counter thing so I figured that's what he was telling me to pay. I pulled out two $20's and, in an effort to be nice and tip a little extra, told him, "Just give me $10 in change!" 

He looked at me incredulously and said "Really?" followed by something that was swallowed into the depths of his thick Russian accent. So my dumb ass, thinking I'd pleasantly surprised him and brightened his day a bit, just decided to give him a great, big smile and said "Yeah! Merry Christmas!"

He just handed me the change and drove off. I was feeling damn good about myself until my girlfriend was like, "Um, Farting_Potato, I think he was asking you why you weren't giving him any tip." Of course, still feeling like a good person, I told her proudly that I'd tipped him above the standard 15% and he seemed pretty happy about it. 

But nope. Turns out when I was looking at the price, he hadn't added in some final costs yet and the actual total of the taxi was a little above $29. 

He had actually been saying "Really? No tip?" 

And I had responded "Yep! Merry Christmas!" with a big shit-eating grin on my face. 

Whoops.

TL;DR: Tried to be a generous person, ended up being the biggest douche this cab driver's ever met in his life.
