It was 1999, the dot-com boom was booming, and I was 23 and eager to make an impression at my new software startup job.    

I had arrived at work on Monday morning to find a full-blown customer crisis that I worked straight through the night into Tuesday afternoon to solve.   Just as I was about to leave on Tuesday, *another* customer crisis erupted, and I settled in for the second-consecutive all-nighter, pleased to have the opportunity to show my dedication.   

So, here comes the f-up.   It is now Wednesday at noon, crisis #2 is finally solved, and I am near-drunk from 2 days of sleep deprivation.  I am also faint from hunger having not eaten since dinner the night before.   My needs are clear: Wendy's drive-through and get home to sleep.   I pull into the Wendy's lot and my heart sinks: huge lunchtime line.   Too groggy to come up with an alternative, I get in line and try futilely to stay awake.   Twice my micro-sleep is interrupted by the couple in the convertible behind me honking to move forward.  That's not the f-up, though, not yet...

Finally, my turn at the window.   The cashier tells me $9.78, which I know isn't right -- my usual grilled chicken combo #4 costs $5.45 -- but I'm too tired to argue.  I take the bag of food and two (2?  wtf!?) drinks she hands me and drive off.

I rip into the bag -- why are there two burgers in here?   Too tired to care, I eat and drive, focused on getting home safely and into my bed.   Blood sugar rising, my zombie-like haze lifts enough to realize what I have done.  I  forgot to order at the drive-through microphone -- I just drove right by.  That's right, I am eating not my own meal, but the meal ordered by the honking couple behind me.  I guess it's not technically stealing since I paid for it?

TL;DR: Drunk with sleep deprivation I skipped ordering and instead took some random couple's order at the drive-through.
