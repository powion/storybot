well not today-today but this is the first day I could write. 

So for Christmas I got my son a Swiss Army Knife along with a couple of other things. He wanted a butterfly knife but I had reservations... for a good reason. 

I gave him the standard "this is not a toy" lecture and made him watch The Simpsons where Bart gets a knife (The 10 Do's and 500 Don'ts of Knife Safety). Five minutes after lecturing him I'm attempting to put together my youngest son's TMNT Big Wheel when I come across some pieces held together by a zip tie. I grab that trusty Swiss Army Knife, and while again lecturing my son, I place the biggest blade to those plastic spawns of Satan. Not realizing how sharp the knife was I apply the teensiest amount of pressure and like a hot knife through butter, the blade cuts through the zip ties, plastic wrapping, my children's respect for me, and plunges into the hand holding those bastard parts. The only thing that stops the blade is the hard bone it dug into. 

I immediately apply pressure, my 3 yo is screaming at the sight of blood gushing onto his new toy, my wife is on the verge of fainting, and my daughter is wobbling on her new skates right next to that bloody blade. I shout at my oldest to "get the knife, get the knife". He's panicked, doesn't know what to do, picks it up and closes it on his pinky finger, efficiently slicing it. He's screaming, wife is done, daughter is oblivious, and youngest has successfully moved on to playing with his new Star Lord toy. 

TLDR: the only two Mexicans on the planet who don't know how to handle a knife.

Edit 2: because so many people are making the comment, the knife was for my 11 year old son. My 3 yo is whose gift I was attempting to assemble when I forever lost my children's respect and admiration. 

Edit 3: I made the front page. I love all of you.
