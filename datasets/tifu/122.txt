So last night I was bored as fuck and I decided to get my wife's waxing stuff and and try my luck at waxing my ass crack, because, let me tell you it's a fucking jungle down there. 
I've never waxed before and I didn't bother looking up how to do it because uh who tf needs directions.
I plugged the machine in and it took forever to heat up. When it was finally ready I took one of those sticks and just went to fucking town on my ass crack and my gooch.
I knew basically how this works so I opened the drawer to get a wax strip out... and there were none left.
I tried everything as a substitute I was freaking out I used:
a shirt (which now has ass hair on it)
an ace bandage
duct tape
after about 30 minutes the wax was dried and my ass was completely stuck together and I had made little to no progress so I had to do the unthinkable ..

rip all of the hair out by hand

for what felt like forever I sat in the shower ripping hair out of my ass crack with only my bare hands which also had wax all over them and were now completely covered with ass hair.

this has to be the worst experience of my entire life and I'm never trying to wax again kill me
