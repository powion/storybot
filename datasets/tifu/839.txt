This is my first post on reddit, so be nice..ok?Im a 15 year old guy btw.
This happened a week ago. I was down with a fever and had a huge headache, my mom decide to give me a whole lot of medicine to make me feel better. As my dad was coming back from the US, my mom wanted to go to the beauty parlor and get a haircut and some haircolor done.I wasn't in the mood to tag along with her, as I was still drowsy from the medicine, but she said she would buy me some chocolate if I went with her, and so I did.

This is where the FU starts. My mom went into the ladies section of the parlor, and I waited in the reception,browsing my phone,almost about to fall asleep. After around 30 minutes, the medicine effect starts wearing off and I start having a serious headache. I don't know why I thought going into the ladies section was a good idea,but in order to find my mom I did.

Now I don't remember this part accurately, but I think I saw a door at the end of the room, and my medicinally high mind decided that's where my mom was..I ran and burst through the door...and there was a lady there getting a bikini wax(Thankfully not my mom)..Having never seen something like that in real life, I drop my phone in shock,which cracked its screen. The lady screams and threw something at me that hit my head and somehow,because of how unstable I was, it knocked me out..I woke up too see my mom apologizing for what i had done.  

TL;DR: I went to the parlor,high on meds
           Had a migraine and ran into the wrong room
           Saw some pussy and got hit in the head
