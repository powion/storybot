Last night my wife and I went to dinner an a inexpensive sit down restaurant. It's been a very good year for us financially and once a month, we go out to eat and we will anonymously pay for a person's meal. We usually try to find an older person who eats alone because it's kind of sad and helps remind us of how lucky we are to have each other.

So, last night, we sit down and we notice three separate people eating alone. Right behind us is an angelic 80 something year old black lady. She is almost finished so we tell our server to pick up her ticket and add it to our bill and to not let her know it was us. She was very gracious and walked out with a huge smile on her face. The second person was an older gentleman with white hair and a walker. When he found out his meal was free, he told the server to tell us thank you and he left with a smile on his face. 

The last person was a man in his 70's. He was seated to our immediate right and when he asked the server for his ticket, she told him that it was paid for by another diner. This guy flipped his shit. He started screaming at the top of his lungs. "I DON'T NEED ANYONE TO PAY FOR MY MEAL! I CAN PAY FOR MY OWN MEAL!" He started waving his arms in the air and going berserk. The server tried to calm him down and told him that if it was that important, he could pay for his own meal. That seemed to calm him down and as he walk out of the room he turned back and shouted, "WHOEVER TRIED TO PAY FOR MY MEAL, FUCK YOU TO HELL!" And he walked out.

I have been doing this for years and I won't stop but I have to admit, that made my night.

***EDIT**** THANKS FOR THE GOLD! 

****EDIT #2**** I appreciate all of the positive comments. Not everyone is going to agree that paying for a stranger's meal who can obviously afford it is the "right thing to do". We also pay for service member's meals whenever we can. We also donate quite a bit to charities. As I posted in a response earlier, My mom is widowed and these people remind me of my mother. They also serve to remind me of how much I would miss my amazing wife if she were no longer with me. My children live 1800 miles and 2200 miles away. If my wife were to die, I would be the old man eating alone. While I ate, I would be reminded of my wife, I am sure. If someone were to pay for my meal, I would like to think that it would brighten my day. That's all there is to this. Nothing more. We just want to brighten someone's day. Yes, there are probably other ways that some of you think are more important but kindness does not have parameters.
