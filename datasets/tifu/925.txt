A few years back I'd hooked up with a girl at a party but didn't manage to seal the deal. A few weeks later she invites me up to her place to go on a 'proper date'. It's a little distance away, so it takes me a couple hours to drive up there. We go out to dinner and end up drinking a bottle of wine (or two). I can't drive home, I'm drunk. One thing leads to another and bam, first date sexy time.

Now next morning I had to be somewhere early; I had planned to be home the previous night so I was gonna be super late if I didn't haul ass. When I got up to leave it was still dark. I didn't want to wake her by turning on the light, so I grabbed my clothes, stuffed them into my bag and hit the road. 

Later that day I'm home and getting my clothes out the bag. And that's when I saw it, peeking out from behind my t-shirt. My dates dainty pink thong. I reflected on this a moment and realised how this might look. I got a girl drunk. I insisted I had to sleep at her house, as I was also drunk. Took advantage of said drunkenness, and slept with her. Got up in the dead of night to abandon her. And then stole her panties for good measure.

In the end I settled on a text... "Please don't think I'm weird, but I stole your panties by accident". This was 5 years ago. Next week is our wedding. Had to tell the story here cause I sure as shit can't put it in the speech!
