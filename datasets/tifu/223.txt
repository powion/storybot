Was waiting for my coffee and got shat on by a minor bird. Two girls walking past saw and started laughing. One said "getting shit on means good luck!" She didn't look too bad so quick thinking me goes "Okay, what's your number?" Turns out she thought that was even funnier and just laughed in my face....
So now I have bird shit in my hair and feel like shit.
