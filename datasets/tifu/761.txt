I've just arrived at work and am pretty sure I've been bright red for a good 2 hours. So this morning I jumped on the train, plugged in my headphones and prepared myself for the monotony of an hour long train ride. As my headphones are blasting whatever music Spotify threw my way, being a drummer, I'm tapping my phone like Michael J Fox playing candy crush.

About halfway through my train ride the carriage is pretty much full and an elderly woman comes and sits next to me, so I move over to give her room for her bags and get back to my music session. As I'm zoning out, still tapping away, I feel someone grab my shoulder. The train I catch goes through a pretty shitty part of Australia so naturally I jump up and prepare to put up a valiant fight as I get the living shit kicked out of me.

To my surprise the person grabbing my shoulder is a pretty attractive girl who I see on the train quite a bit. I sensed I'd startled the crap out of her so I pulled out my headphones to apologise. As soon as I start "I'm so..." she just sighs "Hey do you always look at porn on the train?".

As I'm trying to work out if she's insane or just crazy I look to my phone in horror. While I've been drumming on my phone I've managed to tap on the Reddit icon which has brought me back to where I had left off the night before; the deepest and darkest corners of /r/gonewild.

I turn bright red and sit back down in my chair knowing that I've got at least another 20 minutes of my train ride left. As I'm sitting there in silence, too afraid to put my headphones in, the elderly lady beside me squeezes the top of my hand and whispers "Don't worry love, it's perfectly natural". Kill me.

**EDIT:** So a lot of people seem to think that by "tapping on my phone" I mean slapping it like a bongo. I don't know if people have the delicacy of a rhino but using your fingertips to tap on a phone makes close to no noise and definitely can't be heard over the sound of the train.
