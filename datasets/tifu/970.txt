My nephew is 10 months old and teething, so his parents have these homemade smoothie/ice pop hybrids for him.

 They looked awesome, I was craving something sweet, and he chows down on them so his mom remakes them everyday. I thought taking one while babysitting wouldn't be a bad thing. They were REALLY good, like the best smoothie I'd ever had mated with the best strawberry ice pop and they had a baby. 

So I stole a second one. They remake them anyway!

My brother and his wife got home, saw me playing with the plastic top for one of them (They're refillable plastic molds) and asked if nephew had woken up.

I owned up to it, said no, I had a craving for strawberry and they looked good so I tried one, and since they were *really* good I took a second one. 
My sister-in-law snorted, smiled, and commented very sweetly that she was glad I liked it, she worked hard on them, as my brother turned red and looked like he was going to laugh.
 As he drove me home to our parents, he let me in on why she giggled  when she took the plastic tops from me.

Apparently she makes them by pureeing fresh fruit, straining it, and then mixing it with breast milk.

I can never look my sister-in-law in the eye again, but my brother agrees the teething pops are awesome.
