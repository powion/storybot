At the school I go to there are printers for the entire student body; however, every student has a limit of how many pages they can print. This limit is supposedly enormous. I have been told by seniors (I am a freshman) that the limit is around 1000 pages. 

During my English class yesterday, we got a chance to work on our essays, which were due today. I had already finished mine and was bored, so I held down CTRL and Enter in my Microsoft Word document because I wanted to see how many pages I could create. After about 9000 pages I got bored again and saved my work and closed Word. 

Today, I got to school and then realized that I hadn't printed out the essay yet, so I went to a school computer and sent it to the school printer, but it didn't print. I tried a few more times, but it still didn't work. Then I emailed it to my friend and he tried to print it. Guess what? It didn't print. 

My friend then noticed that the document had over 9000 pages that I totally forgot about. It was a sudden moment of realization that I had hit both mine and his print limit in a matter of minutes even though nothing had actually printed.

We went to a teacher and explained the situation (with emphasis on me being an idiot) and he said it would be $10 each to reset our limits. 

So on Monday I will be coming to school with $20 because today I fucked up.

TL;DR: Forgot doc had 9000 pages, used up my friend's school printing limit along with my own. Now down $20.
