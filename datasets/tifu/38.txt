This happened about 3 hours ago... Be me, 29 years old male, living in probably the most corrupted country in the world (Venezuela).  So just to give you some background, Venezuela is in a very difficult situation, political and economical,  the majority of us want to get rid of this corrupted government and we have elections in a fee days so tension is palpable in the streets, police and military are corrupted as fuck (you can buy weapons such as grenades or sub machine guns to them,  etc etc) basically hate is in the air. So, I was in a traffic jam, one of the many we have daily when the hunger hit me, I had a big bag of Doritos in my car so I decided to eat, I have a gastric bypass and can't eat that much, I was eating with my window open when a motorcycle with 2 military officers (low rank) stand beside me waiting for their turn to pass, I see the guy in the back literally drooling looking at the Doritos so "why not? I won't eat this much" I offer him the bag and he didn't hesitate to take it with a very big smile and thanking me.... 20 seconds later the shit storm!!!! The driver next to me gets out of his car screaming "you fu*king thieves! Let the guy alone he have done nothing to you"  (he thought I was being black mailed and I got asked for money inside the bag wich is one of many ways for them to get paid black mailing you),  I get out of the car to explain that it wasn't money but hell no,  the military officer that was driving told me in not a such a pleasant way to stay inside the car that he could handle it....  He gets down the bike and goes to the guy that was screaming baton in hand when all of a sudden no less than 20 people are surrounding him screaming "thief!!!! Oppressor!!! Go to hell"  and start punching him. Military #2 gets downy to help his friend and getting punched and screamed he managed to get military #1 in the bike and proceed to drive as fast as he could... Everyone get to their cars and guy #1 gets to me Doritos in hand "here's your money".....  Now I have back my Doritos in my car and sadness in my heart for how deep this society has fallen... 


But I have half a bag of Doritos to eat in the traffic jam tomorrow and I have that going for me wich is nice. 

TL;DR: 2 military officers got their ass kicked for a bag of Doritos I gift them. 

Edit: sry for my bad English.
