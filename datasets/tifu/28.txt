This didn't happen today, but over a couple weeks when I was going to boarding school 8 years back.

So I transferred in as a 10th grader from South Korea, into a 9th-12th boarding school in the US. 
Because it was a boarding school, I had a roommate, with whom I had only exchanged a couple emails before coming to the school.

The first day of school came, and I got to my room. The room had a bunk-bed, and having arrived first, I took the bottom bunk, and started unpacking.

Soon after, I heard a knock on the door. It was my roommate and his dad.
We exchanged greetings, and were busy unpacking, until it was time to go have lunch, meet new people, and do what high schoolers do on their first day of school.
The first day of school went by before I knew it, but I didn't really get to hang out with my roommate that much, as we were supposed mingle with everybody in our grade.
It was soon lights-out, so I climbed into my bottom bunk, and my roommate climbed up to his top bunk. We exchanged good-nights, and prepared for bed.

And then I started my daily 50 sit-ups.
*Huff-puff*, *Pant*, *Grunt*,
*Finish with an obligatory 'ahhh' from the burn*

I had been doing 50 sit-ups daily before going to bed for about a year then, and the first day of school was no reason to break my habit.
I was kind of afraid that I would wake my roommate, but he didn't say anything, and it sounded like he was asleep. So I thought nothing of it, and went to bed.

This goes on for a couple days, and one day my roommate carefully asks me without looking down from his bed, "Umm...are you alright, bro?"
To which I respond while heavily breathing, "Yeah!"-pant-"I'm fine. Just doing my daily routine, you know? - pant"
To this my roommate responds, "Uh...s..sure.."

I shrug it off, and go to bed.

About a week later, in the middle of my sit-ups, I hear a creaking sound on top of my bed, and from my bottom bunk, I can see my roommate's hands and the top of his head slowly starting to surface from the edge of his bed.
He starts to peek down at my bed, but with eyes so white, that you'd think that he heard somebody get brutally murdered.

I casually continue my sit-ups as usual, and ask, "What's", pant, "up?"

Suddenly, I see a wave of relief wash over his face. His expression rapidly changes from fear to realization, to relief, and then to laughter.

"OH MY GOD, YOU WERE DOING SIT-UPS. Oh, thank GOD!"
"What did you", grunt, "think I was doing?"
"I totally thought you were furiously jacking yourself off every single night before bed! I thought you would come up to my bed and rape me while I was asleep or something..I had been thinking that I was rooming with an Asian sexual deviant.."

And then it hit me. His previous comments. The dreadful silence every night.
My roommate acting strange around me.

For more than two weeks, my roommate had been thinking that my daily sit-ups had been daily me-time sessions, complete with my huffing and puffing, grunting, and ahhh's. For more than two weeks, my roommate had been laying awake on his top bunk, hearing me panting and grunting down on the lower bed, only imagining me getting myself off, not daring to look down for a fear of witnessing something unspeakable.

We had a great laugh, and we still talk about it every once in a while.

**tl;dr** - Went to boarding school, had a roommate with whom I shared a bunk-bed. I slept on the lower bed, he on the top bed. Every night, I did sit-ups before going to bed. For 2 weeks, my roommate thought that I had been furiously getting myself off.

**edit**: What, front-page? I will be enjoying my short-lived reddit fame. To answer some frequently asked questions:

* Yes, I know sit-ups aren't very effective, especially when done on a soft surface. I didn't know anything about fitness back then, and had mistakenly thought, 'Abs? Must do sit-ups, since I am moving my stomach!' I also progressively worked my way up to 50, from 10 a night. I also don't do any sit-ups now, in bed or on the floor.

* The bunk-beds at our school had enough space for sit-ups on the lower bed, but just barely.
