My bathroom intermittently becomes infested with ants (I live in Australia, if that clarifies anything). They eventually leave when the weather outside improves or, perhaps, when they realise that you can't eat bath products.
I'm a shower person, but today I decided to have a bath. I began filling it but became impatient and hopped in when it was only half full. It is then that I remember that my bath has dodgy spa jets and I decide to try them out. I fail to notice that the jets are positioned above the waterline of my bath. Within three seconds my bathroom is covered in dismembered ants.
The last ant invasion had apparently all died in the spa jet pipes. They were chopped and churned by the jets/pump and were then liberally covering my bathroom and me.

Edit:
-Compulsory: Wow, this blew up over (two Australian) night(s)

-Sorry, no pics (It wasn't exactly on my mind...)

-Btw I am female (I guess the unspoken rule of reddit* still holds true)

*Assume all commenting parties are male unless there is specific evidence to the contrary (oops, I guess it is no longer unspoken)

-No, I didn't scream; I just froze and whimpered for a few minutes.

-Thanks for all of your advice on liquidating the poor beasts. We have, in the past, made use of all of these methods and I can vouch for their efficacy. Since, however, the animals often insist on dying on our property, which results in an unsavoury cleanup, it is often easier to let them go about their business until they choose to leave of their own accord.

Besides, as /u/g2420hd mentioned:

&gt; The ants most likely stored the dead bodies in the jets, opposed to mysteriously dying there.

I probably just exhumed their burial site and I wouldn't like to further offend them through mass murder.
