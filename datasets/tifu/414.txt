My wife and I have been trying for a second baby for about 3 months now and still have not gotten pregnant. During this time she started baking cupcakes and cake truffles from our home to sell. I created her a website and got some facebook voucher codes for $50 advertising. I tried using the code on mine but I realised it was only for new advertisers only (I had already promoted my fb page so I wasn't eligible). 

How I fucked up: I texted her this morning to tell her I'm gonna log in with her account because it needs a new advertiser in order for the coupon to work. I start creating an ad and in the background I see her IMing her best friend. She asks my wife if the test came out good or bad. I continue creating the ad and try not to read anything but I read her saying it came out positive. 

At this point I call her and tell her I read it. Apparently she had been planning on a cute way to tell me since we started trying. She had her sister order a shirt so it wouldn't show up in our account since I keep up with that daily. The shirt says "Big Brother". She was going to have it delivered to our neighbors so that I didn't accidentally get the package. The shirt was supposed to be delivered today and she was going to have my son wear it when I got home.

I have never logged in to her account before and the one time I do, it fucks up a big surprise. 

Edit: Well damn I didn't expect to blow up so much. Also thanks for the gold.

Edit 2: thanks for all the kind words. I knew reddit had a soft side.

Edit 3: I can see the traffic on my wifes cupcakes website you sneaky redditors. 

Edit 4: [Thank you guys for the website traffic, I can finally retire!](http://i.imgur.com/coq7B8g.png)

Edit 5 (last edit): A lot of redditors have asked for my wifes website but I really didn't want this to be PR for it. It's really pointless unless you're in the Dallas TX area. If you really want it you can send me a PM.
