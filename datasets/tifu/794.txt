This happened a few years back. Just a typical day in my sophomore year of high school. My first class of the day, Spanish 2, is just getting started. We start going over our new subject material which happens to be asking people their favorite things. Our teacher has us counting off numbers to put us in our groups. Me and the blind girl are the only group of two, which I didn't mind because she was probably the smartest of the class! Anyways, our teacher drew a random card only that the student could see. Mine read "¿Cuál es tu color favorito?" Which of course translates to "What is your favorite color?" As soon as I read the card to her, silence. As I slowly looked up at me teacher, The whole class slowly turned and stared at me. Of course the blind girl did not have an answer and started crying. I sincerely apologized and went home for the rest of the day. Our teacher never let us be partners again after that day. 

Tl;dr: Spanish teacher set me up.
