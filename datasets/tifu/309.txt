This was a while back when my daughter was a toddler.  My husband and I didn't want her sipping on his beer so we called that Daddy's Juice.  "No, you can't drink that it's Daddy's juice"  One day I went to pick up my daughter from daycare and her teacher saw me and started giggling.  It was around Mother's Day and she had the kids do a little project where they answered some questions about their Mommy.  How tall is Mommy?  What is Mommy's favorite color?  Including "What is Mommy's favorite drink?" The answer being... Daddy's Juice.  Well, that was a bit embarrassing to say the least. I explained to her what it was and we had a good laugh.
