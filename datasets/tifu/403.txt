This actually happened 3-4 years ago when I was in my second year of university. I met an exceedingly handsome man (lets call him Lars) and spent all year trying to move from "just friends" to more than "just friends" We had quite a lot in common and I thought this guy would be a great boyfriend and I therefore spent most of that year hanging out with him instead of doing my work. I even failed a class because trying to get with him was more important (in my foolish 20 year old mind). So, one night we were hanging out after watching a hockey game and I trying to be cutesy (which I suck at) pass him a note saying I &lt;3 you more than my favourite hockey team (I can't put the team's name because I might give myself away). So Lars takes my note, blushes, and asks if we can go to my dorm room hang out more; I think he is going to confess his feelings for me, so we head up to my room (while I'm grinning like a demented fish). We get to my room, and he tells me that he's gay. 
TL;DR I tried to date a gay guy, ended up failing a course and had to pull 3 all nighters to finish all of my other work.
