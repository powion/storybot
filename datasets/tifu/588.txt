When I take a dump I always have some toilet paper in my hand folded up, or sitting on my leg, or the ledge of the bathtub.   

My wife always walks in on me when I'm in there, and over the years I've developed this strange joke thing where I'll stuff the toilet paper into my mouth when she walks in. I don't know why I do it, but she laughed at it years ago so I've just kept it up. The toilet paper is always clean when I do that.  

She never walks in when I'm wiping, and if she does, I would hear here coming and not wipe while she's there, I could never bring myself to wipe in front of her for some reason. 

Well, tonight I was wiping, and of course I looked at what I wiped, and the door swung open. I didn't miss a beat, I stuffed the shit covered toilet paper right into my mouth. This wasn't a 3rd-5th wipe buildup, this was number 1, the very first wipe, the one with the most shit per square inch. This wasn't a normally formed shit either, it was runny, chunky, loose, and for fucks sake it smelled horrid. 

As soon as it touched my tongue, I gagged, I gagged worse then I've ever gagged before. Then I puked. 

All the while my wife is just standing there laughing hysterically, practically peeing her pants. Thankfully the kids were down in the basement, I didn't want them hearing or seeing what just happened. 

I calmed down, she calmed down, she left the washroom. I got up and rinsed my mouth out several times, brushed my teeth, and used several mouthfuls of scope, all the while my ass is covered in shit and there's puke on the floor. I threw the toothbrush away, finished wiping then I cleaned up the puke. 

Never again.
