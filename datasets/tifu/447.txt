Obligatory this happened last year. My brothers and I decided to get a tattoo in memory of our late grandfather. He was a great man and an even better businessman. His most memorable venture was his bow tie company, so we all picked one bowtie out of his private collection to get done. I had work the morning of the tattooing, so both of my brothers went first. (This is where I fucked up) work was busy that day and I hadn't gotten to eat anything. In order to calm my jitters I thought it would be a good idea to smoke a little joint on the way over. Everything started alright until I felt a little woossy, the tattoo artist went to fetch me some candy and when he returned I had passed out and fallen on the floor face first. Well that wasn't the worst of it. After recuperating, I walked outside for some fresh air and noticed that there was something extra in my pants, yup you guest it I shit my pants after I passed out. Frantically rush to the bathroom and rip my underwear off throw them away and used up everything they had to clean myself.... it took me a hole year to come back and finish the tattoo and I even included a little number 2 to show that it took twice to get my first ever tattoo

TL;DR, don't smoke weed before getting a tattoo for the first time. Also make sure you eat something or you will pass out and shit your pants.
