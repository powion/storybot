My gf was in the car, we were just going for a ride, grab to eat, stop by the bay, take a walk and simply hangout.

On the way, she was responsible to play music from my cellphone. However, she was checking out my photo library since I do photography as a hobby nor like I had anything to hide.  There are things I dnload which I find pretty funny, sick or whatever. I forgot all about them.

She being a catholic and my religion is somewhere flying in the wind, she finds this [image](https://i.imgur.com/IVM9inG.jpg)

Now I am single.

Edit1: Holy donkey balls, this blew up. Did this actually make it to front page? Wow! I wasn't expecting. Just to be clear, I did save the picture some time ago due to all the events that has transpired in France. I thought it was just funny or rather I may have a sick sense of humor.  I wasn't expecting anything that has transpired in my personal life. 

Edit2: I apologize as I have not responded to anyone. I tried to work things over with her and I could  say I was pretty insensitive. I also apologize to anyone I may have offended with this post. That was never my intention.  Personally, I find this world a bit funny and weird, we often take things too seriously knowing that there are greater things we should be concerned with. Again, I apologize to anyone I may have offended.
