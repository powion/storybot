So today, I decided to go to the casino and have a try at the casinos interlinked accumulative pokie (slot) machine which has been progressively accumulating money during the past twelve months without it mega jackpotting. It wasn't until November of last year when the mega jackpot maxed out at AUD$1M that everyone began flogging the machines for their chance to win it.

Tonight, like most other weeks on my night off, I tried my hand at the machine and spent a good portion of my nights capital on it in the hopes of winning something. Having made a small win of $250 and feeling kind of chuffed with myself, I got up and stretched and looked out through the second story floor window at the gaming floor below.

After a few minutes had passed a young gentleman took a seat at the machine I had just been using. He slipped some money in and started playing. A few minutes passed and I hear a loud gasp. I look over at him and he's staring at me, "I think I got it!" .. "got what?" I exclaimed.. "I've just won the million dollars!". It was at that moment I was overcome with an emotion which I had never experienced before as I went through the motions of what had just occurred moments before..

Not knowing what else to do and seeing as nobody else had seen yet what had just transpired, I took this photo. Needless to say, I am sincerely happy for this young man and I just hope he uses it wisely.

TL;DR: Was playing pokie machine, got off the machine, someone else sat down and won $1M.

**EDIT**: *Woah, I certainly wasn't expecting so much of a response. If I had the ability to change the title, I would, because as many have been quick to point out, you can't lose something you didn't have to begin with.*
