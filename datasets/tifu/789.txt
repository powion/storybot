This happened a couple months ago, but whatever.

I sat down at a computer in the student center at my school.  There's maybe a dozen other computers situated in the vicinity as well as a couple couches and ping pong tables for people to goof around on.  As I started doing homework, I figured I'd put on my headphones and play some music.  I had been telling a friend earlier about a song another friend and I had made in high school that literally just repeats "b-b-b-buttsex" and "do the nasty" a bunch of times.  I load it up to listen again for a quick laugh and turn up the volume.  As I was listening, I noticed the song sounded kind of muffled, so I turned it up a little more.  It's almost 30 seconds into the song, and I realize what's wrong just as a crucial point of the song came.  As the drop approaches, I scrambled for the mouse to hit the pause button, but it was too late.  The speakers shouted, loud enough for everybody around to hear: "SEX! IN THE BUTT!"
