Haven't been laid in a while, so I thought I'd facebook message all the girls I thought I might have a chance of getting with were I to put the effort in.

So I write a nice friendly message and send it to about ten or so different girls.

hey, how's it going! :D
Haven't seen you in a while...how come? 

Both sentences are two separate messages, gives the impression that I haven't thought it through and its just a friendly, harmless message. Usually works, they won't think I'm trying anything on, right?

Wrong...as soon as I send it a single messenger thing pops up at the bottom of the screen with a group message containing all ten girls. I ACCIDENTLY CREATED A GROUP MESSAGE containing all ten girls and sent my message to the group.

The positive thing is I got replies from all of them...

the negative is all of them were along the lines of "err..wtf" and "you do know we can ALL see this right?"

Probably deserve the creep status I now have.

**edit:**

I just left the conversation about thirty messages in. The last few messages looked something like this:

"freeeeak haha"

"Really, graciejiujitsu?"

"pahahahahaha, I know right? As if he even has a chance..lmao" 

"Graciejujitsu has left the conversation." 

They're probably still going.

**edit**

Messaged them all privately:

"Not really too much I can say about that one, obviously that was pretty f*cking sleazy of me, so sorry I guess....lol"  

4 replied, 2 of whom had already messaged me being super cool about it and basically just being like mate that's so funny seriously what the f*ck were you thinking, the other 2 just being like yeah ok no worries shit happens. Of those 4 who replied only one of them is on my course. :/

No response from the other 5 who are all on my course...,  2 of whom were super bitchy in the group message, (although one of those two I did kind of sleep with then not really talk to afterwards in fresher's year so maybe she has the right to be). 

Now that its been a while and some have replied being cool about it, and I've at least got front page status for my FU, I'm just sitting here chuckling and really dreading tomorrow morning. It could be worse I guess.

Lol.
