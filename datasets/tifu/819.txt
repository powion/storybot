This FU happened yesterday night.

So my sister who lives nearby had to go out shopping for a bit and decided to leave her 5 year old daughter with me. I have exams coming up so it's not the best time to babysit, but being the good brother I am, I agree. 

The night is uneventful and it's getting way past her bedtime so I take her upstairs to my room to sleep. A few minutes later, she comes down and tells me "Sing me a song so I can go to sleep". I am really swamped with my studies and being the lazy ass I am, I tell her "I'm really busy right now, but you can just go on my computer, it's right by the bed, and search 'Go to sleep' on Youtube and you'll find a bunch of songs." [Yes, she knows how to use a computer (kids these days)].

Anyways, a few minutes later, my sister returns. She comes in and I tell her, proud as ever, that I put her to sleep by playing a lullaby on Youtube. So we walk upstairs, and as we near my bedroom we can start hearing a song.. it sounds nothing like a lullaby. Walk in and all we hear is "... AND GO TO SLEEP BITCH! DIE MOTHERFUCKER DIE, BYE BYE, MOTHERFUCKER, BYE BYE! GO TO SLEEP BITCH! WHY ARE YOU STILL ALIVE?! WHY?! DIE MOTHERFUCKER!"

I don't even know why I said to type "go to sleep" and not "lullaby" or some shit. I'm retarded. Pretty sure I'm not babysitting her again.
