I got home from work this evening and was getting ready to go to the gym. A few moments before heading out the door I was opening some snapchats I had received earlier in the day, and just as I was about to exit the application I received one from my cousin (female) who never snapchats me (male), we missed each other in college by about a year so I was kind of excited to hear from her and see what kind of shenanigans she was getting into to these days. 

So at the exact same time that I receive a barrage of texts from her I open up the snapchat to receive full frontal nudity of my dearest cousin. Of course the texts were 
"Do not open that snapchat from me"
"Do not"
"I swear to God do not" 

I swear these have to be the three fastest consecutive texts in the history of human motion. 

So there's that in my life now. 

Cousin if you see this since I know you reddit, sorry for sharing but at least its fauxnonymous


[Edit] 
1. Washington state, no Alabama involved
2. No reddit, I did not screenshot it lol
3. There will be no wincest in this guy's future
4. She's not really my type anyway
5. I made it to the gym, and it actually was leg day :D
