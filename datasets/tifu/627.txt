Now to what happened on Thanksgiving. 

So my gf's sister showed up Wednesday afternoon and everything was going perfectly fine throughout the day. I left around 4 ish to grab some beer and wine before Thanksgiving. When I came home I could hear yelling from the front door and when I walked in it only intensified. My gf and her sister were in full fledged fuck you mode. Once I walked through the door, they both stopped yelling, and the sister went upstairs. I asked what it was about and it was about the sexting incident again. I got them both together and asked them to just play it off until Thanksgiving was over and we could talk the day after.

Thanksgiving happens, there was a lot of tension in the air but my gf and her sister played it off pretty well, nothing too suspicious. Her parents don't expect anything and they left all good.

Literally 5 minutes after they left, the house exploded. My girlfriend was yelling at her sister for "Eyeing" me all evening. I genuinely didn't notice, but I am somewhat flattered. I told them to calm down and they both told me to fuck off basically and I ended up sleeping on the coach last night.

Now here I am about 20 hours after being banished to the coach. My girlfriends sister left in the morning didn't say good bye just left a note saying she wouldn't be talking to us anymore and to enjoy Christmas without her. My gf proceeded to break down into tears and blame me for all this. We talked about an hour ago and it's better now between us. But I'm pretty sure I broke two sisters apart.

**Td;dr: Make sure you read the name of the person you're sexting before you do it redditors. Otherwise, you'll find yourself feeling guilty and pretty bummed**
