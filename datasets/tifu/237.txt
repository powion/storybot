This technically didn't happen today, but I still felt like sharing it.

I recently accepted a job to act as a substitute teacher at my local high school. I was relatively new to teaching so it was a pretty nerve-wrecking experience for me. I entered the classroom and immediately introduced myself. I realized that I was stuttering so I just began lecturing math. At this point, I haven't spent anytime time trying to get to learn the faces and names of the kids. 15-25 minutes into the lecture, I was getting a little bit more comfortable and started observing the class. I noticed a kid sleeping at the back of the classroom and said "Hey, can you please stop sleeping in class?" The kid didn't respond at all. So I walked over to the kid and as I was walking, I realized that the kid wasn't really sleeping. He was Asian and had really REALLY small eyes. He then realized that I was talking about him and said "Who me?" The whole class bursted out laughing. He'll probably be made fun of the rest of the school year.

TL;DR: Called out an Asian student for sleeping in class, turns out he just had really small eyes. He'll probably be made fun of the rest of the school year.

EDIT: Wow, didn't think this would explode. I felt really bad about what happened. Regrettably, I never really had the chance to correct it. I learned my lesson...I guess I'll donate to charity.
