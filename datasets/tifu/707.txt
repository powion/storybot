For once in my life, I am actually successfully talking to a girl. Things are going alright, and she sends me some pics so I attempt to return the favor. I take some dick pics with my new iPhone 6. It's important to note, I'm taking and sending the dick pics while I'm pretending to shower. I watch youtube videos on my apple TV while I'm working out so my phone was still set to airplay. 

My sister and mother are watching some shitty show on Netflix while I am "showering". If you've ever used an Apple TV you know that if someone from an iPhone sends their signal to the TV it will overrule whatever's currently happening. So their Netflix Show must have been replaced by my dick pic once I opened it in the photos app to determine if it was worthy. While I am touching up my dick pic picture I hear screaming coming from downstairs. I frantically remember "oh fuck my airplay is on". That was a bad feeling. They run upstairs and yell what am I doing, I pretend I can't hear even though my shower is certainly not overpoweringly loud. We haven't spoken yet.  


Tonight has been awkward.
