Around 4 months ago I put in for PTO time so I could take my wife and son on vacation. After making all my arrangements my boss came up and asked if I could reschedule my vacation because there was a very important meeting the week I scheduled my vacation. I told him I couldn't really reschedule anything and finally we settled with me being on a webcam/conference call type deal for the meeting. 

I agreed and went on vacation, well come time for the meeting I set up my laptop in the hotel room. The meeting was fairly early in the morning so I woke up and I dropped my wife off at some tourist trap she wanted to see. The place she was going wasn't for kids so my son stayed and slept. I came back to the hotel and the meeting started. The meeting went well for the most part.

1 hour into the meeting my wife called and needed picked up. I told my boss I had to go get my wife id be back in 20 minutes. So I left to go get my wife, I left my son in the hotel and told him id be back in 20 minutes. I screen locked the laptop, I didn't know they could still see and hear everything with the laptop locked but they could. Long story short after I left my 13 year old son decided it would be a good time to jerk off, so he did. In front of my boss and about 20+ other employees on the conference call. They seemed to be OK about the whole situation and I wasn't fired. Still however the most embarrassing thing ever.

TL;DR My kid masturbated in front of my bosses and some other employees.                  Update: few questions I'll answer. My wife cannot drive because she has epilepsy,  she used to drive but stopped after she started having frequent seizures. Also they did end the call after somebody pointed it out, from what my friend told me he noticed about 6 minutes after I left when some lady pointed it out and after that it was cut within a minute.
