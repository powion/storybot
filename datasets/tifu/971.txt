Today I fucked up cringeworthy...

My daily commute involves riding the subway. This is the time I'm getting my daily dose of reddit.


After I arrived home from work, I made myself some awesome tarte flamb√©e, which has chopped onions on top. So I sat at the kitchen table and ate it, when I noticed a small strip of onion on my chair, so I put it in my mouth and started chewing.

Then I realized that the texture does not fit onion and spat it out and saw a horrible yellowish strip of large toenail, which seems to have stuck on my trousers from the subway chair and hitched with myself home and fell on the kitchen chair.


I will never forget this feeling :/


EDIT: Formatting 

EDIT2: no I didn't eat it from the subway chair, I took it from my kitchen chair :S

EDIT3: English is not my first language, so I changed some things to clear things up... Sorry!
