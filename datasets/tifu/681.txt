TIFU when I awoke to my new puppy barking like a maniac at the bottom of the staircase and ran down to stop her howling.

Here's the little one in question: http://imgur.com/48OJvTU

Of course she was already in a fierce rage by the time I got to her, and she wouldn't let up- and I had no idea what the barking was about besides that she hates being down there alone and my gf had just left for work. 

As I tried to calm her she went for any sort of bite she could, which led to me trying to throw up a flat palm and push her nose away whenever she attacked.

**Bad idea:** she got the perfect nip on my right index finger- to which I yelped an actual "OW!!!!!" Although the full yelp didn't come out...

Nope, instead in the middle of my pain the spot she bit me was so perfectly placed that I receieved a full on nerve/muscle spasm of some sort. It was no ordinary spasm though, as I suddenly and uncontrollably found my opposite hand and arm deciding that it would jolt upward and punch myself in the teeth and nose.

With my right index finger bleeding, my left thumb gashed by my own incisor and my nose now dripping blood and feeling numb from a solid self-punch to the face. I lay down in fetal position wondering what had even just happened.

Then she barked one last time and nipped my earlobe- which began to bleed and drain warm blood into my ear canal. That's when she ran to the hanging leash and finally decided to tell me it was just that she had to go pee really bad the whole time.


**TL;DR**
Tried to stop my new pup from barking- ended up punching myself in the face and bleeding from 4 separate spots (finger, thumb, nose, ear).

**Edit:** glad we can all share in my blood. I feel like Christ (that's a highly inappropriate joke, feel free to down vote over it :P) For the record though - she's such a good dog. 10 weeks and is so so smart and obedient. She only barks or nips when she wants to potty or needs serious 1 on 1 play time. Most the time she's cuddled up under my feet or being a dork elsewhere.

*Update*: a few naysayers demanded wound pics - http://imgur.com/a/3Gnf3 as I told them, these are just puppy wounds in the end. It was a strange experience, but certainly not near death. Pic 1 is of the cut in my lobe from what I could get, Pic 2 is the index finger she initially sliced, and Pic 3 is the gash on my thumb from my tooth. The nosebleed was from blunt force, not a cut, so no evidence really. All of them sealed up a nice bit over the day after proper care.



Also, the responses have been generally great- let me just say though- no puppy has ever had zero accidents and although I'd like to react to every situation by the puppybook or how /r/puppy101 would suggest, life is random and there are other people and factors involved. She's already signed up for training and honestly only needs it to prefect her obedience, not to become obedient. That said- I appreciate the feedback, both positive and negative!
