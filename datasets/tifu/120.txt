A kid on the bus makes a funny face at me so I make a funny face back. We're stuck in traffic so we get into a little contest and exchange funny faces for the next while. 
The kid is an amateur, he just keeps pulling the same face. I've got an arsenal full of funny faces so naturally I crush him and win the battle. I scan the rest of the bus in search of a more worthy opponent however I meet eyes with an elderly lady. 
Her facial expression looks like she has just found out there's been a death in the family and I'm the one responsible. I can see the raging storm of anger welling up inside of her. Her beady eyes are so focused on mine, I swear I can feel my pupils searing under the intensity of her glare so I break eye contact and look back at my buddy. 
To my horror, only then do I realise that the child was never making a funny face at me. He is disabled.
