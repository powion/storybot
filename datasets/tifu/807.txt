This one is from back in my kindergarten days...

So there I was, one of the few white kindergarteners in my south side Chicago elementary school. One day, I'm hanging out on the playground when this little black boy runs up to me and asks, "will you marry me?" I panicked and kicked him in the shin and ran away. 

Shortly after, I'm sent to the principal (who is also black). She asks me why I kicked the boy, and I began to panic. I was only in America for a short time, and my English was very poor. I quickly thought back to when I didn't want to deal with peanuts, because I did not like them, and I would say I was allergic to them and bam! No more peanuts to be dealt with. Using this logic, I didn't want to deal with this situation, so not knowing what allergic means, I told my black principal that I was allergic to black people. Shocked, she called my mother, who had even poorer English, and my mom confirmed, that yes, indeed I was allergic to black people. After all, what in the world could allergic mean?

Tl;dr: terrible English led to unintentional racism. 

Edit: I see some people are linking me not liking peanuts with not liking black people. The way I wrote this, I can see how that indeed comes off as intentional racism. I meant I didn't like eating peanuts, and I didn't like being in this situation. The way the principal spoke with me made me feel like I was in trouble because she felt that I kicked the kid because he was black, and therefore I said "I'm allergic to black people." Most of my friends were black (since it was a predominantly black community), and I continue to have black friends that I love dearly (though I get people can have black friends and still be racist). I honestly did not mean to offend anyone with this, and I'm sorry for those that I did.
