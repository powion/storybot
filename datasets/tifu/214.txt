I live in Kyrgyzstan. Here, two languages (Kyrgyz and Russian) are spoken simultaneously by locals and often mixed together. The word for 'ice rink' in Russian is "KAtok" while the word in Kyrgyz for 'penis' is "KOtok". Today was my day off and I wanted to go ice skating. When trying to find out details about the local skating rink, I forgot the Kyrgyz word for ice rink and tried to use the Russian one instead and I asked an old women in a store: "Men bir saatka tsenterdagy chon kotokko kirip konki tepsem, kanchadan bolot?" which translates to: "How much will it be to go on the big penis downtown for an hour?".

I am no longer allowed in the store.
