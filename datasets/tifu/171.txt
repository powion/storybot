So, I play CSGO. And I want a knife-skin, as do many others. Unlike many others, I can afford to waste money on it. Well, a few days ago (I know I know, Today I fucked up, not a few days ago I fucked up, get outta here OP!) I was over at a friends house, and we were goofing around in steam. At some point I noticed that a particular knife skin (the M9 Bayonett | Damascus Steel) had one offer on the community market, which was considerably cheaper than the other offers (like 30-40â‚¬ cheaper than the average price I think). Obviously I jumped on the opportunity, or rather I asked my friend to jump on the opportunity for me, because he was logged in at that time, and I feared that switching accs would mean someone else buying the skin before me.

So, he bought the skin for me, his account got charged, I gave him back the money by sending him a paypal transaction. End of story right?

Wrong.

The thing I fucked up was to write "damascus" as the transaction comment, and nothing else.

Well, that little innocent keyword triggered the terrorism filterlists of paypal, froze the transaction for manual review, and after the manual review failed as well, they froze my entire paypal account.

Now I have 14 days to give paypal a written explanation on why I used the word "damascus" in my transaction, or lose my paypal account with all the money that's still on it.

TL;DR: Wanted to be a cooler CT, ended up on the T side.

Edit: I'm from Germany, not the US, which with the current political climate might explain why they take closer looks at transactions that mention syrian cities. Who knows.

Edit 3: I'm happy to announce that all limitations on my account have been lifted and that the transaction has reached its destination. Surprised that they managed to sort that out in under 24 hours, but I guess transactions like these might be prioritized for review.
