I was sitting in my room talking with friends online when someone linked a photo that was one of the Ishihara colorblind tests. I could not see what was on it, and my friends were laughing hysterically at the joke that I couldn't see. They refused to tell me so I called my mother into the room to tell me what is was. Mind you, it was a fullscreen 1920x1080 photo that filled my entire monitor.


She promptly yelled "WHY IS THERE A GIANT DICK ON YOUR SCREEN?" and I was greeted by even more laughter from my friends and then my own mother laughed at me and walked out saying "*You dumbass*".

EDIT: TIFU WITHIN A TIFU: Looked for the photo. Realizing five minutes later... I can never find it because I am in fact colorblind....

EDIT 2: being colorblind is hard. 

EDIT 2 1/2: [THIS IS AN EXAMPLE](http://ih1.redbubble.net/image.40656886.4246/flat,800x800,075,f.u1.jpg) I CAN SORTA MAKE OUT THE BALLSACK THAT'S IT.

EDIT 3: YES I THOUGHT PEANUT BUTTER WAS GREEN FOR 18 YEARS.

EDIT 4: Apparently I am loved [Elsewhere](https://np.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/3xfpj1/colorblind_redditor_cant_see_image_in_colorblind/). Also, no I am not trolling people by attempting to make you see a dick, as great as that might be.

EDIT 5: Gilded! Wow thank you so much! This all has literally made my day!

Edit 6: Post was removed and shortly reinstated! My bad for not reading the rules on donation campaigns, it's ok guys, I can live colorblind, it's a good conversational piece!
