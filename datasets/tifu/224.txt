Throwaway because my boyfriend is a redditor.    
The other night my boyfriend told me he wanted to try anal. I'm all for trying things for my man, but my butt has pretty much been a poop-only chute. It got me thinking about my butthole, and what it looks like (I know, that's weird). Freshly out of the shower, I laid down on my bed, spread my legs, and started looking around down there to see what it looks like for him. While I was doing this, I had to fart. My curiosity already piqued, I decided to watch myself fart. This wouldn't have been a problem, except last night I took a laxative to help persuade out 4 days of poop. I thought I'd gotten it all out of my system, but the geyser of molten shit that sprayed out of me indicated I was mistaken. For a stunned moment, I sat there with diarrhea all over my hand, my hand mirror, and my bed. The worst part is that my bed is completely bare right now because it is laundry day. Cheers.    
**TL;DR:** I pooped my bed while I was awake.
