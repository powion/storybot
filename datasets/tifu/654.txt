This happened a few years ago, but I still haven't really forgiven myself.

I'm an identical twin. My brother and I look very alike and all my life we've both struggled with people always mixing us up.

At a party one night, I got drunk. Very drunk. Late in the night, someone found me a comfortable spot on the floor and let me pass out. 

The next morning, I woke up, feeling quite disorientated. I saw my brother lying next to me. He was also awake.

"Hey! Where are we?" I said.

I quickly realised I was talking to my reflection and I'd passed out next to a mirror.
