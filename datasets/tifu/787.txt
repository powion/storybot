This literally just happened 1 hour ago.

So I'm just sitting in the classroom, working on some stuff when my art teacher comes to my friend and asks him if she can use his scissors. He doesn't mind and hands her the scissors. She starts cutting something, and in the corny mood that I am I say "Nice scissoring, miss".
Just as I realised what I said she looks me in the eye with a cold look on her face. I immediately say that I'm sorry after which she walks away and doesn't speak to me again for the whole lesson.

Did I mention she's lesbian?
