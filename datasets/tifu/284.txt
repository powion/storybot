This actually happened less than 5 minutes ago.

My daughter was born last week, 10 weeks early. My wife and I have settled into a routine of visiting the NICU every morning. Because I already work remotely, I just use the wifi at the hospital.

Between lack of sleep and too much reddit, I'm starting to get a little foggy brained.

While my wife was reading some children's book to our daughter, I hear her say "You like that?"

Without thinking, I finish the sentence with "You fucking retard?"

Even the nurse in the room felt the look of death.
