This happened last week. 

I'm starting a new job soon, so I had to do a pre-employment physical, which includes a drug test. In case you didn't know, these drug tests are urine-based. I don't do drugs, and never have, so I wasn't worried about it. 

What I didn't know is that apparently this medical office also tests for glucose in the urine since the test strips are really cheap or something. Well, mine came up positive. The nurse said there was "only a little bit" of urine, but that it was definitely above the threshold for a positive test. Urine contains glucose when your blood glucose is elevated, which is most commonly caused by diabetes.

Well lo and behold this poor nurse spent the next half hour trying to figure out what was going on, given that I have no diabetic history and my blood sugar level (a much more reliable indicator of diabetes) was normal. Eventually she decided to just pass me for the pre-employment physical and make me see another doctor to treat my possible pre-diabetes. This entire time, I was completely mortified. I think the nurse thought I was digesting the ramifications of a possible diabetes diagnosis but I was actually quite embarrassed because I knew exactly how the sugar got into my pee.

In case you haven't figured it out yet, I don't have diabetes. The night before I had some "intimate" time with a girl. We rather enjoyed whipped cream as a prop... And I fell asleep right afterwards without any kind of clean up. Definitely the last time I do this right before a urine test. I thought I was going to die of embarrassment in that damn clinic. 

TL;DR - getting a whipped cream blow job and then taking a drug test may trick people into thinking you have diabetes.
