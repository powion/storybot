This happened about an hout ago: I was bored in class so I opened Binding of Isaac on my laptop. I have been tring to
complete all of the challenges, and the last one I haven't beaten yet is called the suicide king. 

In that challenge you shoot explosive tears that come back to you if they miss and enemy, and I find it bloody difficult.

After getting frustrated after dying for the tenth time I open google and type in "How to beat suicide..." and google already filled in the rest for me. But when I tried to click on the googles prediction I missclicked and actually searched for what I wrote in.
I retyped what I meant and didn't think much of it.

 Until after my classroom got an internal call and they demanded that I go to the principals office. Apparently the school proxy filter had picked up my suicidical searches and the IT had notified the administration, and when I arrived to the principals office the principal and the school nurse were waiting for me.

I quickly explained what had happened, and they understood the misunderstanding, but now I am sure I am under some kind of surveillance list from now on üòê

EDIT: If someone knows a solution on how to bypass the school proxy filter any helpp would be appreciated, as the blocking really makes research hard. I have tried tor, ultrasurf and freedome and all of those get stuck in connecting phase, I guess the traffic is blocked. I use my own laptop so I can install whatever would be needed, and I am ready to pay &lt;10 dollars per month if it allows me to watch youtube.
