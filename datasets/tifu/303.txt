Unlike most TIFU, this one actually happened today.  

So, I'm a dentist.  There was a young early 20s new patient in the office today whose boyfriend tagged along.  At some point during the exam, the topic of Breaking Bad came up. I'm a huge fan and pretty much recommend it to anyone if I find out they haven't seen it. I know it's on Netflix so, at some point, while talking to them, I'm mentioning how good it is and I tell them they can go Netflix and chill. I've seen the phrase here a bit and on other social media.  Since Netflix has become so big, I assumed it just meant relax and watch something on Netflix and that was what the young kids were doing a lot these days. They both kind of look at each other, giggle, and mention something like they could do that. I'm not young, but I'm under 40 and I thought they just found it funny I would use a newer phrase.

Fast forward to tonight.  I'm just sitting here watching baseball when this epiphany strikes out of nowhere.  I realize there was something a little off about their reaction to my using that phrase.  So I Googled it... just to make sure.  Now I'm horrified that I told a young couple to go home and have sex. I only hope it was obvious, I didn't know what I was saying.

Edit:  I'm just glad I'm not the only one who didn't know.  Hopefully this helped others not repeat my mistake. :P
