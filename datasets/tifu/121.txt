So, first of all sorry for the shitty English, it's not my main language.
This happened a year ago. I used to work on a IT course as "The IT Guy", had a pretty good time there just fixing computers and you know... doing the "IT Guy" job.
When it happened to me and some other people were at the kitchen drinking coffee and just chillin' a bit. I was going to stay the whole night working on a server migration and everyone else wes getting ready to leave, then comes the conversation about marriage and this guy (Let's call him Mark), was talking about his wife. We decided to ask his age because he looked like he was 16 years old, well, he was 17... No problem at all, so the conversation goes on and he ends on the phrase "I married her because she was pregnant", oh, that makes some sense, then Mark says "but the baby died in birth and we decided to give him to the university for research", after this phrase my mind full of dark humor replies "well, at least he reached college, medicine right ?". Everyone turns at me, I can see some people holding laught and others looking in disgust, I just realised what i've said, finish my coffee and rush to the IT Room.
Mark never looked into my face again.

TL;DR - Told a guy that his dead baby could get a degree in medicine research.
