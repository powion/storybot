I work for a very large store chain, and have been there for a year and 8 months. I was doing my taxes because I'm saving up for a down payment for a new car, and I'm single, and live with my mother. I did my federal taxes online, and they amounted to $1200 (I owe the state $300). That shouldn't have happened. I check my paycheck, to make sure I filed under "single and no children." Apparently, I had 9 exemptions on my paycheck...That is, EVERY. SINGLE. PAYCHECK. SINCE. I'VE. WORKED. THERE. I'll try and straighten this out on monday, but until then, I'm putting the new car on hold.

TL;DR: A year and 8 months ago, while starting my new job, I put that I had 9 kids, when I have none (either, I hit 9 instead of 0, or I have shitty handwriting.) Now I owe $1500 in taxes.

P.S. fuck Jenny...
