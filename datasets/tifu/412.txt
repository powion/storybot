this happened about 2 hours ago. It all started about 2 days ago.

I messaged both "Alice", and "Stacy" this Sunday, on OKCupid. I am a sad lonely man, and I need a ladyfriend. They both happened to respond. Awesome!

I set up the date with "Stacy" first. We set it for this Friday, around 415 for coffee. Cool.

Now, if any of you have ever dated online before, you know how often flakes, cancels, fades, and general bullshit happens. 

So as I was still talking to Stacy, I set up a date with Alice. Based on my talking with Stacy, she seemed somewhat reserved and timid, and it felt like a "1-2 hour" coffee date kind of thing. So I figured I had time on Friday night to go out with Alice.

Alice and I play some rocket league, set up a date Friday night, everything is groovy.

Fast forward to today. I talked to both Stacyand Alice on/off until today. About 3 hours ago, I receive this message from Stacyon OKCupid:

"Oh my god this is too funny. You should che-"

At this point, I have no idea what the fuck is going on. Then I got a text from Alice...

"-ck your phone"

HOW IN THE ACTUAL FUCK, OUT OF ALL THE WOMEN IN THE WORLD DO I HAPPEN TO PICK 2 WOMEN THAT ARE BEST FRIENDS, MEET EACH OTHER TUESDAY NIGHT AND ASK EACH OTHER ABOUT THEIR FUCKING DATES ON FRIDAY.

I can only imagine their fucking faces when they figure out they're going out with the same dude, on the same day, mere hours apart.

The last I heard, one was really fucking pissed at me and the other one thinks it's hilarious.

Yes I know, 3some jokes, fuck you. A better man than me might have pulled it off.

**TL;DR Set up dates with two completely seperate women on OKC, on the same day. They hung out today and happen to be best fucking friends and figured out they're both going out with the same guy**
