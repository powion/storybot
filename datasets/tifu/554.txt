This happened like 20 minutes ago js.
So for some back story here, our house has two bathrooms, the old nasty one my siblings and I share, and the glorious palace of a dumpsight that my parents have attached to their bedroom.  It's larger than my bedroom and has a Jacuzzi and all kinds of goodies.  Anyway, we recently got a new clutch of chickens, and they are still too small to survive the outdoor nights, so they spend the night in a cardboard box in the  Chateau de Guano.  
So here's the FU.  I had just come in from cutting the grass.  I have pretty nasty allergies, so priority #1 was get this shit off me.  So I head to my normal shower, but, It is occupied by my sister (It's worth noting she usually takes at least an hour to empty her bowels) So I figured, My parents aren't home yet, I'll use theirs.  BAD IDEA #1.
So I spend a good fifteen minutes using all the fancy soaps and stuff I found in there, and step out admiring the now steam filled palace.  Then it hit me.  I don't have a towel with me.  No problem, I thought, There is a closet right behind the box with the chicks.  So my American Ninja Warrior mindset kicked in.  Who cares if the floor is wet, I can jump it? Right?  BAD IDEA #2.  I slam butt first into the pine shaving filled shit hole, and managed to burn my back on the heat light in the process.  Meanwhile all the chickens went full panic mode and started flying all over me in my birthday suit.  I can't hold back a scream as my willy gets clawed at by the force of 6 angry peeps. BAD IDEA #3
SO My dad had gotten home in the time of my shower, and he burst through the door, concerned about my health, and BAM. He I am. Butt naked. In a box. With 6 baby chickens. Haven't left my room since.

tl:dr Caught naked with some chicks, My pecker got pecked by a pack of little peckers.

[Edit] We only keep the chickens in the box at night, to prevent them from freezing.  So it's not a 24/7 thing. Also no chickens died and my dad was not naked.
