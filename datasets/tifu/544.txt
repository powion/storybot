Today we were having a discussion about 9/11. Keep in mind this is Australia, where we don't really care that much.

One of my friends brought up the fact that her family friend died in 9/11.

Without thinking I said "What were his last words? ALLAH ACKBAR!!"

I imidiately stop and think "wtf did I just say???"

It came from a joke I heard:  
&gt; My dad died in 9/11, but at least I'll know his last words. **ALLAH ACKBAR**

Anyway, it was followed but 2 people laughing their asses off. 3 people going "Ohhhhhhh [as in, dude wtf?]". And her ignoring me indefinitely.

**EDIT:** I just want to clear up something. I said "Australians don't care that much" not "Australian's are glad 9/11 happened and are planning another one." Calm down.
