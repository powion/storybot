Thanks for the gold!

One of the brave and few, this actually happened today. 

I was talking in the hallway with one of my friends who is a girl and today is pajama day at our school. Peoe were walking by and we were just talking

Im fairly comfortable with most of my friends that are girls so i wanted to see what shirt she was wearing

So i do what any teenage male that doesn't think before he acts. 

I unzipped her hoodie in the middle of a hallway where many people were traveling through. She wasnt wearing a shirt 

So after showing everyone in the hallway my friends melons Lots of nervous laughter and red faces. Being yelled at and laughed at im sitting across the table from her in study hall and the first thing she says to me after a couple hours

"I told your mother"

Edit:

1. Holy shit frontpage
2. Senior in high school, its spirit week, not sure if people actually saw since no one reacted besides me and her, but there was that chance
3. If you don't believe idk its the fucking internet heres a screenshot of a text you reddit detectives.[screenshot (Edited so you cant see her number)](https://imgur.com/aOx49La)
