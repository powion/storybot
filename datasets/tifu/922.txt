This happened 20 mins ago. So I always thought boobies were nice. They were soft and squishy and pretty and fun. I thought hey! I think girls are pretty, boobs feel nice and pussy is cute. Maybe I'm bisexual or a lesbian? So I took a girl on a date. It was fun and one thing led to another and candles were lit, music was playing, no words existed but the sound of us kissing.
I felt like a playa. I wined and dined this pretty girl and she totally wanted me. I was feeling egotistical. She was on top of me,
Grinding into me. Her back was arching, soft whimpers and moans escaped her pretty mouth. And then I sat there, boob in hand and thought "man I could really go for penis right about now". And then
It hit me as she started to go down my pants that shit! I don't want to finger her. I don't want her fingering me! Just not my Thing. At all. So I finished the movie with her and was curteous and saw her out.
But now I have to figure out how not to be a jerk and not see her again. I fucked up.

Edit: Thanks a million for all the advice guys! I'm glad you got a kick out of my fuck up. /u/Penguin_FTW linked a video that describes my experience perfectly
Right [here](http://youtu.be/7n39RzgVNP8) thanks! :) 

Update: So I told the lady I took on a date last night that she was beautiful, wonderful, sweet and kind and a ton of fun! But it just so happens I'm not as much into girls as I had thought. Just not right for me personally. But she is awesome and kind and I had a great time! And she sounded disappointed but in the end was okay with it. Said she understood.
Thanks for your help my fellow redditors!
