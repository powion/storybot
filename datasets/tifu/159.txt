This is my first ever post on reddit, after being a serial lingerer, so forgive my formatting/everything else I inevitably do wrong.

In true TIFU fashion, I'll start by saying this didn't happen today, but 16 years ago, when I was in nursery. (I hadn't got around to making a reddit account back then.)

The FU happened during playtime one day, I was happily playing with a tray of beans, the easily amused child I was. I was temporarily unsupervised, and in a moment of pure genius, I decided that I would insert one of the beans - Into my **nose**. I did a good job of it too, none of the staff noticed. The day carried on like any other, I went home, had tea, went to bed, bean lodged in my nostril.

Noses are warm, damp places. The perfect location for a plant to grow. Long story short, the bean resided in my nose for a good few days, until my mother noticed a small green shoot in my nostril. I grew a bean. In my nose.

My mother took me to the GP, where the (presumably confused) doctor removed the bean, shoot &amp; all from my nose, with an evil looking curved hook. I was terrified of the doctors for a few years, and I was put under constant supervision in playtime, lest I try my hand at gardening again.
