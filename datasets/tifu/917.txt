This happened last night.

I hyped the movie up and took my dad to watch it with me before I really found out anything about it other than Nolan - McConaughey - spaaaace - excellent scores.

We were about 8 minutes late coming into the theatre because we couldn't find a parking spot, and when we walked in, the movie had already started. I found this a bit odd because I expected there to be about 20 minutes of trailers before it started, but whatever.

Anyways, the movie was quite good but it was extremely rushed and we both agreed that the introduction was poorly done and it took us a while to catch up to what was going on, even though we only missed the first ~8 minutes of playtime.

About 90 minutes later the movie ends and we walk out of the theater kind of disappointed. I got pretty pissed when I saw on IMDB that the runtime was 179 minutes but the version we saw was cut down to 90 minutes.

So, the next morning I call the theatre to see what the deal was and maybe give them a lot of shit for thinking they had a right to edit Christopher Nolan's work themselves (cause I couldn't find any info on other theaters doing this).

And then I realized what we did. We fucking walked into the wrong projection hall... The movie was playing in two halls simultaneously and we picked the one that started about an hour and a half earlier...

Fuck.
