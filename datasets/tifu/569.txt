So to start, I'll let you know I had a very big night last night, and drank more than I should have. A lot more than I should have. 

Anyways, cut to this morning, I wake up feeling surprisingly ok, and have the biggest craving for some chicken nuggets. So I had down to the hungry jacks just down the road and proceed to eat 6 nuggets before I get the overwhelming urge to throw up. So being the polite person I am, I run to the nearest bin outside, which unbeknownst to me at the time, had a pigeon feasting on the food inside. I had already began violently vomiting up the contents of my stomach into the bin and all over this pigeon, which then promptly freaked the fuck out and flew up out of the bin, splashing my vomit back up all over me in the process.
