I wish I'd discovered this subreddit earlier, because I have a sad amount of TIFU stories and this one is my favorite.

I had just finished taking my final exam and was walking up to my professor to hand her the paper. After I handed her my exam I started thanking her for teaching such a fun class (it was a class about sexuality and I loved it) and as I was talking to her I noticed her arm reaching forward - about to hug me. 

I had a rapid, panicky thought process. Oh my god, I've never hugged a professor before? Is this allowed? Is this breaching a student-teacher relationship? Does this mean we're friends?? But I liked this professor and didn't want to be cold to her, so I immediately raised my arms to hug her back. But I was so nervous, so I sort of lurched forward to hug her back.

My arms were almost around her and her arm was hovering above my shoulder when I saw her face suddenly look shocked, then she started to laugh. I looked over my shoulder behind me and I realized SHE HAD BEEN REACHING BEHIND ME TO GRAB ANOTHER STUDENT'S EXAM PAPER. 

I was mortified, but my professor thought it was hilarious and ended up actually hugging me before I left the classroom in shame. She ended up choosing me as her TA later on in the year!

EDIT: My professor did not choose me as her teaching assistant because I awkwardly hugged her! Sorry, I should've been clearer; that happened way way later and was intended to be a nice bonus to offset my mess-up story. And yes, she is attractive, but I would never never never ever flirt with her or anything like because I only see her as my professor.
