This actually took place over the course of a few months. We drive to see my girlfriend's grandmother a lot on weekends. The grandmother lives in a different state and it gives the girlfriend and I a lot of time in the car together. Being a pretty boring drive, we usually help time go by by having karaoke parties, playing the alphabet game (race from A-Z finding words that start with the next letter on signs), or arguing about whodunnit in Serial. Being such a long drive (about 6.5 hours one way), we of course hold hands occasionally. Cute boring stuff. Well, usually we'll say "I love you" as we hold hands and I got it in my head on one trip that I'd mess with her. 

It started with me putting my hand on her knee, giving it a light squeeze and saying, "I love you." She'd respond likewise and we'd continue. I'd do this a couple times each way. Then I began to do it when we're on the couch watching something or just in general sitting next to one another. Not too often, but enough to form a habit. Then I started to just squeeze her leg. My plan worked perfectly. Without realizing it she'd look at me, flash that great beam of a smile and tell me she loves me. For a few weeks I enjoyed a game that only I knew we were playing, chuckling to myself in satisfaction. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore. It was just too good. I had to tell her.

This was a mistake.

She couldn't believe she didn't notice it for so long and wonders what else I'm doing to mess with her. Now when I squeeze instead of saying she loves me I get scowl and an eye roll. But eventually she does still say it.

TL;DR: 
My lovely Pavlovian belle,

loved my touch and all was swell,

Until I did sing,

Now when the bell rings,

All I hear is "Go to hell"

Edit: Since so many have asked, MsRyael is not in fact the gf.
