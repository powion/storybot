This happened like two days ago, and I'm still not able to shake it off. 
I will try to keep this short, but no promises. 
Background first; I am a Pakistani teen (18) living in Saudi Arabia. Now, it's not well known but Saudi Arabians are way more conservative than Pakistanis, they're ridiculously possessive about their wives, and have segregation of males and females at events like weddings and parties etc. My dad works here as an engineer, and has befriended hell a lot of Arabs, while I am comparatively newer to the country and don't know much about the culture.
So, on Sunday my dad tells me about this dinner we've to attend on his Saudi friend's place, let's call him 'Ahmed'. Now, I've seen Ahmed quite a few times, and I know that he has a little daughter, probably 3 year old named Ayesha, and son about 4 named Ali. 
So fast forward to dinner. I'm sitting along my dad's colleagues all exclusively Arabs, they're all speaking Arabic probably talking about work, while I am busy eating. Also wondering where the little kids at. When suddenly Ahmed in broken English ask me am I getting bored, to which I reply "No, it's great to meet you guys, where's Ayesha though? Isn't she the cutest". Right after I said this, literally everyone looks at me, and they all stop chewing. Ahmed starts shouting at my dad in arabic and I can tell he's way too upset. He stands up and asks us to leave. I am thinking what the hell? Turns out Ayesha is his wife's name not his daughter, Daughter's name was Alisha. 
Ahmed is still pissed at us, and thinks I'm some sort of uncultured pervert, who's after his wife. 

TL;DR Confused names of wife and a kid in a conservative family, got kicked out.
