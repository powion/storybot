Two friends on my Facebook list have near-identical names; they are literally only one letter off. Both are "Diana K..."

One is a fitness instructor at my gym; the other is an enormous person.

"It's Diana's birthday!" popped up in my feed, and getting confused and thinking it was the fitness instructor, I wrote: "Happy birthday! I'm going to eat pizza, cake, and all other sorts of garbage so I can be just like you today!"

Because, you know, fitness instructor.

Ha-ha.

A week later, "It's Diana's birthday!" popped up in my feed again, and noticing it was the fitness instructor I wrote, "How many birthdays do you have?"

Ten minutes later, it dawned on me...

Yup.

I felt like the world's biggest asshole.
