So this literally just happened...

I went over to Subway for lunch and there was a large black man in line in front of me talking on his phone all the way up to the order line. The woman taking his order was rightfully pissed off at him for ignoring her and continuing to talk on the phone, when he finally hung up saying "call me back in a minute, I need to order this shit." He progressed to place his order, changing the bread choice 3 times, and then demanding they put mayo on the bread before they toast it. 

This is where things start to get ugly. As he is arguing with the lady behind the counter his phone goes off and a photo of a large black woman pops up onto his phone, in a bikini of all things, trying to look sexy...or so I would assume. The name "Chocolate Butter" caught my attention on the screen, and that's when things start to go horribly wrong. 

I burst out laughing uncontrollably, only to have this massive beast make eye contact with his phone and then me...His eyes looked like they could kill. He kept looking at me, not blinking, as my laughter slowly decreased to a smirk. 

"What the FUCK you laughing at?! You laughing at my BUTTER? FUCK YOU!" 

He took a step in my direction and I noped the fuck out of there...

I'm currently sitting back at my desk in my office without any food. Sorry Butter lover!
