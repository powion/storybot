Throwaway because boyfriend knows my Reddit account.

BF and I are both 19 and we have been dating for three years.  Tonight I went over to his house to play some Steam games (I finally got a job and decided to play some games that he recommended), and he wants to test them out on his new laptop.

He decides to show me Surgeon Simulator.

Having had brain surgery a few times, I am absolutely terrified of anything having to do with my noggin organ.  But I say oh fuck, why the hell not.  It's cartoonish, right?  No big deal.

After a nutritious dinner of corn dogs fresh from the oven, I turn my head and he says "Hey, Nora, look."  I turn and he has the poor patient's brain lolling about the tool tray and the screen is positively spurting with blood.

I manage to vomit all over his new laptop, his jeans, and his carpeting.  (The dog managed to move away).

He projectile vomits into my hair.

Reddit, TIFU bad.

EDIT:  Jesus fuck, Reddit.  Front page.  I love you.
