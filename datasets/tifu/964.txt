I was driving back home after a day of work &amp; evening with my gf @~2am

Long straight street, it was hot outside (~26Â°C) and not a single car around as you can tell by the day/hour so i thought it was ok to leave car windows open.

...Until 1km from home.

There the apocalypse happened in 0.5 seconds.

Imagine the street: ditch left &amp; right with the typical grass leaves coming out from the street borders.

No time to think at all.

I see a movement on the right and a rough sound of something hitting my  right mirror..

...And some hot liquid hitting my face in that exact moment. (N.d.a: I live in italy so I was sitting/driving in the LEFT seat.)

My glasses were completely covered in something that was completely covering my eyesight so i paniked and braked blindly.

I somehow managed NOT to fell in the ditch but then I removed my glasses and turned the internal car light on.

Blood.

On my glasses, on the front seats.

Started paniking I realized what happened.

A turkey (YAY, A TURKEY) decided it was a good time to die (so sorry btw).

I stopped the car and looked at the backseats with a torch.

There it was.

Covered in blood the turkey was "sitting" on my backseat.

The backseat was completely full of shit &amp; blood.

I paniked more.

I opened the car doors and gently moved away the turkey with a shopping bag i found on the trunk.

I stopped outside the car for like 10 mins looking at that mess.

Then I finally decided it was time to go back home, cleaned the glasses on my blood-covered-t-shirt, and started cleaning the car and myself with alcohol.

Went to bed @ 5am.


TL;DR: almost beheaded a turkey while driving. turkey in the impact sprayed blood all over me &amp; IN the car. Shitted all over the backseats.
3 hours to clean up all this mess.

Sorry for the english, not my main language.
