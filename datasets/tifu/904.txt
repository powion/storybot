I am going to tell you the story of how what started as a simple shower ended in utter chaos. 

It started like any Sunday afternoon. Wake up around 1, consume candy for breakfast, see what's on TV. A few minutes in I got bored and realized a needed a shower because I stink. So i go in the downstairs bathroom, which is about 6 x 6 feet, and start stripping of my clothes. I also put on a shower cap because I'm a girl and I don't want to get my hair wet because I don't want to wait for it to dry. However I don't have one so I just use a plastic bag. Whatever.

I turn on the shower head, and that's when I see it. A GIANT fucking spider, chillin on the ceiling in the corner or the shower. Keep in mind I am someone who is not afraid to *stare death in the face*, but I am *terrified of fucking spiders.* We have a staring contest. My heart is pounding as I deliberate my plan of action. Also I am staying with my grandma, and there are no manly men to take care of the problem. I am on my own. 

Now what i usually do in this situation is kill the spider with an ungodly amount of dangerous chemicals until it dies. So I go to the basement (still naked, grandma is watching tv still) and find the most dangerous chemical i can find and settle on a bathroom cleaner. This are serious shit.

This is where it gets ugly.

I come back in the bathroom armed and start attacking. The spider crawls to the other side of the room, but this isn't good enough for me. I keep spraying, the spider keeps moving, and I'm getting this shit all over the ceiling and walls. Apparerntly it's the kind that starts foaming, and not only does it make a mess, it *releases these horrible fumes* and soon i can't breathe so i turn on the ventilator, which hasn't been used in like a year. Eventually the spider weakens and succumbs to its injuries, and falls to the floor by the toilet. I take an opaque cup and heroically trap the spider in it.

But it's not over yet.

Next course of action is to get this foam off, can't just leave it there. Meanwhile, the ventilator has gone from a normal quiet ventilator noise to an acute loud screeching, as if something were caught in it. Now, as i reach to wipe the shit off, not only does my arm get caught in an invisible spiderweb, but *daddy long legs* has crawled up the toilet I was standing on, and on my feet (opaque cup, never actually trapped it). The coinciding incidents cause me to freak the fuck out, and lose my balance. I grab the closest thing i can to catch myself, a towel rack, which cannot support my weight and therefor breaks off of the wall. 

And that is how my grandmother found me, naked on the floor with a plastic bag on my head, with a towel rack in my hand and in a bathroom covered in foam.

**TL;DR** find a spider in my bathroom, try to kill it, grandma finds me on the floor naked, bathroom covered in foamy bathroom cleaner

**Edit** I know daddy long legs are harmless, still have deep-seeded irrational fear. It was about 3 inches in diameter if you were to spread out its legs
