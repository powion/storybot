So, technically this fuck up has been going on since I purchased the blinds THREE YEARS AGO, but I just realized today that they do not work properly. 

My room is essentially windowed all the way around, with about two feet (edit: definitely not two feet, I'm no good with measurements, it just comes up to pretty much my hip) worth of wall, so the walled section comes up to maybe my hip. 

I have these awesome bamboo type blinds that I love because they don't block the sun out entirely, they let a bit in which is nice to wake up to...  And should have been my first hint. 

As my other fuck ups will tell you, I like to be naked and I'm very comfortable with my body. So, I live alone and, naturally, I walk around naked a lot and get changed in the middle of my room. 

The windows look out onto an alley of the condo building where the parking garage also is. While changing, I often look out to see who is parking in our building and I notice the cars always slow to almost a stop, then continue. I figured there was a speed bump or something. 

Fast forward to early this morning when I accidentally left my bedroom light on when I left. I walk out the side door, walk down the alley and turn to look back at my room - - with the light on you can see EVERY DETAIL OF MY ROOM. You can literally see the tack on my wall where I'm meaning to hang a picture. 

So, all and all, I've been dancing naked, getting changed and doing God knows what else in full view of everyone driving down the alley.... Oh, and the giant apartment building across from the condo. 

TL;DR : blinds don't work when the light is on, I've been exposing myself to potentially hundreds of people every day for three years.
