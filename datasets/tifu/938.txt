TIFU happened **a decade ago** before starting football at military academy. 

I was leaving the state in a month to play football, and I still hadn't gotten my physical done yet. This was back when physicals still included finger-to-ball cough-touching. I'd always found this part of playing sports to be particularly awkward. My very first physical as a child I was so worried about gagging on a tongue depresser that when the Dr. told me to turn my head and cough, with his finger up my nads, I looked to mother and worriedly asked, "is he going to stick anything down my throat??"

So there I am at 18 years old at the doctor's office getting my pre-season physical. I knew that at some point it was coming, and I was going to have to pull them out in front of this nice old man. He had me lying on the exam table inspecting my thyroid area. He stepped away from the table and said, "go ahead and nip your shorts down a bit for me." I thought it weird because normally the hernia inspection was done while you're standing up. But nonetheless I pulled my shorts down to the middle of my quads and had it all out. He turned and came back to the examination table, and without saying anything he pressed on my lower abs checking for I don't know what. He then turned back to his desk and said, "OK you're all good to go." The cringe hit hard. He'd intended for me to expose my lower abs better, not whip out the rig. I pulled my shorts up, and sat up. I couldnt make eye contact with the guy, so I took the paperwork and left. The cringe set in so deep that I had trouble walking back to the waiting room with a normal stride. It shall hopefully forever remain the single most awkward moment of my life. I took seven cringe breaks writing this.
