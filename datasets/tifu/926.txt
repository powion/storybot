I work from 8am-5pm. After work I got in my car and spent a minute on my phone. During the short period I heard a single bizarre moaning noise. I thought for brief second it could have been an animal, and so I looked around the car and then under it before leaving on my ~15m drive home.

After another minute I heard the noise again. I pulled over, and inspected the inside and outside again. I convinced myself I was crazy or that it was my bluetooth device, and finished the drive home.

During the drive home I spoke to my wife who joked about a cat being stuck underneath the car, out of sight. I didn't take it seriously, because I had already checked it out.

When I got home, I gathered my things and briefly considered the noises one last time. As a joke, I said "hey kitty kitty", and heard a loud and obvious animal noise in response. At this, I sortof flipped out and started checking every possible spot I could find. After checking the inside and outside AGAIN, I opened the hood of the car and searched desperately. I called again, and immediately got an animal response. I narrowed my search based on the direction of the moan and sure enough found a white ball of fur packed into the back right corner of the car. Somewhere between the siding of the car and the engine compartment.

I reached in to pull out a very large scared fluffy cat. Not just any cat. MY FUCKING CAT! I inspected her for any injuries and promptly fed her some food and water.

TL;DR: My cat got stuck inside the engine compartment of my car, survived the 20m trip to work, 8 hours of being stuck (?), and the 20m drive home before being found. No injuries!

Bonus. Terrible quality picture of said kitty.
