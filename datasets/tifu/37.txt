If you're a polite person, it's muscle memory to hold the door open for whoever's behind you.

I was leaving my university library through a revolving door, and I was reading something on my phone.  This gorgeous girl was behind me with a coffee in one hand and books in the other.

As I exit out into the open, without even realizing it, I hold my hand back to stop the motion of the door.  She walked right into the glass, spilling her coffee all over herself.

I panicked and ran.  

I can never go back.
