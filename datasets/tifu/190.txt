Hereâ€™s a little background on me. I'm a 27 year old who is white and gay. I'm not what you would call a stereotypical gay. I'm not flamboyant, I don't have a lisp, and I have horrible fashion sense. Despite this being 2015 and it not being a stigma to be gay where I live, I have still not come out at work. I'm also a natural flirt. It's not sexual; it's just my default setting.

I work in a pretty small office setting. It's just me, my boss, and five ladies. I have a great relationship with everyone in the office especially a girl named Vee. Everyone calls us the "office couple." Vee is a beautiful black woman and if I wasn't 100% batting for the other team, I would probably be all over that grand slam style. I keep my office life and personal life separate. I'll go out for after work drinks with the girls, but really nothing further than that. I have a wonderful boyfriend but he has never stepped one foot into my office building or met any coworkers. 

Yesterday at lunch, a couple of the girls came up to me and asked if I would ask Vee out. They spent all lunch trying to convince me saying things like..."she's single" and "you two are such fun and so cute together" and "she told us she likes you." You know, the basic high school BS you hope to escape in the adult world only to realize that nobody changes.

Trying to escape this horrible ambush I said something that would snowball into my biggest regret:

"I'm just not into people like her."

Now I know what you are thinking, and trust me I've thought about it constantly over the past 12 hours. Why did I say the word 'people'? I could have just said I'm just not into *her*, no need for the people part. I'm an idiot and I fucked up that's why. I thought I was being clever and putting water on the fire without admitting my gayness. 

**NOPE.**

"What do you mean you're not into *PEOPLE* like her?"

"She's just not my type, ok?"

"No, not OK, you said PEOPLE like her. What do you mean? Is it because she's black?"

"What?!? Of course not. I have no problem with Vee being black."

"Then what is it? Why are you being such an asshole?"

"It's just...just...I'm gay."

"DON'T PULL THAT GAY SHIT ON ME! YOU'RE NOT GETTING OUT OF THIS. You're always flirting with everyone, we know you're not gay."

I ran out of the lunchroom. Went to my office and shut the door. I stealthily left at the end of the day without anyone seeing me. 

It's the next day now and everyone is giving me dirty looks. Now despite actually being gay, and attempting an actual "come out" at work no one will believe me. Vee hasn't said a single word to me.

**TL;DR: No one believes I'm gay, so that makes me a racist.**
