So, usually I don't answer private phone numbers because 9/10 they're salesmen who are trying to trying to acquire my soul. (I may or may not have accidently signed up for this through a porn app on my phone, that's another fuck up for another day)  But jokingly my friend said to me the other day:
"You should totally answer the next phone call you get with something like, 'yeah I dumped the body'."
Well, today when I was with a group of my friends and as per usual my phone rang, displaying "private number". So for a cheep laugh I decided to pick up and say it. 
"Yeah, I've dumped the body in the forest, don't stress nobody saw me."
After a moment of silence the voice on the other side spoke.
"Mr Rubix, we're going to need you to stay where you are."

So for the last hour I've been explaining to the police how I really didn't dump any body, and about how it was a prank. Needless to say, it's a bad idea to mess with private numbers.

TL;DR - TIFU by answering the phone to a private  number and admitted to committing to a murder I didn't commit as a joke, turned out the private number was a police officer who needed to tell me my wallet had been found. Spent a good portion of my day explaining that I didn't commit any murder.

-Edit - for people saying it didn't happen, it really did. I was writing it on the way home and was totally hyper about the whole thing. But I understand why you wouldn't believe it, it does sound a little bit far fetched.

Anyway, nothing happened. I went down to the police station, told my story, he laughed at me returned my wallet and sent me on my way.
