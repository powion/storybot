Ok, so this just happened about a half hour ago. My wife and I are in the process of potty training our daughter and we have a tiny Minnie Mouse toilet that has a bucket like apparatus that sits under the seat for catching all "boop boops." I work late hours and last night after getting home I had me a couple adult beverages before heading to bed. Fast forward a few hours later I'm woken up from my daughter screaming in her bed, which usually means get me now or I'm going potty all over my bed. So I go in and grab her and take her to do her business. I didn't turn the light on in the hopes I could put her back to bed for a bit longer. I set her on her seat and she starts to go. Hearing your little spawn let their bladder go is one of the best sounds ever. You know that you don't have to clean a big mess and that the tons of money for diapers are gone. I'm sure anyone who potty trained their little one knows what I mean.
     Anywho while she's going my happiness turns to confusion as my foot is getting wet. When she is done we go through our high fives and I send her to get in bed with mommy. I turn the light on and instantly realize that her mom had not put the bucket thingy back into the potty after cleaning it, so she had actually peed through the potty not in the potty. Not only that, she was now chilling in our bed with her mom asking why is her feet wet?


I just wanted everyone to know that we have acquired a new seat so she can actually use the big person potty. My only worry now is that we don't forget it's not in there at some point and have her fall in.
