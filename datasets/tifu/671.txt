So I work in a kitchen.  People move fast and very often have sharp or searing hot things in their hands. As a safety measure we say "Behind you!" as we pass by to cut down on accidents.

I was walking home from work at around 4 am.  I see a woman walking the same direction as I am, I appear to be moving a fair amount faster.  I've been told I make little to no noise as I walk, so I suppose she didn't hear me, but as I went to pass her I nonchalantly said "behind you" on reflex.  She must have jumped a foot in the air, screamed at the top of her lungs, and sprinted off.

I hope she's not scarred for life O.o
