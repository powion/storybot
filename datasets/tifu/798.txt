So there really isn't much to this story. My friends and i have been planning to have a drag day where we go to school as the opposite gender. I have been looking forward to this for a long time and naturally had some stuff planned out and ready. That is everything but something to press my boobs down. I didn't want to pay for a legitimate Binder for a one or two day thing so i decided early on to use ace bandages. Unfortunately the morning of, i was running around frantically looking for the bandages and couldn't find any so i thought "fuck it i'll just use ductape". That was my first mistake, my second one occurred when i didn't use tissue or anything to cover up the nipples before applying ductape and so even originally i was extremely uncomfortable. I was unable to breath deeply and found out the hard way that coughing was a terrible thing to do. I went to school joked around with friends for a bit and then continued on with classes. Then in third period a horrendous event occurred. I sneezed. And with that sneeze the ductape ripped and my boobs exploded out underneath my shirt, i went from an A to a C in less than two seconds and was braless. Not sure if anyone noticed but it wouldn't be hard to, luckily i have a sweat shirt on hand and am currently wearing it. Gonna make it through the day.
