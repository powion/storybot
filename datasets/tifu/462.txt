My brother, 13, goes to a day camp at a local community college in my hometown. I was visiting home for a few days (working at my college over the summer), and my parents were encouraging us to spend time together since I wouldn't see him for long.

I picked him up from his day camp, which ended at 4, and had to entertain him until his drum lessons at 5. Knowing that he's obsessed with video games, I took him to a GameStop near his drum lessons. 

Everything went according to plan until it was time to leave. 4:50 hit, we needed to go, but he wasn't having any of it. 4:54, he still really *really* didn't want to leave, and by this point I was growing impatient because I didn't want my parents to be pissed at me for making him late. 4:57 and I grab his hand and tell him the **we need to leave**.

"Danny, we have to go."  
"Just one more minute!"  
"No, dude, your lessons are starting like ***now***. Let's go."  
 "Just give me a sec! I just need like two secs."  

I, an 18 year old boy, grabbing my 13 year old brother's hand in a crowded GameStop, angrily yelled

###***"DANNY, WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR SECS."***

I got a lot of concerned looks, got really red in the face, and got the hell out of there as quickly as fucking possible.
