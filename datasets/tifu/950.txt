I was at Disneyland Paris with a group of friends. We were on that ride where you all stand in a room/spaceship whilst it gets pummelled with asteroids. The room shakes, sparks fly and flames pop up. People are fighting for balance and grabbing hold of things.

At one point all the lights went out. Everyone screamed and it was pitch black. I reached out to grab a railing, but recoiled when my knuckles connected with something unexpectedly soft.

When the lights came back on I saw a young child was standing close by, face red and drenched with tears. His father tried to console him as he wailed in terror.

Upon realising I'd just punched an eight year old in the face, I slowly turned and edged away.
