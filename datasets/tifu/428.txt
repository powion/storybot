Still quite fresh, happened yesterday night but has been taking place for the past year. 

Short(-ish) backstory, (at that time) I was a 27 y/o bi guy, dating this girl for about a year, she lived with her dad at the time so whenever I would go over her dad and I would shoot the shit, watch sports, play videogames and we became decently good friends. 

Turns out while we were dating she was cheating on me, so during our "break" her dad texts me and sees if I was alright and if I wanted to go for a drink. She still lives with him so we went to a bar nearby, and continued being friends like she didn't exist. We knock back a few too many, stumble back to his home (drinking and driving is bad kids!) and I drop him on his bed, and end up passing out myself. Wake up after a few hours, to find myself being spooned up to him; panic; wake him up in the process. Embarrassing silence follows, and then he leans over and kisses me. Turns out I'm not the only bisexual in the room, and we end up doing the nasty. 

Fast forward 2 months, he and I are still seeing each other, his daughter and I are not, but no one knows about him and I. His daughter moved in with her new bf and he invited me over since she was gone. We were just hanging out and playing games, I go to get a another beer for us come back to find him down on one knee with a ring. Fate has it, his daughter forgot something and opens the door right at the moment with new bf in tow. Shit hits the fan, she starts screaming obscenities, he panics and tries to calm things down and I walked over, pick up the ring and put it on. Hell hath no fury like that of a woman whose dad I'm now engaged to. She starts screaming even more, her bf decides punching me is the best option, and thankfully my days in Judo haven't completely been forgotten. I throw him out of house, dad tells daughter to get out and slams door in her face. She runs off, and tells the whole world on FB, calls his family and mine. His family is pissed at him, my (very Indian) family is livid with me and right now I just hope she gets hit by a goddamn meteorite!


TL;DR- Dated a girl, befriended father, broke up with cheating girl, slept with her father, now engaged to him, shit hits the fan and neither family is happy!

EDIT: OK this was/is my first reddit post ever, did NOT expect the crazy amount of responses. Here I'm thinking it'll get lost in the swell that is the Internet. Thank you for the support/advice/whatever else this was just me venting and it's become wayyyyyy more than that now. Also, I have no fucking clue what reddit gold is but thank you to the kind soul who donated/bought that. Please don't give me more, I don't know what to do with it :/
Q&amp;A
To answer some of the questions posted or just clear some stuff up. 
- he's 42, I'm 29, she's 24. He had her when he was 18. 
- he's divorced, so he's not cheating on anyone, I wouldn't allow that given that's what happened to me. 
- I did not put on the ring out of spite, I was going to say yes anyway, with or without her barging in. 
- he's Canadian (Italian) and I'm the from-India-Indian kind of Indian . 
- he's not overly thrilled with me venting on here, so I won't be posting pix anytime soon. Maybe once things, and he,  calm down. 

EDIT2: Holiday season was bonkers busy, so didn't get a chance to update. We have decided to move in together, my place not his old place. My extended family (cousins et al) are talking to me again, the younger ones couldn't give a fuck about my sexuality, the older ones are tiptoeing around it. My parents are ... my parents, they are concerned blah blah blah, they don't understand (but so-and-so's daughter is sooooo pretty, and a doctor) but they realize they can't huff and puff and expect me to go running back to their side. His family, typical Italian, don't get it or don't want to. Except for one brother and one sister, he's essentially cut off and it crushes me, but he said they'll come around and I certainly hope so. 
Also, for the people hung up on the judo thing, judo has very little to do with punching and kicking and is mostly grappling, throwing, and submissions. I used to be a purple belt nikyuu (junior rank), before I immigrated to Canada
He's also severely against his picture being online, so no pic but once I get him a ring we'll put up a pic of the rings.
