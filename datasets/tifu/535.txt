Ok, I just fucked up about 2 days ago. I tried posting before, but it was removed. I am on my phone as well so excuse my formatting, but I think I can manage. 

So backstory real quicklike, I went snowboarding not long ago, I ate shit,  it was my first time, and I cracked a rib, sprained my wrist. 

I'm visiting in town for my grandmother's funeral. I'm at my other grandmother's and I decided to run a bubble bath. Soaking these aching, cracked and sprained bones in hot and heavy water would be amazing right now. 

So... this is where I fuck up but didn't know it yet. 

I run a bath, I normally check the tub for things like hair or whatever before I get in, but I'm high on xanax, so I don't pay any attention to the tub. I just run the bath, squeeze in some shampoo or something to make bubbles, grab the clothes I am going to put on, come back and it looks good. It's hot, it's heavy. 

I soak, and ohhhh. It's exhilarating. The nostalgic bathtub, the warm water, the bubbles, but then.. the smell...

My grandfather has Alzheimer's and dementia. He's gotten progressively worse.

He was known to hide his diapers in random places, he's even tried to flush one once. 

So I soak, I feel great, right?
No, left. 

Turns out earlier that day he had an episode, and as I went to get out, I could feel small chunks hitting my body. I noticed small brown chunks on me as well. I felt something cling to my foot. Turns out, I soaked in murky brown water for 5-10 minutes with a diaper. A shitty diaper.  I puked. 

TL;DR: Cracked a rib, ran the bathtub, clung a diaper, became the shattub


Edit:  you guys are fucking hilarious. I love reddit. 

TIFU by posting a truly bizarre thing that happened to me on a subreddit meant for truly bizarre/awkward happenings.
