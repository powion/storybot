Probably 10 years ago, but [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2ak7no/tifu_by_peeing_on_my_cat/) story reminded me of this.

The house that was the party spot during our early 20's had a cat that was always around. For whatever reason, he obsessed with pee streams. We mainly partied outside, so anytime someone had to take a leak, we would just go around the side of the house. Just about anytime anyone took a piss, the cat would come over an sniff your pee, bat at it, just generally be fascinated by it.

It started off as a drunken accident, but someone peed on the cat, and said he didn't even seem to mind. Then it became a regular thing to pee on the cat because apparently he liked it (and we were young, drunk, and dumb). "I'm going to go water the cat" became a normal saying.

We didn't think much about it, and this went on for months. We just thought it was some feral neighborhood cat because it was *always* outside. Anyway, we're out one night doing our regular thing, and hear his ~80yo neighbor- "Oh Mr. Boots (can't remember actual name) how do you always get so wet? Let's get you dried off again."

All our mouths dropped as we looked at each other while this sank in. This poor old lady has probably been picking up a piss-soaked cat and/or letting it inside the house every time we had a party. As bad as we wanted to feel, we couldn't help but laugh. I don't think anyone could breathe for 10 minutes.

We stopped peeing on the cat after that, and my buddy said he raked her leaves for her the next day, "just because" when she asked why. I still feel bad to this day, but can't help a guilty chuckle when I think back on this.

edit: Who knew peeing on a cat would get you gilded. Thanks stranger!
