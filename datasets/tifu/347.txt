This actually happened just a few minutes ago..
So me and the wife are sitting together watching Family Feud, the question on the show is "Name something your wife talks to you about, but you have no interest in". The first family answered with the obvious answers, her clothes and her friends. They couldn't figure out the last two so Steve Harvey asked the second family, "Name something your wife talks to you about, but you have no interest in". I immediately blurt out, "HER FEELINGS"! 
It's been 30 minutes now and I am still trying to convince her that I care about her feelings, I just thought that's how OTHER people would answer. I'm such a dumbass.
