Okay this happened couple of Sundays ago at my nephews birthday party. There were about 15 kids there age raging from 2-6. I was inside trying to entertain my nephew and his friends. So I got some ketchup packets and twisted one end to make it into a ball with all the ketchup built up on one end. I had my nephew stand at the end of living room next to the patio door. I went hadouken! And threw one at him. The kids loved it, maybe it was just the sound I was making. Every time he would say faster faster! So about my tenth one I did full baseball windup and went hadouken! I fling it like a damn fireball. At the same time some random kid decided to run into the house from the patio. BOOM! Direct headshot. The kids head goes back, but the ketchup packet exploded on contact and it sprayed ketchup on the back wall, and the same time there was a mom standing behind me, she started screaming bloody murder! Full chaos breaks out, then people realize it was ketchup. Still no one laughed but me, and I was the outcast the rest of the party.

TL;DR: Hadoukened a ketchup packet, hits random kid explodes and parents thought I murdered a child.

Edit: wow this really took off, and thank you to the one who gave me gold
