So this happened a few hours ago.

Backstory: I work in a small industry firm, with no more than 10 employees, in the finance department, so going on reddit is fine since there's no customers come in or out of the office.

Everyday I come to work and most days, I'm always on reddit to pass time if there's no work to do. I usually go on the popular, main subreddits including TIFU. When I go on tifu, I usually scroll down to hide the title TODAY I FUCKED UP (since its obviously inappropriate at work). But today was different. Today, I was a dumbass.

Instead of scrolling down, to hide the title, I forgot and my boss called me in to have a word about some work. So I walked over and spoke to him for about 5 minutes. I returned to my desk and found the fucking CEO of the firm looking at my computer screen. I walked over as if nothing was wrong, and said "Morning boss". No reply from him. I looked at the screen and saw in huge letters TODAY I FUCKED UP. I nearly died. My heart started racing. Thinking of an excuse, he looked at me, pointed at the title and said "Looks like you did fuck up today" and started laughing. He told me to get back to work and be careful next time and don't go on sites like this as he walked away. Still in shock that I dodged a bullet, I sat down at my desk and breathed a huge sigh of relief, thinking I'm never going onto reddit at work again. An hour passed, and guess what, I'm on reddit because reddit is love, reddit is life.

TL;DR Went to tifu at work, CEO saw it, laughed it off, dodged a bullet, still on reddit

**EDIT;** Woah, this blew up! Thank you for the Gold &lt;3 Looking at your replies, most of you saying to lock my computer when leaving my desk, good idea, next time ;)
And no, the CEO isn't any of you guys!... or is it... hey boss xD
