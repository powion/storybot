So I was at a popular mexican resturant named Cheekys and while I was there with some friends the conversation starting to get pretty stale since we had been there for about an hour or so. To get to the point, I decided to hop on tinder and look for some potential mates.

After a few minutes of swiping left and right I saw a questionable swipe and handed it over to one of my friends. Who immediately started to laugh and handed the phone back to me and said she was extremely ugly (She wasn't, he is just a douche). So im coming to an agreeance with his opinion I swiped left. Simple as that right? No.

Upon looking up, we see our waitress standing over us staring directly at my phone. It was then that we realized she was the exact same girl on tinder. I could see the pain in her eyes as she dropped the checks onto our table and went to the back of the resturant to presumably cry her eyes out. We didn't see her for the rest of the night and the manager came over to apologize to us that our waitress was feeling ill and couldn't finish helping us.

Feeling like total shitbags we managed to pool together $67.20 in tips to give her. Left a little note on the bottom that said "Hey, we are just dicks. You're actually really pretty :)" and left.

So yeah, today I fucked up by swiping left.
