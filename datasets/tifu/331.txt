So yeah, this one happened 30 minutes ago.

I just... I just don't even. Wow.

So, co-worker was asking how he could manage things on his home computer from work. As the IT, he thought I'd have a clever solution. I didn't. I told him just install Teamviewer and he can access his PC from anywhere. I use it to troubleshoot VPN issues from work, file transfering issues, etc. As well as just regular use.

So he was at my desk, I didn't think twice before offering a demonstration.

Load it up. Input password. it loads, no big deal.

Loud BDSM porn.

Not mine. Who's home? My wife. What happens when teamviewer connects? Little corner icon.

After a picosecond of hardcore bondage fucking and "Nooooo" from this little blonde girl, I panicked and hit 'ctrl+w', which just closed the tab of bdsm porn and leaving some schoolgirl hentai shit up.

I love my wife, and I love her porn and sexuality. I think it's super hot that she loves her porn. But today was not the day.

I closed the window, and just leaned back and said, "Well, I mean. You see it works."

He was both shocked and amused and left with just a "Yeah."

That's it.

And yeah, my wife definitely would have received the "thank you for using teamviewer" popup. So she knows I saw. I don't think I'm going to tell her about the co-worker part.

[Edit]: Oh, wait, best part. I share office space with a few other people. After the noise one of them sort of piped up a minute later and just said, "Uh... *"It guy"*, want to talk about something?"

Me: "Oh, you know. Popups."

Him: "Uh-huh..."
