Unlike most fu's this literally happened this morning. To make things clear I do smoke weed once in a while and have nothing against ADULTS smoking weed. So today the secondary school where I teach were holding a quranic recitation for eid celebrations. As a closeted atheist I had no choice but to volunteer in "gods work" as most of the teachers did too. I got info from the class snitch that two students have brought a megafuckton of weed to sell to "aid" celebrations. I got them and got the weed. As a drug enforcement agent wanna be i made them burn it all in class with everybody still inside. The coughs of a few students made me realized my collosal fu. I evacuated the class but by then most were mildly high. This being nigeria, nothing is going to come out of this, but i really did fucked up.
Edit: took a while but i've upvoted every single comment on this thread both positive and negative (except deragatory comments, fuck those guys). Long live karma!
