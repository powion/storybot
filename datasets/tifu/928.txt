First of all. I am sorry about my formatting. Complete newbie to Reddit. :(  
  
  
**Do not try this at work**: A lot of people commenting on how unprofessional my behaviour was at work and they are 100% right. That's why I posted this here. I have a very wild imagination and being sexually deprived and a huge fan of erotic fiction did not help my case at all. The reality of the situation was clear to me the second I arrived at work, but since I had gone that far I decided to go all the way.  My co-worker and I have a long history of crossing the line when it comes to flirting in the office. We are great friends and I hoped that we'd be something more after this... ooops.
  
A co-worker and I have been flirting something serious lately. We're both single and very attracted to each other so we have as much we possible can in our dead-time. We haven't taken things any further than that because we are both pretty busy in the evenings. I attend night-school he is a single dad, which makes him even hotter.
  
    
My TIFU begins with me trying do something a little naughty. No panties and dress that just barely covers my butt. I was a little nervous this morning and really had to hype myself up to do this so I was a little late to work. When I get to work, I see him sitting at his desk.  This guy sits at a desk directly opposite me. He smiles at me. I wink at him.  I sit down, spread my legs, and take a deep breath.  
    
  
I am about to send him a message on Facebook telling him to look under the desk... but this is when I hear the sound of a phone camera taking a snapshot. At first I think he's noticed and has sneakily taken a picture... so, I change my FB message to something like, "what are you going to do with that picture ;o" Right as I am about to hit send his 8 year old son stands up from the floor, hands him the phone, and says "dad, look!"  
My heart skipped several beats, and I am too scared to stop myself from accidentally hitting the send button.  I hear the Facebook messenger sound. He looks at the phone and looks at me with the, "what... the... hell..." kind of look. 
  
  
At this point I am terrified and on the brink of tears. I quickly stand up not realizing that my dress isn't covering my nether, and I am not wearing any panties. The guys jaw drops. I tug my dress down... and make a run for the bathroom.  
 
     
I've been in here for 20 minutes. Crying my eyes out. Too scared to go out. I have no idea how many people saw this, or what's going to happen next. :(

  
**TL;DR**: I flashed my co-workers 8 year old son and he took a picture of it. Might also have flashed the entire office.  
  
  
**Update**: His son did not snap a picture of my crotch. Something *much worse* happened. The son was just on the floor playing with his dad's phone. Took a selfie of himself making a silly face.  I assumed this was my co-worker taken a sneaky picture under the desk. My FB message kind of suggest that he should ad the picture to his spank bank. That's why he was so weirded out. Unfortunately, though, his son did see my nether when I stood up in a hurry.  Apparently he said, "dad, why is that lady not wearing any underpants". Out so loud that the entire office pretty much heard it. :(  So, this is much, much worse.  
  
  
**Update**: Co-worker took me home to get changed (was too sad to feel sexy). On the way back I explain why I wasn't wearing any panties. He blushed but couldn't really give me a decent t reply except for, "aww!" It was sincere though.  
  
When I get back to work my boss approaches me and tells me to meet him in his office as soon as possible. I am about to get fired I think. :(  
  
  
**Update**: I spent a good amount of time trying to find the perfect excuse as to why I wasn't wearing any panties at work. From "*I forgot to do my laundry*" all the way to "*didn't want to be late so I took the risk*", but, as it turned out, I didn't any.  He began with asking how I was feeling.  He was concerned that the ordeal had caused me traumatic stress. When I told him I was fine he then got a pretty serious look in his face and started telling me that I was not dressed professionally and that I should be more considerate to my fellow employees before deciding on my attire next time.  He acknowledged the fact that I had already changed and said what I was wearing now was suitable.  I was sooo relieved. I honestly thought I was going to get fired, because honestly, I would have fired myself (but then again I knew what my intentions were, he didn't). Just as I was about to leave, he said, "have you spoken to (the co-worker whose son I flashed)" and I only told him the half-truth by telling him that we briefly spoke, and completely left out the fact that he is now aware of my intentions and that he drove me home to change. He told me that I should apologise to him in person and ask if his son is okay.  
  
  
I send a message to my co-worker asking if I could apologise to him in person after work by buying him a drink, or two, or ten and paying for any therapy his son may need now or in the future.  :P  
  
  
**Update**: We're meeting up for drinks. :D  
  
  
**Update:**: Drinks went REALLY well. He said his son was quick to forget, or at least he didn't mention it again for the rest of the day. My mini-dress was just bunched up above crotch level but I was quick to pull it down so my kitty wasn't on display for long at all. My co-worker said that he didn't notice anything and had no idea what his son was commenting on. But, with all honesty, I think he was just being polite.  He has invited me over for dinner at his place on Saturday evening, and I am really looking forward to it! :)  
  
  
As for the mini-dress. It wasn't too short. It covered all the right parts, but the problem is that it takes very little to ride all the way back, and since I stood up so quickly it just went right up there and I didn't notice. Provided picture below for reference of dress.
