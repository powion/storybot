Sigh... this just happened about an hour ago. I just woke up and felt the urge to do my morning wee. I walked into the bathroom and as I did I noticed a rather large house spider lurking next to the toilet. Now, I don't have a *fear* of spiders per se, but once they get to the point that you can hear them thump on the floor when they fall off a surface I start getting a bit panicky.   This particular spider wasn't enormous, but it definitely wasn't small either. So, I sit down, whip out my phone to check if anybody had anything interesting to say on Facebook (no) and felt the sweet release of urination. Ah, bliss.   Now this is the part where everything went horribly wrong. I unrolled some toilet paper and folded it over, ready to wipe when - oops. I dropped it. Thinking fast I snatched It just as it hit the floor (yes the floor is clean) and brought it back up to wipe. Wait. What was that on the paper? Some fluff? A hairball? These are all the thoughts that were going through my head as I brought the paper ever closer to my lady parts when I should have been thinking "ABORT NOW, FOR THE LOVE OF CHRIST STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING". But no. The paper engaged. Then, as I was wiping I realised what had happened. In the split second it had touched the floor it had landed directly on the spider and it had hitched a ride to its urine soaked death.    I took the paper away and saw the spider sat directly on my vagina. The next part still baffles me now, but in between my scream and jumping off the seat I decided in my wisdom that I also needed to make sure this thing was dead. So I punched it. Yes, I rammed that fucker into my pussy as hard as I could. At this point I'm crying and trying in vain to wipe the spider corpse out of myself but I'm just smooshing it around. So I'm just covered in tears, snot, urine and spider guts and I haven't even had coffee yet. The half hour shower I took still hasn't made me feel clean and I can't even begin to explain to my husband what the hell happened.         Edit:  Thank you very much for the my first gold :) I didn't realise it was my cakeday too! And thank you to everyone for their comments, I feel much better now. Some quick answers to some questions I've been getting.. No the spider didn't go "inside" me when I hit it it was a term of phraae, however in the aftermath of wiping I can't be sure where any parts of it have ended up without putting a blowtorch down there which I'm not willing to do. (sorry for my lack of formatting I'm on reddit is fun and it doesn't seem to like page breaks?)
