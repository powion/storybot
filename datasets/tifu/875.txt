Happened a few days ago.

First date at a bar for drinks, felt a bit nervous so I got there a bit early and took a couple of shots and was half-way done with my beer when she showed up late.

Everything went great, she was funny and more importantly she thought I was funny.

After a few more drinks we're a bit tipsy, it's still early and she wants us to show up to her friend's party a couple of blocks from the bar.

So we're walking and chatting and then we notice a family getting out of a restaurant, and one of their children appears to be blind or visually impared, as he is wearing shades and has a companion dog.

My inebriated brain allows an unfiltered thought to be vocalized, something I read on reddit wondering how blind persons are able to tell if they wipe enough after going to the bathroom...

I know, I'm sorry but bear with me.

She laughs but she appears not to get it. That's when I should've changed subjects but I told her something along the lines of "*well if he can't look at the toilet paper, how can he tell if he's wiped enough?*"

Her reaction really threw me off-guard: "*eww what the fuck, what do you mean - do you look at your toilet paper after wiping*?" with an utter look of disgust on her face.


I told her that I assume most people do, once again how else would they know if they're good to go.


She tells me angrily that she's never heard of such a disgusting thing before and that she assumes most people just know when the job's done, they feel it.

We had stopped walking and she was putting me on the spot, I could see that she was waiting for me to say something and to wipe the look of shock and disgust I had off my face.


That's when I fucked up. My drunken state suggested the only option was to attempt a funny and flirtatious remark in order to get back to the good vibes we had up until now.


So I said with a smile and flirty confidence "*Don't worry babe I know you're clean, I'm sure if I were to run a sheet of TP inbetween your cheeks there would be no skidmark!*"


She slapped me, called me a creepy disgusting piece of shit pervert and took of.

I don't date often, and was devastated.

At least I laugh about it now - after I told him the story a friend just said "dirty-ass bitches man".
