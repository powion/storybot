You know those little things your parents told you as a child that you always just took as truth because they never got questioned? Well one bit me in the ass yesterday. 

I am studying abroad in Paris this year. It's already been a semester and I am having the time of my life. I have been trying to learn and practice my French while I am here because, well when in Rome...

Anyways I was feeling a little homesick the other day, missing my parents but my mom especially. Then a great idea hit me. She always used to make me this French dish for breakfast when I was young. It was basically an egg on toast. I think it's a pretty common thing? Well she always called it "mer-dwa-so" which I always just assumed meant "egg on toast" or some shit in French. Maybe I just assumed that was the name of the dish, like it didn't translate to anything. I guess I never really thought about it at all. Big mistake. 

I figured to myself "hell this must be a French dish, and it will remind me of home. I'm going to go order it."

So I went into a little café around from where I am staying and I went up to the lady, and in French asked her if they had any mer-dwa-so

You should have seen the look on her face. She basically just stared at me in disbelief and said what?

So I repeated it. 3 times. Until I realized that I was saying "merde d'oiseaux" which is literally bird shit. 

I left with no egg and toast. I called my mom and she explained to me, In-between fits of laughter, that they made that name up because it kind of looks like bird poop, spattered on a windshield (the toast). She said they translated it to French because it "sounded fancier and because you can't say "bird shit" to a child every day."

Thanks mom. That's one less café I can show my face in.
