I feel like a fucking idiot. Something something didn't happen today.

Me and my girlfriend browse Reddit all the time. We read the r/TIFU front page almost every night before we doze off. Thank for giving us hours of entertainment, r/TIFU.

Anyway, a couple of nights ago, I cooked a fucking AMAZING dinner for my girlfriend. You should've seen this shit. Fried shrimp that I spiced myself with all of her favorite ingredients. Garlic, pepper, lemon, and I even seeded a couple of jalapenos and threw the fresh seeds in to make them extra spicy, just like we both love. Throw in some homemade sweet potato fries, and a spinich salad, and I've made the most delicious and sexiest dinner ever. If I was a white girl I would've Instagrammed that shit.

We ate together and she's telling me how much she loved the food. She kept commenting during the meal that it was amazing. I was fucking proud of myself. I've made some pretty decent meals in the past, but this one was fucking epic.

Fast forward a couple hours, and me and my girlfriend climb into bed. Once there, sexy times commence. We're both really into it. After some rough and tumble, I finish and it's my turn to pleasure her. So, without hesitation, I start fingering her. She's moaning and enjoying it for a few moments... until she utters the words I never thought I'd ever be scared to hear:

*"Do you still have jalapeno juice on your fingers?"*

Ten seconds later, she's running out of bed, and jumping into a cold bath. I hung my head in shame and embarrassment.

I read a story exactly like this among the top of all time on this page... I should've known. I know it's a story you all have probably read before, but in the moment I felt like I fucked up royally (and ironically) enough to warrant a post. Not to mention, my girlfriend said when she climbed out of the tub, *"Haven't you read enough TIFU to know better!?"*

TL;DR: Made an awesome dinner for the gf, fingered her with spicy hands and might as well have shoved a jalapeno in her clam.

EDIT: Thanks for all the help amd advice, guys. Now I have plenty have things to put in my girlfriend's vagina when this happens again.

I'm getting a lot of questions and confusion, so here's a little FAQ...

&gt; 1) Why didnt you wash your hands, you sick fuck!?

A: I did. Once, after eating the meal, but not very well. Although some people have commented that washing your hands doesn't help in the first place. Go figure.

&gt; 2) "Sexy times"? Do you really say that shit to your girlfriend, you neckbeard??

A: Yeah, I do.

&gt; 3) You finished first??? UGH, you're an asshole.

A: Yeah, she was on top, and I finished before she did. Not like I wasn't planning on helping her finish... hence the touching.

&gt; 4) Did she really say that when she came out of the bathroom? Did this really happen?

A: Yep.

&gt; 5) What's the recipe?

A: 1 lemon's worth of juice... 4 cloves of garlic... 1 Tbsp of black pepper... 1/2 tbsp of thyme... 1/2 tbsp of oregano... 2 jalapeno's worth of seeds... salt to taste. Saute shrimp in a pan with butter and olive oil.

EDIT 2:

* Well, now my top post ever is this FU. Looks like we'll never really forget this happened. Thanks everyone.
* TIL No one reads the entire post. I still have people saying the same shit over and over when I included extra details in the first edit. Sigh.
* Also formatting.
