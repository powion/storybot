so, this happened about 8 or 9 days ago, and this has really fucked up my head. i go on theync and liveleak and shit, so i thought i was pretty desensitized, but my buddy, let's call him...brock?(yeah, brock) proved that was a load of bull right there.

any who, he called me up asking me to look at his lappytop right? so i take it home and do. lots of porn viruses and the usual shit, so i clear it and clean it. then, like any good person i started looking through his history, his files, music all of that. 

then i find this series of folders in folders "neat, something really embarrassing" so i venture forth to stare into the abyss. oh god it stared back, and i blinked hard

inside this folder is a collection of really distressing videos. i watched a few and found out my buddy's a pedophile who downloads.....

i had a nervous breakdown a few days ago when a neighbors kid started crying on the sidewalk outside my house reminded me of one of the videos' audio. i haven't eaten in days and sleep is little and far between. i needed to say this somewhere before i go fucking mad

EDIT: i have reported him, he's been hauled off, but....i can't unsee that shit

additionally turns out it was over 14 gigs in his "collection" on seperate thumb drives, and this guy was in my home
