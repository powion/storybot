Over the thanksgiving break, my mom wanted to go to a comedy club with me. On the way there we talked about the classes I was planning to take next semester, and I mentioned that I was taking Yoga (since my degree required one Fitness &amp; Nutrition course).

Ten minutes into his comedy set, the comedian does a bit about how every man has tried to blow themselves but most guys aren't flexible enough to do it. And then he said "ladies, if your man decides he wants to take Yoga, now you know why." My mom loses it, screaming laughter, and hits me repeatedly like she wants my attention. I know what she's trying to reference. I refuse to look her in the eye.

No, I did not decide to take Yoga because I want to blow myself. But now mom will NOT. LET. THIS. GO.

She wanted to see a movie, at first. We shoulda seen a movie.
