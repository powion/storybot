So I'd been dating this girl for about 3 months, most Saturdays she would stay over but leave on the Sunday morning as Sunday was 'gaming Sundays' (I know I'm very cool) she was always pretty cool with it and didn't mind.

She stayed over, everything was normal the morning came and she left. Before I settled into my gaming session I checked Facebook first. The first thing to pop up was people wishing her happy birthday. Yep. It was her birthday and I'd sent her home so I could play video games. I've never apologised so much in my entire life.

TLDR; I wasn't aware it was my girlfriends birthday, sent her home so I could play games.


EDIT: Thanks for the gold stranger i'm glad you liked my tale

EDIT: People are getting pretty mad about this... I saw my gf usually about 3-5 days a week, what's wrong with 1 day a week for me?

EDIT: Because so many people are asking i'm 21
