Okay so this just happened. Big snow fall, rushing to get to work but have to shovel my half of the driveway. I rush into the shed to get a shovel (first time this year). It's dark. I reach to grab the shovel and WHAM, I step on the propped up rake and take the handle in the chin. I curse the rake, swear profusely and grab the shovel. I start to shovel, but realize I grabbed the one with the rusty metal blade at the end. Not right. I run back into the shed to grab the right one and WHAM, this time I take the handle in the teeth. Now drinking coffee hurts. Happy snowy Tuesday everyone...
