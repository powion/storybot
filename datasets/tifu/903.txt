Backstory:  My husband and I play a silly game while scrolling through the T.V. channels; the first one to yell "¡Sí!" when we come across a Spanish language station wins.

Well, tonight we went out to dinner and I enjoyed a couple of glasses of wine with my meal.  I was in a silly, giggly mood as we walked back to the car and passed by a homeless man muttering to himself in Spanish.  Instinctively, I yelled, "¡Sí!"  This lascivious smile spread across his face and he started spouting off rapid-fire Spanish and heading straight for me.  

My husband yelled at the guy to back the fuck off, yelled at me to get the fuck in the car, and peeled out of there as fast as he could.

My Spanish is pretty much limited to "sí" and "yo quiero Taco Bell", so I had no idea what he'd said until my husband told me that the guy had asked if I'd suck his dick and I'd responded with an enthusiastic yes.

We're home now.  My husband is still mad at me and I can't stop giggling.
