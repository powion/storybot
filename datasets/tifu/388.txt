So, I find this Toyota pickup on CL that I want to look at, but it's a couple hours away in Nashville. Normally, I would go by myself, but my wife's gotta work so I take my 8 YO son with me. I've got a trailer and the cash in case I decide to buy it. Seller wants to meet in a public place, Walmart. I text him when we get there and he replies that he'll be there in a couple minutes. Guy shows up and I start looking the truck over. I walk around it, get on the ground and check the U joints, and when I stand up the cops are there. Seems that somebody assumed that just because a man and a boy were in a vehicle alone in the middle of a Walmart parking lot, they're having sex.

Unbelievable. I'm coming to realize, I can't go anywhere alone with my son for fear of what others will do. I don't like this place anymore.

Edit: one of my many thoughts on the way home was the provocation for this. Was I victim to something akin to swatting? Could someone have called the cops and reported this knowing full well that nothing was going on, just for kicks?
