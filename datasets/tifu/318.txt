Last night, I was on the bus coming home from visiting a friend in a nearby town, and I fell asleep. So I start dreaming about her, and before I know it, it turns sexual. A slow, lustrous tension builds up as, in my dream, I slowly slide my hand up her naked thigh. The second I reach her privates, all the muscles in my body release in a wonderful spasm of ecstasy.

It's enough to wake me up. Of course, with a sinking stomach, I realize instantly what is happening; My dick is happily pumping cum into my underwear like it's waving freely in an open field. Except I'm sitting in the window seat on a fully packed bus with two hours left to go, and the bathroom is out of order. To my horror, as I'm contemplating my pitiful existence, I feel the cum start to slide into the crack of my ass. There's no way to move to make it better. Water finds the fastest, most efficient route to succumb to gravity, and any way I move gets my cum deeper into my ass. 

If that wasn't bad enough, by the time I eventually got to a bathroom, it had crusted most of my ass hairs together. Pulling my cheeks apart has never been more painful - both physically and emotionally. I cried all kinds of tears last night.

TL;DR: I had a wet dream and came in my own ass.
