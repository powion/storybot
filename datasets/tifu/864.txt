It wasn't today, but valentines day I'm out shopping long stem roses for the missus, and my three little girls. I'm aiming for Dad of the year, so I know that each rose needs to be completely unique (heaven forbid sisters get the same rose), which leads me to selecting 4 unique roses. If you are one for style (which I am), the colors were very mismatched and did not work well together, which doesn't matter, since they will be passed out individually. However, as I'm checking out, I gave the appearance of someone trying to get creative (and failing) at making a bouquet. I was very self-conscious of this, and it must have shown, as a sweet old lady came up to me and reassuringly said, "Those are beautiful, she's going to love them."

Heaven forbid I allow a stranger to think I have poor taste, and I always love a good opportunity to talk about my daughters, so I replied,

"Well, each rose is for a different girl."

I expected an "ah, how sweet" response, but all I got was a displeased look from her and the cashier who overheard laughing. I left feeling very perplexed, until it hit me, I never specified the girls were my daughters.
