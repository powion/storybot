EDIT: Obligatory "this didn't happen today", it happened last night. Close enough.

So I came home from work yesterday, ate dinner, and went on Reddit. I checked the subs I normally do, like NoSleep, AskReddit, Jokes, stuff like that. Usually I save TIFU for last because it's the most entertaining.

I started reading all of the TIFU's. After the front page was exhausted, I looked at "new". [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2wtnj7/tifu_by_forwarding_this_message_to_my_entire/) popped up and I clicked on the link in the text post. In case you guys don't know, the link contains an image of a black dude with a gigantic dick.

Right at this moment, my dad just chooses to walk by (I'm 16, by the way). He saw the image of the black dude. After this, he went into his room and didn't come out for a while. Later, he gave me this talk.

"Look, it's okay if you're gay. You didn't have to try to close the window when I walked by. I support you 100 percent, but try not to look at porn all the time, okay?"

Thanks, Reddit.

EDIT: Holy shit, this got big. No pun intended.
