I had just gotten back from the gym and decided that a shower would be pertinent. Soon after the shower began, I got a little horny. The showerhead and I are *intimate* friends. I set it to pulse, lay on my back on the tub floor, and reintroduced my clitoris to her watery lover. As I got close, I decided that if the water were just a tad hotter, it would significantly improve my orgasm. Being on the edge of cumming, and thus disinclined to sit up and turn the temperature knob a little warmer, I decided to use my foot. Predictably, my foot slipped and I sent the water temperature from warm to thermal vent. I now have  an icepack between my legs.

TLDR; I wanted to cum, got cooked instead.
