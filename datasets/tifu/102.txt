I'll try to make this quick.

Basically, I met this girl from Tinder at a bar last night. We had great chemistry and ended up staying at the bar until close. During the date, I asked if she had met up with other guys from Tinder and how those previous dates went. She explained how during her last Tinder date, after a couple of drinks the guy asked her to come back to his apartment. She said no, she wasn't like that. The guy then proceeded to convince her that "that's not how Tinder dates work". Long story short, she ended up leaving and didn't talk to him again.

Now, I found this hilarious so throughout the rest of the night anytime she said no to any of my questions, I would respond with "**But that's not how Tinder dates work.**"

Me: "You should buy me a drink?" Her: "You should be buying ME a drink!" Me: "But that's not how Tinder dates work."

Me: "Want to play pool?" Her: "No, I'm not very good." Me: "But that's not how Tinder dates work."

Me: "Want to take another shot?" Her: "No, I have work tomorrow." Me: "But that's not how Tinder dates work."

You get the idea. Anyways, we both found this to be very funny and an easy way to lighten the conversation. It was all in good fun.

So here's the fuck up part: At the end of the night, somehow we ended up going back to my place and getting in bed together. After some kissing play, she took off my pants and started sucking my dick. After a minute of this, I couldn't resists myself and in one of my creepiest voices, I said "**Now this is how Tinder dates work.**"

At first she started with somewhat loud dick-in-the-mouth nervous laughter. But then she stopped and couldn't believe what I just said. And then it had killed the mood so much that she ended up putting her top back on and decided to quickly leave. Leaving me laying in bed, naked, with a semi-hard, thinking about how badly I just fucked that up.
