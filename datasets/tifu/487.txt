So today I was talking to this girl I like. And was trying my hand at flirting. It was going pretty well, and I said "I'm sure you make all guys feel this way." She got pretty defensive after that and told me I made her feel like a slut. Anyways, the conversation went back to normal, and then she said 'Say "you're not a slut", you bitch'. 

At that point, my brain stopped working, and I did not even see/comprehend the not in her sentence, and replied back to her "You're not just any slut. You're my slut."

Haven't heard back since...
GG get rekt.

Edit 1:
Holy fuck this blew up!
Well I guess I am pretty retarded hahaha. 
"Slut" texted me a couple hours after the incident and all order has been restored.
I'm glad I could entertain you guys with my stupidity this weekend.
