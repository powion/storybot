So I was back in my home town and  my wife and I went to a nice seafood restaurant with some old friends of mine from high school, and some of their parents.  On the way out of the place, we were all headed through the lobby which narrowed to a hall that was only wide enough for  two people to walk shoulder to shoulder at best.  An older couple was coming in so we stepped out of the way to let them pass.  As we were standing there I gave my wife a loving pat on the ass.  I immediately heard "wrong ass" .  One of the girls that came with us, an old girlfriend from school, had somehow switched places with my wife.  What made it worse was it was her husband and her parents were all there.  They had quite a good laugh at my expense while I turned as red as the lobster I had for dinner.  Fuck.  I'll never hear the end of this.
