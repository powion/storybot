I'm a housecarl for a certain well-known person, who I shall refer to as 'the dragonborn' to protect his identity. The dragonborn often has me following him around to assist in his various adventures.

Today was a day no different from any other day. He and I had just killed our third dragon that week and we were just about to head inside a cave to the South of Solitude. He decides he wants to train two-handed so he gives me his unique weapon, Chillrend before pulling a daedric greatsword out of his ass. We go in the cave and proceed. It was a typical ruin but we got through it quicker because I was using his sword. Everything is all well and fine until we get to the boss room. I pull out Chillrend and start charging towards this draugr overlord.

The draugr surprised me - as I went towards it it shouted at me, and Chillrend goes flying out of my hands. No problem, I still have an ebony sword that he never got around to selling so I decide to use that instead. We manage to take it down, the dragonborn loots the chests and we leave, continuing as normal.

Fast forward two days later. We've just cleared a bandit camp and the dragonborn says "actually, I need to go back to one-handed weapons now. I'm taking Chillrend back.

Chilldrend. Oh shit! It's still in that cave! I start panicing and suddenly he starts cursing at me, saying "What the fuck happened to my sword?" and "This game is so fucking glitchy" 

Next thing I know, we're in the courtyard of the College of Winterhold and we start going down the bridge. He tells me to wait and moves back a bit. I suddenly hear "FUS RO DAH" and I go tumbling off the bridge, falling into the sea. I don't know where he went afterwards. He told me to wait, though, so I can't move. It's very cold down here. If you're reading this, please send sweetrolls.
