I haven't played soccer in years, but some of my buddies were
playing one morning so I joined up with them. After a few minutes of kicking the ball around
I'm standing near the mid-field line, maybe 40-50 yards from the goal, and the guy
playing goalie shouts to me, "Hey, 100 bucks if you can score on me from there!". I
played a lot of soccer in my younger years, so I know it's within my range. He was playing way
off the line so I just had to get it over his head. So I start taking my steps to the ball,
then put all my effort into kicking the ball as hard as I could. As soon as I strike the ball,
I yell "FUCK!!!" in excruciating pain, open my eyes, and realize I was still in my bed, dreaming.
I had kicked the wall barefoot with full force in my sleep; pretty sure I broke two toes. 
Never did find out if I won that 100 bucks. 

**TL;DR:** Don't trust a goalie early in the morning.
