It never really made sense why over the course of three years I never got one comment or upvote/downvote for all of my posts. Reddit is an absolutely huge site, but after a couple years you begin to have your doubts. I decided to check to see if I could see my posts in an incognito browser and saw that none of my posts existed. What the fuck?! It was at that moment I realized that from my first post I was shadow banned and all of my contributions over three years never was viewed by a soul. I can't fucking believe I never caught onto it sooner. I've had my hand raised for three years and no one could ever see me and I never questioned it.

*check my post history to see the barren world.
