My best friend was sent home from school because she had an upset stomach. I went over her house today to see how she was doing. She still wasn't feeling good, but I stuck around and chatted with her for a few hours since both of her parents were at still work. 

When I was leaving, I gave her a big hug and said that I hope she feels better. As soon as I did, she simultaneously projectile vomited down my back and had explosive diarrhea in her pants. She backed away from me before I could react, tripped over the rug, and split her head open on a table. Blood was everywhere, I'm covered in puke, and there is shit in her pants. Great.

I carried her to my car and raced to the hospital. I called her parents and told them what happened also. She needed 20 stitches in her head and a change of clothes. TIFU
