Today, well early AM, I fucked up and got super wasted and tried to search for my bf's ex on fb, but when I typed in her name, nothing came up. I searched over and over and nothing. This evening, I see that I had posted her name all over my wall. Kill me.

edit. I'm a dude from Canada who likes to tell stories :) 

edit 2. You all are so amazing, thanks for the love.
