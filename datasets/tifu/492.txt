I'll make this very short. Being the cool dude I am, I try my best to entertain my brother with autism. One thing he really enjoys is me reading TIFU's to him or other threads but his favorite thing are the comments. He looooves the comments. So.. If most of you haven't caught on by now, loads of people have realized that when in an awkward situation, peeing everywhere asserts dominance and makes you alpha as fuck. Well. Today my brother, while in school was scalded for not listening to his teacher who repeatedly told him to stop breaking the graphite off his pencil so he could just sharpen it again. He casually said, 'I'm the dominant person Mr. Jacobs,' dropped his drawers and urinated all down the cabinets and onto stacks of graded tests and medical forms for an upcoming field trip. Immediately blames me for teaching him how to be 'alpha,' and I get my lunch breaks taken away from me for 2 weeks. FML. 

EDIT: let's clear some stuff up. 
-My brother is actually a very smart kid, just he doesn't understand certain concepts. He thinks very differently than the normal person. 
-I mean that I lost the ability to eat with all my mates in the cafeteria and I eat it in the detention room.
-I got in trouble because, 'I was training him to blatantly disobey.' ....no way dick, 1.5+ thousand people agree with me that pissing on your papers is in fact a boss ass move and he deserves to be alpha male. I can read what I want to my brother. 
-My dad laughed so hard when I explained the situation to him and agrees that X is the man
