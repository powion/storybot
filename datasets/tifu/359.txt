I'm just getting home now and want to share this pretty mild but utterly stupid fuckup with you.

On my way over here I drove up to a red traffic light. Since I wanted to make a right turn, I lined up in the rightmost lane behind 4 or 5 cars.

As the light goes green and nobody moves, I begin to boil a little. Although I'm pretty sure everybody zones out and starts daydreaming in traffic at least once in his life, I can't stand if that happens in front of me and costs me precious seconds I could spend doing things I like better than waiting.

And as much as I hate this, I love to put people in their place for it. So obviously I made sure absolutely everybody around me got to hear my horn and the pretty admirable tirade of only the finest slurs and insults my vocabulary has to offer.

A few seconds later, when still nothing happened, it hit me: the cars in front of me were parked -.-
