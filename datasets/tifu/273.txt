A few weeks ago, my cousin was driving behind a Ford Galaxy on a rural road. As the cars went over a bump, something fell from the wheel well of the car in front of her. She slammed on her brakes and got out of the car to see it was a tiny orange kitten! (She never could find the owners, and we assume he was a feral cat)

Because I just had to put down my 17 year old orange cat, she decided to let me have the kitten, which we appropriately named 'Galaxy', due to his origin story. 

Fast forward a couple of weeks. I just bought a Samsung Note 4. Ever since I got the phone, it has been doing weird things. Namely, the voice recognizer will randomly turn on and search for things while I am casually browsing reddit. I couldn't figure out why, and the staff at the store was of no help.

A few minutes ago, my kitten jumped on my lap while I was browsing twitter. So I said "oh hi, Galaxy, silly kitty!" Then my phone started a Google search for "silly kitty". ("Hi, Galaxy" is the phrase to start voice searches on samsung phones)

This is going to get very old, very quickly.
