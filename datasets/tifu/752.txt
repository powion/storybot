So pretty much every post I submit here is related to my vagina . . . We fuck up a lot.

My family owns a property in the city, and I texted them all stating that I would be spending 2 days there alone just to relax, do some reading, walk around, etc.

The detachable shower head at home has been broken for a few months, so when I realized that the apartment had one I wept with joy.

My Dad works in the city, and has a key to the apartment . . . I figured that since I told them all I was having a mini-getaway, no one would come bother me. WRONG.

I'm in the shower blasting ole reliable at the goods, while letting out mini moans. I orgasm as I moan deeper.

I wash up, grab a towel (thank god) only to leave the bathroom to find my Dad sitting on the couch with lunch for us as a surprise.

I have a mild heart attack as my face burns red. He said nothing, but his face said it all. There is no way he didn't hear me.

Damn you, Dad, why do you have to be so goddamn considerate?!
