So, this happened Wednesday night in class..

I have been casually seeing a guy a few nights a week. He asked me the other day if i had any toys and if i did, the next time i came to his place i should definitely bring one. I thought it would be fun and what could go wrong?

As I'm getting ready to leave for school i throw it into my purse (first mistake). Now keep in mind, this is an older one, from like 2002.... You barely have to turn the end to get it to come on. I had every intention of leaving it in my car. But alas, i did not. I get into class and throw my purse into my chair and exit back out to grab something to drink. Get back into class and i hear a weird sound. My first thought was that it had to be all the routers and switches we've set up recently. If you're wondering I'm in a computer class and we set up an internal network of 8 Cisco routers and switches. I Don't remember them sounding like this, but maybe today I'm just noticing it more. I grab my purse from my chair and then it hit me. My purse is the source of the sound. FUCK FUCK FUCK. This vibrator is anything but quiet as is, and amplify it with $20 in change and car keys. I start digging through my purse in a frenzied panic, trying to get it turned off before anyone noticed, but it was too late for that. The guys in the class give me this look, like they know what it is, but they're still curious if it is what they think it is. Also, I'm sure me digging through my purse like a crazed lunatic only gave me away.

TL;DR - Today i fucked up my bringing my old vibrator to class, it turned on when i threw my purse into my chair. The sound was amplified by change and I'm sure everyone knew what it was.
