So sometimes when I show friends or people how you can request money over Google Wallet, I'll send a request for a few thousand bucks to close friends with a note saying something like "for my ransom" or "need crack". They know whats up, they read it, chuckle and reject the request, it's all good. 

Except today I got this [email](http://i.imgur.com/4rm3YVC.png) from Google...
