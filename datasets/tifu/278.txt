I'm a middle school teacher, and apparently I have a high number of aspiring basketball players in my classes. There's always one or two students in every period who insist on "shooting" their trash into the garbage. Daily. They also insist on missing...daily. 

Of course, unless they are prompted, they don't pick up said garbage when it lands outside of the can. Due to this, I've gotten pretty good at throwing down a stern "You need to pick that up. **Now.**" phrase in the blink of an eye. 


Teaching a lesson across the room? Bam! 

Breaking up a fight between other students? Bam!

No trash goes unnoticed.


So today I'm walking into the grocery store and pass two men off to my side. Immediately my brain registers the motion of the jump shot and a paper bag landing far away from the trash can. 


Teacher brain kicks in and I look at them very sternly and say "You need to pick that up. **Now.**" 

Almost immediately upon saying this my brain realizes I am not in class, these are not my students, and those men were not about to simply leave their trash on the sidewalk. 

Too late. 

Now, to add insult to injury, I am a pretty young teacher who typically appears to be in her teens while donning day clothes, as I was. These men were probably 10+ years my senior.

One of the men quietly mumbled sorry while looking at the ground. The other, somewhat frantically apologetic, explains that he was just about to pick it up and *really really* wasn't going to just leave it there. He promised. 

In the midst of my embarrassment and lack of a good explanation for their sudden scolding, I just said "good." and continued into the store. 


TL;DR: I scolded grown men outside the grocery store because they reminded me of my Bobcat-esque middle school students.  

*Edit:* wowzers! I'll try to respond more later today. 

Since a couple people have inquired: I don't mind the shooting of the trash. It's the missing and leaving garbage on the floor that I don't allow. We actually have a little score card going on the board for when they make a shot. The points are irrelevant and don't really do anything, but they haven't seemed to catch on to that yet. 

Edit 2: I finally understand RIP inbox. Also, death threats? Seriously?! Ya'll need a chill pill. Or detention. ;)

Gold??? That's awesome :D
