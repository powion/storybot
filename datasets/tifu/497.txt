My parents are from South Korea, but I was born in the United States. Last week, I got to visit my native land for the first time. My grandmother (who still lives there with other family) thought that, at age 16, I was loooong overdue to see where I came from. She’s always encouraging me to get in touch with my roots, because I’m sadly what *King of the Hill* calls a "banana." (Yellow on the outside, white inside.) She took us out and encouraged us to eat a lot of South Korean foods I’d never tried. Some were delicious, others I pretended to like as they secretly repulsed my Americanized palate.

One dish that especially turned my stomach was the sannakji, a whole tiny octopus, legs cut off and served ALIVE. Not wanting to upset grandmother, I gave it a try. It was kind of bland, but not horrible. Wait, no, here came one little surprise for me: The legs may have been severed, but they can still ATTACK! The suction cups grabbed hold of my cheeks like there was no tomorrow, and I would’ve choked if my father hadn’t reached in my mouth and yanked the things out. Thank god it didn’t get all the way into my throat.

The dangers of this dish are apparently well known, with people being encouraged to chew it thoroughly, but a dumb American girl like me was totally ignorant to this. An internet search tells me that six people a year die from eating sannakji. There’s a warning label on my shampoo, but not on this thing??

Let me just say, as a young Asian woman, I did NOT want to be remembered for getting killed by a tentacle monster.
