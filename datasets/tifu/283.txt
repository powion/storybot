I work as a loans officer in a rural branch of a small Canadian bank.
 
Sorry for your suddenly-sodden panties, ladies. 

Definitely not my dream career as a kid – the Fisher Price Banking Is Fun! playset is not a big seller – but when I lost my job selling computers in my early 20s I got this job and it stuck like soiled underwear. I’m okay at it and I’m a well-liked mentor to many of the staff, but I’m definitely a goofy round peg in a humourless square hole which is what ultimately led to my WTF shitstorm.

If I have to work in an office I’m gonna have a bit of fun. I love ThinkGeek. In my office I have a [Conan the Barbarian letter opener](http://i.imgur.com/xwQpqAjh.jpg), a [Salvador Dali melting clock](http://i.imgur.com/hG0OT5q.jpg) and a [magnetic levitating world globe](http://i.imgur.com/rm1luHbh.jpg) among other things purchased there, and as fate would have it this past Christmas in my stocking I discovered that my kids bought me an [Annoy-a-Tron](http://i.imgur.com/vfO4Usi.jpg). It’s a small device that makes maddeningly short, faint noises at totally random intervals and can run for 3 months on a watch battery, designed to be hidden to drive someone harmlessly bonkers. Here’s the description [from ThinkGeek’s site:](http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/b278/?pfm=Search&amp;t=the%20thinkgeek%20annoy-a-tron%202.0)

*“The Annoy-a-tron will do its part to drive your co-workers slowly mad with its short and seemingly random beeps. And when someone does locate the Annoy-a-tron, they're not going to know what it is - which is almost as much fun as watching them search for it. Muahaha...”*

And hilarity will ensue!

Right?

As it turns out, much less than zero.

I came in early on a Monday and placed it behind a metal poster frame hanging on the wall in the office of one of my co-workers. I flipped the ON switch and went blithely about my day, waiting for a reaction and to share a few chuckles.

Monday came and went. Nothing.

Tuesday, nothing.

Wednesday and Thursday, not a peep. At that point I figured it was broken. Frankly, I kinda forgot about it. I had Friday off and I suppose I would’ve checked it when I got back the following week.

Monday comes, lurching out of the weekend like a reanimated corpse. As soon as everyone arrives, the manager calls all 16 of us into her office for an unscheduled conference call. I end up standing at the back of the group near the office door. She dials in and our district VP announces herself through the little speaker. I stifle a yawn. The VP then introduces our company’s head of security. My brow furrows. This is unusual.

“By now,” the VP says, “some of you know about the device that was found at your branch last week.”

*Device? What the hell? What kind of device could they possibly be talking--* 

*Oh holy Jesus fuck nuggets.*

“When it was found it on Thursday nobody knew what it was, so it was brought to the branch manager, who then sent pictures of the device to me—“

*Fuck.*

“—and I forwarded the images to our head of security. He couldn’t identify it but guessed it might be a listening device so he sent the pictures to the RCMP corporate crimes division—“

*Oh fuck me.*

“—as well as the Canadian Security Intelligence Services in Ottawa. They suspected it could potentially be a bomb—“

*Fuckity grand fucking canyon of fuck.*

“—so we closed the branch, told all staff to stay home and hired a team of investigators to search every square inch of the building over the weekend for any additional devices.”

If I had sat down ahead of time to brainstorm a worst-case scenario, I wouldn’t have even come close to this epic corporate craptastrophe.
I had no choice. I took a shaky breath, steeled my nerve, clenched my ass cheeks tight and tried to say “Excuse me” but choked out a pubescent squeak instead. I cleared my throat, interrupted the conference call in that stuffy room full of my coworkers and spoke up, telling them it’s a harmless noisemaker, taking responsibility and apologizing profusely.

The room was dead quiet. The VP slowly says thank you for speaking up, they’ll stop the investigation, and the call ends. Everyone files out. I ask the manager if she wants me to stay, but she says she can’t talk to me right now. She doesn’t talk to me for three weeks. 

I found out later that she was in her car with the device on the passenger seat when she got the call that it might be a bomb. She apparently burst into tears and nearly drove into a ditch.

The district VP threw a fit and despite my 17-year unblemished work record she tried really, really hard to have me fired. Ultimately a senior executive in the company understood my benign intent and overruled her. Luckily they didn’t charge me the $50,000+ in lost business, staff wages and other miscellaneous costs.

No, I don’t know why my manager didn’t just ASK HER STAFF IF ANYONE KNEW ABOUT IT INSTEAD OF SENDING A FUCKING URGENT MEMO TO THE ENTIRE FUCKING UNIVERSE. My office is full of a lot of things but common sense isn’t one of them.

**tl;dr: ThinkGeek + corporate zombies = fail.**

**EDIT:**
So *this* is what it's like to be the bottom in an upvoted Reddit relationship. My god... it's full of *stars*. 

Some clarifications:

* I don't work for ThinkGeek. I doubt they'd be allowed to use the term "suddenly-sodden panties" in their attempts at viral marketing.
* My post is as accurate as I remember (it happened a few months ago). I can only relate what was told to us during the conference call about the theories about the device and the involvement of the authorities, but I can't and wont verify if that's what they actually did. I'm not going to poke that particular dog with a pointy stick.
* Although my post focuses on my frustration about the overreaction to my prank, there's a reason I posted this in TIFU after I found out this subreddit exists. 'Cause I fucked up. As I mentioned somewhere in the comment deluge below, had I given a modicum of thought to the type of risk-adverse industry I work in, I never would've placed the Annoy-a-Tron at my work at all. There would've been no overreaction to have if I hadn't done this to begin with. And my office pranking days are dead and buried - my wife will make damn sure of that. If I even *think* about trying something like this again, my wife will shove an Annoy-a-Tron so far up my ass that I'd have Daft Punk vocoder farts.
