I was Christmas shopping with my wife(I'm 32 years old) and she decided to go to Ross. For those of you who don't know, Ross is mostly a clothing store. She was going to buy some clothes, so I decided to wait for her outside the changing rooms on some chairs they had. While I waited, I was playing Pokemon Heart Gold. I had just beaten the 2nd gym, and was looking for the HM Cut when this little kid, who couldn't have been older than 8 or 9, sat down next to me with his DS. He asked me "What Pokemon game are you playing?" And I told him Heart Gold. He then pops out the game in his DS and puts in a copy of Soul Silver.

I could see where this was going. I then playful exclaimed "I challenge you to a Pokemon battle!" and I started heading back to a Pokemon Center so I could battle him. This is where the fuck up happens.

I always nickname my Pokemon really dumb nicknames. For example, my Quilava's name is "KidFucker" and my Pidgey's name is "PenisPump". Right when we started the battle, I asked if we could restart, because I just noticed the name. Of course, his mom walks to him and looks at his DS and then looks at me in horror. She then starts yelling at me and causing a scene. I tried to calm her down but she was threatening to call the police.

Needless to say, I head out to the car and waited for my wife to finish shopping.
