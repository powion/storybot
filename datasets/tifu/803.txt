I occasionally have weird hallucinations/dreams/sleep walk events. Usually these sleep-events are based on something relevant in my life at the time. For example, when I used to work at Starbucks, a few times I got up in the middle of the night and walked around the bed moving my arms and hands as if I was at the coffee bar making drinks.

My wife is a light sleeper and always wakes up when I start my dream-walks. She used to yell at me to snap out of the dreams but over time, she has grown accustomed to it and basically ignores it now.

Last night, I watched the Tron remake.

And then, I got up in the middle of the night, picked up my iPad air and threw it really hard like a frisbee. Ran after it. Picked it up and threw it at the window in the bedroom. Window didn't break but made a horrific noise. I actually remember hearing this noise in my sleep and thinking that maybe I shouldn't be doing so much Tron stuff. But I still ran over to pick it up again for another throw. Threw it back really hard at the first wall.

At this point my wife was screaming really loud for me to stop. I snapped out of it and went back to bed.

The iPad still works but is badly dented in a couple corners. And I have a couple holes to patch up in the drywall. Wife thinks I need to see a sleep specialist.
