Today's fuck up has roots about two weeks ago. I was walking around the upper part of my university's campus and there was this LGTBA club basically obligating people to take condoms, and if you don't they purposely make you feel really uncomfortable. So because I learned through watching that you should not reject these condoms I took the 15 they offered me and tossed em in my backpack.

  Now keep in mind that these are like, pride condoms; They have rainbows and **hugging shirtless-happy-multiracial-buff-men wearing suspenders on the wrapper.**

  Today I was in my music theory class and near the end I needed my planner to write some upcoming assignments up. Little did I know about 8 or 9 condoms were between the pages and stuck to the planner. 

   I leaned over to my backpack, grabbed the planner, and yanked it out. Sooner that I could react there was rainbow of colored condoms and shirtless minorities gently soaring across the room in a gesture of pure flamboyance.  

  **TDLR: Pulled my planner out of my back pack too fast. Condoms, condoms everywhere.**
