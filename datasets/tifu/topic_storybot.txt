reddit..tifu yesterday morning started out like any other monday. getting to work around 8am, i grabbed a cup of coffee and started going through the emails from the weekend. i have this co-worker in the cubicle next to me who is sometimes quite obnoxious. i've occasionally had to tell her to quiet down when i was in the middle of a call because i couldn't hear the person on the other end. well, yesterday morning when i was in the middle of a call, the same thing happened. she was making all of these strange, loud noises, and i couldn't make out what the person on the other end of my phone was trying to say. so i yelled over the cubicle, 'hey, can you please be a bit more quiet, i'm on the phone!' the noises didn't stop. so i was like wtf, i put my call on hold, and walked around to her cubicle to see why she couldn't stfu. reddit...she was having a seizure and i yelled at her. i immediately called 911 and ran to alert my boss. apparently she is mildly epileptic and she has seizures occasionally. she understood why i yelled at her, but i still feel horrible about it. tl;dr tifu by yelling at a girl who was having a seizure and not just being loud for no reason.i am in a fairly new relationship with a girl who speaks english as her third language. she speaks english very well, but sometimes there are words that she mixes up from time to time. we decided to go on a group vacation with some friends, and we had a room to ourselves. we previously had sex a few times, but we were just starting to get into the "what do you like to do during sex?" phase. she told me that she really enjoyed the man being rough with her during sex. i told her i had no issues with that, and wanted to know how rough she liked for the man to get. she said that she really enjoyed being held down, hair pulled, slapped, etc. i agreed to try these things with her the next time. so fast forward to later that night. we are having sex, and i reach up and slapped her in the face. nothing too hard, but enough to hurt for sure. she had somewhat of a shocked look on her face, but i felt like it was all apart of the act, so i reached up and slapped her a second time a little harder. she stops and asks "what are you doing?" i said "slapping you like you asked" and she replied with "no, the slapping on the ass!" "do you mean spank?" "yes! spanking! not slapping!" she was incredibly understanding, but i still couldn't help but feel bad about what i did. so this actually happened about 15 minutes ago and it still hurts, man. i'll keep this as short as possible. so after finishing work and having dinner i decided to take a shower and get ready for bed. after the shower i decided to just put on a t-shirt and a pair of briefs. no pants required as i would soon be in bed. after returning to the wife who was on the couch watching television i decided i would go outside for a quick cigarette before watching a little tv with the wife. so we have a glass sliding door which leads out to our deck and while i'm outside having a cigarette the wife can see me. i can see her glancing at me about every 30 seconds or so. this is when i decide it would be super funny if the next time she looks at me my nuts are hanging out the side of my briefs. so i wait till she turns away the i get my nuts out. now i'm standing there smoking a cigarette with my nuts out. just as she starts to turn to look at me again i was taking a drag on the cigarette. and that's when it happened. for some reason the cigarette got stuck to my lip. as i went to get it off my lip i dropped it and it landed straight on my ball sack. bad times. the wife thinks it's the funniest thing she has ever seen and i can still here her laughing. now i'm her running my ball sack under cold water while i type this. tldr: dropped a lit cigarette on my balls.so, i'm skyping with my ex girlfriend for the first time since we broke up four months ago, we had finally been able to talk about things after awhile. we're both talking about how we miss each other, you know, that teenage shit. i'm on my desktop, with my headphones plugged in, browsing reddit /r/gifs whilst she continues to tell me about how she missed me. after awhile, we start talking about seeing each other. the conversation begins to get more intimate, next thing you know she wants to see me. she's 45 minutes away and it's nearly 12am, we decide to quickly cam. i turn on my cam and she does too. i minimize reddit. about forty minutes later, she flashes her tits. i haven't had sex, nor any female physical contact in four months. instant, rock hard erection to say the least. she notices, and begins begging me to jerk off. of course i'm going to, she takes off her top, and i flop out my cock. i was a bit nervous, my computers right infront the door, if anyone was to walk in, they'd see me jerking it. i kept assuring myself, it's nearly 2am, everyone's asleep. i'm close to cumming, edging if anything. i begin to hear my door slowly open (fuck carpet, no footsteps heard).. i quickly hangup and switch the browser to reddit, back to [this] ( i look back, to see my father, his eyes in shock, as if he witnessed his son die before him. as i quickly put my pants back on, i have no fucking idea but my cock decides to climax, cum lands all over the floor, in a matter of seconds. right in-front of my dad. he didn't say anything, but i'm sure he's confused what the fuck i'm doing.. what in the fuck do i do? i think he believes i beat it to priests fighting guys in white tuxedos. **tl;dr : dad caught me jerking off, might believe i beat it to priests fighting guys in white tuxedos.** edit : i'm glad my misfortune provided some of you with laughs! just to clarify, i don't have a lock! also, forgot to mention : ex got pissed offso i'd been dating this girl for about 3 months, most saturdays she would stay over but leave on the sunday morning as sunday was 'gaming sundays' (i know i'm very cool) she was always pretty cool with it and didn't mind. she stayed over, everything was normal the morning came and she left. before i settled into my gaming session i checked facebook first. the first thing to pop up was people wishing her happy birthday. yep. it was her birthday and i'd sent her home so i could play video games. i've never apologised so much in my entire life. tldr; i wasn't aware it was my girlfriends birthday, sent her home so i could play games. edit: thanks for the gold stranger i'm glad you liked my tale - edit: people are getting pretty mad about this... i saw my gf usually about 3-5 days a week, what's wrong with 1 day a week for me? - edit: because so many people are asking i'm 21 i met a guy online, and we have been talking/snapping/texting for about two weeks. our first date was supposed to be friday, but he really wanted to meet me, so i agreed to meet him at his house once i got off work (at midnight.) i pull up to his house, and his mother (i wasn't aware that he lived with her) came out and told me that i shouldn't be showing up at her house to fornicate with her son in the middle of the night. as i was turning to leave, he comes out and apologizes for her behavior, and tells me that she's just looking out for him. he then says that they had had quite a few drinks. as he was explaining that she acts insane when she's drunk, not to mind her, he suddenly throws up all over me. i had to drive home covered in puke. edit: wow, front page. i didn't realize my massive fuck up was that massive. also, i have learned my lesson. no, i did not go to his house with even the intention of going inside. it was supposed to be talking for a bit, and then i go home. thanks for all the concern, but i do understand how stupid of a move i made. the vomit taught me a lesson. edit: gold?! thanks! good to know my awful experience has made a lot of you laugh. i am laughing with you. :)went to fancy movie theater with date. decide to buy a bottle of wine. go back to bar. ask for two glasses. bartender says he needs two id's. i'm too lazy to go back to seats to grab dates id. tell him i'm alone and was embarrassed to ask for just one glass. he is clearly sympathetic. idiot me then tries to sell the story and continue on about how lonely i've been recently. he tells me he's off in a few minutes and insists on watching the movie with me. i try to fight it but i could only argue so much without giving away the truth. bartender is insistent. i text my date what's happening. go back to theater with my new date. sit a few rows in front of my first date. she has the stupidest grin on her face as me and the bartender (jared) sit a couple rows in front of her. he ends up being super cool and bought me and him another bottle during the movie. movie ends. i thank him for his gesture. he didn't even ask for my number or anything. i think jared was just a genuine guy trying to comfort someone. met back up with my date in the parking lot and thankfully she found the whole thing hilarious. i don't deserve jared.this was a while back when my daughter was a toddler. my husband and i didn't want her sipping on his beer so we called that daddy's juice. "no, you can't drink that it's daddy's juice" one day i went to pick up my daughter from daycare and her teacher saw me and started giggling. it was around mother's day and she had the kids do a little project where they answered some questions about their mommy. how tall is mommy? what is mommy's favorite color? including "what is mommy's favorite drink?" the answer being... daddy's juice. well, that was a bit embarrassing to say the least. i explained to her what it was and we had a good laugh. so last night at jimmy john's we get a call from some lady who's online order apparently didn't come through for 45 mins. we get the order as she's calling but she doesn't believe us and is all pissed off. about half an hour later we get a a prank call from some kid who asked if our blowjobs are "freaky fast" - 'cause that's funny, right? my coworker suggested we text the kid just to mess with him so i take her phone, get the number, type and send the message "are your blowjobs freaky fast???!" just to kind of mock him. it wasn't even that funny but we were bored so whatever. then, maybe 10 minutes later we get a call from the first lady and i realize i typed the wrong number in (it was still up on our first phone screen). apparently she was so offended even after it was explained to her that she needed to talk to our general manager the next day. i come in the next morning and find out me, the coworker and manager are all getting fired. and it's completely my fault.this actually happened yesterday, so it's relatively fresh right, so at the moment i am at disney world orlando with my dad and little sister. my sister is 10 and i am 17. as my sister is a dumbass and can't walk in a straight line as she is looking at all the disney shenanigans, i sometimes put my hand on her back and guide her through the crowds. now the fuck up: we are walking in a big crowd towards the haunted mansion and i see my sister walking the wrong way so without really paying attention i again start guiding her for a few minutes. when we get to the haunted mansion i look down and realise, that's not my sister. she was wearing similar clothes and looked similar but this was definitely not my sister. fuck. that's also when my dad noticed. i had managed to lose my sister, and kidnap someone else's daughter at the same time. luckily ad disney they are used to lost kids, petrified parents and confused siblings/ child thief's and managed to find the girls parents. and sadly, they found my sister too. tl:dr went to disney. saw sister. kidnapped a little girl. edit: haunted mansion not haunted house wow okay this has blown up, i'm glad you are all enjoying my sisters misfortunes. narrated this literally just happened. i was walking to the spot i normally stand at on the train platform but i didn't have my contacts in so my vision/depth perception wasn't very good. i hear someone say hi so i turn to look as i'm walking and i see my friends sister with her arms outstretched. in my head i'm like oh alright she wants a hug, so i go in and give her a hug. i thought it felt kind of strange, like she wasn't really hugging back so i end the hug and back up to look at her. at this point i realize a) that it wasn't my friends sister but a random woman waiting for the train and b) she was extending her arms to someone who was behind me, who i noticed after the hug. they both looked pretty horrified so i didn't even really try to explain myself, i kind of just walked away without saying anything. tl;dr: went in for a hug, ruined someone's morningedit: the [audiobook]( ) by [cyae1]( happened a few days ago. first date at a bar for drinks, felt a bit nervous so i got there a bit early and took a couple of shots and was half-way done with my beer when she showed up late. everything went great, she was funny and more importantly she thought i was funny. after a few more drinks we're a bit tipsy, it's still early and she wants us to show up to her friend's party a couple of blocks from the bar. so we're walking and chatting and then we notice a family getting out of a restaurant, and one of their children appears to be blind or visually impared, as he is wearing shades and has a companion dog. my inebriated brain allows an unfiltered thought to be vocalized, something i read on reddit wondering how blind persons are able to tell if they wipe enough after going to the bathroom... i know, i'm sorry but bear with me. she laughs but she appears not to get it. that's when i should've changed subjects but i told her something along the lines of "*well if he can't look at the toilet paper, how can he tell if he's wiped enough?*" her reaction really threw me off-guard: "*eww what the fuck, what do you mean - do you look at your toilet paper after wiping*?" with an utter look of disgust on her face. i told her that i assume most people do, once again how else would they know if they're good to go. she tells me angrily that she's never heard of such a disgusting thing before and that she assumes most people just know when the job's done, they feel it. we had stopped walking and she was putting me on the spot, i could see that she was waiting for me to say something and to wipe the look of shock and disgust i had off my face. that's when i fucked up. my drunken state suggested the only option was to attempt a funny and flirtatious remark in order to get back to the good vibes we had up until now. so i said with a smile and flirty confidence "*don't worry babe i know you're clean, i'm sure if i were to run a sheet of tp inbetween your cheeks there would be no skidmark!*" she slapped me, called me a creepy disgusting piece of shit pervert and took of. i don't date often, and was devastated. at least i laugh about it now - after i told him the story a friend just said "dirty-ass bitches man".last wednesday, the girl of my dreams asked me to go to prom with her. i readily accepted, and that was that. the only problem? i'm a girl as well. my parents thought that i was straight, so i decided to tell them that i was bi that day to get it over with. so, i go to my mom, and tell her that i need to get a prom dress this year. where i go to school, only seniors can go to prom unless you are asked by one. as a junior, my mom automatically wanted to know which hot guy asked me. when i told her who it was (let's call her stephanie) my mom had an..... interesting reaction. she told me that it wasn't funny to make fun of lesbians. they are people too, and deserve respect. she doesn't care if i go to prom or not, but i have to be respectful of others. this led to a mildly awkward mother-daughter conversation in which i tried to convince her that i was, in fact, a bisexual **tl;dr i forgot it was april fool's day edit: wow, i left for school, came back and this blew up! thanks for the gold and the support :) for those wondering, yes stephanie was serious. she wanted 'april fool's' to be her response if i turned out to be straight. i'm sure you have all heard the story about the person yelling "are you fucking sorry". well.. today i did something similar. 5:30pm comes around at work and i'm just chatting with a few people as we are finishing up. i then thought it might be cool if we go for a couple of beers after work. so i turned to my female colleague and went to ask her if she was game. however being the excellent clear speaker that i am i stumbled over my words and started saying " do you want a quick one" except halfways through saying quick i changed the word to sneaky. i ended up asking her "do you want a quickie". luckily she just laughed and told everyone else but i'm not going to live it down for a while. edit: to all those asking a sneaky refers to getting a drink or two when you wouldn't usually have one. and i'm australian so you don't even need to use the word beer or drink in that sentence.i work an office job and a coworker invited me to smoke a blunt with her after my shift. we'd never smoked before and it had been a long time coming. we both lightly flirt with each other sometimes but she has a boyfriend so i wasn't gonna try anything. i didn't have any weed on me but she did so i bought the blunt wrap at the gas station. after we smoke she offers to drive me to the subway so i can get home. now i did not specify which subway i needed to be dropped off at (my high ass assumed she knew) so she automatically assumes the one closest to her house. i am so high that i'm so busy trying to make normal conversation that i don't even realize that i am getting dropped off fucking two miles outside of my usual commute. she stops the car and i stare at her for what felt like ten seconds thinking "why are we stopped?". after the long pause she says "uhm here we are" and i realize i'm outside of the wrong train but i was too high to tell her she dropped me off at the wrong train. i get out of the car and proceed to take about two hours to get home via public transportation. on top of that she probably thought i was gonna make a move on her when i was trying to compute for ten seconds why she was dropping off at the wrong train. edit: when i say "we've never smoked before" i mean "we've never smoked before together" edit 2: we never left the area of my work. going back to her place was never in the question. for further context i was getting off work and she was smoking on her lunch. also not that this is relevant but she does not live with her boyfriend and i have met him before, pretty cool guy. edit 3: for the love of god people read the post i was never gonna make a move!!! tl;dr: i got high with a coworker, she dropped me off at the wrong train station, i was too high and awkward to say it was the wrong train station, it was a severe inconvenience for me in terms of transportation but i trucked it out anyways. this literally happened 15 mins ago, i'm still slightly traumatised. to give just a bit of background, i'm a 17 year old male, and live with my sister who is a couple years older than me, and parents of course. i have this strange habit that occurs subconsciously whenever i feel the need to go to the bathroom. when i'm alone, i'll casually whip out the d as i'm walking towards the bathroom, and as soon as i reach the toilet i let loose. easy peasy, i'm in and out of there in like 10 seconds. usually this isn't a problem, if i notice anyone around i simply do what any other civilised human being would do and not unleash my genitals. today i was watching a video on my phone so i had earphones in. on my journey to the bathroom, i was giggling like a little girl so i didn't realise my sister was already sitting on the toilet as i walked in. why the door wasn't fucking closed i will never fucking know. as i stroll in (with phone in one hand and dick in other mind you) i hear a voice say "sorry i'm in..." which then cuts off. slowly i look up from my phone. i swear if you saw her face it would be like i killed someone, though a part of her probably died so yeah. i got the absolute fuck out of there, and here i am in bed, watching netflix and writing this. i'm not getting up after that traumatising experience. tl;dr had to take a leak, instead showed my sister my flaccid ding dong. this happened earlier today. i am mortified. a bit of background: my wife and my mother-in-law are the same height. they have the same body type. and they have the same color hair. well today, they were wearing the same color outfit. whenever my wife bends over, i always cup her ass. not just a little tap, or on the cheek. i get down as low as i can (i have long arms) and i finger her clit if possible. just for a second, just to tease her. i didn't know my mother in law came over this morning. so i wake up late, see my wife for a second and give her a kiss, then i take a shower. then i go downstairs. go to the kitchen, cause i'm damn hungry. and by the pots, my "wife" is bent over, presumably getting a pan to cook with. so i proceed to cup her, and immediately proceed to the fingering her clit for a second portion.. when.. "she".. yelps. i'm a bit horrified. but my wife just said her mom isn't mad.. but still.. video games in my room for this week sounds great.. it's improtant to tell you guys i'm jewish... so my gf was taking a shower and i had to pee, so i went into the bathroom and told her that i'm coming in... i started peeing and after a few seconds she said "when you're done you can come to into the shower with me if you want", and while usually i'd say yes and hop in, i felt extra funny that moment, so i replied with "sorry dear, my grandpa already fell for that trick"... i really thought she'd like the joke... but she didn't...this happened yesterday, so if you're out there bus girl, i want you to know. it's not what you think. yesterday after working a grueling shift at the old internet mines (i'm a network engineer). i got on the bus to go home just like always. ahead of me in line is a young woman who is looking very pretty, she has red hair and a nice polka-dot blouse. i don't think much of it, but we end up sitting across from each other on the bus. i'm reading something that was on the front page but get the urge to look up and see her face. i had only seen the back of her head before. i glance up and to my delight, she is very pretty! horray! i have seen one more pretty girl in the world than i did before. except mid-glance she looks up at me. i realize i'm probably slack-jawed and not really paying attention. i look down. i don't really know why, i don't have a problem talking to girls. i have a long time girlfriend and i don't talk to very many women these days. i'm feeling a bit sheepish and awkward, so i glance up again for some reason. a second after i do - she looks up at me and catches me starring at her, or at least she thinks i'm starring at her. she screws up her face a little bit. i'm not even that ugly, oh well. twice in a row i've been caught slipping. none of this matters because the mid-way stop at the park-and-ride is coming up, and usually everyone gets off the bus here. she stands up as the bus stops and i breath in relief. i also stand up in search of a more comfortable seat (the bench seats that face each-other kind of suck). so i'm waiting for people to clear out, and people are getting off the bus. but on today of all days much more people are getting on the bus, much more than usually. must be a football game tonight or something. she isn't getting off the bus. she sits by the window in a regular seat. i look around - all of the other seats are being filled quickly. i walk to the back of the bus, nothing. i look around, there is nothing. the universe's cruel game of musical chairs is playing "creep" by radiohead. i sit down next to her. she looks at me like a deer in the headlights and i think she is actually afraid. flash forward 10 minutes and i've moved seats as we are the only two people left on the bus. she is looking over at me regularly, probably making sure i'm not furiously masturbating or something. last stop. my stop. her stop. our stop. we get off the bus, she goes first and stars walking in my house's direction. we slowly walk together, for a few blocks, she keeps checking over her shoulder. she finally turns down a side-street and i think maybe i can relax now. i turn down my street. i breath a sigh of relief, finally the coast is clear and i don't feel like i'm stalking anyone. then she appears, she clearly took a fake-turn to get away from me, and i met up with her on my road. she starts running up the steps to my building and i'm freaking the fuck out like what is happening, am i actually stalking this girl? i keep walking towards my building, i just want to go home. she turns and yells at me from the stairs "stop fucking following me fucking creep" this is how i met my new neighbor. tifu by making a joke during sexy time. last night my wife and i started getting a bit frisky after the kids were in bed. as i began to remove the items of clothing covering her magnificent breasts, she said, "slow down, no need for rushing!" i replied, "i'm not russian, i'm german!" it took several minutes to convince her to let me touch her again.i meant it as a joke but her response was "[sister's name] told you??" edit: i thought she might be joking but when i got home today the whole family was there and she was visibly upset. update: we're going to the doctor this week to confirm it but if she is pregnant it's definitely mine. no i'm not actually a bigfatvirgin, don't take my username so seriously. the reason it was such a surprise is because she has one of those birth control implants in her arm (it's called implanon for those asking). update #2: just finished finals so i finally have time to update you guys. she was due to have the implant switched out because it's been a few years since she had it done. a lot of people are bashing her and it bothers me so let me clear things up. she told her sister first because she needed advice and her sister is older (29) and has had 2 kids already. she didn't know if she was preggo but has been feeling sick so her and her sister went to take a pee stick test and it came back positive. she has an appointment with her doctor in a few hours so hopefully that will clear up the situation more. whether she chooses to keep it or not i'll support her, we are only 21 but i graduate with my cs degree on friday and i've already got a steady job lined up. my sister-in-law is an absolute technophobe. she has always had some shit mobile phone but recently upgraded to an iphone due to some pressure from her kids. she was having some problems with certain aspects of it, certain things draining her battery etc and asked me if i could have a look at it. so, me being the absolute evil genius that i am, entered a text shortcut so that when she typed the word 'jay' (which is her husbands name) it would come up 'you're a fat bitch! lol jk'. i know this is hardly an imaginative prank, and an infantile text, she would try and text her husband 'hi jay' and it would come up 'hi you're a fat bitch! lol jk' which seemed like a pretty harmless joke that he wouldn't really be offended by. so i sit back to wait for the outcome. fast forward a couple of hours and i hear an ungodly hammering of my front door. i answer the door and she shoves past me, "what the fuck did you do to my phone?!?!" i am completely taken aback by how angry she is and was like "sorry kelly, it was only a joke, was jay pissed off?" to which she replied "i didn't fucking text jay, my friend's mum had just died, i wrote to her on facebook to say 'so sorry for your loss, thinking of you, love kelly and jay'" what she had actually written was "so sorry for your loss, thinking of you, love kelly and you're a fat bitch! lol jk" i recently starting hooking up with a girl i knew from high school. we are 22 now, and just realized we were a decent match. it was our 5th (or so) night of sleeping together, and it was great. semi-buzzed sex ending in mutual satisfaction. as morning rolled around, we decided to have another go. things progressed normally, foreplay went well, and eventually we ended up with her on top. as she was on top, being incredibly sexy and making me realize i had landed something special, i decided to try and assert my male dominance. mistake. i thought a slap on the ass would be just perfect. not too hard, but enough to get the message across. i'm a stud. as i swing my arm out to start building momentum, she sits straight up on me. my arm moves around and i start the slight whip-like motion so that it i get a nice "pop" as my hand lands. i start to make contact. my palm lands directly in the middle of her butt cheek. my fingertips, fully extended, wrap around, only to find that i've overshot the runway (so to speak). my stomach drops, and my mouth starts salivating. i slapped my balls. hard. with the aforementioned pop. i let out an audible groan, and she immediately knew what i had done. she tried to get off out of courtesy, but in my state, all i could mutter was "don't move. don't move." i sat there for the next 5 minutes, inside her, trying not to vomit (successfully) and her trying not to laugh (unsuccessfully). after what felt like a lifetime, i was able to allow her to get off (not the way i had hoped). tl;dr: i tried to slap my girlfriends ass while she was in cowgirl position, and instead slapped my balls so hard i almost threw up.so this happened earlier today. enter me, enter sexy blonde girl. after a night of heavy flirting, i finally convinced her to come back to my apartment. i put on some rock to get us both in the mood for some aggressive sex (she had let me know she was into it beforehand) and broke out the condoms. it was going great. approximately 4 min after foreplay and getting it in, my little soldier decided he wanted to get some fresh air. my brain didn't register the fact that i wasn't still inside her and decided to start going even harder than i was before. my johnson bent in half and popped. it sounded like the most satisfying knuckle pop. i looked down, and my willie was black, blue, and bigger than my wrist. i cried and ran out if the room because of the pain. apparently fractured penises exist. she left very soon after. tl;dr: you can beat your meat, you can choke your chicken, but god forbid you ever break your stake. edit 1: holy. this got big. rip inbox! edit 2: figures my gold cherry would be popped after i break my dick. thanks kind internet stranger! edit 3: sorry for no response for a while, i was in surgery. apparently this happens more often than you would expectafter class the other day, i went to pick up my younger sister at the middle school. when i got there, i was shocked to see her getting beaten on by an older girl, with a few others looking on. she wasn't even fighting back. she was just curled up, covering her face. i broke into a run and yelled for them to leave her alone. the girl who was hitting her just sort of looked at me, probably thinking i was some aftercare worker coming to shoo her away. "she started it!" the bully lied. bullshit. i shoved her out of the way and checked up on my sister. she had some scrapes, but otherwise seemed okay, just shaken. i've never seen her so scared, though. tears were just pouring down her face. the bully girl didn't give a fuck, tried to pin the fight on her, and grabbed a fistful of her hair. well, shit, i kinda lost control, and decked her upside the head. her friends started screaming, and they all scampered off. i took my sister inside to get cleaned up by the nurse. she promised to let the principal know about our scuffle. that night, our parents got a phone call. apparently, i punched that girl so hard that her jaw dislocated, and her dad was shitting himself with rage. my parents think i did the right thing, but we could potentially be in some legal trouble. we know the bully's family has no case (multiple witnesses could identify her as the aggressor and my sister has a black eye), but they could buy a good lawyer, which is much more powerful. we'll just have to see where this goes. tl;dr punched a kid who was attacking my sister, may get suedi feel like i must preface this by mentioning that i am a girl. that's what people seem to be focusing on most when they find out about it. my best friend and i met when i was 13 and he was 10. we got along great despite him being what i felt was just a little kid while i thought i was an adult. i am now 20, which makes him 17. also, he has a hot mom. like way beyond hot. she got pregnant at 16, and she is now 34. anyway, this all started when i went out with some other friends this past weekend. he couldn't come along because he is underage (this is in canada, so drinking at 18 here, though most places start at 19) we went to a local bar which, while it was not originally its design, now caters to a mostly gay, and especially lesbian, clientele. i am bisexual, and it's one of my regular hangout spots. so one beer and a couple doobies into the night, i'm dancing with my friends, and i decide to go to the bar and get another beer. when i get to the bar, i notice my friend's mom is there, so i get a beer, and sit down next to her and chat her up, still oblivious to the fact that my friend's mom is at a lesbian bar. by the time i finish my second beer, i'm getting tipsy (i can't hold my alcohol) and it finally hits me. this is a lesbian bar, and this woman is here, chatting up (and checking out) other women. i let the alcohol and weed get the better of me and i'm flirting a bit, but trying not to be too obvious. i eventually get her to come dance with us, so i drag her to the dance floor. we're dancing, keeping up the appearances of a conversation, and she puts her hand on my waist. i felt like my face must have gone completely red, i must have been blushing to bad (thank god it was dark!) but i was having a good time, so i quickly relaxed and got up closer. eventually, my high was wearing thin, so i excused myself and went outside with my friends to smoke up. she showed up outside and surprised us by asking to smoke up with us. yeah, she's a cool mom! we go back in, now i'm good and buzzed and all kinds of handsy, dancing with her, and without thinking about it, i kiss her. she reciprocates. it gets pretty intense, dancing slowly, making out hardcore. the night goes on, and we call it a night. we're all walking home, and me and her split off from the others cause we live on the same block. she takes my hand and walks with me, right by my place, all the way to hers. amazing sex ensues. i wake up in her bed the next morning. no awkwardness or anything between us, just like it was any other day. yesterday night, she calls me up (she has all of her son's friend's phone numbers.) booty call. she comes to my place, crazy sex ensues again. this morning, my roommate wakes up to find my best friend's mom half naked and disheveled in the living room eating cereal and watching cartoons. now he found out and obviously totally hates me. roommate says my friend has a huge crush on me and everybody knew except me. **tl;dr**: met my best friend's mom at a lesbian bar. she took me home and had her way with me. booty call a few days later. her son hates me now.theres this young lady, around 24 years old, who comes in the gym where i work pretty often with her 4 year old son. yesterday, she didnt have her son with her. we joke around a lot and were talking for a while, so i asked "where's your kiddo at? doing meth with the neighbors again?" in a very jokingly way (since like i said we mess with each other all the time). well she got a real bad look on her face and walked away. turns out she's in celebrate recovery because of her former meth addiction. and her son was with her neighbors. fmlfmlfmlfmlthis literally just happened in the last half hour and i'm still kind of in shock/ confused. so i've been chatting with this girl on tinder for the past couple days and things were going well. tonight she suggests that i come over to watch a movie and cuddle. i accept the invitation since all i was doing was watching the finale of true detective and this season has been confusing enough. i make it to her apartment complex when suddenly my phone dies, that should have been the sign right there. i run to the gas station to buy a charger since i already drove out there and i'm committed to this cuddle. i get into her apartment and everything seems normal, we go strait to her room since her roommate (a dude) was in the shower right next to the living room. not even a few minutes into the movie we start making out and it starts getting a little toasty. while were kissing she keeps getting texts and going out to talk to her roommate a couple times which i thought was odd. she comes back in and takes off my shirt and then says, "i want you to fuck me right now". it catches me off guard since i didn't take her for the type. i knew something was up at this point so i tell her that she was going a little fast for me. i hear the shower stop in the other room and then she says, "do you mind if my roommate joins in?" that isn't really what i had in mind and get up a little startled when suddenly roommate guy barges in balls naked and says, "i'm going to pound you into the ground, i'm going to pound you into the fucking ground." as he gazed into my eyes my dong went limp and i proceed to sprint out of the apartment as fast as i could with my shoes and shirt in one hand. as i'm running out he yells, "i'm going to track you down, you better run i'm coming after you." i didn't look back and ran as fast as i could to my car in shock and disbelief that something like that actually happened to me. needless to say i'm going to take a break from tinder for a little while. edit: i'm glad many of you are concerned about my wallet, it was in the car the entire time so its safe! as soon as i go to lunch i'm going to report her to tinder and get her account banned. more importantly i will be filing a report with the police, i realize this could have gone way worse for me and i don't want anyone else walking into that situation if its a set up/ scam. update: so as i was enjoying my chick-fil-a at lunch i received a text from her, let me know what you think still seems kind of sketchy. "i have no words to say how sorry i am about last night. that guy is an ex of mine and he kept threatening me until i came over and drank with him. he got me really drunk and got on my tinder and was actually texting you from his phone. he told me i couldn't go home until you came over and i convinced you to have a three some. thank you for not taking advantage of me. i was scared shitless and i know he freaked you out too. i got your number from his phone after he passed out before i left so i could apologize. again, so sorry that you were put in that situation."8 days ago my girlfriend gave birth to our daughter. she had a mild infection so stayed in the special care baby unit for a few days. my girlfriend came home 3 days after the birth but we've been going back to the hospital to see our daughter every day since. today our daughter was discharged from hospital so we went to pick her up. my girlfriend went to sign some papers in another room. i was super anxious and if i'm honest i was not thinking straight. i ended up walking into the wrong hospital room, the one next to where my daughter was. i was a complete and utter idiot. both hospital rooms looked exactly the same and this other baby was wearing a white babygrow and a yellow hat, just like my daughter. my daughter had a wristband, this baby didn't but i didn't realise it until later. i put the baby into the car seat and went to reception where my girlfriend was meeting me. while i was waiting, my mum showed up with some stuff for my daughter. she asked to hold the baby and i said yes. she picked her up and said "mike..." i could tell by the time of her voice that something wasn't right so i started freaking out. she said the baby looked different but i insisted it was because the last time she saw her she was in an incubator. we continued to wait and my girlfriend arrived. my girlfriend looked at the baby and her face turned white. she said that it was not her baby. we rushed over to the desk and a nurse came with us to the ward to see what had happened. there was another couple there freaking out because their baby had gone. i was forced to admit my mistake. we picked up our daughter and headed home but now my girlfriend is being cold towards me and i feel like a crappy father for not recognising my own daughters face. wish me luck for the next 18 years.i hate all the excessively long posts so i'm going to keep this short. my little sister is 6 years old. the way i convinced her she was invisible was simple; i took a picture of our couch before she was on it. then, i called her and she came to me and i pretended i couldn't see her. naturally, she didn't believe me. so, i told her to sit on the couch and i'll take a picture. but here's the zinger: i showed her the old picture with no one on it. this was all it took to convince her. unfortunately, people react differently to learning they are invisible. she was skipping around tormenting my other family members (they were in on it too). it was pretty harmless until she started picking her nose and whatnot. we had to stop the gag when she began to undress. we gave her some honey and said it was anti invisibility potion and that was that.this actually happened just a few minutes ago.. so me and the wife are sitting together watching family feud, the question on the show is "name something your wife talks to you about, but you have no interest in". the first family answered with the obvious answers, her clothes and her friends. they couldn't figure out the last two so steve harvey asked the second family, "name something your wife talks to you about, but you have no interest in". i immediately blurt out, "her feelings"! it's been 30 minutes now and i am still trying to convince her that i care about her feelings, i just thought that's how other people would answer. i'm such a dumbass. she had been really flirty and sexual. when i proposed the threesome i was half-joking, testing the waters, if you will(you know exactly what i'm talking about). she was was not amused. at all. whatsoever. tl;dr- if that's too long for you, then go fuck yourself. and two other people.before anything, sorry for my english. so, friday night, a friend of mine called to tell me that he's alone in the house, and we should invite some people for a house party. alright, nice! i call some of my friends, including this horny one. let's call him joe. i call some girls too, and, by the beggining of the party, there was 7 people: /u/hank_moo_d, **joe**, **guy1**, **guy2**, **girl1**, **girl2** and **girl3**. we started drinking, and talking, and people just spread around in the house. some were in the balcony (it was a apartment), some in the bedroom, some in the living room. after a while, i heard a scream, and one of the girls leaves the bedroom, covered only by the bed sheets. wtf!? everybody left the apartment, because the mood got heavy. i was driving home, me and my friend, so i ask him: "joe, what happened?". here it goes: &gt;**joe**: yeah... so, i was in the bedroom with **guy1** and **girl1**. we were chatting, no big deal. all of a sudden, **guy2** enters the room with **girl2**. they were hooking up, so the three of us decided to leave the bedroom so they could use it. as we leave, i turned off the lights, and realized the room got pitch black. so, i decided to stay inside, since they wouldn't see me. i closed the door and stayed by the wall. they started heating up on the bed, as i could hear. given time, your sight starts to get used to the dark. so i could see forms and shapes. i could see them fucking. i started to jacking off. the girl was on four, and basically i was in her eyesight direction, but she did not see me. the guy was fucking her really hard, and i started to jack off even harder, and then... she sees me. she screams, saying *theres somebody there*. so i started apologizing, and turned on the lights. as they see me, and i see them now, in the light, we all turn to another corner of the bedroom: there was **guy1** there, dick in hand. he started to apologize as well, then she leaves the room screaming." **tl;dr:** invited a horny friend to a house party. he sneaked in a bedroom with couple fucking in it. they see him after a while. then, they realize there was a even more ninja guy in another corner as well. **the tale of the horny ninjas** **edit:** since 3 guys were in the bedroom, me and the other 2 girls just thought the ninja jerkers were buying cigarretes at the gas station down the street. this all happened in the timeframe of 5 minutes (or less). **edit²:** all the girls were ours friends, so they just laughed about it afterwards. the only new face to them was the second ninja. he was friend of the guy who got ninja-cockblocked. **edit³:** a lot of people are calling it fake. i don't mind, but i'll try to answer some questions people are making. **1) didn't girl1 notice why she left the bedroom alone?** *i sent her a message about that. she said she went straight to the bathroom. when she left the bathroom, she didn't even think about joe and guy1.* **2) how they didn't notice the second ninja fapper?** *that's the beauty. nobody knows.* **3) who was the host?** *the guy who got ninja-cockblocked.*so its a friday night and being the anti-social college student, i decided to go to the library to get some studying in, which actually turned into how long could i stare at the same picture of a dog on /r/aww. after a couple of hours of looking at my phone waiting for something to happen, i got a text from a girl. now, this girl was very sweet and very pretty and had the kind of innocence that magically makes you fall in love with her. she had been my best friend since middle school and we never tried to make moves because i couldn't hold a relationship for shit and seeing as we both are kind of nerdy, we didn't know what the hell to do. so back to the text, she asks me if i want to come over and watch netflix. this was huge for me, since i have never used netflix before since i am a baller on a budget, so i of course said yes, thinking that this doctor who loving girl just wanted to help a friend out with some quality entertainment. so, i make my way over to her room and noticed the door was open, walked in and there she is standing naked right in front of me. now, if you see a girl just standing in front of you naked, you kind of have that pause moment when you go through the ultimate high of excitement, busting out into the carlton dance, to the utter fear of not knowing what to do. so, being the smooth talking nerd that i am, i said this : "so, no netflix?" and i got kicked the fuck out. an update to when i had originally posted this 3-4 weeks ago, the girl and i are still friends. i found out that the door was locked but college dorms suck and the door cracked open without her knowing. she was changing into her pajamas to watch the movie and didn't think that i had the speed of usain bolt. edit: to all of the people asking about if she had intentionally left the door cracked for he to see me naked, i can 100% confirm it was not intentionally. the doors at this college that i got to have the ability to self open because of wind from another open door (science). i also didn't make a move because sexy time just isn't the thing for me right now, just because i had a friend in high school who knocked up a girl because she legitimately poked holes into his condom on prom night. i was just in a silly mood and thought it would be funny to mess with my waitress by faking an australian accent, pretending it was my birthday, asking her a bunch of stupid questions about her life, about america, etc. she liked me so much that she wound up [snuggling next to me for a picture]( and giving me her number. she wants to hang out on thursday. if i don't blow her off, then she'll eventually learn that i was being completely fake when we met. i'm such a piece of shit. :(just did this. in a waiting room with limited seats and other patrons randomly disbursed. a mom and her son walk in. i have an empty seat on their side of me, so i slide over so they can sit next to eachother. she gives me an odd look and says, "thank you, but we will sit over here." so i look at the seat i just offered to her child... it's not a seat... it's a trash can. tl;dr i politely offered for a child to be thrown away. edit: hey reddit! /u/markreadsreddit did a great narration of my fu. [check it out!](i made a hot pocket in the oven last night, and i of course needed to test if it was cool enough to eat. so i used the most appropriate method i could think of, i took a small bite[7]. superheated "cheese" comes out, but no big surprises there. i proceeded to devour both pockets and sooth my burning lips and mouth with an icy beer. i went about my night and everything was normal. this morning i noticed i had burned my bottom lip near the right corner. it wasn't too bad, just a small blister i noticed while shaving. i went to work and went about my day, and proceeded to forget about my burned lip. i got off work and met up with my girlfriend. she gives me a big kiss, which then pops the blister. she pulls away quickly as i reach towards the blister. she looks at my lip and asks me what is on it. i say it's just a blister, but she just keeps staring and analyzing it. after a minute she picks up her purse and says, "no, that's herpes", calls me an asshole and accused me of cheating on her. she tells me we're over and started freaking out that she now has herpes. i keep trying to tell her it's a hot pocket burn as she leaves the bar, but she just stormed out flipping me the bird while everyone just gave me a death stare. i checked out myself in the mirror and the blister popped really badly, it looks pretty nasty, but i don't think it looks like herpes. this all happened an hour ago and she's not answering my texts or calls. tldr: i ate a hot pocket, burned my lip, gf left me cause the burn kind of looks like herpes. photo of blister: update: she still hasn't responded, but thanks for all the support. i dunno what is going on with her, but maybe this was the best hot pocket ever. edit: wow first page! rip inbox thanks for all the support everybody! edit 2: to answer some of the questions, her ass is kate hot, she is very far in the hot side of crazy/hot scale (i thought less crazy though), and we've been together 2 years. edit 3: thanks for the gold kind stranger!if you're a polite person, it's muscle memory to hold the door open for whoever's behind you. i was leaving my university library through a revolving door, and i was reading something on my phone. this gorgeous girl was behind me with a coffee in one hand and books in the other. as i exit out into the open, without even realizing it, i hold my hand back to stop the motion of the door. she walked right into the glass, spilling her coffee all over herself. i panicked and ran. i can never go back.okay so this happened around 3 months ago. keep in mind i'm a guy who likes role-playing and tends to make a lot of puns. so i had been dating this girl for about a month and a bit and things were going really great. we were alone one day and we were spooning (i was the big spoon) and i had my hands resting around her waist under her shirt. eventually she gets an idea and says 'hey wanna touch my boobs?' and being the horny teenager i am, i'm like 'hell yeah i do!' and thus began the moment i began to fuck up. okay maybe it was because i was a bit nervous but for some reason as i started working my way up to her boobs i began to commentate (in david attenborough's voice) like i was some explorer on an adventure to her boobs. after crossing the grand canyon (her belly button) i eventually got to her breasts where i said ' wow i must have fallen and died in the grand canyon because it feels like i'm in heaven'.. i thought it was pretty smooth and i think she thought it was kind of cute. (looking back she probably didn't it was pretty lame) but it didn't last long because i was instantly back into explorer mode. 'hmm it looks we've reached uncharted land, i'm going to call it...boobsville' and this is where i really started fucking up. 'shh i need to watch out for booby traps' i started to giggle a little bit but i kept it together. 'don't get too close to the natives, they might give you the boobonic plague.' at this point i was trying so hard not to laugh i was holding back tears. eventually i got to her nipple, where i couldn't help but say 'wait a second, how the hell did we end up in nepal' and then proceeded to laugh uncontrollably to the point where i could no longer continue my boob exploration adventure. she broke up with me the next day. i'm not sure if it was because of the boob incident but i still don't regret it and i would totally do it all over again. tl;dr my girlfriend let me touch her boobs and i fell into a booby trap, got the boobonic plague and went to nepal before we broke up the next day. edit: wow i can't believe this post got gold, thank you so much.so i was on a date with a girl to the cinema. the date went well, but it was only a second date, and i still didn't know if she liked me or not. so she went to the bathroom, and i decided to go to the shop next to it while waiting. now we had gone to see the hobbit and i was starving as i hadn't eaten since dinner before, and i didn't feel i needed a snack during it, and i didn't want to ask her for some in case she thought it was weird. so when i went to the shop i saw condoms, and i started to ask myself if i may need some myself. now i'm a 19 year old virgin, so i'm very oblivious to any signs of interest from girls, and i never had a need to already have condoms. now i only had enough money for the condoms by themselves, and then i wouldn't have been able to afford the chocolate. so i bought the chocolate. big mistake. i drive her back to her college apartment, and walked her to the door. she then invites me inside for some tea. now being inexperienced and kind of clueless i think she genuinely means a cup of tea. so we are there sitting on the couch drinking tea when she leans in and starts kissing me. things escalate and she's dragging me to her room and we start getting undressed. then she ask the dreaded question, "do you have a condom?" so now i'm sitting here, still a virgin, with a mars bar wrapper in my hand. tldr: bought a bar of chocolate instead of condoms while on a date, and now i'm still a virgin because of it. edit: wow thanks for the response guys it is really helpful. i decided to take the advice of a few of you and rang her. things seem all good, and she wants to go out again. pretty clueless as to what i'll do, but i'm definitely not forgetting the condoms.so this is not today, but a few years ago in high school. i had failed my classes (thanks world of warcraft, at least i got all classes on max level so it was kinda worth it) and was forced to redo the entire year. the first day of school i didn't know anyone in my new classes and took an empty seat in my economics class. a very attractive girl took the seat next to me (we were grouped in pairs). in the following weeks, we hit it off pretty well. but not much happened aside from the chatting. around november/december she got very close physically, to the point where her leg was always touching mine during class. we were both invited to a christmas party of a mutual friend. i had a few drinks and i, somehow, became the center of the party. i had learned how to shuffle ( a few weeks back and danced my ass off. it seems this beautiful mating dance aroused my potential mate significantly. i eventually took a break from performing my mating dance and sat on a table. suddenly she, and a few of her friends stood in front of me. i have no idea why she brought her friends. we talked for a while and then she tried to kiss me. the most logical response was to slap her in the face obviously (fist half closed) which is exactly what i did. i was blessed with good reflexes thanks to my dad, who liked to spar with me when i was just a wee little boy. threat evaded! what does this girl think... fucking with me huh?! all she said was "you shouldnt do this!! why??" it was only after i left for college that i realised that she indeed wanted to fuck with me, but in a different way. i was an average guy who played wow, skipped classes and smoked pot. and for some reason this girl liked me very much. the thought of her liking me didn't even cross my mind once during all these months of her foot-fucking and rubbing me. i have plenty of other stories like these if people are interested. last night, we were in bed and my girlfriend was scratching her eye viciously, complaining that she suffers from chronic dry eye and not from leaving contacts in for too long. as we're in the spooning position, she finally sighs and asks me to "make her cry" so her eye gets some moisture. i quickly think of how to do that on short notice. should i tickle her relentlessly? do i need to ray rice her? and then a lightbulb goes off in my brain. i lean close to her ear and whisper to my girlfriend of over three years: "i've never really loved you." needless to say, tears were had. i'm not a smart man. edit: wow, my inbox. so a lot asked what happened afterwards. she was caught off guard because i said it so sternly like i meant it. i did not. i reaffirmed my love and did not have to sleep on the couch! as with most fuck-ups, this didn't actually happen today. it was over 9 years ago. my mom informed me that morning that we would be having "aunt maggie" over. i had never met this aunt, but there were plenty of other family members showing up out of nowhere, so i didn't think anything of it. we spent several hours cleaning the house to prepare, and then they arrived. aunt maggie and her two kids, a girl around my age, and a boy several years younger. we spent the whole day playing, as kids do, while my mom and my aunt talked. eventually, as the day was winding down, the three of us were in my room playing with legos. aunt maggie called to her kids, telling them it was time to go. we all came out and started saying goodbye to eachother. before leaving, the girl came to me in the kitchen and asked me if i would go on a date with her. "no." i said, wondering what kind of person asks their cousin on a date. looking back, my tone of voice was about the worst it could have been, probably sending the message "i wouldn't want to be seen in public with you." she was visibly disappointed, and left. i went back to my room afterwards and found an unfinished message written with legos. "will you go o" cute, but i'm not gonna romance my cousin. fast forward a few months, when i found out we're not actually related, and "aunt" is apparently just a term of endearment. every time i see this girl, i'm blown away. she's stunning, and i'm a moron. tl;dr: didn't date my cousin, turns out she's not my cousin. kick myself in the ass daily.i really like my girlfriend, and i think she likes me but having a relationship with her may be a bit difficult from now on. we went to her house for dinner, and everything went smoothly until we were done eating. she has a litte brother who is 5-6 years old (not sure) and he seemed to like me, and we threw his little plastic ball back and forth. he started getting competitive and threw way harder than i'd expected, so as a reflex i slapped the ball mid-air so it flew, knocked over and broke this urn. the urn contained my girlfriends grandma. without missing a beat her little brother runs out and fucking points the finger at me and said i did on purpose, and the little shit even started to cry. i tried to explain what really had happened, but they gave me the classic "we think it's best you go home now", and my girlfriend took her parents side. so here i am the day after, and she still won't return my calls or my texts. we might be done. edit: she saw my post here, since it apparently has made it to the front page of reddit, and broke it off. according to her i'm "childish and unable to take things seriously". guess first round's on me rip. edit 2: i must explain since a lot of people seem to think this is fake: i've been a reddit lurker for a long time, and only made this account to share my story with you. never imagined it would blow up like this, and i can understand you being suspicious. your comments made me realized how fucked up this whole thing was, and i wanna thank you all! you're the best :) (thank you kind redditor for the gold)today, well early am, i fucked up and got super wasted and tried to search for my bf's ex on fb, but when i typed in her name, nothing came up. i searched over and over and nothing. this evening, i see that i had posted her name all over my wall. kill me. edit. i'm a dude from canada who likes to tell stories :) edit 2. you all are so amazing, thanks for the love.so last night my girlfriend was going to be home alone. she asked if i wanted to sleep over so i said fuck yeah! i'm not allowed to sleep over her house ever. so i was super excited. i slept over and fell asleep. her parents aren't supposed to come home till around noon so we figured it's perfect since my girlfriend has to be at work by 9am. well my friends, her dad came home! now i am currently stuck in her room trying to be as quite as possible. my girlfriend left to work already and i have work in less than 3 hours. i can't sneak out because her bedroom is upstairs and he is downstairs working on shit on the computer. i will update you guys as soon as i'm out of here. hopefully it's soon edit: i've been stuck for over an hour now. no signs of him leaving. my back is starting to cramp up from not moving. less than 2 hours until i have to be at work edit 2: since so many of you keep telling me to jump out the window. i was considering it but realistically there is no way i could go through the whole thing without making a lot of noise. the layout of the house is pretty much the same as the one across. i would the window on the second floor is what we are looking at. i'm starting to consider calling work saying i might be late but i'm going to wait a little more. less than 1.5 hrs till work final update: front page!? thanks everyone! damn.. a lot of you guys really wanted me to get caught. thanks for all the suggestions and advice! i ended up waiting it out. the dad ended up taking a shower and i thought that would have been my chance but i started to think about how i sometimes leave the water running to warm up before jumping in. i didnt want to die today so i waited again. finally he left just on time for me to run home and leave for work. but seriously? you guys wanted me to kill him, tie myself up and pretend to be kidnapped, someone suggested making out with the mother? idk how that would help. i didnt do no ninja jump off the second story. if he hadn't left by a certain time, i would have been ready to take u/piercetheproper advice and done the whole pizza deal. lucky for me i didn't have to take things to that level. thanks everyone!so i was chatting up this girl and she decided she wanted to come over for some fun time, in an attempt to surprise her i planned on standing in front of my door naked and erect so when she came over it would be more sexy (stupid, i know) anyway, i hear a knock and warm myself up before opening the door only to find myself standing there, full mast in front of a horrified postman, i sprinted inside yelling sorry sorry sorry and posted this to reddit for your enjoyment instead of just forgetting it, you're welcome.this happened a couple weeks ago. im using a throwaway because i dont want this shit tied to my main account. ill try to make this as short as possible. **additional warning**: *im in my early twenties and not that experienced when it comes to sexy times. all the porn in the world couldnt have prepared me for this.* i was going out with a girl for about 6 months. it was nice. she was freaky. i liked it. she kept hinting towards butt stuff which ive never done. i was skeptical, but after talking to my friends about it, they encouraged me to give it a shot and to be "open minded." were driving one day listening to music and some song comes on and one of the lyrics were you gotta eat the booty like groceries. ill never forget this fucking song. the gf knows the song and shes singing the lyrics and shes looking directly at me while singing that line. subliminal message. fast forward a couple days and shes over at my place taking a shower, getting ready for work. i join. sexy time. be open minded rang through my mind. so i decided to try something new. i tried to eat the booty. i even went as far as to stick my tongue in her butt. i heard a oh and then the worst shit **ever** happened. she farted. i jerk back. mind you, were still in the shower so im thinking the water mixed with the fart and i have nasty fart water in my mouth. no. i spit the water out and its not just water. she pooped in my mouth. it wasnt a lot, but thats no excuse. she started apologizing, but her sorrow turned into straight laughter. she wouldnt stop laughing. i was so angry i didnt know what to do. tl;dr: i tried to eat the booty like groceries. it didnt work. today my wife decided that it would be a nice idea to take a shower together. we do it all of the time and it is a nice way to kick start our night together after work. it was a typical shower which consists of her using all of the water with me being left in the cold waiting for my turn in the warm water. after a while she decided to forfeit the water and let me have my turn. i grabbed my body wash off the shelf and proceeded to drop it. this is where i fucked up. i quickly bent down to grab it. i bent at the knees remembering that it's bad for you to bend down to grab something only using your waist. i was soon met with a painful sensation that i had never experienced before. the small push/ pull valve that changes the water from the faucet to the shower head penetrated my virgin ass. the pain was unreal. the water changed from the shower head to the faucet. i shot up trying to get away from the metal knob that just violated me. upon standing up the shower resumed. i stood there in shock looking up at my wife. she witnessed the entire thing. she won't stop laughing at me about it. it hurts to sit. tl;dr: showered with my wife trying to put something in her. ended up with something in me. edit: wording. it figures that my most successful post to date is about something metal entering my ass. the steve byrne video: i have not seen it, i swear that this is true. i'm going to watch it with my wife tonight because if it is verbatim like some of you say she will get a good laugh from it.my girlfriend has been on holidays for the last couple of weeks. it kinda sucked because it was our five month anniversary (which she took quite seriously). so we were texting and things started getting suggestive (or at least i think they were) and then she sends a message saying "hey babe skype me i have a surprise for you!" we have done skype sexy time before and that's where i thought this was leading. so i flopped it out and skyped her my erect penis taking up the entire screen. then when she answered it was her entire family: mum, dad and two little sisters (7&amp;9) there yelling in unison "happy anniversary" i freaked out and slammed the laptop shut. i since have received two messages from my girlfriend (soon to be ex i imagine) saying "what the fuck was that?!!" and "answer me!!" it is the a definite dumbest thing i've ever done. i kinda wanna die right now. edit: i know it's kinda weird that we celebrate each month but yeah i guess we're pretty young. five months is pretty long for high school couples so yeah. i still haven't heard anything from her except another text just saying "?" i don't have the balls to reply. update: so i decided to man up and text her back, it was the most awkward conversation ever! but it ended with her saying "maybe we should take a break when i get back" i should change the title to "tifu by showing my erect penis to my ex-girlfriends entire family. i was taking a two hour history final in a tightly packed room. the desks were barely a foot apart. somehow the desk behind me was pushed up to my chair and the girl behind me was bending down over her exam. i straightened up and stretched my neck by moving it back and looking at the ceiling in a swift motion (to crack my neck). my head nailed that girl on her head and she was so surprised she slammed her head into the desk. she down fell out of her chair holding her forehead and somehow pulled the desk down on top of her. she was alright and finished her exam. (first time posting on tifu) edit: and i was very, very sorry. edit: [diagram]( edit: because people doubt the existence of stretching necks. i stretch this way because it straightens my neck and cracks it. i have horrible posture so leaning my head back kinda fixes the orientation. plus it feels nice. just lean your head back all the way and stare at the ceiling for a few seconds. edit: because too many people are hurting themselves. to do this correctly just lean your head all the way back and stare at the ceiling. tl;dr during an exam i reverse-head-butted a girl behind me by stretching so as to crack my neck; she ended up on the groundfirst off; i am sorry for not articulating myself too well, english is not my first language. well, when i read all this tifu posts i find myself thinking: "done that" to a scary amount of the posts, but then it hit me, i havent seen anything like this tifu before so here it goes. just to make things clear: in norway drinking age is 18. and the sexual age is 16. to long to read? it's in audio now. this happend about 10 years ago, i was 17 years and the legal drinking age in norway is 18, but i looked older so i snuck in to a bar. i was drinking, having fun and start to talk to this lady. she did not drink so we talked about that for a while while i was getting more and more drunk. i remember that i thought "she got nice teeth". yeah that drunk. oh.so.drunk. out of the blue she asks me if i wanted to go to her place. i thought "well i've done worse" and well we left. she told me she was 28 years old, and i was impressed. i was finally getting an experienced girl. maby i could learn something new from this chick... well we get to her place and she gets undressed, so did i. she goes down on her knees to give bj, i remember thinking "how long does it take to get the d in her mouth",she finally started and wow what a bj it was, the best i've ever had. better than any sex i've ever had before. well after a period of time i was done and that's where i realised the fu. she looked up at me and smiled and she was fucking toothless!!! she had taked out the fake teeth and layed them on the floor under her. i never noticed that because....well... shitfaced. enough said. i started screaming like a girl and started walking backwards, i didn't see the shower curtan and fell in her shower while hyperventilating making small squeaky noises. for f sake!!! she looked like a toothless bulldog eating mayonnaise. well needless to say, i was scared out of my wits so i ran over my clothes, taking them with me, hiding in the kitchen, trying to get dressed. she came out to the kitchen and she had put her teeth in again, i was still scared as hell so i ran out. she started calling me but i did not answer, but after constant calling for 2 hours i took the call and the weird thing was that she started apologizing to me!!! i was shocked. on top of it all i needed a place to stay for the night so what the hell. long story short. i dated her for a year and had a whole year full of fantastic bj's. oh, and she had a gum-disease, and that is why her teeth fell out. and yes i know i was an asshole for reacting like that, but i panicked. tldr: got a bj from a toothless girl, got scared, fell in her shower while trying to escape.so i met a girl on tinder and she seemed really nice and pretty, so after a week or so of talking we decided to meet up, before i even met her at the bar i get a text that says you better not be in this for the sex... i didn't even bother answering, i get there and she is 50lbs heavier than in her pictures and later find out they were from 4 years ago... she eventually starts talking about how she isn't happy with her size. i am a bigger guy myself so i told her why don't you do what i do, i go to the gym and diet and i'm down 20lbs so far, she called me an inconsiderate asshole... so then later we started talking about snowboarding and i showed her pictures of my vermont trip and she saw one of me and my close friend who happens to be a girl, well apparently she didn't like the fact that i had a close platonic friend because all she did was question me about her for an hour, i eventually said i'm sorry i have to go and left her with the bill for my two beers. as i'm on my way home i get a text that said look what you are missing out on, it was a nude picture of herself and two videos of her masturbating and the last text said she would have played with my g spot... it was not a pretty sight and i just blocked her number... so yes that was my crazy date edit: plutonic to platonicalright reddit? i fucked up. i was in a nightclub. i was speaking to a girl and said i would buy her a drink (she agreed). i took a swig from my drink. swig went down my airway. threw up on said girl. got kicked out of the nightclub. that's it.... bye. edit: my shame is now front page. this morning i decided to rub one out before going on a family outing. i'm in the shower, and searching through some videos when my wife walks in. she sees i have the phone in the shower and gets mad. not because she knows what i'm doing, but just thinks i'm wasting time on reddit when i'm supposed to be getting ready. she opens the shower to take my phone and sees my raging boner. this does not go like it does in the movies i've been watching. she reaches for my phone, and i jerk back to exit the private browser. this is where she flips the fuck out. wife starts erupting with all her pregnancy hormones. throws my phone across the room. starts screaming about me cheating, and asking who i was talking to. she storms out, and i go after her, still naked and luckily grab a towel. she's still freaking out, and our 3 yo daughter comes in to see what's wrong. i have to try to explain to her what happened with my 3 yo there. she doesn't quite believe me. threatens to cancel family outing which involves my parents and sister. eventually she calmed down, believed me, and has been making fun of me all day. she's gone to bed now, and i'm on the couch for the night. tl;dr i tried to jerk, wife went berserk normally, getting laid would not lead to a tifu post, but today something so terribly fucked up was said that it warrants posting. my girlfriend and i are in the "honeymoon" stage of our relationship, and we have started having sex every night we are together. one thing will lead to another, and before i know it, the condom is on and we're getting it on. she had said several times that she is on birth control because she doesn't want children, so in the wee hours of the morning (after six shots of crown), it seemed like a good idea to pass on the condom. things are getting pretty heated and she is riding me cowgirl style. i warn her before i'm about to finish, and she holds me down and finishes me off inside of her. i'm basking in the afterglow, and she leans in real close and asks, "how do you know i'm on birth control?". my eyes widen, and before i can formulate a response, she says, " happy father's day". she assures me that she is really is on birth control, but i can't help but think that tifu. update: 10 hours later, my post has been discovered... many lawls were had. i think i have a keeper!so the story goes... i'm male and i posted "i'm pregnant!" on my facebook wall for april 1st and things spiraled out of control. but first there are a few things you should know about me. 1. i'm 100% male, testicles penis and everything. 2. i have a gf that my family doesn't like. 3. my family is extremely conservative. so later in the day my mother calls and when i pick up she is hysterical, screaming, and is basically disowning me. i'm bewildered and entirely confused so try i ask her through the screaming, what did i do wrong? she says "you got your girlfriend pregnant", and that's when it dawned on me. my little super obviously a joke facebook post on april first saying "i'm pregnant!" actually tricked my family leading them to chain call each other to gossip about how i got my girlfriend pregnant. long story short, my whole extended family is pissed off at me and thinks i got my girlfriend pregnant, i almost got disowned, and i won april 1st this year. fml....this happened around 9 years ago now, but is probably the most embarrassing thing that i have ever done. the premise was ordinary enough, i wanted to ask the girl i had a huge crush on out on a date. i gave her a call and no answer. that's fine, i'll just leave a message saying i called and i would call her back. like most teenage boys, i was super nervous, and because of this i wanted to make sure the voice mail message was perfect. not too interested, not too uninterested. this was easy enough as i could start leaving a message and if i didn't like it i could delete it and rerecord. easy enough. another thing i should note; when i get up the courage to do something i talk to myself. i try to psych myself into it, saying things like "come on man, you got this" or "no big deal, stay calm" about half way into the 7th or 8th try into the voicemail i'm startled by a voice that i will never forget *mailbox full. goodbye* and then a click. ... it was at that point to my horror i realized that although i was pressing the restart button, i had to first hit a different key to enter the menu for the restart to take place. i didn't start my message over 8 times. instead i left one obscenely long message comprised of me starting over again and again with phrases in between that talked about how i needed a good message because i liked the girl so much. i wish i could say at this point i never saw her again, but i was young and stupid and tried to convince myself it wasn't so bad. it would be several more months before i realized she wasn't playing hard to get. the memory however lives on. edit: several people are asking about what happened afterwards. it's not very interesting. she was always one of those people who tried her best not to make people feel bad and so it was never directly brought up and she tried to ignore me. the end of me having a crush on her actually occurred when i finally confronted her and made her tell me she didn't like me. it made her feel super uncomfortable but at least i got closure and we both finally got to feel awkward. or something.so this just happend and apparently i am single now. my gf randomly calls me and ask me if on my birthday i wanna have a threesome with her and her female friend. i obviously suspecting it to be a trick question said no and i genuinely didn't care about threesome as i don't want to cheat on my girl. she kept pushing me and sending me her friend's pictures and saying how we should be trying new things and it will be fun. at that point i thought maybe that's something she wants to try and after a good 30 mins of persuasion i agreed to it. she hung up on me after and texted me saying it's over and that she was just testing me. i feel like an ass now. edit: thanks for the comments and support guys, i really appreciate it. i just woke up and saw 7 missed calls from her. got her text saying "if you ever loved me, pick up the phone". edit: here is my last message to her this morning. [img] [img] edit: sorry about my bad texting, it's just a habit of shortening everything when i talk to her on messenger. no updates for now. updates: she tried calling me 20 times already and messaged me saying she still loves and wants to make it work. i am not gonna do it. updates: ok this is getting pretty messed up. she just texted me a pic of her with blood on her wrist. this is freaking me out. what should i do? update: called her brother and she is ok. update: she faked the blood on her wrist!! crazyyyy so reading the story about the guy "fucking the shit" out of a girl reminded me of this story. your typical "this didnt happened today but a few years ago" so i was 22 and in the army. i had my share of one night stands and random relationships and so on. so i had met this girl and we dated on and off for a couple months. it wasnt super serious but we had fun and at that time thats all that mattered. we broke up a few weeks before i went on leave (vacation) and hadnt spoke for about a month. as i was coming back we started texting. we werent ready to jump back into dating but decided to be fwb. so talking my entire drive back the subject of anal had come up. i had never done it but was eager to do so. she had done it a few times but she didnt think it was all that great but was willing to do it for me. we talked about all the aspects of it, making sure she was cleaned up what i should expect and do and so on. by the time i got back in to town and took a short nap we were ready to hang out. we ended up watching a movie and hanging out. now i have to explain my barracks. it was 3 separate rooms and a shared kitchen and bathroom. they kept the rooms that werent occupied locked. thankfully an incident had happened and a guy had kicked his door open and they hadnt been back out to fix it (the guy had moved to another room already) so we decided to use the room bare mattress and all to do the deed. we get down to business and everything is going good and im ready to mount up. so i start going to town and everything is feeling great and she is enjoying it too. i pulled out for a second and i stop...i lock down at my dick and it is covered in shit. its not normal dark brown stuff but it was more of a grey speckled color. i dont say a word but i run to the bathroom. i run to the shower and thrust me dick into the water trying to clean it off without touching it. she is waiting in the bedroom when i come back. as i start explaining it to her she realizes what happened. she glanced down at the mattress and there is grey specks all over the place they trail all the way up her leg and all over the place. we formulated a plan to get everything cleaned up and we both shower and she leaves. the story does have a happy ending because i ended up marrying her and weve been together almost 3 years now. tl;dr girl pooped on my dick so i put a ring on it. edit: holy poop on a stick (or on a dick maybe) batman this blew up! some of the questions i keep seeing: i was young and stupid she claims she cleaned up multiple times guess she didnt get it all out. the gray speckle was the poop. why was it grey? i have no idea i'm not a poopologist and never cared to research it. she has no health problems, she's having elective surgery at the end of the month and everything says she is fine. i think she didnt realize poop was on her. she was probably embarrassed i mean i hauled ass to the bathroom as soon as i saw poop dick. edit2: this blew up more than ever! thank you stranger for the gold! this is the best birthday present a redditor could ask for!i (27 year old male) live with a close female(29 year old) friend of mine. i have known her all my life and she is like family. i came down for breakfast this morning and my roommate made a joke about interrupting my masturbating for eggs and bacon. it was funny. i laughed, she laughed, her boyfriend laughed. to take the joke a step further i joked back that i was not doing that, the way to tell is to hand me something after i leave my room, if i refuse to take it with my right hand then she knows. less laughter, awkward silence ensues. i realize i made shit weird and change the topic. i put the whole thing out of my mind and go to work. when i got home from work today i went up to my room to read. when i came down my roommate walked out of her room, handed me some papers, nodded and walked off. every time i would come out of room she would come up and hand me something. finally it happened. i was browsing the internet and somehow found porn... after i go to walk to the bathroom and my roommate hands me two books. i grab them both with my left hand and start walking away. she bursts out laughing and runs to tell her boyfriend. tifu by giving my roomie a jerk off detector and she thinks it is hilarious. edit: today i came down for breakfast and my roommate hands me toast. i take it with my right hand, walk to the table, swap it with her toast with my left hand and proceed to carefully eat it using only the left. she had no idea how to react. after i was done i washed my hands and left her standing there trying to figure out what to do. edit 2 for clarification. my room is on the only room on the top floor. it opens to a set of switchback stairs and leads to the hallway. her room is opposite the stairs. the bathroom is down the hall. i pass her room on the way to the bathroom. edit 3 for yet more clarification. i won't touch my dick and then not wash my hands after. i spent many years as a cook and some habits die hard. first time using tinder. i thought what the heck, might as well try it and see what happens. fast forward to a few weeks later, i matched up with a very lovely woman and we decided to meet up. we met up at a restaurant in the city. had a few drinks and a few laughs with some delicious food. we also take a stroll around the city having a nice talk and getting to know each other. as the night ended i took her home as her friend dropped her off at the restaurant initially. i parked up in front of her home and was saying goodnight. she asked if i would like to come in side for a bit. i knew i scored big time so i was cheering. as i walked in it seemed like she wasn't living alone. it was a pretty big house. i asked if she lived with anyone and she said she lives with her sister but she's out of town and has the house to herself for a week. we sat on the couch and eventually one thing led to another. next thing you know i carry her to her bedroom and she starts going down on me. that is until the door flung wide open with her husband staring straight at both of us. yes, her husband! i guess he was the sister out of town? he immediately starts charging at me as i stood there helplessly. he hit me with a flew blows and i was swinging back to get him away from me. i dazed him out with two punches to his jawline, push him real hard that he moved out the way and i hit the runner straight to the front door. all this was happening while she (his so called wife) was screaming as us to stop fighting. this happened about an hour ago and i currently have a bag of cold peas on my left cheek thinking fuck me. did i just really ruin a home, i honestly feel pretty awful. i wonder what is happening to her now aye. so long for online dating. tl;dr. went on a tinder date, husband walked in on us, all hell broke loose. **update!!!** as cliche as it sounds i didn't expect this post to become as big as it is now. many people are calling this story fake but you can say what you want. the deed has been done.. unfortunately. i woke up this morning thinking what the fuck. first, recapping of what happened, i actually couldn't believe it. second, seeing this post blow up on reddit with great advice from redditors, it really had me thinking. i am not going to press charges because in reality, the husband is going through enough already and i wouldn't want anything else to be a greater burden on him. i took them punches like a man and now i just have to deal with it. what i am going to do though is write a letter explaining the whole backstory and leave it in their mailbox with a 12 pack on top of it. i deleted tinder and blocked the whores number. i think i should leave the dating game on the side for nowa while and concentrate on myself. i'm just going to have a quiet night to myself tonight and relax hoping this bruise on my face heals quicker than usual. beware of australian women!!!!this literally just happened 1 hour ago. so i'm just sitting in the classroom, working on some stuff when my art teacher comes to my friend and asks him if she can use his scissors. he doesn't mind and hands her the scissors. she starts cutting something, and in the corny mood that i am i say "nice scissoring, miss". just as i realised what i said she looks me in the eye with a cold look on her face. i immediately say that i'm sorry after which she walks away and doesn't speak to me again for the whole lesson. did i mention she's lesbian? reddit, tifu. so just to set the stage here my wife is currently surfing the red tide solo. during these monthly events my board is kicking it on the beach waiting for better days. so after watching the family friendly tosh.o we've been playing the scare game trying to freak each other out on random occasions. of course i am the master having got the kids and the wife numerous times and they have failed to scare me yet. but enough of me beating my chest, lets get to the fuck up. so the 14 year old is grounded and stuck at home and the 8 and 9 year olds have just finished their homework. my gorgeous wife calls me saying that she is almost home and that i should get the kids out of the house and take them to the park where she will meet us later after she gets home and changes. thats when it hits me... what a perfect opportunity for the four of us to scare the crap out of her. the first thing she does when she gets home is go to our closet to change clothes. so i hatch the plan with the kids that we should pretend we went to the park but instead hide in the closet to scare mom instead. everyone loved the idea especially since it didnt involve them being freaked out for once. so we see her pull into the alley and we scramble into the closet and wait. im trying to get them to all stop snickering as we hear the garage door close. then come the foot steps down the hall... her purse hits the desk and we can hear her fumbling around the room. the dresser drawer opens and in the back of my head a brain cell lights up... but no thats not going to happen... and then it does. bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz and moans start to fill the room. i look at the puzzled faces of the two innocent ones and the revolting shock of disgust on the 14 year old and did the only thing i could think to do.... "hey angel we are in the closet and we were going to scare you. coming out in 1 minute." we are still trying to process this event. but needless to say im still laughing my ass off and she has this sheepish look on her face. not sure what we are going to say to the 8 &amp; 9 year old... and i think the 14 year old will never be the same again. so there ya go.i got home from work this evening and was getting ready to go to the gym. a few moments before heading out the door i was opening some snapchats i had received earlier in the day, and just as i was about to exit the application i received one from my cousin (female) who never snapchats me (male), we missed each other in college by about a year so i was kind of excited to hear from her and see what kind of shenanigans she was getting into to these days. so at the exact same time that i receive a barrage of texts from her i open up the snapchat to receive full frontal nudity of my dearest cousin. of course the texts were "do not open that snapchat from me" "do not" "i swear to god do not" i swear these have to be the three fastest consecutive texts in the history of human motion. so there's that in my life now. cousin if you see this since i know you reddit, sorry for sharing but at least its fauxnonymous [edit] 1. washington state, no alabama involved 2. no reddit, i did not screenshot it lol 3. there will be no wincest in this guy's future 4. she's not really my type anyway 5. i made it to the gym, and it actually was leg day :dwhen i was in high school years ago, my girlfriend and i would often fool around on the couch in her parents living room. her parents would always go upstairs to watch tv in the evening, so this worked out perfectly for us. during this one particular evening, we both ended up falling asleep with half our clothes off (unintentionally) and slept right through until the morning. i was shocked to wake up the next morning to the sound of her dad's footsteps upstairs. i threw my clothes on in record time and tried to run out of the house but that plan did not succeed. i did make it as far as the front door just as her dad was coming down the stairs. her dad is clearly surprised to see me. he slowly says to me: "oh, hello kangar, what are you doing here?" ok, it was 5:30 in the morning, so this is what comes out of my mouth. i say: "oh, hi mr. jones, i'm just going out fishing for the day, and thought i would come say hello to susan first." to my great astonishment, he buys this explanation. he smiles, wishes me good luck fishing, and goes to read the morning paper. susan told me that years later she told her mom this story, and the two of them still laugh at her dad for falling for this. edit: to all those who continue to send me hate mail about how my tifu post wasn't actually today: take 30 seconds of your life and actually go and read the subreddit's rules and regulations. particularly rule 1a. jesus.my wife is a flight attendant and she is gone for 4-5 days art a time. we have been married for 24 years and i really miss her when she's gone. we have 3 children, ages 8, 10, and 12. the 8 year old is our only girl. she is a fucking vampire. she likes to sleep late and stay up late. anyway, on thanksgiving day, my wife flew in and she missed me a lot! in so many words, she told me what she was going to do to me that night after the kids were in bed. it made me blush. so around 9ish, we told the kids to brush their teeth and we would read to them a bit then it was off to bed. after reading to them, my wife said, "you guys get in the bed and don't come downstairs and bother mommy and daddy. we are going to sit on the laptop and do some christmas shopping for you." well, this made them run upstairs and get right in the bed. we waited about ten minutes and it was sexy time! i won't get into details but let's just say my wife really missed me and was vocal about it. about halfway through our sexy time, i hear a knock on the door. we immediately stop what we are doing. we are dead silent, hoping whoever it is will go away. thirty seconds go by and i hear the sweet sound of my precious 8 year old daughter say, "are you guys still christmas shopping?" my wife says, "yes, we are. go back upstairs." my little angel says, "well, all i can hear is ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh!" immediately i lose my mojo. end of sexy time.original post here: *originally i posted this on tuesday but those darn mods wouldn't let me. it's fine now.* okay, so like i said i went into school today and at lunch went to the library. she wasn't there this time around, so i went to the cafeteria. now, i had gotten strange looks and some laughs earlier in the day, so i knew she had spread the word with my mastery to masturbate. when i went into the cafeteria, i saw her with her friends, so i decided to sit alone at the table across from her. i had no lunch as usual, so i simply stared at her for, say, thirty seconds before realizing i was being cringy so i went up and sat as close to her as possible. immediately, her friends either giggled or called me nasty and told me to sit away from them, so i acted. i read every single comment, and i chose was i thought would be the most flattering and best plan by combining a couple of suggestions. in front of all her friends, i said something like this: "gf, i'm sincerely sorry for disgusting you. however, i want you to know that the very reason i chose to jack off to you was because i cared about you." i obviously wasn't that eloquent, but she was blushing, so i thought i was doing well. "over all the naked women on the internet, i chose your body to lust to. i had hoped you'd think it's flattering." i was wrong about how i was doing. "don't talk to me anymore", said gf. i was desperate, so i used what i learned from nofap. "gf, i haven't jacked off to you in nearly a month. please, i do not jack off anymore. not in 25 days." she ignored me. i left, in defeat and shame. we're officially broken up and i'm now known as the fapmaster around school. *edit* i'm fapmaster flash now. a lot of things happened since tuesday. this isn't the right sub for the story, though.throwaway, because the gf knows my account. this happened last friday and i finally got the stains out of the sheets. i took the girlfriend out to dinner as a celebratory meal for her finishing school. a nice meal, two glasses of wine, her cheeks are rosy, she wants to go home. ok, no prob. she was also pretty horny. so one thing lead to another, i have her all wound up, i slip off her dress and she decides to go down on me. you can see where this is going. i'm lying on the bed full erect and she's got me in her mouth, slowly and sensually going up and down. the odd quick one and more sucking, shit this is awesome. so then she goes way down. -way- down. and i've never felt that before. and in my pure moment of body numbing pleasure, with my balls getting that tingly feeling, my hips thrust ever so slightly. well that little movement invoked the gag reflex of a full stomach, horny, and fairly drunk college graduate. she puked up two glasses of wine, half of a fruit crumble with ice cream, her salmon filet on wild rice, and one quarter of a bun, buttere,d all over my erect penis while it was in her mouth. all over my balls, in her hair, all over my lap, on my comforter, and a good portion of my sheets. still plan on marrying her though.it's 7:30am on black friday and a few buddies of mine were getting breakfast at a restaurant before heading out climbing for the day. the restaurant is busy and full of middle aged people we assume are out for the day to enjoy a nice morning meal before enjoying the cold but sunny day. it's a small town so anyone who wanted to do some crazy black friday shopping probably drove out of town. i was wrong. as we're eating, i looked across the street at a local shoe store that a woman just unlocked and walked into. she was getting the store and cash register ready and i realize it's an old ex girlfriend from early high school who got surprisingly attractive. i decided to step out of the restaurant for a second and walk over for a quick chat and see how she's been doing. i'm dressed in dirt bag climber style (cut off jeans with long johns on underneath, beanie, ripped shirt etc) and look a little ridiculous as i approach the store entrance. i knocked on the glass and she looked over and took a second to realize who i was. she smiled, came over and unlocked the door to let me in and give me an awkward hug. at that moment i'm giving her a hug, her eyes lit up. i turned to see every fucking person in the restaurant comes running over and through the doors of the shoe store. she obviously still didn't have the register ready, an open sign on, anything ready for the epic retail workers nightmare of black friday. they came pouring in, her face is going "oh god, no no no no no no no." and all i say is, "shit, i'm sorry. i'm headed climbing now, good luck!" and walked out. i returned across to the now nearly empty restaurant to visit my friends. "dude, we just saw that all go down. you just ruined that girls day!" moral of the story, black friday is a terrible day to get a retail workers number. so this happened last night. with all the buzz about this 50 shades movie, i decided to understand s&amp;m. so i spanked myself a few times, (i'm male btw) and got nothing from it. so i decided to go to town and spank myself as hard as i could, alas nothing. so here's where things went south. i went to my girlfriends place that night, and as we were about to do the no pants dance, she noticed 2 red hand prints on my ass. she flipped her shit, and i mean flipped her shit. she was screaming at me saying i was a dirty cheat. i tried explaining that they were my hand prints but she couldn't believe that "anyone would be that retarded." she won't return my calls or messages now. what do i do? tldr: spanked myself that hard that it broke my relationship.before going into the story itself i have to give a bit of background. one of the important part of my work is going to professional conferences, parties or trade shows. it's a fairly small world so i end up meeting the same 100 people at least once a week in a social setting (think open bar and free food). naturaly after a few years like that you start making aquaintances/drinking friends, especially among the few people among my age. one of these people is a cute young lady with whom i share a passion about videogames, and we usually chat about that while hitting the bar. all in all just a friend. last night we met at a party where so where also invited and where i met her boyfriend of a few years (who she wanted to marry) i introduce myself and then she and i start to chat about our latest favorite game (pillars of eternity for those wondering). after some time i go to the bar to grab a few glasses for me, her and her bf (yay free champagne) and when i come back a couple minutes later said boyfriend is throwing a tantrum about "how she's looking at me" an then storms off shouting that it's over between them. i then proceed to my friend that has become a teary meldown and put her into a cab to go back home. i then proceed to my own place and proceed to my daily skype session my own girlfriend (long distance sucks guys). i tell her what just happenned to the party, and she then starts to act coldly and ends the session quite fast. i then woke up this morning to a text telling me that she's breaking up with me because "where there's smoke there's fire, you were obviously hitting on her". so i'm now single and the single positive fact of the day is that me and my newly single friend are going to hit the bars tonight to get wicked drunk (we both need it). tl/dr : crazy jealous bf breaks up with my friend because he thinks she's into me. my own gf proceeds to break up with me because she thinks i did something wrong. gonna get wicked drunk tonight. update : too much beer, too much shots. the hangover is strong. nothing happened, this was not some damn romcom. :'dso this fuck up happened on halloween night but was removed due to it not being the weekend. i was out for halloween with my mates, we were out in a club and we bumped into some people i know from university. i had just dropped some ecstasy like essentially everyone else there and was having a pretty good time. now their is a mature student in our class shes 33 and is an attractive women, married and has two kids.we got talking and she ended up dropping a pill. we all arrive back at my house a group of about 7 people, where she tells me that she is a swinger and her and her husband have an open relationship. we are both on a serious lovebuzz so i think what the hell lets do this. we have wild sex after some encouragement to get my not so eager little man in the mood. so fast forward to the morning shes just left and i'm fighting the mother of all hangovers and what i know to b a fairly ruthless skag. i pass out and for a few hours and wake up a few hours later to some very angry messages from her husband on fb. he wants to know what the fuck i'm doing fucking his wife? valid question only for the fact that i was under the impression that this was all above aboard. how wrong was i. he wants to talk to me so i man up and give him my number because the last thing i want is him beating down my door and causing a scene. i explained myself to him and told him i was under the impression they didn't have a monogamous relationship and i genuinely wasn't trying to cause any hassle. the conversation is short i think he was some what surprised that i didn't try to weasel out of my actions. so fast forward another few hour's and i'm lying here on my bed typing this, just heard from a friend that shes been kicked out of the house with her dog and a bag. i feel so terrible, i don't know if they actually were swingers or not but all i know i could have potentially played a direct role in the destruction of a family. i'll have to confront this situation again on monday but until than i wont be leaving this room. tldr *i 22 had sex with a 33yr married classmate with kids who i believed to be in a swingers relation, husband finds out gets in contact with me, kicks her out of the house and is not best pleased about the situation.*** sorry for the lack of grammar people... i hang my head in shame.this actually took place over the course of a few months. we drive to see my girlfriend's grandmother a lot on weekends. the grandmother lives in a different state and it gives the girlfriend and i a lot of time in the car together. being a pretty boring drive, we usually help time go by by having karaoke parties, playing the alphabet game (race from a-z finding words that start with the next letter on signs), or arguing about whodunnit in serial. being such a long drive (about 6.5 hours one way), we of course hold hands occasionally. cute boring stuff. well, usually we'll say "i love you" as we hold hands and i got it in my head on one trip that i'd mess with her. it started with me putting my hand on her knee, giving it a light squeeze and saying, "i love you." she'd respond likewise and we'd continue. i'd do this a couple times each way. then i began to do it when we're on the couch watching something or just in general sitting next to one another. not too often, but enough to form a habit. then i started to just squeeze her leg. my plan worked perfectly. without realizing it she'd look at me, flash that great beam of a smile and tell me she loves me. for a few weeks i enjoyed a game that only i knew we were playing, chuckling to myself in satisfaction. finally, i couldn't take it anymore. it was just too good. i had to tell her. this was a mistake. she couldn't believe she didn't notice it for so long and wonders what else i'm doing to mess with her. now when i squeeze instead of saying she loves me i get scowl and an eye roll. but eventually she does still say it. tl;dr: my lovely pavlovian belle, loved my touch and all was swell, until i did sing, now when the bell rings, all i hear is "go to hell" edit: since so many have asked, msryael is not in fact the gf.i was in the kitchen reading the paper at the table, and my one year old was sitting in her high chair at the head of the table. everything was fine until she started to try and rock back and forth in her chair when she tipped back a little too far and started to fall backwards. like a cat, i sprung out of my chair towards her to save her from falling. except...that's not what actually happened. it did happen in my head...as i was dreaming it. what actually happened was, my wife was happily sleeping next to me, while i was dreaming this, and was rudely awoken by the force of both my hands slamming into her skull. i found out this morning, that when she asked 'wtf was that for', i muttered something unintelligible and rolled over and went back to sleep. tldr: dreamt i was saving kid's life. punched my wife in the head. so i got off early from work today and came inside. my wife had been over at the neighbor's place and was just coming back inside. i was just about to leave the bathroom (right next to our back door) and impulsively thought i could be really funny. so, waiting for the perfect moment, i opened the door and yelled right as she walked past. it was perfect. she screamed and jumped really badly, and then began to laugh really hard as she realized what had happened. but there was one thing i had not taken into account during my impulsive decision. my wife was 39 1/2 weeks pregnant. keyword: was. yep. i scared my wife into labor. at first we thought it was just flase contractions again, but very quickly realized that this was the real thing. thirteen hours later and we have a beautiful, healthy baby girl. everything worked out well, but during labor my wife was not amused (though the doctor was a little) when she told him what had caused her to go into labor. still, lesson learned: do not try to be funny by scaring your heavily pregnant wife.this happend just 2-3 hours ago. today is my first day of my internship at a supermarket. for my internship i need to do a research. they put me in an office with an one-way window that has a view over the store, mainly the cash registers. i have a friend who works at this supermarket and this is how i got my internship at the store. after 2 hours of my internship i spoke with my friend. she told me that one of the cashiers thought i was cute. i was curious who it was because i never had a girlfriend before and have a low self-esteem. she pointed out who it was. i was really excited. so i went back to the office and stared at her for a good 15 minutes through the one-way window. she sometimes looked at the window but i was like 'hey, you can't see me through this window' so i kept staring at her. i was pretty sure she was just looking at customers who were near the window. i left the office to go to the toilet. while i was heading back to the office i realized i could see through the window. welp, apparently if you switch the lights on of the office the effect of the one-way window goes away. i have been basically staring at her with a creepy face for full 15 minutes and she knew. i bet she doesn't think that i'm cute anymore.yesterday afternoon, i was just finishing my homework and ready to unwind with some mario kart. last time i saw the game was in my sister's room. i thought she was at a friend's house, so i barged right in to take it back. i opened the door, and my heart stopped. my sister was home after all, and she was having a moment with herself. no covers, shorts down, everything on display. she screamed like something from a horror movie, and i slammed the door. i stood there in shock for a moment. "are you getting dressed?" i asked, hoping to convince her that i didn't realize what she was doing. no way she'd fall for that though. i very clearly got the full show, an image that i fear will be burned into my brain forever. fuck, this is my little sister. i'm not supposed to see her having a hand party. i've been avoiding her since.most front page tifu i see involve sex. /r/circlejerk makes allusions to this with "tifu by putting my penis into my girlfriend's vagina" more and more i see tifu which just seem to be people either wanting to say they've had sex, or making completely fake stories with plot holes in their own stories. i get the weekend rule, which is fantastic, but what happened to this subreddit? before i had this account it was my first subreddit to browse, and now it just seems to be kids acting like my example below. but since this is tifu, i must provide a tifu: ex. tifu by being so *fucking* better than you. i also had sex. with a girl. in her vagina. the upper one. she came. then her sister heard us having sex and insisted she join because im so good. then my already 12 inch penis grew 4 more inches, before i became president of the world. tl;dr - im better than you.today, my gf and i went to go get our nails done together (as good lesbians do). i was really excited for the massage chairs, and unbeknownst to be, they were a little more intense then the ones i am used to. when i sat down, the woman to the left of me commented on how the chair was massaging her ass and she seemed uncomfortable. i figured she was overreacting... that is until the woman who was going to give me a pedicure turned on my chair. the woman to my left was right, it was a butt massage, but as i was sitting straight up with my butt in the back of the chair, it hit a different spot. i squealed and my girlfriend gave me a look to shut up, and there were about 20 other women in the place so i didn't want to make a scene. i was like a deer in the headlights, frozen and unable to move, crippled with the anxiety of anyone finding out i was getting a hitachi magic wand straight to my clitoris. needless to say, i came more than once and almost kicked the woman giving me a pedicure in the face. the chick to my left definitely knew, and gave me cut-eye as she walked out. tl;dr: show me on the doll where the chair touched you.okay it seems that i must post that this wasn't today but like 18 years ago in hs. i was set up on a blind date by a buddy of mine. i was the quiet but funny and nerdy kid who was essentially the king of the band geeks. she was a conservative and quiet girl about my age from the rich part of town. we talked on the phone for a few days (as was the style at the time) and i worked up the gumption to ask her out on a date-date. she said yes. i picked her up, and after some basic pleasantries with her mother, we drove off in my car. "where are we going?" she asked. well shit. i hadn't actually connected the idea that i needed to plan. normally i just wing it. so... i winged it.... "where nobody can hear you scream" i replied. i chuckled and kept driving, thinking that she got my "joke". a minute of awkward silence later and i asked "where would you like to go?" "home" she said with the defeat in her voice that you'd expect from a 10 minute date-gone-wrong. shortest date ever.there's a girl from my high school who i am very good friends with, and was pretty cute in my opinion. we both had a passion for soccer and also had a few classes together. naturally, as we began to hang out more and more throughout the year, i began to like her very much. fast forward to the end of the year. our school had a last chance dance and we both went. we danced together for the night and overall had a great time. when it finally ended (unfortunately), we began talking outside near her car in the parking lot. it was just small talk, mainly unconscious yelling due to the extremely loud music, and eventually we began to talk about how great the last chance dance was. i told her that she wasn't too bad at dancing, and then she replied with "oh, you don't even know". obviously, i asked her what she meant, and she said "don't worry about it". changing the subject, she then proceeded to tell me about how she got new seats in her car and was wondering if i wanted to help "break them in(;". not sure what i was thinking for this next part. this hint went completely over my head, and i gave her a high five. what. the. fuck. a high five. she then smiled a little disappointedly (another detail i failed to notice), gave me a hug, said our goodbyes, and then got in her car and left. as her car disappeared, it hit me. i just cockblocked myself. tl;dr my crush asked to have fun in her back seat after a school dance, and i gave her a high five. update: i called her up and asked her to get coffee and maybe go to a local scenic spot in my area. keep in mind, this spot is infamous for hooking up and such because of its emptiness and scenic views. so, i picked her up, and we soon hit it off just like before. it got pretty late and we were just chilling at the parking lot and the topic came toward the last time we saw each other (the time where i cockblocked myself like a handicapped retard). utilizing a technique i picked up from r/seduction, i cut her off during her sentence by saying "wait." and then i kissed her. things began to escalate, and i'll keep the details to myself. afterwards, she told me, with a smile, that i was an asshole for not fixing the problem earlier. thanks guys and r/seduction coming in clutch! never again, i promise! just kidding, knowing me, it'll probably happen next time. this actually happened about two weeks ago. my sister recently died at the age of 32. we were very close. her funeral was held at the lutheran church she was married in. right before they started the service (after the viewing), i went to give my sister a kiss one last time. when i went to stand up, i tripped over the altar they put out to kneel on. falling forward, i put my hands out to brace myself which happen to be on the inside of the casket, on the ledge next to the hinge of the lid. it pushed the casket backwards. luckily, no major harm was done. the men put it back upright, fixed her hair, and placed her gifts next to her again. i swear if she were here, she would laugh so loudly. my mom was so upset she was hysterical, and my step dad held back a chuckle. this is my life. edit: wow! thank you all so much for your show of support. it means a lot that you shared your experiences and laughs. it was a funny moment for me, and i still get teased that i 'knocked 'em dead'. just fyi, she died of complications from vasculitis. in the end, her heart just wasn't strong enough to keep going. once again, i appreciate all the well wishes!ok, so this just happened about a half hour ago. my wife and i are in the process of potty training our daughter and we have a tiny minnie mouse toilet that has a bucket like apparatus that sits under the seat for catching all "boop boops." i work late hours and last night after getting home i had me a couple adult beverages before heading to bed. fast forward a few hours later i'm woken up from my daughter screaming in her bed, which usually means get me now or i'm going potty all over my bed. so i go in and grab her and take her to do her business. i didn't turn the light on in the hopes i could put her back to bed for a bit longer. i set her on her seat and she starts to go. hearing your little spawn let their bladder go is one of the best sounds ever. you know that you don't have to clean a big mess and that the tons of money for diapers are gone. i'm sure anyone who potty trained their little one knows what i mean. anywho while she's going my happiness turns to confusion as my foot is getting wet. when she is done we go through our high fives and i send her to get in bed with mommy. i turn the light on and instantly realize that her mom had not put the bucket thingy back into the potty after cleaning it, so she had actually peed through the potty not in the potty. not only that, she was now chilling in our bed with her mom asking why is her feet wet? i just wanted everyone to know that we have acquired a new seat so she can actually use the big person potty. my only worry now is that we don't forget it's not in there at some point and have her fall in. so this actually happened a few months ago, when i started my new job. so i'm an intern at a small web-development company. i'm here to write code but because there's not a lot of work going i frequently leave the building to go for smoke breaks. the building we're in has a couple of other companies in it. some of the other people are really nice but some see others as competition and treat people accordingly. so first week, i hold open a door for a woman who works on the floor below us. she tells me that it's offensive for someone to hold hold the door open because shes a woman, i just leave it and tell her i'd do it for anyone, she's pretty pissed so i took the stairs instead of taking the elevator with her. here the tifu really begins. so a few weeks later, i'm coming in from a smoke break i was on my phone, trying to get my auto correct to work. i walk through the door and see someone coming towards the door so as i always do, i hold it open. now this morning i was particularly annoyed, tired and stressed. i peek up from my phone to look at who's coming and it's her, mrs door assault. so i simply let the door go and get into the elevator. she mustn't have been looking as she got to the door because she walks straight into it, this big ass fire door. she breaks her nose and falls backwards, just as the elevator door closes. i saw her hit the door and fall backwards because fire doors close slowly to avoid slamming. according to my boss she was bleeding pretty bad. i feel like a total ass for the whole thing but everyone i work with thinks it's pretty funny. i tried apologizing to her a few days ago in the staff room and she ignored me completely. still feel very bad and i no longer take my smoke breaks for fear of injuring someone. tl;dr: broke someones nose because they didn't like having doors opened for them.thanks for the gold! one of the brave and few, this actually happened today. i was talking in the hallway with one of my friends who is a girl and today is pajama day at our school. peoe were walking by and we were just talking im fairly comfortable with most of my friends that are girls so i wanted to see what shirt she was wearing so i do what any teenage male that doesn't think before he acts. i unzipped her hoodie in the middle of a hallway where many people were traveling through. she wasnt wearing a shirt so after showing everyone in the hallway my friends melons lots of nervous laughter and red faces. being yelled at and laughed at im sitting across the table from her in study hall and the first thing she says to me after a couple hours "i told your mother" edit: 1. holy shit frontpage 2. senior in high school, its spirit week, not sure if people actually saw since no one reacted besides me and her, but there was that chance 3. if you don't believe idk its the fucking internet heres a screenshot of a text you reddit detectives.[screenshot (edited so you cant see her number)]( so this just happened, and my face is still red. mcdonalds as some of you may know is doing this "pay it with love" promotion. my girlfriend and her son came to have lunch with me and the only real kid friendly place near work is mcdonalds while ordering the cashier says "you can pay this with love, you can give a hug, or high five, blow a kiss". so i turn to my right with the intent to hug my girlfriend, as i do i reach one hand to give her butt a playful grab while my left hand goes out to a guy standing there to give him a high-five. it's then i realized my girlfriend was standing on my left, and i was just hugging and placing my hand on a strange woman's backside, all while trying to get a slap hand from her husband. the couple looked to be in their 50's or 60's. what made it worse was not only did the husband start to go for the high-five and stop, but when i realized my mistake and tried to correct to hug my girlfriend, she recoiled too out of pure awkwardness, making me out to look like some weird fast food molester... i will be "paying with cash" from now on! *edit. holy cow gold! thanks! and i though the only thing i was gaining from this was free artery clogging food and the memory of cupping that round cheek.so this story of mine happened about a year ago, and i don't think i will ever forget what happened that day. i used to work at this certain coffee corporation, ya know, the one that pretty much rules over the world. my store had this regular customer that would come in every single day, and there was always something to yell at us about. her coffee was burnt, the tables are gross, it's too loud, we're all out to get her, etc. she was really ocd and freaked out if you so much as got a splash of water on the side of her cup. after about two years of dealing with this woman, biting my tongue and trying my best to give her the best "experience" she can get (even harder since i was a supervisor), one day i just snapped. i saw her in line and immediately braced myself for impact. i tried to do everything for her the way she wants it, and of course it backfired. she usually liked to put her lids on herself, so instead of snapping it on, i just set it on top and informed her of what i did. she asked me why i did that and i told her that i'm just trying to be convenient to her. this bitch just started **yelling** at me, telling me i'm trying to burn her on purpose and get her sent to the hospital, and how she's going to complain to corporate as she always does. i literally lost it at her ungrateful attitude. she said "how about you just get someone else to take care of me?!" here's my fuck up, i responded with "how about you stop being such a *fucking bitch*?!?!" instantly my store got quiet, and at this point i'm on a fucking roll so i'm just yelling at this customer, venting all of my two years of pent up aggression. my other supervisor had to drag me off the floor to calm down, and i just turned the keys over and left. several customers actually clapped for me when i was on my way out, saying they were proud of me for sticking up for myself. i'm just like "yay, there goes my fucking job", even though i felt amazing about it. i called my boss and told him what happened, his only response was "oh boy...", as this kind of thing was inevitable. in the end, i got a write-up and didn't lose my job, even though she was doing her damn hardest to get both me and my boss fired. this lady has a track record in our entire district of being a cunt, and this final issue was enough to get her banned from every store in our district. i fucked up big time, but amazing things came out of it. moral of the story, don't take anyone's shit. tl;dr: cursed out a customer, almost got fired, ended up getting her banned from our district. edit: wow, you guys are awesome. first big post and i made the front page! i got gilded too which is wicked sweet. it's been a bit of a hectic day for me, so this cheers me up a lot. i'll get to responding to some of you guys later tonight when i get home! edit2: for one, this incident isn't fake. it actually happened. and for those of you who are saying it's not a fuck up, it is. fuck ups don't always have to end in some horrible manner. i made a terrible decision out of anger, and really should have gotten fired. i put myself and my boss in a tough spot, and while it felt rewarding, it also hit my pride that i allowed this woman to get under my skin like that. so no, i "won" that fight, but only because of the mercy of the gods.so my sister and i resolved to get fit together this year and have started going for afternoon jogs around our neighborhood. we are two years apart and best friends so we do really dumb shit in front of eachother all the time just out of sheer boredom or to make eachother laugh. we were almost home and i had been holding in gas for ages. i was jogging slightly in front of my sister and so decided to let out my gas in a series of short, loud farts while exclaiming that i was 'jet powered'. my sister told me i was gross and from behind her i heard a muffled laugh. an older lady and an incredibly hot guy our age had been walking about 10 feet behind us. my sister began laughing hysterically and i quicky fled to our front yard and around the side gate to escape. turns out the lady is our new next door neighbor and the hot dude is her son. fuck.this is pretty short, but is easily one of the most embarrassing moments of my young adult life. when i was about 14, during those awkward and interesting days of adolescence, i came home from school to an empty house, so i decided to hop in the shower. i used the shower in my parents' bathroom, because theirs was nicer  it was a walk-in shower with a glass door, and one of those 'rainfall' spigots. well, as i was cleaning myself, i started thinking about a girl i was attracted to at the time and... please don't judge me... i started kissing the shower door, imagining that i was kissing her. so here i am, pressed up against the door, getting physically erm... stimulated... when, out of nowhere, my mother opens the door to the bathroom and finds herself face-to-face with her son rubbing up on and making out with the door to the shower. she just does a 180° and walks out. about 10 minutes later, i head out and came up with some excuse that "i slipped and fell" onto the shower door. her response? "well from the look of things it certainly must have been exciting for you." i have never mentioned it to her again.this fu as most is not from today but is from yesterday... actually you could argue the fu is 3 years ago or even 4. was in a fairly new relationship with a girl "tara" for a few months while on a work term in my home town. work term ended and i went back to school a few hours away. within a couple months i had received a phone call from tara telling me she was pregnant. i came home for the weekend and discussed what our plan was and she decided she was going to keep it. 3 years later my step mom urged my dad that i should do a paternity test since she thinks the child looked nothing like me. got the results back today and for the last 3 years i was financially and emotionally invested in a child that wasn't mine. ends up tara was sleeping around. now i feel awful for the kid and don't know how to exit the scene. edit: since this has been coming up in a lot of comments. i'm no longer seeing tara for some time now other than picking the little one up every other weekend. i am going to try to ween myself out of their life and go on living mine. for the kid i hope she finds the real father but man thats gotta be an awkward conversation to start. edit#2: thanks for all the support and suggestions. thankfully i don't live in the us. as i mentioned i was in school out of the city so i wasn't as close to the kid as most people seem to imagine. work also took me a ways away for some duration for the 2nd year. since i was in school for the 1st year and a half i wasn't able to pay any child support during that time. i'm not asking for any of it back but i fully intend to cut payments from here on out. i'm a single guy and whenever my daughter asks what i want as a present, i always say she should bring me back a pretty girlfriend. it's like a running joke with her usual response being "she better not be prettier than me" anyway i was recently really ill with tonsilitis. like the most ill i've ever been as an adult, and after a week of it i decided to go to the docs to get some antibiotics. we're the waiting room of the surgery and daughter is reading through the magazines. she's holding up pictures of different women asking me "how bout that one dad? or that one, or that one" i'm like "what for?" thinking she means hairstyles. she comes and whispers in my ear "for a new girlfriend" (bless her). i tell her magazine people are not real and she needs to find me a real person to be my girlfriend. and that i would be really silly if i cut one of them out, put it in my pocket and told everyone that she was my girlfriend! while we're having this stupid conversation a large elderly woman shuffles across the waiting room and sits opposite us. she remarks about daughter and how cute &amp; well behaved she is....daughter looks at her, then at me, then back at her and says, as loud as anything.... "you can't have her as your girlfriend, she eats too much!!!" ...before i had even processed what she just said, the stunned silence was broken by people giggling in the background, and the woman just "hmmphd" and turned away before i could apologise. ( i did say sorry)i am a 21 year old guy. today i was returning home from a dinner party when along the way i met this girl on the bus. before moving ahead, let me bring to light the fact that she is very good looking (drop dead gorgeous if i may say so). so we were standing on the bus, due to the lack of empty seats and she was right behind me. for some reason, the driver braked hard and we were all pushed ahead. the girl almost fell on me and i picked her up and asked her if she was okay. she smiled and replied that she was and we got talking about stuff. she was a student and so was i and we both talked a bit about studies and all. we flirted a bit and hit it off; and also exchanged numbers. i was happy about being so lucky... after a great time i arrived at my stop and bid adieu to her and said i will keep in touch. she smiled and waved me goodbye and i got down. i started walking home from the stop, feeling lucky about having met this absolute stunner of a woman... then out of habit i checked my back pocket. my wallet was gone. (for those wondering, i tried the number and it was a hoax..)social media nightmare. my girlfriend and i have a morning routine on the weekends where we drink coffee in bed naked. we call it 'naked coffee.' she's out of town, so i decided to send her a snapchat. i took a picture of me, naked, spread out on my bed with a mug of coffee in my hand. i put 'naked coffee' in the caption and sent it promptly at 9am. i went about the rest of my day, went to the gym then did a few errands. at 4:30pm i received this message from a good friend of mine: "hey ...! wasn't sure if you meant to do this or not but there's a naked picture on your snapchat 'my story' which is visible to the public. you can delete it by holding down on your username and i think it will point you in the right direction to delete it." i was feeling beyond embarrassed at this point. i quickly deleted the photo, then sent an update on facebook. i called it my "leaked photo debut on snapchat." i texted my girlfriend about it and she thought it was hysterical. best part about this whole mess is that she commented on the update and said, "i liked it." tl;dr: i sent my girlfriend a naked photo of myself on snapchat. i stupidly posted it to my story on accident and it was live for well over 4 hours, until i was notified by my friend. **edit:** i understand a few of you asked to see the picture for proof. i know you are disappointed but it has been deleted. i'm not about to debase myself any further. it really happened. **edit ii:** regarding it being on accident, i'm being honest. i use android. i just tapped the arrow on the bottom to send it. when i figured out how to adjust the snapchat settings after the fact, i saw that all posts were sent to my story (the default option). it was pointed out you can specify who your stories are sent to; it's the custom option but i didn't configure it until it was too late! so this was on valentines day and i was making my girlfriend a nice card because she always liked me making her stuff instead of buying her stuff. she was really happy reading the card until 20 seconds in she just looked at me with angry eyes. she threw the card at me and said "seriously?" i felt strange that she did such a thing. at first i thought she was mad because the card wasn't good enough but it didn't really make any sense to me so i picked the card up and read it. everything was normal until the last line. "if i was asked to put a price tag on you i couldn't because you are just too worthless" i don't know how i could fuck up something so simple. i meant to write "priceless". even after i explained it to her she was still unhappy about it and i basically ruined our valentines day. tl,dr : told my girlfriend she's "worthless" instead of "priceless"this happened a couple of months ago. while in the midst of having sex, we get the idea of me being blindfolded and my hands tied while she rides me. it feels amazing and, at the same, feel *incredibly* comfortable. just laying down, enjoying it all, head resting on a pillow, unaware of how suddenly drowsy i felt. slowly drifting aware without noticing. all of a sudden... **snap** she *rips* the condom right off. this immediately gets my attention, as you can imagine. "**you fell asleep while we were having sex!!!**" "i... *did*??" "yes, i must be that bad, huh?" "wait, really? what, no!!" should be noted she was moderately insecure. "yeah, while i was riding you, *you started snoring*!" "....uh^i^really^did^that?" "and then i asked '*are you sleeping??*' before ripping it off!" "oh^my^god,^i'm^so,^so^sorry!!" cue me re-assuring her for the next 30 or so minutes convincing her she wasn't bad at all and i just was really, *really* comfortable . edit: achieved gold status. i think i won the game. thanks for enjoying this.it actually happened a year ago. my friend, a lady from and old italian family who works for theaters in milan posts the following status on fb: 'there is an entire population in my head and i don't know who i shall listen to'. i comment below 'listen to the old skank, she'll always tell you the truth' and go to bed. apparently her very aristocratic mother had commented seconds before me suggesting a selected genocide of the people in her head. my comment appeared like i was inviting my friend to listen to her mother, an old skank who always tells the truth. the mother wasn't amused.so today i was talking to this girl i like. and was trying my hand at flirting. it was going pretty well, and i said "i'm sure you make all guys feel this way." she got pretty defensive after that and told me i made her feel like a slut. anyways, the conversation went back to normal, and then she said 'say "you're not a slut", you bitch'. at that point, my brain stopped working, and i did not even see/comprehend the not in her sentence, and replied back to her "you're not just any slut. you're my slut." haven't heard back since... gg get rekt. edit 1: holy fuck this blew up! well i guess i am pretty retarded hahaha. "slut" texted me a couple hours after the incident and all order has been restored. i'm glad i could entertain you guys with my stupidity this weekend.i was in class where i was randomly partnered up with a girl to do a group project. i have never said a word to this girl but she is a smoking hot 10/10. so we talked after class and decided to stay after school to work on the project to get it out of the way. so, i arrived home late since i stayed at school and my girlfriend asked why i wasn't home at my normal time. (not in a paranoid type of way...but just curious about where i was). so i told her "oh i have a group project to do and her and i decided to stay after class and get it done" she jokingly responded, "oh so she's your side ho now?" i said "no she's way out of my league" she said "then how are you dating me?" i said "because you're in my league" 3 hours later....the bedroom door is still locked and i want to go to bed. update: she unlocked the door, called me a moron, threw a glass of water on me and i better do something special tomorrow night. we have been dating for 6 years and practically married.one of my cousins lost her left middle finger in an accident a few years ago. the other day, she posted a photo on facebook of her **right** hand nails after she'd have them painted. in my quasi-drunken state, i decided to leave a humorous comment. the next morning, i checked my phone, to see numerous angry comments. confused, and unable to remember what i'd written, i went to the photo. turns out that i'd written "do you get a 10% discount?" next time i meet with her should be... fun. i posted proof in the comments earlier on, but i think it's been buried. [here it is]( _____________________________________________________ the "how to count" edit: a lot of people seem to be confused as to why a 10% discount is necessary and not a 20% off. to clarify, most people get both hands worth of nails done at once. you have 10 fingers. 10% of 10 is 1. 10-1 is 9- the number of nails that she needs done. . edit: thanks to both users for gilding me! i've remove your names to ensure that this post isn't removed again. sorry, but thanks so much! also, someone did a reading of this. it's on youtube with the same name as this post, but i can't link it here- at the request of the mods. this happened on saturday and i still feel like shit from it. **minor spoiler below.** so saturday was the anniversary of my fiance's mother's death. it is still really raw so this day is a pretty sad one. we decided to take it easy and relax that night instead of going out. i suggest we watch a movie and what movie do i suggest? fucking guardians of the galaxy. neither of us have seen it before and had no knowledge of any character's back story. for those of you who haven't seen it and don't care about a spoiler, [spoiler](/s "chris pratt's character's mother dies in the first 5 minutes of the movie.") i didn't think they would just kill her like 30 seconds into the scene on camera. i figured we would just know she died but god damn was i wrong. i just sat there in disbelief that it happened. she gets up, goes into another room, and is obviously upset. needless to say i have only seen 5 minutes of guardians of the galaxy. god damn it. now narrated by /u/cyae1: my dad and my six-year-old sister often have playful "fights" about who my mom likes better. it's kinda stupid, but she's a kid so whatever. i was home for new years, and i hear my sister and dad at it again, jokingly making up silly ways why mom likes either of them better. it usually goes along these lines: sister: mom likes me better! dad: nuh-uh, she made me bacon for breakfast! sister: well she let me [insert activity fun for a kid] dad:yeah well she let me [one ups my sister playfully] eventually they moved into the living room where i was sitting and i hear my sister say to my dad: "well, i'm so close with mom, i've been *inside* her [referring to being in her womb as a baby]" to which i stupidly interjected: "yeah well so has dad." she looked really confused, as if actually contemplating the idea that my mom had birthed my dad. to clear that up and prevent further misunderstandings, today my six-year-old sister learned about sex.i'll try to make this quick. basically, i met this girl from tinder at a bar last night. we had great chemistry and ended up staying at the bar until close. during the date, i asked if she had met up with other guys from tinder and how those previous dates went. she explained how during her last tinder date, after a couple of drinks the guy asked her to come back to his apartment. she said no, she wasn't like that. the guy then proceeded to convince her that "that's not how tinder dates work". long story short, she ended up leaving and didn't talk to him again. now, i found this hilarious so throughout the rest of the night anytime she said no to any of my questions, i would respond with "**but that's not how tinder dates work.**" me: "you should buy me a drink?" her: "you should be buying me a drink!" me: "but that's not how tinder dates work." me: "want to play pool?" her: "no, i'm not very good." me: "but that's not how tinder dates work." me: "want to take another shot?" her: "no, i have work tomorrow." me: "but that's not how tinder dates work." you get the idea. anyways, we both found this to be very funny and an easy way to lighten the conversation. it was all in good fun. so here's the fuck up part: at the end of the night, somehow we ended up going back to my place and getting in bed together. after some kissing play, she took off my pants and started sucking my dick. after a minute of this, i couldn't resists myself and in one of my creepiest voices, i said "**now this is how tinder dates work.**" at first she started with somewhat loud dick-in-the-mouth nervous laughter. but then she stopped and couldn't believe what i just said. and then it had killed the mood so much that she ended up putting her top back on and decided to quickly leave. leaving me laying in bed, naked, with a semi-hard, thinking about how badly i just fucked that up.actually yesterday. i couldn't sleep, so i wanted to kill some time on chatroulette. i met this cute girl from morocco (she was white, but i didn't think about it. she could've moved there later or something, right?), and one thing lead to another and she's masturbating on cam on skype. she says that if i don't show my dick she will delete me. i was just starting to get horny, so why not. but i was smart enough to not have my face and dick in the picture at the same time. she lost the connection and logged on again. the first thing she does is send me a link to a youtube video. if you didn't guess it already, the video was first me on webcam with my face and then me showing my dick. the title of the video was my full name with my facebook link in the description. if i don't give "her" 630 usd she will send the video to all my friends, and she listed up some of my friends on my facebook friendlist. since i'm panicking, i get my card and empty my savings just to please him. he ended up deleting the video, but he wanted more. that's when i blocked him and he stopped. the video is not online now (at least not with my full name). **tl;dr showed my dick on chatroulette and got blackmailed for 630 usd** edit: i see a lot of the same questions asked over, so i thought i'd add an faq. *why exactly 630 usd, and not a round number?* it was a round number in the original currency, but i converted it to usd since most people here are from the states and/or knows how much a dollar is worth. *you actually paid the guy?!?!???! fucking idiot* i was in panic, a lot of you would've done the same thing. he didn't give me a lot of time, so i didn't have time enough to think. **i see a lot of good posts here, and good answers to what i should do. i've done everything i should to prevent the "hacker" from doing anything more. and you guys really helped me calm down, and as you say the worst that'll happen is that some of my friends and family sees it. they'll forget about it sooner or later, and after a few months it'll only be a joke to us. but that would probably make it easier to track the guy too, and i think he's in way deeper shit than i am then. thanks so much for your help!**this happened years ago when i was in college, and still haunts me to this day. i had been casually dating a girl for a few months, not being careful enough, and she became pregnant. she decided she was going to keep the baby. we were both terrified because we were still in college, not committed, and not at all ready for that. a few days after taking multiple pregnancy tests, we were having sex and something just didn't feel right. the texture was different, kind of like anal, but...sticky, and chunky. i pulled out and looked down and saw this bloody substance all over my junk, my stomach, and the bed. neither of us had any idea what it was, and didn't think much of it, assuming it was period remnants or something. a few days later she went to the doctor to get a checkup on the pregnancy. when she came back and told me the news, it was then that i realized that the substance covering my body, and her sheets, was my miscarried child.my girlfriend was over for a few days, and unfortunately i live with my parents while i attend university. we have a goofy relationship..and more often than not i am doing something awkward or crazy to get a laugh out of her. she left the room without saying much and i assumed she walked into the bathroom next to my bedroom, as shortly after she left, i hear the door close. i pulled off my pants and slowly unlocked to door to avoid making a sound... got my dick in a full helicopter then burst into the room. my mom is sitting there screaming at the horror at the tornado of cock headed towards her. (cocknado) i am so embarrassed.. we haven't made eye contact yet. will keep you up to date when the awkward silence ends edit: mom: don't worry about it. your dad does that all the time... me: to battle!!!!..jk -she just started laughing while making the salad for dinner and said "what the fuck michael" edit:turned out ok. we had a good chuckle at dinner and she knows i was trying to bug my gf but now she thinks i am a weirdo haha. so this fuck up actually did happen today, about five hours ago. my girlfriend had just gone downstairs and i was finishing a conversation with her parents upstairs. after finishing the conversation, i headed downstairs, i notice she's in the bathroom. being the quick-thinking guy i am, i silently run across the room and hide in the corner to wait for her to come out of the bathroom. this way, when the door opened it would be blocking her view from me. for the record, the room is pitch black - i was gonna scare her so well! fast forward 15 seconds of waiting, the door opens and i prepare to strike! once she walks out i leave my spot from against the wall and go to grab her waist from behind. the next thing i realize is feeling a quick strike of pain to my face, seeing stars, and laying on the floor. by this point, she is screaming, i'm cursing, her parents are probably thinking we're having sex in their house. i'm no small guy either at 6'2, 190 lbs (not saying i'm big, but i've started varsity at offensive line for a few years now), and just finished my senior year of football, but she took me down in one hit. apparently i was a murderer for a fraction of a second in the pitch black and paid the ultimate price. i'm proud of her for being able to throw out a good punch if she had to :) tl;dr: girlfriend is ronda rousey and i saw stars, will have black eye tomorrow. edit: turns out she is actually holly holm, much more accurate! thank you all for responding! glad i could make someone laugh, i can't wait to have to explain this eye to anyone who asks. edit 2: grammar edit 3: huge thanks to the people who aren't trying to give me relationship advice. while i appreciate all opinions, i assure you i am not manipulative or malicious to my girlfriend. we've dated for a few years now and have laughed about this incident more than i think the average couple would! keep the comments coming, we're laughing pretty hard at some of them! thank you for the gold!!! you the bomb this happened like 5 minutes ago. i (male) work with cousin (female) at a family business. we have a water cooler in the office that had just run out. as i got up to leave the office, she shouted "remember you need to fill the water butt up!". i immediately responded with "i'll fill your butt up". i'm hiding in the kitchen and i might have to quit work from embarrassment. oh god. edit: morning! just a few things, for the sake of clarity; 1, at the risk of losing all this precious, precious karma, i don't want to do butt stuff with my cousin, it was just me being "funny" and firing back a reply that i would normally reserve for a friend. 2, by "water butt" i mean "the water bottle", it just sometimes gets called that around the office because it is similar to an actual water butt. 3, no pictures of my cousin ya damn dirty apes. anyways, she'll be in work in like 2 hours, so we'll see how it goes! edit number 2: it hasn't been mentioned all day. sweeping it under the rug like nothing ever happened. dealing with it in the correct, british way.tifu reddit, and i dont think i will ever forget this. quick preface: i am a 20 [m] in college at a state university. i usually dont post so if this post probably sucks but whatever, i needed to get this off my chest. so this fu actually occurred today... while at the local headshop (preparing for april 20) there was a really attractive red haired girl with quite possibly one of the most radiantly attractive smiles i have ever seen in my life standing in line waiting to be helped. as she was waiting, her phone went off and her ringer was r2d2. me, wanting to strike up conversation, told her that was an awesome ringtone, to which she replied that she is a huge star wars fan, which is awesome because i am too! we make small talk, definitely mentioning the new trailer that just was released and whatnot. we were hitting it off well, and we turned out to have so many things in common: we are both huge fans of lotr, super into gaming, specifically old nintendo console gaming and pc gaming, and obviously smoking (we were at a head shop so that is obvious). then, the absolute kicker of the whole situation was that she browses reddit! everything about this girl is 10/10 and when she walked out the door i thought my friend i was with was gonna kill me for not asking for her number. i've fucked up a lot in my life, theres no doubt about that; but i think this might be one of those fuck ups that haunt me forever. tl;dr: saw pretty girl who is also fellow redditor, hit it off super well, didnt ask for phone number. edit: didn't expect this to blow up at all... for those wondering, i'm from southern louisiana, i'm not gonna go any more specific than that location. i'm pretty sure that if she reads this, she would know who i am. even the guy working in the store was telling me how i fucked up not getting your number... also, for those taking me so literally on calling her perfect, yes i know i only met her for 5 min, i didn't mean that's she's literally perfect, she just seems like a cool person and i'd like to get to know her better if the opportunity were to arise. also, thanks for the gold strangers! edit 2: so to clear some things up, yes i go to lsu. no, i actually was not at the ra shop surprisingly enough; my buddy and i were at a 24 hour smoke shop just off campus, those of you familiar with lsu should know what im talking about. edit 3: just logged back on after spending the day celebrating. there really isn't anything to update, no hits yet. celebrated a lot before writing this so... more updates later edit 4: so, after celebrating for a full 24 hours... people have sent me pictures of random redheads apparently who go to lsu, so far no matches. that being said... i didnt make this post to find her, i made this post because i was at a solid [6] and just felt like putting it somewhere. also, to the people saying we were gonna date/fuck/etc., no, i just wanted her number to see where things would have gone had i not been a little bitch about it. and if she did/does have a boyfriend, who cares, she could have been a great friend, who knows.so i work in a kitchen. people move fast and very often have sharp or searing hot things in their hands. as a safety measure we say "behind you!" as we pass by to cut down on accidents. i was walking home from work at around 4 am. i see a woman walking the same direction as i am, i appear to be moving a fair amount faster. i've been told i make little to no noise as i walk, so i suppose she didn't hear me, but as i went to pass her i nonchalantly said "behind you" on reflex. she must have jumped a foot in the air, screamed at the top of her lungs, and sprinted off. i hope she's not scarred for life o.olast night i was at the bar and ended up bringing a girl back to my place. we hooked up for a while and when it was eventually over we both begin to fall asleep. after a little silence she leans over and asks, "do you reddit?" a little drunk, a little tired, and really surprised a girl like her would be into reddit i reply with an enthusiastic, "yes! do you?" the only problem is she didn't ask if i reddit, she asked if i "regret it" as in regretted hooking up with her and my enthusiastic "yes" was not the answer she was looking for. she responded with an angry "fuck you", got dressed and stormed out before i could put two and two together. on new year's eve 2012, my girlfriend of six months and i were about to leave her parents house to go to boston. her parents were about to go cape cod. it's important to note that her dad didn't like me yet for no reason other than i was banging his daughter. i take a quick poop upstairs before we all leave. clogged it. i re-flushed in hopes it would work the second time. the water overflows all over the wooden floor. i frantically start cleaning it up with a couple towels when i hear my girlfriend scream from the kitchen directly under me, "mom! water is coming through the light fixtures!" they all rush upstairs and gf's mom asks to be let in to help me. i open the door to the scene of a flooded floor and one pathetic nugget swirling around in the top of the bowl. the worst part was her sweetheart mother (who is a nurse) insisted on cleaning it up. her dad escaped to the car without saying a word to anyone. we're still together. her dad likes me now. edit: i know i should have turned the water valve off but i panicked. if i was on home turf i would have averted this crisis. i was at the park with my daughters 6&amp;7. i assumed my usual position at a bench in the middle of the park that give me a view of the whole park. i usually sit there until i'm called to push, help or just watch. i pull out my phone and start playing mortal combat x. my 7 year old comes over about 10 minutes in and says the boys are saying bad words. i told her to take her sister and go to the other jungle gym. a few minutes pass and the boys head over to where my girls and a few others are playing. the boys are probably 9-10 years old. now i hear them cursing and its echoing throughout the park because they are in a plastic slide. i walk over and say "you guys need to watch your language" loud enough for them and any parents to hear. had they been teenagers i would have said a lot worse and probably told them to leave but they were just young kids. a few seconds later and young lady who i am assuming was one of their mothers comes over and goes apeshit on her kid. she is yelling and cursing and threatening the kid and his friends/brothers. the language she was using was 20 times worse than the kids. this caused another mother to come over and yell at the yelling mother. the yelling mother didn't appreciate it and starts going apeshit on the mother too. now the father of one lady comes over and starts trying to break it up and the yelling mom goes apeshit on him too. now all of the kids have stopped playing and are watching and all the grown ups are screaming, cursing, threatening each other and threatening to call child services and to call the cops. then i got a text that dinner was ready. i grabbed my girls and walked to the car and they were all still going apeshit. first of all i wanna say thanks for saving my day, with all of your tifu's! i can't tell you how many hours i've spend laughing, and how many sleepless nights you have been given me ;-) so now i wanna share my tifu, which didn't happen today but about 2-3 weeks ago... i'm traumatised for life... (i apologies if my grammar isn't correct, but i hope you'll get the point anyway) my name is michael. i live in denmark, and i was visiting my gf for about 2-3 weeks ago. she lives about 200km/124miles away, so it's rarely we see each other. i'm waking up a saturday morning, and as a lot of other guys i have to take a piss like the niagara falls in the morning. so i just woke up, my head's kinda fuzzy, and i'm heading for the restroom.... what i didn't remember, because i just fucking woke up, was the fact that her parents never (**never!**) lock the god damn door. so i opened the door, and there she was. my gf's mother, completely naked with big hanging tits. i didn't know what to do, so i just shouted "woaoouuoooo"-ish, smacked the door, and heard her laugh afterwards. then i backed my head up against the wall outside. "wow"? was that the fucking word i choosed to scream when i saw her naked? jesus christ.... i'm not sure if she thinks i was turned on or afraid.... traumatised, guys... *traumatised*..... tl;dr: had to piss in the morning. gf's family never lock the door. saw my gf's moms tits. traumatised..... edit 1: i showed my gf this tifu. we've talked about this, and she had a sick laugh about it, although i absolutely did not find this funny. so, she read this tifu, and she was like: "big hanging tits.... my mom's got beautiful tits for a woman at the age of 50. especially when she breastfed me until i was three." - is this normal? three years?!.... i seriously don't know what to respond to her. edit 2: this isn't unlikely. i searched the internet for it, and wow. apparently this is normal (wtf). although it's "normal", i must say i just read a comment about this dude's cousin who was breastfed until he was 7... this isn't normal. 7 fucking years? holy shit! so a bit of a backstory, i'm 29 and have had a slight case of tourette's since i was about 14, nothing too serious, i can usually keep a lid on it but i slip up every now and then, mostly when i'm nervous or stressed. anyway, my wife and i just finished moving across the country for her job and made a trip to florida this year to see our parents for father's day. i'm currently still looking for a job and my wife's dad has never really cared much for me. so we arrive at her parents house for dinner and the topic of me being a house-husband comes up. here's how the convo went. father in law: "so with all this time at home, you must be getting a lot of work done in the house, right?" me: "well i'm not very good at carpentry, so we're hiring someone to do the bathroom and porch." father in law: "well then, that must give you a lot of time to keep the cars in good shape and well kept, right?" me: "honestly, i'm not great with cars either, so we just stick to mechanics for that stuff." father in law: "well jeez, is there anything you do well?" me (thinking to myself): "don't say 'fuck your daughter', don't say 'fuck your daughter...' " me: "fuck your daughter." (nnnnnnoooooooooo!!) her dad immediately got up and left the room without saying a word. i apologized later and he understood that i really couldn't help it. my wife thought it was the funniest moment of her life, possibly the most embarrassing for me. tl;dr: i told my father in law that the only thing i do well is fuck his daughter.so i was at a popular mexican resturant named cheekys and while i was there with some friends the conversation starting to get pretty stale since we had been there for about an hour or so. to get to the point, i decided to hop on tinder and look for some potential mates. after a few minutes of swiping left and right i saw a questionable swipe and handed it over to one of my friends. who immediately started to laugh and handed the phone back to me and said she was extremely ugly (she wasn't, he is just a douche). so im coming to an agreeance with his opinion i swiped left. simple as that right? no. upon looking up, we see our waitress standing over us staring directly at my phone. it was then that we realized she was the exact same girl on tinder. i could see the pain in her eyes as she dropped the checks onto our table and went to the back of the resturant to presumably cry her eyes out. we didn't see her for the rest of the night and the manager came over to apologize to us that our waitress was feeling ill and couldn't finish helping us. feeling like total shitbags we managed to pool together $67.20 in tips to give her. left a little note on the bottom that said "hey, we are just dicks. you're actually really pretty :)" and left. so yeah, today i fucked up by swiping left.this didn't happen today, but i didn't have internet or reddit when this happened. i feel like sharing it with you. when i was really young i used to think that there were 2 types of diseases: the ones that can kill me and the ones that won't kill me. the ones that could kill me were the ones that i saw my mom being seriously worried about. between them, cancer and pneumonia. eventually, when i was around 7 or 8, i became sick. i had bacterial pneumonia. my mom got worried. as a consequence, i automatically thought i had a killing-tier disease. the next day at school i could only think about the possibility i could die at any moment. i felt obliged to tell my friends i was sick, but i couldn't remember the word "pneumonia". as it was a killing-tier disease, i thought that calling it "cancer" would have the same impact. as you can imagine, it didn't. all my friends told their parents i had cancer. a shitstorm proceeded to happen. during the following days, my mom received several calls from parents trying to share some hope and strength with her. when she went to school to pick me up, people would stop her to talk about my condition. my mom had to spend several hours of shame explaining to people how stupid her son was. one week later i was healthy again and glad i wasn't dead. edit &gt; wow!! thanks for the gold, stranger!my mom just moved out of my house two weeks ago, so naturally i'm embracing my new found freedom. this morning before work i decided that every dildo/plug/vibe i own needed a good cleaning before this weekend so my man and i can have a bit of fun. a few minutes later everything is all clean and sitting up to dry around my bathroom sink. i then quickly get dressed and rush out the door to work. now this is where the fuck up comes in. i left them there. all 10 of them and went to work. now i just recieved a call from my mom saying that she is swinging by tonight (while i'm still at work) to drop off some groceries and pick up some stuff she left behind. unable to think of an excuse as to why she can't do that or use my washroom tonight i just squeaked out an "ok" and hung up the phone. fml reddit. i can't wait for the phone call i'll get later. **update:** so i just called my mom on the way home from work and apparently she and my step dad found my collection quite amusing. the story i was told goes: mom walked into the house put the groceries down and immediately went in to the washroom while my step dad went to work fixing the sink in my laundry room. mom obviously saw the toys and had a bit of a giggle. she went about her business until my step dad decided he needed to use the washroom. apparently she ran in there grabbed them all to try and put them away before he could see but it was too late. she got caught in the hallway with an arm full of dicks. they apparently were both dying of laughter. and to top off the embarrassment of both of my parents seeing the collection she thinks "the purple swirly one it's kind of neat." **update 2: (nsfw)** due to overwhelming demand and the fact that this is the internet here is part of my collection [the purple swirly one is on the left ;)](so, like most, this didn't happen today. or yesterday. not even this year. in 2010 it was the second quarter of my freshman year of college. it was a pretty typical friday night: i found myself playing beer pong with a person i didn't know and i house i'd never been before and drinking something that i wasn't quite sure of. we had been playing for what seemed like an eternity when i notice two girls from my dorm walk into the room. i am shitfaced by this point and i call out to them despite not knowing them very well. they come over and we talk about dumb shit such as what're you drinking, do you know of any other parties, etc. one of the girls is maybe the most beautiful girl i've ever seen (sober). the other is... homely, we'll call her a. so at some point in the conversation a asks her friend if she wants to go dance. she says no since she and i are having an intelligent conversation about the finer points of beer pong. i ask a why she doesn't just go ask a guy to dance with her. she says that she's afraid of being turned down. this is were i fuck up. quick point: i can barely stand straight. i start laying down the most inspirational speech i have ever heard. i tell her to go out and dance and if guys don't want to dance then they are friggin idiots since they don't know what they're missing. she is a strong, independent, beautiful woman who doesn't need the validation of any man to have a good time. i continue for about 15 mins of motivational rambling. afterwards she looks at me, i can still see the sparkle of admiration in her eyes, and says, "wow, thanks brochill! would you want to go dance with me?" "nah." and i turn around and keep playing beer pong. tl:dr i helped a girl with her confidence, only to immediately reinforce her doubts and shatter it. edit: wow, this blew up. i'm glad some many people find humor in my moment of obliviousness. edit 2: the re-editing: thanks for the gold, stranger! i feel vastly superior to everyone else already.a few years back i'd hooked up with a girl at a party but didn't manage to seal the deal. a few weeks later she invites me up to her place to go on a 'proper date'. it's a little distance away, so it takes me a couple hours to drive up there. we go out to dinner and end up drinking a bottle of wine (or two). i can't drive home, i'm drunk. one thing leads to another and bam, first date sexy time. now next morning i had to be somewhere early; i had planned to be home the previous night so i was gonna be super late if i didn't haul ass. when i got up to leave it was still dark. i didn't want to wake her by turning on the light, so i grabbed my clothes, stuffed them into my bag and hit the road. later that day i'm home and getting my clothes out the bag. and that's when i saw it, peeking out from behind my t-shirt. my dates dainty pink thong. i reflected on this a moment and realised how this might look. i got a girl drunk. i insisted i had to sleep at her house, as i was also drunk. took advantage of said drunkenness, and slept with her. got up in the dead of night to abandon her. and then stole her panties for good measure. in the end i settled on a text... "please don't think i'm weird, but i stole your panties by accident". this was 5 years ago. next week is our wedding. had to tell the story here cause i sure as shit can't put it in the speech! this actually happened today, so i guess i get bonus tifu points! well, for some background first: i'm a 17 year old guy, currently in high school. iv'e had a girlfriend for almost 2 months and today we decided to go ahead and have some fun. i'm a virgin, she's not. had, a condom , felt pretty relaxed about the whole situation, all that jazz. overall, i thought stuff was gonna go okay. alright, so i go to her place, we get in bed, start making out, i get a hard-on from the start of it. stuff was going pretty well, but slow as fuck. it took me like 30 minutes to see her bra. fast forward a little, after about one hour and 30 minutes im only in my boxers, she's in her panties. after having my dick up for almost 2 hours, my heart sinks when i notice i went soft, at this exact time she wants to get to fucking. i try to play it cool, go on with some more foreplay, try to stealthily rub it, but it's dead. it's fucking dead, it feels *numb* by now, im barely even feeling it when she goes for a grab! i try to go call for a bathroom break, i take a piss, try to mess around with it a bit more, but still nothing. i go back to her room, and there she is, with a ripped condom wrapper in her mouth. good luck playing pool with this rope sweetheart! before i can even say anything she pulls down my boxers, and boom, no boner, only tiny bald mole in here. she tries to grab it, suck it, whatever man, i don't even feel her down there anymore. seeing as i won't get anything done, i try to cut my losses and go for some fingering. i get pretty turned on by moans, so by some sort of miracle i get back up. she notices and goes in for a blowjob. at this point i should mention iv'e been standing around naked for almost an hour and its pretty cold in here. i realize im actually shivering. i start shivering even harder to the point where im basically having a seizure, dick still in her mouth. during my little seizure i manage to lose it again. with my cock *inside her goddamn throat*. i don't even wanna know what it's like to deepthroat a guy and feel his dick retracting... i decide go back in for some more fingering, this time stuff gets pretty heated, i actually raise the fallen soldier again, and as i take my hand out to grab the condom before its too late... period blood. motherfucking period blood on my fingers. she notices, and just kinda starts sobbing , and just ran away to the bathroom, locked the door behind her. "well, no fuck" is all i could mumble as i stood there, butt naked with period blood on my hand and my girlfriend crying in the bathroom. **tl;dr**: got to have sex with girlfriend, too much foreplay leads to dick getting tired. **edit**: apparently my gf browses reddit every now and then. that seems like a pretty bad thing right now, but it makes this whole thing even funnier. **second edit**: this shit blew up. i don't know which one of you crazy motherfuckers glided me, but damn i feel like i just got a medal for not getting it up. and it's awesome! this happened about 20 minutes ago my girlfriend and i had just finished in town, so i walked her home, on the way home we were both being a little flirty. after reaching her house, long story short i had her over the kitchen counter very quickly. about 20 seconds into it we hear rustling coming from the closet, instinctively, i pulled out, zipped up. she opens the closet and out falls her dad, straight away my stomach drops because he was one of those guys who made it clear i wasn't to touch his daughter anymore than a peck on the cheek, but then in the back of the closet was a woman id never seen before (i knew both parents) and it was pretty obvious that papa-girlfriend had been doing the naughty naughty with another woman. the dad scrambled to his feet, disregarding the fact that i and his daughter just caught him cheating, and came straight at me, without a second thought i was out the door and down the road, i have no idea what's happened since ive left, im waiting for a reply from my girlfriend, ill keep you all posted. tl/dr: got intimate with gf, shortly interrupted by gf's cheating dad, i didnt get to finish. update 1: nothing yet, it's pretty late though, if she hasn't replied by the morning i may go over make sure she's ok update 2: first things first, apologies for the shitty grammar and punctuation, ive always been bad at that. girlfriends mom knows and apparently shits going down at their house, im getting ready to leave my house now and head over for a 'family + boyfriend discussion' i don't think i'll get hurt. extra info for clarity: - girlfriend and i are 18 we both live with our parents until uni starts next sept. - her dad is a lot bigger than me, i wasn't gonna stay around and get my head kicked in, i knew he wouldn't hurt his daughter, he may be a scumbag, but he's one of those dad's who loves his daughter to much to hurt them. ngl, her wellbeing wasn't my first thought when he ran at me - mystery woman was in fact a coworker of the dad. - i didnt get bummed by her dad - i'm not one for blackmail, i would've had to come clean no matter what, even if gf hadn't said anything. update 3: i just left her house, basically, her moms furious at her dad (obviously) but she's 'not surprised' at mine and her daughters actions, not sure what she's tryna say about me. the dad didn't speak to me the entire time, awkward af between us. girlfriend is also furious at her dad but assures me nothing will change between me and her. for the best i think the parents are going to decide what happens between them over the next few days. the mom is currently trying to get in touch with the other woman, i wish i could be there for that call but gf will keep me posted on how that goes. my best friend was sent home from school because she had an upset stomach. i went over her house today to see how she was doing. she still wasn't feeling good, but i stuck around and chatted with her for a few hours since both of her parents were at still work. when i was leaving, i gave her a big hug and said that i hope she feels better. as soon as i did, she simultaneously projectile vomited down my back and had explosive diarrhea in her pants. she backed away from me before i could react, tripped over the rug, and split her head open on a table. blood was everywhere, i'm covered in puke, and there is shit in her pants. great. i carried her to my car and raced to the hospital. i called her parents and told them what happened also. she needed 20 stitches in her head and a change of clothes. tifu edit: thanks for the gold, anonymous user!happened about an hour ago. lunchtime, i'm walking the short distance from the separate building where i work to the main office where the cafeteria is. as i approach the doors from the side i spy a pretty girl i've never seen before approaching the same door from straight on. the timing (and the fact that the door opens towards me) means i can do the gentlemanly thing and open the door for her and let her through first. i plan to bow and smile, cool. i reach the door and these doors are quite heavy so a little effort is needed to open them. as i reach for the handle i turn my head to do the 'after you' smile. this is where i fu. by looking at the girl i miss the handle. but im already leaning back to counter the weight of the door and i fall over in the most uncool fashion imaginable. by brain fails to react and i literally go down backwards like a felled tree. i hit my shoulder hard on the post which supports the canopy over the door. had it been my head that i hit i would've been out cold. i get up pretending to be fine, she seems concerned but is trying not to laugh. i'm trying not to cry. i am not cool.so my girlfriend and i were talking about her upcoming holiday to japan when she mentions that she's lost a lot of weight from walking a lot at her new job. gf: " i'm going to be so thin for my trip!" and now i, knowing she loves japanese food decide to take a jab at that and go to say, "and when you get back you're gonna be so fat from all the food you've eaten." but instead what comes out of my mouth is, "when you get back you'll be fat again." it took her a second to process what i just said (as did i) and we just fell silent from shock. she then says, "you always thought i was fat?" no i never did, damnit brain. edit: of course my highest voted post ever is about me accidentally calling my gf fat. good work rob.my girlfriend's phone stopped working and the replacement turned out to be a piece of crap. her brother offered to send his old phone as a replacement. we live away from home because of university. delivering things to my parents' house feels safer. we already did that a few times. so we decided to let them know something was coming with the mail. i decided to give my mother a heads up with a text. so i texted: "girlfriend is expecting a package." not thinking anything of it. my mother didn't respond and again i thought nothing of it. she does that often. however when i came home 2 weeks later i learned that she had been panicking the whole time. she thought i knocked up my girlfriend. she demandend an explanation. i gave one and laughing ensued. so as a bonus i learned that my mother thinks i'm capable of getting my girlfriend pregnant and announcing it through text with a shitty pun. **tl;dr**: i texted my mother and she thought i knocked up my girlfriend. edit: according to my girlfriend i'm wrong because it was 2 days and not 2 weeks. edit 2: thanks to [/u/isthisnew]( for narrating my story! so this happened when i was 19 near my home town. i was at a house party when i met a girl and we proceeded to go back to her house. well she was 18 and attending college later that year so she still lived with her parents. so we sneak in, go up stairs to her bedroom for some sexy time. i was there for maybe a couple of minutes when we hear the phone ring and her father come walking down the hall. she freaks out and tells me to get out on the roof (her room was on the second floor and they had an awning type roof covering their porch). i was drunk and was not in the best state of mind to make rash decisions. so i reluctantly go out the window and lay down on the roof. this is where it gets fucked up. the father comes bursting in the room and tells her that her little sister was in a car accident and that they are leaving for the hospital right now. so she waits for her father to leave opens the window and tells me she will leave it unlocked and that i can leave after they leave. night is just getting better and better. well the mother comes in crying and starts helping her pack some things for her sister. she then notices the window is unlocked and locks it on her way out. i guess the girl didn't notice. so here i am around 1100 on a friday night, its about 45 degrees outside and i am only in my boxers and socks. after they left i tried everything i could to open that window, no luck. there was no way i was jumping as it was the second story and they lived on a steep hill. so instead of 20 ft it would have been around 30 and a painful roll down. i had no phone and no other way of signaling anyone for help. im not sure someone would help a half naked boy on the side of a house anyway. so after about an hour of me losing feeling in my extremities and full of false hope that the girl would return any minute to open the window. i decided the only logical thing would be to break in. surprisingly its not that hard to break a sliding window off its tracks and i managed to keep it from completely shattering all onto her floor. i grabbed my belongings and booked it out of there. the following day i get a call from her apologizing to me about how she left me. yes thats right, she apologized to me because i had to smash in her window. the sister ended up being fine and her father got the police involved for my little stunt but she is the only one that knows it was me. never saw her or talked to her again after that. tl;dr met a girl, she was rad. got on the roof to hide from her dad. broke in and wasn't half bad. never saw her again and i ain't even sad. edit: sorry for the paragraphs. as you can tell by most post history i have been mostly a lurker on this site for the past couple of years. guess i should have posted this on my computer instead of my phone. i'm glad tifu enjoyed my fuck up.*update: all jokes aside, i genuinely appreciate all the replies on here. this situation fucking sucked and not knowing anyone on campus sucks to. i always believed all comedy comes form a dark place and helps deal with shit and you guys just proved my point. thank you* this happened about a month ago. i just read another recent post about inscest on here so i thought i'd post this. backstory: - i was *finally* starting to break some ground in my freshmen year by breaking out of my shell. for me, even saying hi or smiling at a classmate was a big step. - i've been dating the same girl for over three years now and we've known each other since middle school. when we were kids, her mom would refer to me as her son and my mom would refer to her as her daughter. we would occasionally joke about the whole inscest aspect of our relationship when we started dating. - since ios 8 came out we've been sending each other lots of voice memos instead of texts. the story: the university i'm attending is in a city that is notorious for being hard to make friends in. it's a completely new area for me and i know absolutely no one. the fact that i was starting to at least talk to classmates was a huge positive step for me. we get our usual break in class and i stay at the spot and check my texts. i see that my gf sent me a voice memo (it's usually quirky silly things) and i raise the phone up to my ear to listen to it. the voice memo is her saying in a very sensual voice "do you miss your sister's mouth?" the volume was loud enough that everyone two rows in front of me and behind me could hear me. not positive if the prof heard. i start sweating bullets and just turn red. word quickly spread through campus and now i just go to the library during my breaks and study. i figure i'll make friends when i get a job.so this happened a little under two months ago, but i felt as if this had to be shared because it was extremely traumatizing. so my girlfriend and i were getting it on for the first time, and it involved really good foreplay and cuddling and whatnot. with me, when it comes to a new person for the first time, my nerves can get the best of me and sometimes i suffer from performance anxiety when it comes to first times with others, so during sex i had a hard time keeping it up (my penis that is) simply because of the nerves i was experiencing. my girlfriend understood completely and we decided to take a break and try again in maybe 30 minutes. so when we finally got into it again, it was much better. we were really going at it missionary style when she says to me, "when you cum just pull out and do it on my stomach." that was fine with me, so i kept going until 15 seconds later she said, "yeah. better out than in i always say." at that moment i exploded. i laughed so fucking hard and my erection disappeared faster than most things possibly can. i was on her bed with my limp dick in her and i was losing it. needless to say, sexy time went unfinished that night, and that was that. thankfully, she found it really funny too, and takes some of the blame for it. shrek is love, shrek is life. tl;dr - having sex with girlfriend for first time, she makes shrek joke, i laugh so hard i lose my erection, sex over. you can find my first post here as to what happened and all it's updates. latest update: now to what happened on thanksgiving. so my gf's sister showed up wednesday afternoon and everything was going perfectly fine throughout the day. i left around 4 ish to grab some beer and wine before thanksgiving. when i came home i could hear yelling from the front door and when i walked in it only intensified. my gf and her sister were in full fledged fuck you mode. once i walked through the door, they both stopped yelling, and the sister went upstairs. i asked what it was about and it was about the sexting incident again. i got them both together and asked them to just play it off until thanksgiving was over and we could talk the day after. thanksgiving happens, there was a lot of tension in the air but my gf and her sister played it off pretty well, nothing too suspicious. her parents don't expect anything and they left all good. literally 5 minutes after they left, the house exploded. my girlfriend was yelling at her sister for "eyeing" me all evening. i genuinely didn't notice, but i am somewhat flattered. i told them to calm down and they both told me to fuck off basically and i ended up sleeping on the coach last night. now here i am about 20 hours after being banished to the coach. my girlfriends sister left in the morning didn't say good bye just left a note saying she wouldn't be talking to us anymore and to enjoy christmas without her. my gf proceeded to break down into tears and blame me for all this. we talked about an hour ago and it's better now between us. but i'm pretty sure i broke two sisters apart. **td;dr: make sure you read the name of the person you're sexting before you do it redditors. otherwise, you'll find yourself feeling guilty and pretty bummed** so this actually happened about nine years ago, but tifu by trying to chase a girl. there was a new girl that worked at a store where i was a regular and i had a crush on her from the first day she started. i hit it off with her pretty well and would talk to her when i came in, along with the rest of the employees since we knew each other pretty well (small store). once a month the employees would get together and go see a movie at the theater next to their work when they all got off. i wanted to be a part of their next outting since the new girl would be joining them as well. one of the employees, steve, got off work so i started asking him about the outting, telling him that i wish i was a part of the group since they all know me pretty well, and i was also want to work there. i didn't want to flat out say i wanted to tag along for her, so he invited me along. needless to say i was excited to be able to try to spend some time with her outside of work. we all went to the movies and i ended up sitting next to steve and my good friend matt, while the new girl was a few seats down and i never really got to talk to her, while steve was acting kind of strange, which was slightly disheartnening. i went back to the store the next week and matt tells me "i didn't know you were into dudes." i gave him a puzzling look and said "i'm not. i'm into the new girl that works here. what makes you think that?" matt starts laughing "did you know that steve is gay?" i unwittingly reply "didn't have a clue." but my eyes began to widen as i started to realize the truth. matt told me that steve had asked me to the movies thinking it was a date and that my excitement had him thinking that i was of the same mindset, and everyone else thought that i was there on a date with him. never lived that down tl;dr was chasing a girl, and unknowingly was asked out by a gay man, and unwittingly accepted thinking it was a hang out with friends. also, i did eventually get the girl ;) edit 1: grammar, and why i didn't mention the girl to steve edit 2: for those of you wondering about the girl, it is a far less interesting story sadly. we ended up together for about a year, and while we split up, we still remained friends for quite some time. i got her mainly through persistence and explaining that i was trying to be there that night for her. she cut off an engagement the day before her wedding, and i'm currently in a long term relationship getting ready to propose (to a girl).i've been working as a host at a fine dining restaurant which opened up just a few months ago. one of the things we've been instructed to do is use last names as much as possible while interacting with guests. so this guy, probably around 45-50 years old walks up to me with his wife. he asks me to make him a reservation for their anniversary in a couple of weeks. i ask him for his last name, which i then type into the computer we do the reservations on. this computer also happens to store information on the guests and their previous visits to our restaurant. he had visited before and we had two names under the reservation- a man and a woman. let's go ahead and say that the two names were robert and sarah. excitedly thinking to myself "i can really surprise the guests and impress them by using their first names!" i look up and ask "oh, robert and sarah?" the look on the woman's face was like nothing i have ever seen. she is not sarah, but she certainly knew exactly who sarah is. "i thought that was over 4 years ago" was the only thing she said to him. keep in mind, the restaurant had only been open for 6 or so months at the time. she then took off her ring, put it on the counter in front of me, told me to "give it to a nice girl someday" and then left. the man looked like he was about to jump over the counter and strangle me. i managed to spit out a half assed "sorry" but the damage was done. he gave me a look, grabbed the ring and then took off after her. so there's how i ended a marriage by attempting to be fancy. lesson learned. on the train, a girl about 2 feet from me has her fly open. i tell her about it and then she says "why are you looking there?" she closes it thereafter. everyone on the train gives me a mild death stare. disappointing when i was only trying to help. i guess people were angry at me for telling her as now they wouldn't be able to look there anymore.my gf was in the car, we were just going for a ride, grab to eat, stop by the bay, take a walk and simply hangout. on the way, she was responsible to play music from my cellphone. however, she was checking out my photo library since i do photography as a hobby nor like i had anything to hide. there are things i dnload which i find pretty funny, sick or whatever. i forgot all about them. she being a catholic and my religion is somewhere flying in the wind, she finds this [image]( now i am single. edit1: holy donkey balls, this blew up. did this actually make it to front page? wow! i wasn't expecting. just to be clear, i did save the picture some time ago due to all the events that has transpired in france. i thought it was just funny or rather i may have a sick sense of humor. i wasn't expecting anything that has transpired in my personal life. edit2: i apologize as i have not responded to anyone. i tried to work things over with her and i could say i was pretty insensitive. i also apologize to anyone i may have offended with this post. that was never my intention. personally, i find this world a bit funny and weird, we often take things too seriously knowing that there are greater things we should be concerned with. again, i apologize to anyone i may have offended. so this fu just happened about 20 minutes ago. i'm 21 (m) and i've known this girl (20) for about 5 years now, and we've been pretty good friends since then. we've never had a romantic history, as we've always just seen one another as friends, but admittedly, she's gorgeous. 5'10", blonde hair, model type, really. so about 20 minutes ago, i get a snap from her, and i opened it right away. to my delight and shock, it was a full-blown, balls-to-the-wall shot of her bent right over, on her knees, mirror selfie. hands down, one of the most perfectly shaped backsides i've ever seen. thinking quickly, and coming to terms with the finite time i had to gaze upon this smooth, magnificent anatomical work of art, i find it wise to take a screen shot. mistake. mind you, this happened within about 2 seconds of opening the snap. as soon as i finish taking the screenshot, i get a flood of texts from her, pleading me to not open that, that it wasn't meant for me, that i shouldn't see what it is, etc. it occurred to me then, that it hadn't occurred to me that it may not have been for me. the texts stopped as abruptly as they began, as i assumed she got the screenshot notification. still awaiting the aftermath, but yeah. in the most glorious and serendipitous way, i fu. edit: woo! front page!! *also, update: i talked with her, and of course i deleted the image entirely. didn't back it up or anything. she's a sweet girl and is really embarrassed, and i couldn't keep it with good conscious. i told her i'd never bring this up again and she's actually being pretty cool about it, no awkward feelings. edit 2: nice! popped my gold cherry too! thank you kind stranger!so this happened just today. i work at a dominos pizza, and right across the street is this dairy queen, and i've been trading pizza for dairy queen stuff with this really cute black haired girl for a bit. i built up the courage and asked for her number and we've been texting and talking to each other for about a week. today she asked if i could bring her pizza to her new place, so i jumped to the conclusion that, that was her saying "hey come over." later after i clocked out, bought a pizza, and got one of my delivery drivers to drive me to her place (i don't drive and her place was on his way). she took the pizza saying "thanks" i stood there thinking she was going to let me in, we talked a bit and i immediately knew she wasn't down. she asked "how did you get here?" i said "one of my drivers drove me" she said "oh did he leave?" "yea..." "oh really! oops, can you call him back?" so i called my driver back after he was done delivery and went into the front foyer of the house and waited, and seen this dude up stairs, i knew what was up and i just waited like 1 minute and left when my driver got outside. he said "what happened?" "i guess she wanted the p instead of the d." i got a ride home afterwards. edit: wtf front page, and gold.this girl texted me the other day and i was reminded of my huge fuckup on our first date, which was about a year ago. so i know her from highschool in our hometown, but i hadn't seen her for 5 years. i saw her working in a bar, we talked a little and exchanged phone numbers. few weeks later we planned our date, which was at 22.00 but we hadn't decided on the location yet. the day of our date the fuckup began.. she texted me that morning saying :"you should really know i had a huge crush on you five years ago..". i kind of freaked out and didnt know how to react. i was hanging out with some friends of mine when she called me to ask where we were going to meet. having set the location, i hung up the phone and told my buddies about the text i had recieved that morning. one of them told me i was definitely getting laid that night, that i should take advantage of the situation. some typical drunken male trashtalking ensued. i told them there was a thin line between taking advantage and being taken advantage of, and left for the date. so it's 22.00 and she isnt there. 22.15, still no one. at 22.30 she walked in and acted super cold. she didnt order a drink and was obviously not willing to have a normal conversation. after ten minutes she asked: "so who are you going to take adventage of tonight?" turns out i didn't hang up the phone when i meant to and she heard everything. everything. tldr; didnt hang up the phone when i meant to and my date overheard me and my friends trashtalking about me getting some tonight. didnt get any.technically it was last night, but it crossed over into this morning so it counts. and it's not some humblebrag "i got laid but then x happened." i'm actually can't recall ever having felt this worthless in my life. she drove, we chatted, i made my interest apparent. she seemed to reciprocate. as the night went on and the liquid courage started loosening everybody up, she started getting kinda flirty and feely with a lot of people. should have been my red flag to get the hell out. nope. we ended up at another house with two guys who we had been hanging out with at the party. me and guy #2 played fifa while she sat on the couch with guy #1. they ended up making out. i figured they were going to have sex and i would just have to live with it because she was my ride home. guy #1 gets up and taps guy #2 on the shoulder, and whispers something into his ear. guy #2 sets his controller down, tells me "it's all you dude." she's on the couch cheesing, and the three of them all head down the hall into the same bedroom. i was still in denial until i heard the bed shaking and her squealing. i sat numb for maybe five minutes before going outside and smoking cigarettes until they made me sick. tried to go back inside and lay down, but i made it maybe five minutes before i decided i had to go home. it was about a two hour walk. i'm pretty sure i'm not leaving my bed today. tl;dr - got to hear my crush banging two guys at once and had to walk home. edit - to the people who keep calling her "whore," "slut," "bitch," etc, i don't agree with you and you're really not helping anything at all. edit 2 - she keeps trying to call me. i really see no benefit to anyone in answering. edit 3 - there is just no way i'm going to be able to keep up with all these replies. i'm going to call her and add an edit here later. edit 4 - i'm familiar with the red pill and i won't be joining them, so you can save those suggestions. edit 5 - tifu by calling my (former) crush back the night after having heard her bang two dudes in the other room. claimed she wanted me in there too. so i asked the obvious question, and she says she was drunk and it didn't work out the way she intended. decided to just go with it when i didn't get involved. passed out when it was over. was worried about me, never meant to hurt me, bla bla bla. it helped nothing at all, as i don't really know what i can believe and what i can't. i've seen a few suggestions implying that it may have been rape or that i should have tried to "save" her. the fact is that she practically led *them* down the hall, she was visibly damn happy, and sexual pleasure has a pretty distinct fucking sound. i wasn't going to sit around and listen for it to go south, nor was i going to burst in to what was pretty clearly a consensual sexual encounter that i didn't believe myself to be welcome in just to make sure everything was okay. if you guys want to start barging into the room anytime you hear people fucking at parties, be my guest. i'm not doing that though. whatever. fuck this noise. told her i don't hate her but i don't think we should talk anytime soon. apparently now i have a party to get to tonight. you guys are certainly free to keep bitching about what a "whore" she is if that's what you want to do though. edit 6 - i'm reading all your replies, but sadly, it's just impossible for me to reply to everyone. you guys are great though. thanks for being awesome, reddit.so this really happened yesterday but it's still bad. so i was out shopping with my gf at a popular sporting goods store. she generally doesn't like going with me because i take my sweet ass time looking at anything i find appealing. kinda like she does to me when she shops. it's a good way to get back at her for her shopping expeditions. anyway, the entire time she was following me and she kept running into me. so i asked her, "why do you keep bumping into me?" she replied, "inertia..." without thinking i said, "well maybe if you didn't have so much mass..." her jaw dropped so fucking fast she probably has lock jaw. update 1: so i told her about the post and told her about what yall were saying. she found the post. now i owe her something shiny and a margarita. i was getting my hair cut by a quite attractive woman and my mind was starting to wander. when she was finished with the cut i meant to ask her for a blow dry, but i slipped and asked for a blowjob. i quickly told her what i meant and she just laughed it off. so right now i'm a junior in high school but last friday i asked a girl classmate who i've crushed on since freshman year to be my girlfriend. she said yes, shoo be doo be doo to me. now, every day at lunch ever since last year we've just sat in the library and worked or talked or anything. so today was no different and we're just talking about our plans tonight or something. all of a sudden, the talk redirects to something very interesting she says. "meinster, how long have you liked me?" i was taken aback because i've liked this girl since day one for her beautiful looks, smarts, attitude, etc. "well i've been crushing mad on you since day one" i said or something. but she wasn't satisfied and told me to tell her more, like my inner thoughts and whatnot. naturally, i say "well tbh after i followed you on instagram i used to jack off to your bikini pics, that's how much i crushed on you." to flatter her even more. for some reason she turned red and looked at me in shock, then told me that we're no longer together and she just walked out of the library and to the cafeteria i guess. ...bad mistake? *edit* thanks for the comments. i'd go for a beer at the bar right now, but clearly i'm underage. anyways, on tuesday at school (monday is columbus day) i'll try to salvage this. i'll update then.this occurred a few months ago, but i just discovered this subreddit, so i figured it would still be relevant. for my english class, we were assigned one of ten projects about the book to kill a mockingbird. we were allowed to pick a partner and, without question, locked eyes with the girl who was at the time my best friend. we decided to make the project entitled "make a board game". needless to say, we were going to make a board game. i, who had never had an interaction with a girl outside of school, we wondering how to compose myself; should i just be myself? sure, what could go wrong? we met at the library and got working on our project making sufficient progress and having fun all the while. she slides her chair close to me. really close to me. she starts resting her arm on mine and being a little *too* cozy. eventually she wraps her arms around me and gives me a hug, squeezing me quite a lot. i decide to do what she's doing and hug her, squeezing just as hard. little did i know, i can squeeze a lot harder than a girl who's 5'2" and 110 lbs. *crack* she jumps as if someone scared her. she complains that her side hurt and she is convinced she broke her rib, however, she shakes it off and keeps working. we finish, i go home and she texts me later saying "so you actually broke my rib." and later showed me the x-ray. she didn't hold it against me and actually we ended up dating, and still are to this day. and don't worry, neither if us have broken anything else. tl;dr i was too awkward to know how to hug so i broke my friends rib. now we're dating. love hurts. i was eye flirting with this girl earlier while pumping gas. she came over and introduced herself. being the flirting dude i am, i smoothly smiled and said "digiorno". i wanted to say bonjour, but i screwed up, and she laughed and went back to her car and left after pumping gas. i'm a cashier at a grocery store. one of my friends is a regular and we joke around a lot, usually it starts by me refusing to ring up her groceries and we have a few laughs from there. yesterday was a fairly busy day. i see her get in my line behind the customer i was ringing up. i finish the transaction, so my friend is next. i'm still putting money in my drawer, so without looking up i loudly say "ma'am, we don't serve your kind here." usually at this point my friend laughs and makes a remark right back at me, but this time there was only silence. i look up and see not my friend, but a black woman with a shocked look on her face. my heart drops into my feet and i start to apologize but she puts her basket on the floor and walks away. the front end manager was running the next register over and saw the whole thing. i was fired on the spot. i tried to explain the situation but she just said "punch out and leave right now." i later found out that my friend had forgotten something and had to get out of my line. the black woman took her place. if i had looked up i would have seen. unemployment hearing is next thursday. edit: gold on a throwaway account??? so i was snapchatting with this girl i knew for a while and things were getting a little heated. i get a snapchat from her with her showing her tits. the only reasonable thing to do was to send her a dick pic. so i send her the dick pic with the caption "you like?" and after maybe an hour without a response i text her asking if she didn't like my last snapchat. she says she never got a picture back. so now i'm like fuck fuck fuck who do i send that dick pic to and i go to check my history and the most recent update was the snapchat from the girl showing me her tits. my stomach immidiatly sunk because i knew what i did. i go to check my mystory and there it was. for those of you who don't know what a mystory is, you basically post pictures to it and everyone in your snapchat contacts can see it, which includes about 50 of my friends and family, almost all of which saw my dick. tl;dr: sent a picture of my dick to my friends and family.firstly i have never been in a relationship so a mate told me to start using tinder. i'm not a model, i'm just an average college guy looking for some girls to hang with so when i got matched with a few really pretty girls i was very happy. so this all started around 2 months ago i started talking to a girl let's call her ella, she was very pretty and we had a lot in common we went out 6 times we had fun and nothing was official. a month a go i got matched with another very pretty girl but at this point i was really starting to like ella but this girl let's call her emily sent me two messages so being the nice guy i was i sent her a message back after a couple weeks of talking to emily she wanted to get some drinks i thought what the hell i don't think ella is really that into me anyway. little did i know that i received a text from ella in the middle of the date i had with emily asking if i was interested in becoming a little more serious (i was and she was one of the nicest and most interesting girls i had ever talked to). so at this point i had two girls that where in to me, being a 20 year old nerdy virgin that sits on reddit all day i was stoked. after a few drinks emily asked if i wanted to go back to her place, shit i panicked i wasn't expecting this i had no condoms and was freaking the fuck out i said let's get one more round during this i rushed to the bathroom hoping they had those baby prevention machines that spit out condoms for a buck. yes, they did i bought 5 i was that excited and who knows i might break one or something. so i finish my drink and we start walking back to her place, a little bit tipsy i start talking dirty but luckily she's totally into it. we start walking up the stairs to her place and before she opens the door she says "shhh *giggles* my room mates a huge nerd and is probably in bed". so we get inside i try to take my shoes off and just my fucking luck my fat ass hits the small fish bowl next to the front door... who the fuck puts a glass fish bowl next to the front door. smash! water every where she starts freaking out and i try to pick up the glass. but we both just start laughing. then i hear my name "mick, what are you doing here" totally confused half drunk and thinking that emily was just playing with me i rambled "to fuck you obviously" i look up and turns out emily and ella are room mates and poor old mick is still a virgin. tl;dr: virgin, started using tinder. had two girls that turned out to be room mates. still a virgin. when i was 18 i used to run food out to the customers for the local restaurant. but on my way to the table i happen to glance over to see a girl playing the virtual hunting arcade game that you would see in the back of almost every restaurant. more particularly the shirt she was wearing. it was a workout shirt that had the holes for your arms cut down to about mid side, leaving the entire side of her upper body exposed. how she only had a bra on underneath, mixed with the way she was leaning left her entire boob just hanging out. when i saw this i walked over to one of my more favorite waitresses and said "do you see that girl over there (nudging my head in her direction)."she is hanging out if you know what i mean". she looked over at the girl and back at me and said "you mean my daughter"?so this afternoon i was mid fap and i heard my phone buzz. i looked over and saw that i had received a snapchat from a girl that i know pretty well from my athletics team, who is also pretty hot. so, feeling frisky, i decided that right before the moment suprême i would open the snapchat and cum to her picture. i was fapping away and was almost about to come when i opened the picture.... it was a picture of a dead pigeon she had found lying on the street. at this exact moment i came and because i was caught off guard it got all over my shirt and pants.. after a few seconds of cumming the entire realisation of shame and disgust came over me and i hobbled to the toilet to clean myself up. tl;dr: fapped to a dead birdthis happened 20 mins ago. so i always thought boobies were nice. they were soft and squishy and pretty and fun. i thought hey! i think girls are pretty, boobs feel nice and pussy is cute. maybe i'm bisexual or a lesbian? so i took a girl on a date. it was fun and one thing led to another and candles were lit, music was playing, no words existed but the sound of us kissing. i felt like a playa. i wined and dined this pretty girl and she totally wanted me. i was feeling egotistical. she was on top of me, grinding into me. her back was arching, soft whimpers and moans escaped her pretty mouth. and then i sat there, boob in hand and thought "man i could really go for penis right about now". and then it hit me as she started to go down my pants that shit! i don't want to finger her. i don't want her fingering me! just not my thing. at all. so i finished the movie with her and was curteous and saw her out. but now i have to figure out how not to be a jerk and not see her again. i fucked up. edit: thanks a million for all the advice guys! i'm glad you got a kick out of my fuck up. /u/penguin_ftw linked a video that describes my experience perfectly right [here]( thanks! :) update: so i told the lady i took on a date last night that she was beautiful, wonderful, sweet and kind and a ton of fun! but it just so happens i'm not as much into girls as i had thought. just not right for me personally. but she is awesome and kind and i had a great time! and she sounded disappointed but in the end was okay with it. said she understood. thanks for your help my fellow redditors!we were laying in bed, post coitus, watching the crazies and she has her hand resting on my junk. during the car wash scene i decided to scare her when a crazy smashes the car window, a bad bad move on my part. she jumped and squished my balls in her hand at the same time. i fucked up, boy did i fuck up. so this happened like 3 weeks ago. me and my girlfriend of 3 years were sitting on her bed whilst she was doing here make-up and i was watching some tv. usually we have these weird conversations that don't even make sense. we started talking about how everything we know and see could be fake, and that it could all be part of our own imagination. when we stopped talking for a couple of seconds she looked at me and said: ''maybe you aren't real either''. my girlfriend is the type of girl that is easy to persuade when it comes to these things and is interested in supernatural things, so i knew i had to do something evil. at this point im not even looking at her anymore and she continued doing her make-up. i lowered my voice and softly whispered: ''i'm not real''. loud enough for her to hear but she still didn't look at me. she then said: ''i mean, it could be? maybe you are just someone i made up in my mind and i'm just talking to myself right now''. slowly i went to the other side of the bed while she was still talking about the same topic. when i finally got to the other side i hid myself behind the bed, she could not see me if she turned around. she didn't look up for like 30 seconds, but when she did she freaked out. real bad. real fast. she started crying out of nowhere because she really thought for a second that i didn't exist. i tried not to laugh and still hid myself but after 10 seconds of hearing her cry i showed myself. we didn't talk for 2 days. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- edit: cyae1 narrated this story, this just made my day [link]( edit: a bit more background: my girlfriend and i scare eachother all the time. the truth is that she has this thing that if she gets scared real bad she starts to cry(first time she did), i just didn't know she would be like this. the reason she didn't want to talk to me was because i couldn't stop laughing and didn't take her serious. i still bring this up if i need a good laugh, hope you did too. edit: we both laugh about it now and she doesn't mind it all. we are both looking through the comments and we cant believe the theories people come up with to give this all a reason. she got scared - she cried - we laughed in the end. also, my native language isn't english, so spelling/grammar won't be on point all the time. edit: thanks for the gold kind stranger!so, my wife met an old friend of hers a few days ago and decided to invite her over with her husband for a dinner. we recently moved to a new apartament and i guess wifey wanted to show off how nice of a kitchen we have. i had a vague memory of who that friend is and i remember i didn't like her too much - let's call her x for this story. anyway, we prepared an oriental meal together for them (we like oriental food and it's what we usually cook for our guests too). x arrived with her husband soon after and we all sat for the dinner. it wasn't going that bad at first; i made them laugh with a few jokes and we had a pleasant conversation. suddenly, x pulled out a hair out of her chicken strip. it was long and she looked at it with disgust. my wife turned all red and started to frantically apologize while x looked at us with that face of disgust and contempt (she's a bit of a b*tch and clearly a false woman, i really have no idea why my wife is friends with her). i wanted to save the day somehow; my thoughts were racing and without any second thought, i spilled the "joke" out of my mouth: "ya know it could've be worse, could've been a pube" all of a sudden (i have no idea why), x puked all over her place at the table. she tried to cover her mouth with her hands but it didn't help too much. my wife was looking at me with eyes wide open. x let out some inhuman sounds and furiously walked towards the door, slamming them. her husband gave us a quick look, muttered "sorry" and rushed after her, collecting her shoes from the corridor. my wife only said "really? really?" and closed herself in the bathroom. i think she's taking a bath. i cleaned up all the mess but she still didn't leave the bathroom. **update:** i think the things settled down a bit. my wife said i'm the dumbest man ever but she still loves me. **update 2:** x' husband texted us saying he's sorry for the mess. according to my wife, x didn't contact her yet. i hope it'll remain that way.unlike most tifu, this one actually happened today. so, i'm a dentist. there was a young early 20s new patient in the office today whose boyfriend tagged along. at some point during the exam, the topic of breaking bad came up. i'm a huge fan and pretty much recommend it to anyone if i find out they haven't seen it. i know it's on netflix so, at some point, while talking to them, i'm mentioning how good it is and i tell them they can go netflix and chill. i've seen the phrase here a bit and on other social media. since netflix has become so big, i assumed it just meant relax and watch something on netflix and that was what the young kids were doing a lot these days. they both kind of look at each other, giggle, and mention something like they could do that. i'm not young, but i'm under 40 and i thought they just found it funny i would use a newer phrase. fast forward to tonight. i'm just sitting here watching baseball when this epiphany strikes out of nowhere. i realize there was something a little off about their reaction to my using that phrase. so i googled it... just to make sure. now i'm horrified that i told a young couple to go home and have sex. i only hope it was obvious, i didn't know what i was saying. edit: i'm just glad i'm not the only one who didn't know. hopefully this helped others not repeat my mistake. :pi'll make this short and sweet. i was in the kitchen not doing anything special when my girlfriend walks in and says she's hungry. seeing this as an opportunity to drop my pants, i quickly undo my belt and say something along the lines of "well you're in luck, i have a sausage just for you!" and begin waving it around like i just don't care. from out of nowhere my dog sneaks up from behind and gives my penis a sniff and a lick. i got head from my dog. yes this actually happened today. a little backstory i been working for a electronics store and i recently switched positions for a pay raise. after switching i found i was actually getting paid less than what they said. after i reported they said they'd get back with me. so eventually they told me they sent a "email", its been over a month and i texted my boss fuming about my pay and he's like " oh op i was going to tell you you were being bumped up but with a attitude like that wait 90 days. " edit: so i went in to work apologized to my other manager and he told me the higher up still hasn't replied to the email. so you guys are right my manager is a liar and a scumbag. i can't afford to quit but i am now looking for another job. if you guys want to see what i sent this morning to my manager i'll post it. btw my first real post on reddit and i'm on iphone sorry for typos. thanks for all the advice guys. i want to marry all of you ;)today was unlike any other day. being the horny 15 year old i am, i decided to spice things up a bit tonight. i waited the sweet moment for my brother to leave to work so i can proceed with my dirty secret. but today my hand would not do that job. i was too horny for that. i decided to look up some "homemade sex toys for males" on youtube and found one that seemed relatively easy to make. so i grab a ziplock bag, fill it with conditioner, slide it under the couch cushion, and begin my wonderful couch fucking. this is where i fuck up. it started burning but i ignored it for a few minutes before it became unbearable and decided to just jerk off and slide it in right before i cum. so i'm so close and decide to put it in. now i'm a virgin so i've never felt anything this good in my life before. anywhoo i didn't realize my grandpa had come upstairs (everyone else was downstairs). so, here i am pants down at my ankles fucking my couch when i hear the door to downstairs fly open. as i previously stated i've never felt it this good so i couldn't stop. i came right as he turned the corner frozen like a deer in headlights. he quickly turned the corner and proceeded to tell everyone! my life is over i'm so embarrassed. and to top it off my dick is on fire. tl;dr my grandpa watched me fuck the couch edit-sorry for the shitty grammar. edit-2 front page! so this happened about 2 months ago, i'm a cook at a small family owned restaurant but i can fill in for the bussers when they need which is what i was doing on that fatefull day. im a pretty quiet guy so bussing and hosting is a bit out of my element so i was already uncomfortable enough as it was. then this middle aged overeweight couple came in looking for a table to sit at. these people were probably 300 lbs each, keep in mind i would never judge them or make fun of them. i asked them, as i ask all parties that come in, how many people they had. this is where it starts to go south, they said two but in a loud restaurant and being far away i somehow heard 5. they asked to sit in the bar but i told these two overeweight people, thinking they needed a table for 5 that our biggest table in the bar was for 4 but "they could probably fit." the man looked at me funny and said ok... we will just sit here, pointing at a booth that also seats 4. i said ok, "would you like me to get an extra chair to put on the end for more space?" this time the man looked angry and said "its ok, i can fit my fatass in here." at this point i was starting to realize something was up so i tried to explain myself by saying that i just wanted them to have enough space. this didnt help my case. the man now looked furious and asked what my problem was. i then realized what could be the problem and asked how many people were with them, they told me 2 and i then apologized and explained my confusion. the man didnt think it was funny though and i avoided them all night. i did tell my manager what happened and she laughed her ass off. tl; dr: thought a fat couple wanted a table of 5 when they only wanted a table for 2, repeatedly told them they couldnt fit at a table for 4. edit: formattingmade this throwaway to tell this for obvious reasons. yesterday i decided to spice things up with my wife so i went to the kitchen, got cream and back to the dark room i started to pour it on her breasts and lick it off. i thought it tasted a bit weird but i was horny, i didn't care. when we turned the lights on we saw the cream was all brown/green of mold. i've been shitting since i woke up. i'm a dad of a beautiful 3 year old girl. any dad of a daughter will tell you that bathroom stuff is part of the deal. if mom is not around, or tending to one of the others, i have to take my little girl into the men's room. so this happened at a quiet little mom &amp; pop restaurant. it was just the two of us in there. i wipe off and cover the seat so she can do her little tinkle...but then i realize i really have to go. no big deal. i just place her in the corner of the stall and say "don't move." i start to pee. i hear the door to the restroom open, meaning we are now no longer the only two occupants. i hear two guys walk in. as one of the sets of footsteps draw near, my little girl starts to back away from the door and ends up right next to me. she looks down at what's going on (with an "open door" policy on the bathroom at home, and her two brothers...it's nothing she hasn't seen before) and loudly exclaims: "daddy!! look at your little penis!!" what...the... i hear the other guys in the bathroom kind of snort...and then let loose in laughter. first of all...wow. she's never said that before...or since. second...what is here frame of reference!!?? i didn't know what i could possibly say to make it any better. i kind of wanted to yell out "um..she's just kidding...it's normal size" but i figured that any remark trying to clarify my size would just come off as creepy. i just stayed in the stall until the other two guys left. i couldn't face them. i'm sure they were out there in the restaurant watching to see me come out so they could tell their wives about the guy who has a tiny wiener by three year old standards!! tl;dr my daughter publicly insults my manhood edit: wow, thanks for the interest everyone! also, for those concerned about "open door policy" i guess i should clarify that it's not so much a policy as a fact of life with 3 kids and 2 parents in a smallish house. everybody has seen everybody else's stuff and it's no big deal.so i'm hoping a load of people are going to come out in support of me here but i've got that sinking feeling i may be alone in this. our toilet broke so i was in shopping for new ones and the sales person joked (no doubt for the millionth time) that i'll want one that automatically puts the seat down after i'm finished with it. i 'joked' back and said if i didn't have a wife i could save money and not buy one with a seat and i'd never have to hear women complaining about putting it down again. to which he gave me a strange look and said "but what about when you need to poop?". i naturally pointed out that i'm a guy and therefore don't put the seat down, i sit on the rim of the bowl. several embarrassing moments later, i realize that i've misunderstood my entire life and that guys do indeed use the toilet seat. i left empty handed and red faced. thinking about it now, it makes sense. especially how men's restrooms have seats. but i just assumed it was a unisex/cost saving/oversight deal.sooo...roughly a year ago i was about to take a shower when i decided i wanted to listen to some music to make the mundane process more pleasant. i had already disrobed, so i walked my naked self into the living room to retrieve the computer. my wife was lying between the computer and me, on the floor, face-up, playing with our dog bert. so i stepped around her, got the computer, then turned to head back to the bathroom. only this time instead of stepping around her, i thought it would be a lark if i pretended to teabag her as i walked by...you know, stand over her and squat a few inches then stop. we'd both share a good laugh at the thought of me tapping her chin with my scrote. you know, something all good husbands do! so i walk back over, stand over her face, bend a few inches at the knee-- -- and i tear my quadriceps tendon. edit: thanks for the first gold ever, guys! and for taking my dumb ass to the front page :d edit: obligatory "this didn't happen today", it happened last night. close enough. so i came home from work yesterday, ate dinner, and went on reddit. i checked the subs i normally do, like nosleep, askreddit, jokes, stuff like that. usually i save tifu for last because it's the most entertaining. i started reading all of the tifu's. after the front page was exhausted, i looked at "new". [this]( popped up and i clicked on the link in the text post. in case you guys don't know, the link contains an image of a black dude with a gigantic dick. right at this moment, my dad just chooses to walk by (i'm 16, by the way). he saw the image of the black dude. after this, he went into his room and didn't come out for a while. later, he gave me this talk. "look, it's okay if you're gay. you didn't have to try to close the window when i walked by. i support you 100 percent, but try not to look at porn all the time, okay?" thanks, reddit. edit: holy shit, this got big. no pun intended. backstory: i'm from the west coast and have moved to the south. there's a lot of things i don't know. my boyfriend and his friends had a get-together last night and were hanging out, just chatting. i normally let them have their guy time but was in the dining room getting some pizza and just saying hi. they were talking about football: what they'd do if they were a coach, made their own team, etc. i don't know anything about football but just wanted to add in for the fun of it. i thought for a second and came up with a clever idea. my favorite animal is a raccoon and our state animal is a raccoon. i quickly piped in, "if i had a team, i'd call them the coons!" they looked at me for a second, completely shocked. half the table started laughing hysterically and the other half, especially the black guy, were just giving me the most 'wtf' look. i had no idea what i'd said. finally they explained it to me and everyone got a good little chuckle out of it and i'm never going to live it down. needless to say i think i'll just let them have their guy time for now on. this fu happened yesterday night. so my sister who lives nearby had to go out shopping for a bit and decided to leave her 5 year old daughter with me. i have exams coming up so it's not the best time to babysit, but being the good brother i am, i agree. the night is uneventful and it's getting way past her bedtime so i take her upstairs to my room to sleep. a few minutes later, she comes down and tells me "sing me a song so i can go to sleep". i am really swamped with my studies and being the lazy ass i am, i tell her "i'm really busy right now, but you can just go on my computer, it's right by the bed, and search 'go to sleep' on youtube and you'll find a bunch of songs." [yes, she knows how to use a computer (kids these days)]. anyways, a few minutes later, my sister returns. she comes in and i tell her, proud as ever, that i put her to sleep by playing a lullaby on youtube. so we walk upstairs, and as we near my bedroom we can start hearing a song.. it sounds nothing like a lullaby. walk in and all we hear is "... and go to sleep bitch! die motherfucker die, bye bye, motherfucker, bye bye! go to sleep bitch! why are you still alive?! why?! die motherfucker!" i don't even know why i said to type "go to sleep" and not "lullaby" or some shit. i'm retarded. pretty sure i'm not babysitting her again. it never really made sense why over the course of three years i never got one comment or upvote/downvote for all of my posts. reddit is an absolutely huge site, but after a couple years you begin to have your doubts. i decided to check to see if i could see my posts in an incognito browser and saw that none of my posts existed. what the fuck?! it was at that moment i realized that from my first post i was shadow banned and all of my contributions over three years never was viewed by a soul. i can't fucking believe i never caught onto it sooner. i've had my hand raised for three years and no one could ever see me and i never questioned it. *check my post history to see the barren world. background. my cousin and i (both male) were having a sleep over when we were around 6 years old. we started talking about girls and about how they could pee, we couldn't figure it out so we started to come up with ideas. one thing led to another and we started talking about how to have sex with a girl, since we had never seen a vagina we thought maybe it was the butt. curious we proceeded to put our little peckers into each others butts and just lay there. one on his stomach and the other on top, we would switch positions. at the time i thought nothing of it, but years down the road when i was a teenager i realized what the hell had happened. i tried my best to ignore this little piece of history and so did my cousin. but every time we would hang out as we grew up you could tell it was still awkward and was only getting worse. fast forward 20 years and we are both married, out at dinner on a double date and we had an obviously gay waiter. my cousins wife remarks, "i don't understand how they can have sex with other men, that is just weird" i causally said "its pretty easy". both wives look at me and i go "what, like you've never had causal gay sex with your cousin when you were 6 before?". my stupid brain thought this would be a good way to finally break the ice on the situation, i meant it to be so ridiculous that the wives would never think i was serious. instead it led to a lengthy conversation of "what the hells" and "oh my fucking gods" as my cousin and i tried to explain to our wives why we had gay sex in a walk in closet at my grandmothers house at the age of 6. tifu by letting my wife and cousin's wife know that we had gay sex when we were children. in a restaurant, with a gay waiter. im sure people overheard. my friend was complaining how bad fallout 4 looked on her ps4. i jokingly told her that she should plug her **galaxy s6** to upgrade the graphics and i even showed her a video how the ps4 can use the hardware of a smartphone to improve performance/graphics. she believed it and told me she'll try it soon. i was internally laughing about the silliness of the situation, on my way out i told her "don't forget to charge your phone in the microwave first for 1 minute before plugging it in your ps4, google it if you don't believe me!". i left while having a laugh, thinking that she'd figure out its all bs, i mean the microwave your **iphone** thing... everyone knows that! 4 hours later (about 30 minutes ago), i got a phone call from her brother telling me the said friend "cooked" her phone and she is yelling like a banshee that she will murder me. i switched off my phone, i logged out of everything on my pc... guys... i am terrified...ok so i live in colorado and have separate gas and electric companies and typically this time of year your gas bill goes up and electric goes down. so money has been tight with the holiday's coming up we have had to forgo some things we have wanted like everyone does this time of year. i pay the bills every friday. so today i go online to pay my gas bill, and keep in mind the last few months i have paid $90.00 then $117.00 then $247.00 last month which seems oddly high but it was minus 11 at one point so i chalk it up to that. today i check it and its $597.98 and i lose it i'm wtfing all over the place, i call customer service and i am ready to fight. "listen my bill is to high i have no idea why it would be that much!" so the lady on the other end calmly says "well sir back in august you over paid by about 58 dollars and a credit went onto your account see that cr on your account?" "yes..." i say slowing starting to realize what's going on. she says "well... you have been paying the credit balance the past 3 months and that 596 is a credit on your account not a past due would you like us to send you a check for the 596?." i of course say yes and needless to say i am an idiot but we wont be completely broke this christmas. tifu in a pretty decent way. i wake up, look around, and think "fuck yeah, labor day". it's maybe 8am. my gf had already left for work. alarm goes off. swipe. bitch, it's labor day. second alarm goes off. swipe. uhh, still labor day, shitty phone alarm. gtfo third alarm goes off. slept through it like a boss. no more alarms. wake up at 1130. check phone. 3 missed calls and 7 texts. uhh. reading a few... then my shitty brain puts 1 and 0 together. dicks. it am not be labor day. 1230 now. be rolling in to work. will update. update: nobody even noticed. winning.for once in my life, i am actually successfully talking to a girl. things are going alright, and she sends me some pics so i attempt to return the favor. i take some dick pics with my new iphone 6. it's important to note, i'm taking and sending the dick pics while i'm pretending to shower. i watch youtube videos on my apple tv while i'm working out so my phone was still set to airplay. my sister and mother are watching some shitty show on netflix while i am "showering". if you've ever used an apple tv you know that if someone from an iphone sends their signal to the tv it will overrule whatever's currently happening. so their netflix show must have been replaced by my dick pic once i opened it in the photos app to determine if it was worthy. while i am touching up my dick pic picture i hear screaming coming from downstairs. i frantically remember "oh fuck my airplay is on". that was a bad feeling. they run upstairs and yell what am i doing, i pretend i can't hear even though my shower is certainly not overpoweringly loud. we haven't spoken yet. tonight has been awkward.this happened a few days ago. i was out with my two youngest kids at the grocery store. when we were pulling up, in front of the christian book store next door, there was a mother and two young kids, probably about 5 and 3, holding a sign that said they were "poor and hungry, please help." i am trying to teach my children about giving back at a young age so they grow up to be good, helpful and respectful people. since we were going into the grocery store anyway, i picked up a small jug of milk, some bread, some fruits and two pieces of candy for the kids (since it's the holidays and it was starting to snow, the candy was more of a bonus for them being forced to stand outside in the cold). i explained to my boys what we were doing and they were excited to help out. we paid for all of our things and walked out. i was feeling pretty good about myself at this point. we walked over to the family standing in the snow and i handed the mother the bag. her reply was "no, i would like cash" i'm sorry, but if you're "poor and hungry", you should be more than excited that someone would go out of their way to buy some essentials, or even accept it for the children, because the children definitely looked like they have been missing more than a few meals recently. she, on the other hand, did not. i set the bag down next to the children, said merry christmas and went on my way. i watched her eat the candy out of the bag and set the rest next to her. luckily, my children aren't quite old enough to realize what happened and still think we did a good thing. i will continue to let them think that. tifu by trying to help a family who claimed they were poor and hungry, found out only the children are (probably) hungry and were being used to get cash.this actually happened less than 5 minutes ago. my daughter was born last week, 10 weeks early. my wife and i have settled into a routine of visiting the nicu every morning. because i already work remotely, i just use the wifi at the hospital. between lack of sleep and too much reddit, i'm starting to get a little foggy brained. while my wife was reading some children's book to our daughter, i hear her say "you like that?" without thinking, i finish the sentence with "you fucking retard?" even the nurse in the room felt the look of death. this happened yesterday. so, i was lying on my bed in my room at home, reading, when i heard the front door open and my flatmate come in with a girl. he clearly didn't think i was home, because they immediately went to his room (which shares a wall with mine). i was mildly amused by this, so i decided not to go out and ruin their fun. before long, they start getting down to it and, since they didn't think i was home, they weren't shy about being vocal. he was grunting away, and she was moaning pretty loudly, shouting his name, etc. all this noise started to turn me on, so i started masturbating, figuring that this was better than porn because it was real-life. eventually, the girl started moaning even louder, which i took to indicate that she was cumming, and there was some definite wall-banging as well, so it didn't take me long to finish either. satisfied, i went back to my book. after about half an hour or so, i was bored of being confined to my room, so i went out into the lounge, not really caring if i'd embarrass them; we're all adults, we can just laugh it off. i walked into the lounge to find my flatmate sitting on the couch, watching tv, with his arm around my little sister. christ. what have i done? edit: wow, this really took off. thanks to all who have commented. i tried to reply to a decent number, but there are way, way too many for me to get through. if you desperately want to grill me for details as some seem to want to, or you want an update, feel free to pm me. no insults, though, hopefully :) . so this didn't happen today but back in high school. my cheeks still get red every time i think about this. my boyfriend my senior year of high school lived in the same neighborhood as i did, so we saw each other fairly often. he was hanging out at my house after school one day, and my parents decided to leave to go pick us up some food for dinner. we had been dating more than a year at this point, so they were okay with leaving us alone. well the second they left, we got down to business and the blow job train was a'rollin. since we were both really into it, we didn't hear the garage door go up or the downstairs door open. next thing i know i hear my dad calling my name coming up the stairs. my boyfriend's pants are down. i've got slobber all around my mouth. apparently my dad had been calling me on my cell this whole time asking about a clarification on what we wanted to eat, so he had a pretty good idea what was up. my bf puts a pillow over his crotch and i wipe the side of my face and sprint to the door. i open it right as he's standing outside of it. "hey dad, what's up?" "hey v_jax, i brought y'all the food you wanted from moe's, but it seems as if you've already eaten." cue silent walkaway. i hang my head in shame. boyfriend leaves. i eat my quesadilla alone in my room. so i made [this sex calendar]( as a joke for my boyfriend who's in town right now. i put it on the fridge so i can reference it from time to time ... specifically when i want it. fast forward to yesterday, for some reason my power wasn't working correctly, in some rooms it was on, in others it wasn't, so i called my dad over to see if he could figure out what was going on. i completely forgot about the calendar on my fridge and he walked around the apartment checking appliances to see what worked and what didn't. it wasn't until i went to get something to drink from the fridge that i saw it and realized i had to hide it immediately, which i did. i wasn't sure if he had seen it, but he hadn't said anything so i hoped for the best. then, in the evening i get a call from my mom. she just wants to talk like always, but then she says my dad said i have very interesting choices of fridge decorations. i didn't know what to say, i just laughed and pretended like i didn't know what she was talking about, but now i have no idea how i'm going to look my parents in the face the next time i see them. tl;dr i made a calendar that said i want my boyfriend's dick every day and my dad saw it.today i had to make my way to my company's main office. as i got there for an unrelated matter, the hr lady hands me my paycheck and says: "we made sure to include your bonus here." "what bonus?" "the extra $20,000 addition to your salary." "i'm not too sure what you're talking about but okay." "hang on" she goes to speak with her boss and comes back and said she made a mistake and needs to change it. and that's how i gave up the biggest raise i've ever gotten!so today i decided to jack off in my bathroom before i took a shower. i lied down on my back on the floor(you should try it) and started fapping away. i hear a thud on the roof about halfway through my session and thought it was no big deal. **wrong** i forgot that my house was getting re-roofed today. so as i am furiously stroking my sausage, looking up at the skylight directly above me, this heavy, sweaty mexican guy looks down at me. we locked eyes for about two seconds before he moved away from the skylight. i jumped up, got dressed, and hid in my room the rest of the day until they left. edit: was not expecting to make the top page. thank you all for laughing at/with me. for everyone saying "how do you forget your house is being re-roofed?" its my parents house and they mentioned it a weeks or so earlier.so, i recieved a new watch a few days ago. it's a pretty decent one that runs apps and connects to your phone to allow you to read your notifications on the watch. it's lazy, but it's cool. in any case, my morning was going as normal as ever, until i decided to go to the restroom. now, this was no ordinary piss - the force was strong with this one. a few seconds in, i felt a vibration from my watch, which was conviently on the hand which held my pisser. i instinctively turned my wrist to look at my notification, only to realize the error of my ways as the yellow stream came my way. this is where my second fuck up came in. instead of doing the rational thing and moving my head away, i opened my mouth in shock. that is the story of how i accidentally pissed in my mouth.so i was back in my home town and my wife and i went to a nice seafood restaurant with some old friends of mine from high school, and some of their parents. on the way out of the place, we were all headed through the lobby which narrowed to a hall that was only wide enough for two people to walk shoulder to shoulder at best. an older couple was coming in so we stepped out of the way to let them pass. as we were standing there i gave my wife a loving pat on the ass. i immediately heard "wrong ass" . one of the girls that came with us, an old girlfriend from school, had somehow switched places with my wife. what made it worse was it was her husband and her parents were all there. they had quite a good laugh at my expense while i turned as red as the lobster i had for dinner. fuck. i'll never hear the end of this.before i start this story i should mention that a) both of us have a solid sense of humor, and b) i had my revenge in 24 hours. i work in a very large building with a lot of different companies and a small restaurant area on the top two floors. my girlfriend stopped by to visit me on my lunch break, and while we're eating lunch on the top floor, she tells me that her brother's girlfriend convinced her brother to do something by crying in front of him. i made an offhand comment about how i didnt see how that would make much of a difference and said (in a very superior tone) it definitely wouldnt work on me. my girlfriend asserted that she could totally convince me to do something by crying. i disagreed, saying that because my girlfriend is definitely not the kind of person who cries very often, any attempt to manipulate me through tears would be very obvious and therefore ineffective. i also told her that she probably couldn't pull it off anyway, since she was such an infrequent crier. you can probably figure out the rest of the story. the conversation moved on to other topics, and i had already forgotten about our discussion by the time we go to get in the elevator. we get in the elevator with three older businessmen and an older grandma-ish woman. just as the doors close, she starts sobbing out of the fucking blue. i announce loudly that the fake tears arent going to work on me. it turns out this is a really great way to draw attention to the crying girl in the elevator, and make me look like a massive asshole. the grandma-ish woman asks if she's alright, and she goes, "i'm fine, i just had a fight with my boyfriend." and then my gf turns to me and say, "you didn't mean it, did you? i promise i'll ask your permission first next time." im trying to make her break character, so i go im sorry, do i know you? i swear to god, i almost screwed her up, she half-giggled but turned it into a weird sobbing noise and goes do you see how he treats me! i swear to god, if looks could kill. the three guys were getting off at the 10th floor, so the doors open on 10 and one of them gives me a last look (like he'd like to take me behind the building and beat me to a pulp) before leaving the elevator. grandma-ish woman is still watching us suspiciously. i finally lean over and tell her she won and to cut it out. my girlfriend makes a miraculous recovery, and a few other people enter and exit the elevator without incident. grandmaish woman tells her to "take care of herself" before leaving. tl;dr: goaded my girlfriend into making me look like an abusive asshole to prove a point. obligatory "this wasn't today" post. it was last saturday, and my friends presented me with the question,"hey xxc0dexsilv3rxx, what does a vagina feel like?" rather than trying to explain a whole new concept to my friends, i decided to relate it to something we all know and love... or so i thought. i responded with,"do you know when you feel your butthole..." the room went silent. after a short pause, i was met with resounding laughter. various "what!" and "huh?" sounds ensued. turns out, not everyone has felt their own buttholes before. from what i've recently learned, nobody i know has ever felt their butthole. now everyone at school calls me "finger popper" and "the butthole kid." not just the guys i told, but everyone. fuck my life, and not in the butthole.so last night i was in bed waiting for my wife to finish her before bed rituals when my 8 year old daughter comes in for a good night hug and kiss. we get to talking and i use the line "girls rule and boys drool" cause she's at that age where the boys at school think otherwise. the part where i messed up was at that exact moment i catch the eye of my 4 year old son who was also in the room, and the look of pure defeat on his face was so depressing and his poor little soul crushed i thought maybe i scared him for life. in an attempt to bring back his manhood i had to tell him girls go to jupiter to get more stupider and boys go to mars to get more candy bars. he likes candy, so he probably won't be scarred for life. a kid on the bus makes a funny face at me so i make a funny face back. we're stuck in traffic so we get into a little contest and exchange funny faces for the next while. the kid is an amateur, he just keeps pulling the same face. i've got an arsenal full of funny faces so naturally i crush him and win the battle. i scan the rest of the bus in search of a more worthy opponent however i meet eyes with an elderly lady. her facial expression looks like she has just found out there's been a death in the family and i'm the one responsible. i can see the raging storm of anger welling up inside of her. her beady eyes are so focused on mine, i swear i can feel my pupils searing under the intensity of her glare so i break eye contact and look back at my buddy. to my horror, only then do i realise that the child was never making a funny face at me. he is disabled. this happened around christmas. a gay couple i am friends with invited me to their house party. i am a straight 29/m, they are middle aged. they had also invited about 2 dozen other gay men from around town. i didn't know anyone else there. after i arrived, i tried to mingle with the other guests. one was about to tell a raunchy story, but acknowledged that he didn't know me. "before i start, are you family?" not knowing what this meant, i thought he was asking if i would be offended by gay stories. "yeah, i'm family, go right ahead!" i replied. his eyes grew wide. i was now the young new guy at the party, and everyone wanted to get to know me. all night long everyone was over the top nice to me, and naively i thought they were just being welcoming to the newcomer in their midst. until at the end of the night, one of them started hitting on me. when we realized my mistake, we all had a laugh, but i had about 20 new facebook friend requests the next morning. what's more, because i had just ended things with my live in girlfriend the week before, my host friends had thought i was coming out too, and were planning on making a celebratory announcement until it was stopped at the last minute. embarrassing mistake, but i will have a funny story out of it at least!last night, i meant to go to bed early, because i had to get up this morning at five to help my grandpa sort calves we were selling. i went to bed at 1130, but proceeded to browse reddit until four. i only got like 30 min of sleep, and ended up being exhausted during the sorting. i was so tired that my reaction times were crap, and didn't get out of the way of an angry mama cow soon enough. she head-butted me up against the feedbunk and cracked 4 of my ribs. :( i guess this gives me time to play fallout 4 for the next few weeks... tl;dr: stayed up too late, reaction time was crap, broke ribs.while i understand that sex can be an intensifier to a fu and that it can make things funnier (generally speaking), this subreddit is becoming overrun by constant tifus which have to do with sex, porn, or masturbation, and i can't be the only one who thinks this is becoming a bit dry. [this is the second page of my account](so, i work for ird, the equivalent of irs in the united states, and i have 30 sick days a year. i haven't taken any sick days in the past 2 years of me working there. i thought, "hey, why not?" so i decided to have a day off. i had a great sleep in, and i thought it would be a nice idea to smoke some pot. i smoked multiple bongs and got a strange call, from my fucking boss. she asked my why i wasn't at work, and out of quick &amp; stoned thinking. i came up with the conclusion that i should say i have bronchitis. but instead, the words that came out of my mouth were, "i'm in bed, i have brontosaurus." i now have to attend a disciplinary meeting, this wednesday. tldr: i took a day off and now i'm in a disciplinary meeting.old home with old fashioned door knob, the kind that has an open key hole all the way through it. before work i sprayed it full of expanding foam, quite proud of myself for easily fixing the draft problem. after work realize what a mistake i've made when i can't get back into my house.so sometimes when i show friends or people how you can request money over google wallet, i'll send a request for a few thousand bucks to close friends with a note saying something like "for my ransom" or "need crack". they know whats up, they read it, chuckle and reject the request, it's all good. except today i got this [email]( from google... edit: all out of inbox invites, /u/herrsergio and /u/3sidedpolygon and /u/olddaze enjoy your inbox, everyone else go bother those guys :)so here i am, just got off work, drinking a beer, standing in this amazing hot shower and browsing reddit on my phone. my wife is asleep and refuses to wake up even though she promised to sex me up in the shower when i got home. she just walked in butt naked and slides the door open to step in and stops. "are you really on your fucking phone? ....are you on reddit??" "uhhhh.... yes?" she just turned around and walked back out. so here i am. enjoying my hot shower, cold beer, and browsing reddit. i hate you guys.greatest/worst thing ever just happened to me, so buckle up folks..it's story time: girl on a dating app tells me in the first few messages that i'm really cute (true) and interesting (also true) and asks me to meet her at 1140am for coffee at a random mcdonald's. when i ask if she's a 45 year old man trying to harvest my organs, she proceeds to send me 15 pictures in a row that look like they're straight from facebook. because that's how you convince somebody you're real (not true). now normally i don't accept propositions like this because i'm thinking "what's the catch?" well, i decide to live a little on the yolo side...and since it's right next to a subway sandwich shop i think that the worst that could happen is it's a 45 year old lonely man, i give him a big hug because i know the feeling as a 25 year old lonely man, get a tasty sandwich, then go home. apparently that was not the worst thing that could happen. i show up. she shows up. she's real. i'm surprised. i buy her coffee because i subscribe to traditional gender roles unless requested otherwise. she uses her mccafe frequent buyers card so she gets stamps. its cute. while the guy is making her drink, she tells me to go find a table outside in the sun. i go outside and find the perfect goddamn table because i'm a romantic at heart. 5 minutes later. 10 minutes later. 15 minutes later. no girl. i text her the typical guy message "lol u get lost???". no response. turns out she took the coffee and left. so i'm not saying it's bad to leave a date if you feel uncomfortable or aren't attracted to them. it's totally your decision. but i don't think that's the case...i think this girl is a serial mccafe dater. and i don't think this was her first time. it was too professional. too clean. it was the perfect mcheist. and i'm starting to think i'm not even mad...she didn't steal my credit card, or my organs. just a few euros. and my heart. ([for those who can't read good]( /u/cyaeldobson)so this morning i was having my usual shower to begin my day. feeling a bit randy i started masturbating. as i was about to climax, i lent too hard against the glass shower door. door comes off its hinges and the door and i fall out of the shower, i on top of the glass which smashes everywhere. my mom hearing the crashing noise (and i hate how fast her response time was) runs into the bathroom just in time to witness a bathroom full of broken glass and water, me lying naked on the bathroom floor with a cut up back from all the glass, and with an erection still ejaculating over myself. smh.i currently work in a it-consultant firm where we use skype as our main form of communication. today i took my laptop to work, since i wanted to watch some netflix during my break. instead of using my work computer i used my personal. so after my break, i sit down to do some more work, when my manager asks if i can participate in conference call with my boss and some of the upper management, i tell him that i'm on my personal computer, but can add me by using my name as username. so a couple of minutes after i get the invite and i accept. so far everything is fine, when suddenly one of the guys from upper management (not the one who invited to the call), says "who the fuck is titler?". that's when it hit me, i really fucked up. i forgot that i have that silly displayname and a pretty fucked up [picture]( to accompany it (nsfw). so now my boss is kinda pissed, and hr possibly wants to talk with me soonish. tl;dr: my boss doesn't like tits with mustaches. edit: update posted [here!]( edit 2: tifu of the week! thanks for the support and the nazi jokes.so i moved from north dakota to virginia. i have been applying to jobs for months. i havnt got a single call. well, i dont know if anyone actually did call me, but this entire time i was using the phone number that ive always had in north dakota. it turns out when i reactivated my phone in virginia they gave me a new phone number. ive been applying to every single job with the phone number i no longer have.so i just found out that i did this last night. to give a little context, i'm a gay guy who lives with two girls and two other guys. a couple months ago it was one of my roommate's birthday, let's call her jan. now me and my other roommate who we'll call mike thought it would be hilarious if we got jan a dildo for her birthday. now that may seem a little weird, but it's part of a long running joke between us because jan has been single for so long. so we got her the dildo. her birthday came along and we all had a good laugh about it. now the thing about the dildo is that jan didn't want to keep it in her room because mike and i would mess with her and make jokes that she was using it. no one else in the house wanted to keep it in their room either so eventually it ended up sitting in a drawer of a lamp stand in our living room. fast forward a few weeks. the dildo is still just sitting in the drawer. now being a 22 year old single guy, i'm very horny. but i wasn't just in the mood for some porn, i was in the mood for some butt fun. that's when i remember the dildo. so i grab the dildo, get in the shower and do my business. i make sure to thoroughly clean it, dry it, and then put it back in the drawer. over the next few weeks i do this several more times. now fast forward to last night. we have a few friends are over and we're all drinking, having a good time before finals start next week. one of the friends we have over, not one of out roommates, asks "hey, do you guys still have that dildo you got for jan?" all of us start laughing as we go over to the drawer and pull out it out. we're all still laughing and joking when someone asked jan if she ever ended up actually using it. she didn't respond but she immediately got that look on her face that made it clear to every one that she had. the story doesn't end here though. jan, thoroughly embarrassed, decides to call out our other roommate, alex. jan looks at alex and yells "well i know for a fact you used it too! a few weeks ago when you and your boyfriend came back from that party. i was still awake in my room when i heard you two come in and start fooling around in your room. then i heard footsteps and a drawer open and close. once you were both back in your room i went out and checked and the dildo was gone." at this point everyone is laughing hysterically except for me. i had just used the dildo again a few days beforehand and now i'm trying to come to terms with the fact that that dildo has been inside half of our household and i was the one to most recently use it. tl;dr some roommates and i got another roommate a dildo as a gag gift. it sat in a drawer seemingly unused but it turns out everyone was using it. edit: wow so this got a bit more popular than i expected it too and i guess i should clarify a few things. first, it does seem apparent that i am responsible for jan getting a uti after she used the dildo right after i used it. it wasn't very serious and she's totally fine now. next, people are acting like i did this on purpose as part of some fucked up plan to get everyone in my house to share a dildo. we got a gag gift, and then is sat around seemingly unused for months. i was completely unaware that anyone else was using it. that's kind of where the fuck up comes in. i would also like to point out that we have all been very close friends since our freshman year of college. the joking around and teasing were all in good fun. we mess with her, she messes with us. that's kind of how our household dynamic works. edit2: jesus fucking christ, none of us have stds! we aren't just going around sleeping with random people that's kind of why we were all using the dildo in the first place. can stds really even be transmitted that way via dildo if its washed and then sits around for a while? edit3: well as some of you predicted, through the power of the internet this story made its way back to my roommates and now they know everything. jan is understandably a little pissed off. everyone else thinks the whole situation is fucking hilarious. finally, yes, dildos and sex toys galore are definitely on the the christmas list this year. also added a tl;dr edit4: there have been multiple requests for pictures and descriptions of the dildo. unfortunately i wont be able to post a picture at the moment because it is my finals week and i'll be in the library studying until very late tonight. however, here is the link to the one we bought. it's a pretty nondescript and boring dildo so i didn't feel the need to go into detail about it in the post. first off this happened yesterday but i was a bit injured so i couldn't write this. anyways let's just get right to it. so every morning as i get ready for school i shower because personal hygiene is a good thing. this particular morning i was a bit sluggish so i was getting clumsy. i went to take my underwear off and the big toe on my right foot got caught in my underwear and i fell over head first into the door. the next thing i know i am butt ass naked laying in my bathroom with my mom on the phone with 911. she is freaking the fuck out and i quote, "he is naked on the ground unconscious! i dont know what happened just please come!" so the ambulance comes and wind up going to the emergency room in just my underwear. now i am being tested for a concussion. tl;dr: my underwear tried to kill me. edit: holy shit just got back from going out and this blew up. also there was no injury i was just a bit banged up. edit 2: for clarification, i was not going to school but showering to keep clean. sorry for confusion. i know yesterday was saturday, i forgot since my head is jumbled up. when there's a long line of customers and it's busy you look but don't really take in faces as such. so when the group of 6 came in i handed out 5 adult menus, and a child's menu and a pack of crayons to the little one, and everything was great. until the little one was quite clearly a 45 year old lady who was not looking impressed, and neither is the partner. the family on the whole was looking not impressed. i of course wanted to roll up into a little ball and die there on the spot, immediately, and thank fuck i didn't bring up the high chair edit: thanks for the gold! so pretty much every post i submit here is related to my vagina . . . we fuck up a lot. my family owns a property in the city, and i texted them all stating that i would be spending 2 days there alone just to relax, do some reading, walk around, etc. the detachable shower head at home has been broken for a few months, so when i realized that the apartment had one i wept with joy. my dad works in the city, and has a key to the apartment . . . i figured that since i told them all i was having a mini-getaway, no one would come bother me. wrong. i'm in the shower blasting ole reliable at the goods, while letting out mini moans. i orgasm as i moan deeper. i wash up, grab a towel (thank god) only to leave the bathroom to find my dad sitting on the couch with lunch for us as a surprise. i have a mild heart attack as my face burns red. he said nothing, but his face said it all. there is no way he didn't hear me. damn you, dad, why do you have to be so goddamn considerate?! so i am a type 1 diabetic. i take insulin before eating meals since it take 15 minutes to start working. earlier i took insulin and placed some leftovers in the microwave for 2 minutes. i then proceeded to start a game of league thinking i could eat while i played. 30 minutes into the game i start feeling light headed. but since we were about to win, i ignored the feeling and kept playing. as the game was coming to a close i could barely keep my eyes open, which is when it dawns on me that i am about to pass out due to low blood sugar. with no one else home and too tired to walk i got on my hands and knees and started to crawl towards the kitchen. i get to the kitchen and since i don't have enough energy to reach the microwave i open the fridge and on bottom shelf grab an old container of orange juice. despite the orange juice being old i started chugging until my sugar level came up enough for me to stand again. i almost died, but at least my team won?i share a bedroom with my sister, so i almost never get any time to myself for issues that require a bit of privacy. usually, i do my business in the bathroom and before doing so i announce that i'm going to go 'drop bombs' (yes i say drop bombs when i need to poop). this time, however, was a little different. i was watching a porno on my phone and got that feeling. encapsulated by what i saw, i wasn't thinking straight. carelessly, i said out loud "i'm going to go fap" instead of "i'm going to go drop bombs". realizing, through the look of "what the fuck" i recieved, i became mortified and instantly went into a coughing spasm and kept saying my stomach hurts while running to the toilet (i didn't know what else to do). that's my tifu story reddit, go easy on me.
