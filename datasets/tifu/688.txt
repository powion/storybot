This morning I get up for work, jump in the car and start the ignition. My engine immediately starts caterwauling. 

Do you remember the messages in your facebook feed about how cats take a nap in your engine block to hide from the cold, or even heat? I found out the hard way they're true. 

A little black cat (less than a year old) jumped out from under my car. She had a loosely dangling rear leg and several skin injuries. Needless to say, the poor thing was scared out of her wits, not to mention in terrible pain. 

Thankfully, an old lady in the street saw me comforting that cat while I was trying to reach several vets (none of whom were in office at that time). She pointed me to where the owners lived. 

So I rang them out of bed, and passed on a couple of the phone numbers I dialed. I'll go check in a few days to see if she's doing fine. 

Accidents like this may be unavoidable, but I still felt guilt and responsibility. 

**tl;dr:** Tap your hood. Cats can get hurt if you don't.

**Update:** Kitty cat didn't make it. :( 

I went by that house again last night to see what was up, but there was no good news to be told. Apparently she had gotten a belly wound too. It wasn't immediately visible because it had been immediately scorched shut (and she had black fur too).

Damn shame.
