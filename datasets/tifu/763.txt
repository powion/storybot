So here is the [story](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3decx0/tifu_by_watching_a_guy_cheat_on_his_wife/) in question.



This morning I saw Jill for he first time since pancake gate. She came in a little earlier than usual and as guessed, by herself. Luckily there wasn't anyone else in line so we had a few minutes to chat.


As soon as she walked up she started crying. So I of course walked from behind the counter and gave her a hug. Crying women at my counter happens more frequently than you would expect. 7 times now to be exact. Anyway, after the hug and me telling her that I'm sorry about everything she tells me the basics and we decide to have lunch together so we can talk some more.



During lunch I find out what really happened. Turns out that Jill has had one other person tell her that Frank was cheating. She didn't belive that person fully but was of course on guard. Jill went to Frank's office early that day to try to rekindle the marriage if that was the issue. Lunch, conversation and all that without the kids around to sidetrack them. 


Here are some talking points.

* Jill apologized for yelling at me. She said her emotions were all jacked up which I of course told her that it wasn't a big deal.


* Jill already filed for divorce and kicked frank out of the house.

* Before filing, Jill went out and bought a new car with Frank's money. Apparently the joint account money was mostly his as she paid the majority of the bills. His money was mainly savings and spending money.


* I asked about the anal sex thing. She got super red in the face and said that she would never do it even though he asked constantly. Her reasoning was that "sex is supposed to be pleasurable, not painful."  I left it there as my views on sex differ. That and it's kind of a sore subject.


* Apparently Frank wants to already move out of the city and start his own practice. 


* Jill wants the kids and frank isn't going to fight her on it.



So all in all it sounds pretty amicable besides the super public blow out. I wished her good luck and she said she will still be getting coffee with me every morning.



As I'm sure people will ask, yes she is now single. Yes she is attractive for a late 30's woman, and she will NOT take it in the ass. 


No clue if the TWIT is single.


TL;DR  Jill is now single and happy but still won't do anal. (Edit) /s

Edit:  Under no circumstances should you ever perform any sexual act under duress. If you do not want to do something, tell your partner plainly and clearly.  If they insist, then leave their asses.  Communication is key y'all!
