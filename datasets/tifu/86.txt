I walk into starbucks and take my place at the end of a rather long line. I notice in front of me a group of about 10 adult men who have Down Syndrome who are on a "field trip" and being chaperoned by an older woman. The woman turns to me and says "we are going to be a while, why don't you go in front of our group." She then loudly announces to her entire group that I will be skipping ahead in line and that it's ok. I thank her and begin to walk up the side of the line, looking at each man in line as I pass to ascertain whether he has down syndrome, and continue forward to find where their group ends and my new place in line is. I lock eyes with the frontmost man who has Down Syndrome, and slide into line in front of him. A few moments later I get a tap on the shoulder, and the man I had moments ago locked eyes with begins to explain in a broken, defeated voice that he's not with that group. I respond "oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were..." and my voice trails off as I realize that I had mistaken this rather unattractive man as having down syndrome and pretty much everyone in starbucks saw it go down. He stood there uncomfortably shifting on his feet for a moment and then B-lined it for the door, didn't even get his coffee. So awkward. I can't even imagine the damage I did to his self esteem.

I am very happy to announce that all feelings of shame I've been harboring today after this incident have been completely erased by /u/Fameless kind contribution of reddit gold. If it is ever possible to monetize this reddit gold I have every intention of donating said monies to some retarded charity.  

Edit 3:
I originally expressed it as "being Down syndrome". Lots of people pointed out I should say "a person who has Down syndrome". So I fixed that.
