I'm looking after my sister's house for a few days while she's away. Been here a couple of days and I'm settled in. It's nice and sunny outside, so I decide take the dog on a bit of a hike. It was lovely. Sun beating down, bluebells in the woods, tweeting birds - it was a proper walk in the countryside. Happy days.

Got home and I'm a bit sweaty (balls are sticking to my leg) so obviously I need to jump in the shower. "Ahh, a nice relaxing shower" I think to myself as I soap up and feel the hot blast of water cascading over my shoulders. Bliss.
Then I hear the dog going crazy downstairs, barking and jumping around. So I jump out of the shower and open the window to see what he's barking at. Shit, it's a courier! I completely forgot my sister told me she had some parcels coming. I quickly wrap a towel around my waist, run downstairs and head for the door.

The delivery guy spots me through the glass and waits as I calm the dog down and tell him to sit. Good dog. I open the door a crack and the dog gets a bit twitchy. "Stay!" I tell him, and he settles. Good boy. Your training is going well. You deserve a biscuit. I open the door to deal with the delivery.
The guy hands me a parcel, taps his touchpad a couple of times and gives it to me to sign. I stuff the parcel under one arm, take the touchpad and look for where I need to sign.

Then I hear a woman talking. Then a little girl. It's the neighbour from a couple of doors down, pushing her baby's buggy up the street and talking to her (I'm guessing) 5 year-old daughter, who occasionally plays in the garden with the pup.
The dog hears his little friend and makes a bolt for the door. But I'm too quick for him. I put my leg out to block his way. Little shit dips his shoulders and rushes between my legs, catching my towel over his head and ripping it away from my waist!

So I'm standing there, bollock naked, touchpad in one hand, parcel under one arm, my junk basking in the summer sun, shouting for the dog to stop while my brain is trying to work out what the fuck is going on! Too many things happening at once! Confusion intensifies!

Delivery bloke bursts out laughing, neighbour's eyes lock onto my man parts, jaw drops and she scrambles to cover her little girl's eyes, who's standing there staring at my sausage with a look of utter confusion/horror on her face.
I quickly drop the touchpad over the offending appendage, shuffle backwards into the house, pull the door to and gather myself as best I can. Delivery guy (who's now in tears) hands me the towel through the crack in the door and I cover myself. I sign with a X, shout the bloody dog back inside, look up and lock eyes with the neighbour again as I shamefully slink back into the living room. Then I sit holding my head in my hands for about 20 minutes.

But here's the kicker. I opened the parcel to check everything is ok with [the order](http://i.imgur.com/JsCCQWPh.jpg)

Arse!


TL;DR I answered the door in a towel and now I'm probably a sex offender. Plus irony is a bitch.
