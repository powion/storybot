I'll make this short and to the point:

-Wife gave me a gaming chair with speakers on the headrest and bluetooth capabilities

-I invited family over to finish christmas leftovers

-Was showing off my new gaming chair by playing music off my phone

-Day goes by

-Some last minute christmas gifts are exchanged

-I put on a family friendly movie for the kids and parents to watch and tell my wife I'm gonna take a quick shower

-...

-...

-...

-My natural urges take over and I decide to "relieve some stress" so I throw on one of my favorite compilation videos (to make it quick). I had the water running and I couldn't hear the porn, I figured it was shitty sound quality of the video so I turned it up to full volume... Nothing. So whatever I release the dragon and continue my shower and decide to put some tunes on (just found this awesome band called "Rings of Saturn").  Now I know something is wrong because the music is fairly loud... That's when it hit me like a runaway train... I'M STILL CONNECTED TO THE CHAIR!!! I went to the settings, please have bluetooth off, ON!!! AND C-O-N-N-E-C-T-E-D!!!

-I begged for the sweet release of death to take me... oh but he never answered... I felt heavy pressure on my chest and stayed in the shower for much longer than I needed to... Eventually I said "Fuck it" just go out as if nothing happened "they don't know that you know that they just heard you're spanking the monkey" and that's exactly what I did...
