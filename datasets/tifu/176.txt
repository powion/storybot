(This happened a few months back. AFMBIFU.)

So, I am addicted to Candy Crush on my iPhone but refuse to pay for any extra lives or power ups or whatever. This means when you've played 5 turns, you have to wait a few hours until they refill and you can play again. 

I was doing this like a chump for several years: play 5 turns, wait a few hours, play 5 turns, wait a few hours, etc. Then I heard about a workaround where you can reset your phone clock forward an hour and Candy Crush thinks it's time to give you another life. Woohoo! Free lives. I did this a few times in the evening.

This was fine until my phone alarm alarm went off in the morning at 6am, my usual time to get up and start getting my 8 year old son ready for school. I go shake him awake. He's strangely difficult to wake up this morning. I shake him harder. Finally he half opens his eyes and says 'is it morning already?' He drags himself out of bed and zombie-walks to the living room where I put some cereal in front of him and he turns on a Netflix cartoon.

He is still half asleep trying to eat his cereal, and I think, "maybe he's getting sick, he shouldn't be this tired." Then I open up my computer to read with a morning coffee, and I glance at the computer clock. 3:15am. It took a moment to figure out that my '6:00' alarm had gone off at 3:00 thanks to my Candy Crush phone-time clock cheating. 

I sent my poor kid back to bed for a few more hours of sleep. I was already awake by then though, so I just kept on reading reddit.
