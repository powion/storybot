The FU happened a few hours ago, but the motion has been set couple days ago…  
&amp;nbsp;  

It was a beautiful weekend, the weather was sunny but breezy and I spent it with the pretty lady that I've been dating for the last six months. Moonlight shines in and it was sexy times. Grabbed two condoms and used one first night. Second night rolls around and we talked about how we're both tested clean so... You get the idea.
Now this was a rental place so naturally when we leave we clean the place. I cleaned the kitchen and she cleaned the bedroom. Proud of our cleanliness we left with smiles on our faces.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Fast forward to earlier today, 9am. Time for a meeting with my staff. Everyone gets settled in and I start the agenda. About 5 minutes in I needed my laptop to show performance stats, and without my knowledge my pretty lady had bequeathed me with the unused condom that is wedged between my iPad and laptop. With one swift move, I pulled my laptop out of my backpack and the surprise condom came flying out, landed right smack in the middle of the conference room table.  
&amp;nbsp;  

My jaw drops half way, my mind is blank, and I blinked in slow motion.  
Silence ensues. Then bursts of laughter while my face turned into boiled lobster color.  
One of my minion said "Boss, you had a good weekend?”  
The other minion quickly added "maybe he didn't have a good weekend... cuz…"  
&amp;nbsp;  
Aaaaaaand the rest of the meeting was not productive.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Throwaway account... Cuz my minions are all redditors..  
&amp;nbsp;  

Edit - hope you, and my minions, all got a good laugh, I have an excellent team and specifically used the word minion because thats our office humor.  
Everyone on my team has a minion or two on their desk. So many happy meals were eaten that month..   
I have no doubt someone is going to be pranking me by hiding condoms in my office…  or my car.. or crap.. don't give them ideas..  
&amp;nbsp;  
TL;DR - Didn't use condom, end up using it in a group setting.
