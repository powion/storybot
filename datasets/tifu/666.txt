This just happened 2 minutes ago.

I was trying out anal for the first time on my own, on the basis that my straight male friend said it was amazing.  I had a dildo from a joke birthday gift, 8-inches jelly dong.

So I'm putting it in and I push it past the second sphincter which didn't really hurt much, and suddenly I lose grip on it.

I try to push and reach it to get it out but it's stuck past the sphincter.  At this point I start to panic, mostly because I'm leaving for an 8 hour flight in roughly 5 hours, and message my homosexual internet friend for advice, while making posts on two internet forums and /r/sexadvice .

He recommends me the squatty potty (google it) which after a minute of relaxing and then decently hard pushing, yields the 8-inch dildo.

So yeah, TLDR; Lost a dildo past second sphincter, gay friend gave shitting advice and I got it out.
