I share a bedroom with my sister, so I almost never get any time to myself for issues that require a bit of privacy. Usually, I do my business in the bathroom and before doing so I announce that I'm going to go 'drop bombs' (yes I say drop bombs when I need to poop). This time, however, was a little different. I was watching a porno on my phone and got that feeling. Encapsulated by what I saw, I wasn't thinking straight. Carelessly, I said out loud "I'm going to go fap" instead of "I'm going to go drop bombs". Realizing, through the look of "what the fuck" I recieved, I became mortified and instantly went into a coughing spasm and kept saying my stomach hurts while running to the toilet (I didn't know what else to do). That's my TIFU story Reddit, go easy on me.
