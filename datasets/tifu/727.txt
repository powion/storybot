So, I'm 16, living in New Zealand, ready to do my level 1 history exam. I'm not too great at it so I decide to study. I want to get a merit (&gt;80%), so I actually put a decent amount of time into it, at least 12 hours over the course of the week.

Finally, it's the day of the exam. Tension is high, I'm nervous, but I'm prepared. Miss Long - 50 something year old Asian woman who aged worse than John Travolta, kinda looks like a Japanese Calypso - starts calling the student codes. For some reason, I don't hear my code get called, so I quickly ask the teacher if they accidentally missed me out. Somehow, my code wasn't on the sheet, so I run to the office (at this point, the exam has 12-15 minutes until it begins) to see if anyone there knows what happened. Rochelle - office lady, weird obsession with orange objects - tells me that they don't have any record of me being enrolled in Level 1 history. 

That's when it hits me.

I didn't take history this year, I took it last year. I have an accounting exam. In a different building. Which I haven't studied for. Throughout the entire accounting exam I'm wondering whether I have early onset dementia or have a second personality that's a history buff.

TL;DR - I studied for an exam in a subject that I didn't take this year, and probably failed my accounting exam because of it.
