So I'm an easy going gal. I let guests and their partners stay at my house as they wish. I let them utilize the house however they may... but that stops today. 

I let two stay over and they arrived when I was at work. When I came home they were in my room and I kindly escorted them to the guest room. I rarely ever saw the two, they'd typically be in the room or scavenging for food. What I wasn't really expecting was for them to partake in some shower sexy time. 

I've been going to the gym 5 days a week so I use their showers. Weekends are cardio days so I run to work and shower there. My guests left after a week and I decided to take a day off from the gym to clean the house. And then came the  glorious moment of showering in my own shower. The steamy water, massaging jets, aromatic soap.... and my loofah. It has been at my house waiting for weeks for me to suds it up. 

Without hesitation I load it up with soap and lather away. It takes me moments to realize something isn't right. Babies. Little baby spiderlings all over my torso, upper body, and right arm. Drowning... hopeless, disgusting, 8 legged freaks. Mashed up, mangled and dispersed on my skin. Why I ever let the angsty, scandalous spiders stay in my house is beyond me now. Fuck yo reproduction system, fuck yo choice of nesting and apparently fuck my hospitality.

Tl;dr: don't actually have friends. Spiders were the guest. Let spider guests stay in my home, loaded egg in fluffy loofah, ended up with spider babies on me.
