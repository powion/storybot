Pretty much I thought that school started the day after Labor Day, like it normally does. Decided to check my school email today and found that IT had already posted its Lab Tech schedule (i.e. one of the work study program that I've worked for the past two years) as well as a couple of other emails from my professors about class stuff.

Didn't have the time to check the calendar though, because my dad needed me to help him with some house renovation stuff then went straight off to work. Come home from work and check the calendar on the website:

&gt; Fall Semester Begins: Sep 1

Mom's pissed, I feel the magnetic pull of my face to the nearest flat object, and I've probably got a mountain of things to catch up on before work at 4PM tomorrow. FML.

SITUATION UPDATE: just checked in. Went fairly smooth. Doesn't make up for the fact that I missed at least two days' worth of teaching, but at least I didn't get dropped altogether. Thanks for the kind words from some of you guys. Note to self, though: *never* post on a large sub again. Inbox freaking exploded on me &lt;.&lt;
