Last night, we were in bed and my girlfriend was scratching her eye viciously, complaining that she suffers from Chronic Dry Eye and not from Leaving Contacts in for Too Long. As we're in the spooning position, she finally sighs and asks me to "Make her cry" so her eye gets some moisture. I quickly think of how to do that on short notice. 

Should I tickle her relentlessly? 

Do I need to Ray Rice her? 

And then a lightbulb goes off in my brain. I lean close to her ear and whisper to my girlfriend of over three years: "I've never really loved you."

Needless to say, tears were had. I'm not a smart man.

Edit: wow, my inbox. So a lot asked what happened afterwards. She was caught off guard because I said it so sternly like I meant it. I did not. I reaffirmed my love and did not have to sleep on the couch!
