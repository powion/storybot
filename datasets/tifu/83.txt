So, today I fucked up by taking my wife to see Ant Man. Yeah .. see we're newly married but have been together several years. We're moving house and I'm under a lot of stress with new city new job and I was getting cabin fever and just had to get out of the house. I chimed to my wife that we should go see a movie! There's a new Marvel one that I want to see. And she happily agreed.

I bought tickets and we went in. She was clutching my arm rather tightly and she cuddled in close when the title came up but I thought nothing of it. We're very close and it's not uncommon. You see at this point I hadn't even thought about it ...

My wife suffers Myrmecophobia. Or a fear of ANTS.

Yeah .. she had seen my stress levels and put aside her darkest fear to accompany me to a movie willingly that portrays her worst fear in detail.

As a side note she thoroughly enjoyed it; and buried her face in my arm any time she started to feel uncomfortable. So as a homage to her I felt I should share this story on Reddit. I could ask for no better life partner.

TLDR: I took my wife to see the Ant Man movie. Totally forgot she has a morbid fear of ANTS.


**Edit:** I woke up this morning with front page of reddit ..  Thank you all for your kind words and great comments. My wife read through this whole thread and had one hell of a laugh (and got itchy at the mention of 3D .. thanks guys .. TIFU by letting my wife read the comments on the thread I made for her) 

To those asking 'Was it a good movie?' I would have to say yes; if you enjoyed the Avengers (2) and/or the Iron Man series it's in that same sort of comedy style. Very entertaining.
