So I had a surgery Monday afternoon. Bunions are genetic in my family, and for some reason, mine are particularly bad for a 23 year old. I elected to get the surgery now, while under my mother's insurance and to prevent it from getting worse. Also, this way my mom can take a few days off work to stay with me if I need anything.

Long story short, they had to break 2 of my bones, then realign them, add some screws and pins, file down the side of my foot, then put the bones back into the sockets. I have 12 stitches and am on heavy narcotic drugs for pain. 

Well, I have a super high sex drive. I flicked the bean before surgery Monday, but it's been 4 days. So I was horny and put on some porn. So I'm going at it and getting really into it. A few attempts at finishing pass because of mild pain in my foot. I decide to play through the pain.

Bad.

So I'm finally about to come, and I get ready, straighten my legs. And I curl my toes as I climax, as I always do.

I curl my fucking toes. 

There's a loud **CRACK** then my earsplitting scream of pure fucking agony. Then I have about three seconds to think *Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, what did I do* before my mom comes barreling through my door. 

There I am, covered in sweat, vibrator in hand, porn still on my TV, and my mom staring at me in shock. She stammered "Are you... uh, oh. Um. Are you o-okay? Uh..." She keeps glancing from me to the TV. I'm yelling at her that I'm fine, just go, I'm fine, **GO.** But she's in shock I think because she's still just glancing wide eyed from (half naked) me, to my TV, back to me, then my foot. 

So I throw something at her to wake her out of her confused daze to make her go. The only thing I had within reach. My vibrator. 

I threw my vibrator at my mother. 

She backed out of my room slowly. We haven't spoken since.

EDIT: Best proof I've got: http://imgur.com/a/Bqc5M

I have 12 stitches and I'm NOT ALLOWED to remove the bandage, so that's literally the best I can do. Want more proof? Go fuck yourself. Also thanks for the gold, strangers.
