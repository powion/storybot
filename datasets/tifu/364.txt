Okay, so maybe that's a no-brainer.
But this is how it went down:

My coworker and I were making small talk with a customer's 5 year old during checkout and he asked how old my coworker was.
She told him to guess and he guessed 20. She is 19 so she said, "Wow! Very close! I'm 19."

Now, I'm 20 and this kid is a good guesser so I'm going to give him a shot at my age.
That's where I fucked up.

"Okay now guess me!"
"Ummmm.... 37!"
Me, taken aback, I scoff.
"Well, no. I'm 20, but I've always been told I seem a little bit older."

"Oh. Probably because you're fat."


Edit:
Hi, OP here. I didn't expect you all to find my story so amusing, and I certainly didn't expect all the responses you've posted for me. Thank you for sharing your funny stories and words of encouragement. These responses made me feel better than some. (You know who you are.)

Let me address a few of your comments.

This story took place at a previous job about 6 months ago. I've come to terms with the fact that the little guy didn't mean to upset me, but I still think of this every now and then and it hurts.

**Yes, I'm fat.** I've been overweight for as long as I can remember. I struggle with chronic depression and anxiety, and while this is not a good excuse for my laziness and gluttony, I do believe it carries some *weight.* Those of you that understand mental illnesses may be familiar. I am receiving treatment and I'm working on bettering my mind and body, but it has been an uphill battle.
