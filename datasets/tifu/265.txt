My Dad is a professor at a university and not originally from the USA which means he's twice over not hip with lingo. Therefore he learns all his hip lingo from my two brothers and me! 

So being great sons we decide to mess with him and tell him 'Touching Tips' is the new way of saying connecting on LinkedIn. You know, "let's touch tips" = "connect with me" "Have we touched tips?" = "Have we connected on LinkedIn?" etc etc. 

Fast forward to yesterday when he's meeting a younger guy to work in his lab... I get an angry call from him later saying that he ended the interview with something like "All sounds good, have we touched tips?"
