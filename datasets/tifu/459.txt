Long time lurker on the is sub (although just changed account). 
I am writing this to say that I am fed up with the overly sexualised "fuck ups" which have unnecessary detail which IMO is just there to generate up votes, and leaves other more interesting fuck ups off the front. 
I know that stuff like this has been posted before and I know that of course some detail is needed but shit like this:
 
&gt;"I just got in this mood to give him exclusive ball action with my tongue and hands. I first started by just licking, slurrped up and, placed each ball inside my mouth and went to town by sucking and licking them. I then laid beside him showing how much I loved him by sucking and licking his neck... my fingertips tracing the outlines of his skin, I began to just rub his balls in such a fluid motion. He pulled me on top of him, I turned around so he could get a eyeful of my ass I leaned in bypassing his hard cock and began licking his nuts again."

Just sounds like 50 shades of grey.
I don't think that this adds to the story and (mostly?) Isn't needed.

Sorry for the rant, obviously other people don't feel this way but I think that this sub has lost it's roots.
