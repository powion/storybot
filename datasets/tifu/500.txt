During our fortnightly meeting, an upcoming maternity leave was announced. 

We segued onto the topic of waters breaking. Another colleague explained that when she used to work as a bartender, a lady's waters broke.
Fortunately this had occurred in the beer garden (outside area of the hotel/pub). We asked how she cleaned it up,  she said it was just left as is, due to the fact it occurred outside on a patio area. Hosing the area down was suggested, but she shook her head and said it was fine to leave it alone.

At this point I stupidly said "And that's how you get ants".
No one watches Archer except me, my colleagues all think I was being gross/disgusting.

TLDR: quoted Archer when discussing waters breaking. Except no one realised I was quoting, they think I crossed the line.
