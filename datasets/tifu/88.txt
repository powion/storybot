So as I go to warm up my car this morning my neighbor comes out and asks if I have moment. We're cool with each other so I figure no big deal. Well, he proceeds to inform me that while he's happy that my husband and I have a great sex life that he would greatly appreciate if we kept it down in the early evening hours since he had to explain the birds and bees to his 8yo last night.

At this point, I'm confused. We didn't have sex last night. What is he talking about? Then it dawns on me... What they actually heard was us playing Mario kart. They heard me screaming "fuck me" repeatedly while getting hit with a blue shell just before the finish line along with some other colorful language.

TL;DR My neighbor thinks we have a great sex life; I just have a dirty whore mouth while playing Mario kart.

Update: I let my husband know what's up and he just about died of laughter. He is working second shift, so I went over myself to clear the air. Explained what happened to my neighbor, he got embarassed, laughed, and said he wished he had thought of that in the moment. Then he and his daughter could have talked about good sportsmanship instead. His wife is apparently still upset. I've apologized and promised to keep it a bit more PG before bedtime.

Thanks for the gold kind stranger!

Edit: My name isn't Jenny, my number isn't 867-5309, and I have no need for a Zach or Mr. X. I am quite happily married to an awesome man.
