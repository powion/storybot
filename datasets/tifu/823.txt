Ok this happened yesterday but didn't think of posting about it here till this morning...

I had a long day at work yesterday and when I got home all I wanted to do was relax so I got a drink and took a nice hot bath. I had my phone with me texting and browsing facebook. I decided to update my status and took a pic of my legs in the bath and posted how nice it was to be home in the bath. One of my friends messages me and said did you know you can see for vag in that pic? So I went and looked and even though I didn't see it on my phone when I took it I had not been low enough and at the bottom of the screen you could clearly see my freshly shaved vagina. I took the pic down but it was up for awhile..so friends family coworkers all had the chance to see it. I don't know who saw it and who didn't before I took it down. 


Update: So yesterday morning I get called into my supervisors office and he is there with HR and they ask me to sit down to discuss something. Basically they said I could do whatever I want in my personal life but I need to keep the company's best interest in mind. In paticular postings in facebook that could reflect poorly in the employees and the company. I was asked to please keep this in mind and I had to sign a form that I understood and that they were not saying what I could post but that I needed to represent the company positively. They never said anything about the photo but obviously that had to be it, I was balling by the time I left and I avoided my supervisor the rest of the day, today I called in sick. I don't want to face anyone.
