*Originally I posted this on Tuesday but those darn mods wouldn't let me. It's fine now.*

Okay, so like I said I went into school today and at lunch went to the library. She wasn't there this time around, so I went to the cafeteria.

Now, I had gotten strange looks and some laughs earlier in the day, so I knew she had spread the word with my mastery to masturbate. 

When I went into the cafeteria, I saw her with her friends, so I decided to sit alone at the table across from her. I had no lunch as usual, so I simply stared at her for, say, thirty seconds before realizing I was being cringy so I went up and sat as close to her as possible.

Immediately, her friends either giggled or called me nasty and told me to sit away from them, so I acted. I read every single comment, and I chose was I thought would be the most flattering and best plan by combining a couple of suggestions.

In front of all her friends, I said something like this:

"GF, I'm sincerely sorry for disgusting you. However, I want you to know that the very reason I chose to jack off to you was because I cared about you."

I obviously wasn't that eloquent, but she was blushing, so I thought I was doing well.

"Over all the naked women on the Internet, I chose your body to lust to. I had hoped you'd think it's flattering."

I was wrong about how I was doing.

"Don't talk to me anymore", said GF.

I was desperate, so I used what I learned from NoFap.

"GF, I haven't jacked off to you in nearly a month. Please, I do not jack off anymore. Not in 25 days." She ignored me.

I left, in defeat and shame. 

We're officially broken up and I'm now known as the fapmaster around school.

*Edit* I'm Fapmaster Flash now. A lot of things happened since Tuesday. This isn't the right sub for the story, though.
