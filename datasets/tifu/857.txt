So this happened earlier today. Enter me, enter sexy blonde girl. After a night of heavy flirting, I finally convinced her to come back to my apartment. I put on some rock to get us both in the mood for some aggressive sex (she had let me know she was into it beforehand) and broke out the condoms. It was going great. Approximately 4 min after foreplay and getting it in,  my little soldier decided he wanted to get some fresh air. My brain didn't register the fact that I wasn't still inside her and decided to start going even harder than I was before. My johnson bent in half and popped. It sounded like the most satisfying knuckle pop. I looked down, and my Willie was black, blue, and bigger than my wrist. I cried and ran out if the room because of the pain. Apparently fractured penises exist. She left very soon after.

Tl;Dr: you can beat your meat, you can choke your chicken, but GOD FORBID you ever break your stake.

Edit 1: HOLY. This got big. Rip inbox!

Edit 2: Figures my gold cherry would be popped after I break my dick. Thanks kind Internet stranger!

Edit 3: sorry for no response for a while, I was in surgery. Apparently this happens more often than you would expect
