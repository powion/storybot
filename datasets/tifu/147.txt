I was walking towards my bank to deposit a cheque into my account when I saw what I thought was two very small children about to cross a carriageway. 

I should point out, I have to wear contact lenses but they are not vital, but to me, everything past around 10m just looks like a photoshopped blur, I can tell what's there but I can't make out distinct features.

I walked faster to attempt to see whether they were just being stupid or whether they were actually going to cross. One of them took a step into the road to get a better look around a bus that was stationary at the side of the road. This is when I thought to myself something really bad could happen. I started sprinting at them. They turned and looked at me and as my vision started to clear I had a surprise. Looking back at me was a dwarf woman and what looked to be her grandson. 

I didn't know what to do so I just carried on sprinting and hopped on the bus. I looked at the driver and engaged him in conversation whilst the woman continued to eye me suspiciously. I whispered faintly, "I'm just gonna confess I don't have any money, I just mistook that dwarf for a kid about to cross the road and it was just instinct"..
The bus driver started giggling to himself and said he'd drop me round the corner to spare everyone's embarrassment.

Apart from mine. Obviously. Good guy though. 

Edit: for all those criticising me about not wearing contacts, I know the limitations of my eyes very well thank you. This isn't an everyday occurrence, I wear them based on whether I'll actually need them. They cost money. I'm only slightly shortsighted, the fact I had to sprint to them should indicate I was at a distance that most people might have second guessed. 

Edit 2: thanks for the gold! Much appreciated!
