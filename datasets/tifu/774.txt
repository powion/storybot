This happened a while ago but I just found this sub.

I was home visiting my parents for the weekend. My parents went to bed early that night, but I decided to stay up for a bit longer to finish up some reports. At some point, I got thirsty and tiptoed downstairs to the kitchen to get some raspberry lemonade. 

Now, I prefer to work on my laptop in the dark. I don't know why, but it makes me feel more productive. Upon returning to my room, I took a couple drinks of the lemonade, set it on my nightstand, turned off the lights, and crawled into my old bed. 

The lemonade had only been sitting out for 10 or so minutes untouched when I took another drink of it and noticed it tasted kind of... grapey. Weird, did my parents switch brands? 

Thinking nothing of it, I returned to my work and repeated this a few times. Until I took a drink and felt a few very solid somethings go POP! in my mouth, followed by an explosion of very disgusting grape flavor. 

Something was moving in my mouth.

I turned the lights back on to witness DOZENS of sugar ants in and around my cup, all of them on a one way path to salvation via throwing themselves in and drowning in sugary lemonade nirvana.

I reacted appropriately and projectile vomited onto the floor and onto my bed, all the while screaming WHAT THE FUCK ANTS, WHAT THE FUCK ANTS, WHAT THE FUCK ANTS, WHAT THE FUCK ANTS.

This is why I don't visit my parents very often.

TL;DR: grape drink
