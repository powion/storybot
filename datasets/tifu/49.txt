My girlfriend has been on holidays for the last couple of weeks. It kinda sucked because it was our five month anniversary (which she took quite seriously). So we were texting and things started getting suggestive (or at least I think they were) and then she sends a message saying "hey babe skype me I have a surprise for you!" We have done skype sexy time before and that's where I thought this was leading. So I flopped it out and skyped her my erect penis taking up the entire screen. Then when she answered it was her entire family: mum, dad and two little sisters (7&amp;9) there yelling in unison "happy anniversary" I freaked out and slammed the laptop shut. I since have received two messages from my girlfriend (soon to be ex I imagine) saying "what the fuck was that?!!" And "ANSWER ME!!"

It is the a definite dumbest thing I've ever done. I kinda wanna die right now.

Edit: I know it's kinda weird that we celebrate each month but yeah I guess we're pretty young. Five months is pretty long for high school couples so yeah. 

I still haven't heard anything from her except another text just saying "?" I don't have the balls to reply.

UPDATE: So I decided to man up and text her back, it was the most awkward conversation ever! But it ended with her saying "maybe we should take a break when I get back" I should change the title to "TIFU by showing my erect penis to my ex-girlfriends entire family.
