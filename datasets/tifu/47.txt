This happened a couple weeks ago. I’m using a throwaway because I don’t want this shit tied to my main account. I’ll try to make this as short as possible. 

**Additional warning**: *I’m in my early twenties and not that experienced when it comes to sexy times. All the porn in the world couldn’t have prepared me for this.*

I was going out with a girl for about 6 months. It was nice. She was freaky. I liked it. She kept hinting towards butt stuff which I’ve never done. I was skeptical, but after talking to my friends about it, they encouraged me to give it a shot and to be "open minded."

We’re driving one day listening to music and some song comes on and one of the lyrics were “you gotta eat the booty like groceries.” I’ll never forget this fucking song. The GF knows the song and she’s singing the lyrics and she’s looking directly at me while singing that line. Subliminal message.

Fast forward a couple days and she’s over at my place taking a shower, getting ready for work. I join. Sexy time. “Be open minded” rang through my mind. So I decided to try something new. I tried to eat the booty. I even went as far as to stick my tongue in her butt. I heard a “oh” and then the worst shit **ever** happened. She farted. I jerk back. Mind you, we’re still in the shower so I’m thinking the water mixed with the fart and I have nasty fart water in my mouth. No.

I spit the water out and it’s not just water. She pooped in my mouth. It wasn’t a lot, but that’s no excuse.

She started apologizing, but her sorrow turned into straight laughter. She wouldn’t stop laughing. I was so angry I didn’t know what to do.

TL;DR: I tried to eat the booty like groceries. It didn’t work.
