I know this is not how these things normally work, but this literally happened 5 minutes ago.

I just woke up from a crazy dream (probably caused by my new anxiety medication). 

In my dream, I'm at a party trying to get some homework done like the usual college student. 

When my girlfriend nonchalantly tells me this guy from my Psychology class is trying to sexual assault her.

As you can imagine I am pissed. I find the asshat and he runs away. I decide to shower in the rain, then I confront him again. This time he tells me some details about the assault.

At this point I am done, dream me is jacked like Arnold and is going to tear this guy up. I throw my first punch, but barely grazed him (I miscalculated the dream physics). 

He goes to throw his punch. But before he even interprets what's happening I perfectly execute the most meanest elbow directly to his face I've ever seen.

I woke up to my girlfriend cussing me out like no tomorrow, and refusing to acknowledge that elbow was meant for her attacker. 

Now I am typing this out as she is sleeping in the other room.
