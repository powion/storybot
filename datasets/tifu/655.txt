My housemate and I have been friends for ~20 years, and constantly prank each other. 

Early this morning I quietly came home from my overnight shift and heard him in his bedroom. Knowing he was home without him knowing I was home was the perfect opportunity to do something funny. So I took my glasses off (that's important), pulled my shirt up over my head like a mask, and jumped into his open bedroom door with a running start. He was in his bed.

"TIME TO DIE BITCH!" I yelled.

No response.

I used my best 90's action movie villain voice. "What's wrong sweetheart?....cat got your tongue? Bwahaha!"

Still no response.

"How about a kiss for daddy?"

The toilet flushed in his bathroom behind me. If this was a movie, there would have been a dolly zoom on my face. I pulled my t-shirt down and put my glasses back on to find my housemate's girlfriend, who just spent her first night over, sitting on his bed with the blankets pulled up to her neck. She was absolutely terrified.

I slowly backed out while muttering incoherently, went into my bedroom, and laid down on the ground face first to hide my embarrassment from the world. I am truly a fuck up.


Edit: Never seen my housemate so gleeful. All he had to do was take a dump and I did all the work in making an ass out of myself infront of company. The g/f is fine and commented that my karate game was a bit weak (I threw a few shadow chops when I first ran in)

Edit: Yes, I realize he could have swiss-cheesed me with a shotgun....
