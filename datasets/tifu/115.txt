I have a similar story to a recent post here, but not quite as long as a 29 year one. Also this was not today. My name is Samuel, but until I was about 10 I didn't realise this. Everyone had called me Sam all my life and that's how I had learned to write my name. One day in primary school I was looking at the list of the class's names in the wall (to have stickers and stuff put next too if we had done well in something) and couldn't find my one. I did however see the name Samuel and started laughing as I had read it as if it was pronounced "Samool" and was looking around for the poor fucknuckle with that name. 

Tl;dr I didn't realise my name was Samuel instead of just Sam. Thought there was a kid in my class called Samool and felt bad for them.


Edit: man this blew up haha. My only proper post I've ever made and it hits front page! Also rip inbox :)
