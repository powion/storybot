So a bit of a backstory, I'm 29 and have had a slight case of Tourette's since I was about 14, nothing too serious, I can usually keep a lid on it but I slip up every now and then, mostly when I'm nervous or stressed. Anyway, my wife and I just finished moving across the country for her job and made a trip to Florida this year to see our parents for father's day. I'm currently still looking for a job and my wife's dad has never really cared much for me. So we arrive at her parents house for dinner and the topic of me being a house-husband comes up. Here's how the convo went.

Father in law: "So with all this time at home, you must be getting a lot of work done in the house, right?"

Me: "Well I'm not very good at carpentry, so we're hiring someone to do the bathroom and porch."

Father in law: "Well then, that must give you a lot of time to keep the cars in good shape and well kept, right?"

Me: "Honestly, I'm not great with cars either, so we just stick to mechanics for that stuff."

Father in law: "Well jeez, is there anything you do well?"

Me (thinking to myself): "Don't say 'fuck your daughter', don't say 'fuck your daughter...' "

Me: "Fuck your daughter." (Nnnnnnoooooooooo!!)

Her dad immediately got up and left the room without saying a word. I apologized later and he understood that I really couldn't help it. My wife thought it was the funniest moment of her life, possibly the most embarrassing for me. 

TL;DR: I told my father in law that the only thing I do well is fuck his daughter.
