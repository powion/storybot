Only my luck would let this happen a day before Mother's day.  

I was in Macy's shopping for a mother's day gift for my mom, and while I was in a text conversation with her regarding stuff she'd "always wanted" (yeah there are no surprise gifts in my family), my girlfriend Molly started sexting me.  It was really weird being in a serious conversation with my mom and at the same time responding to my very inconveniently timed horny girlfriend.  I responded to Molly a few times as I tried to gather myself and focus on choosing a gift for my mom.  

Unfortunately, both my mom and Molly were texting me at the same time.    I don't know how I lost focus of which text conversation I pressed on, but I was *sure* that I chose Molly's conversation.  I was wrong.  I sent that fateful text as I checked out at the register and was paying for my purchase.  

Immediately after I sent it, I saw that I had one unread message from Molly at 3:42 (it was 3:56 pm).  I yelled out a huge "OH SHIT!!!" right in the store.  The entire area by the checkout counters became dead silent for about four seconds.  Everyone just stared at me for those four fucking long seconds.  I immediately jolted out the store.

My mom is a REALLY religious Christian, and she doesn't even know I have a girlfriend (it's *very* frowned upon in my family unless it's for marriage), so it's not like she could even have guessed who that text was meant for.

It's been one hour.  I haven't heard back from my mom yet.  I am scared to go home.  FML.




**[UPDATE] 8:50 pm:** After wandering aimlessly FOR FOUR HOURS holding that 30+ lb set of kitchenware (my arms are freakin' killing me!!), my dad sends me a text "Come home please.  Your mother and I need to discuss college options with you."   'College options' my ass!!   That topic's never been brought up yet, *EVER*!  My bones are shaking from just the thought of the awkwardness that is about to ensue......   Goddammmitt....




**[UPDATE] 1:45 pm (Sunday):**  Okay, so I finally gathered the courage to go home after like 6 hours of freaking out.  I got home at around 11 or so last night and sitting right in the living room were both my parents and the priest from my church!!!  They started preaching to me and quoting passages from the bible.  OMG!!  My head was spinning.  It was PURE torture!!  Fucking nightmare.  They even said that "they reached a unanimous decision that I should see a psychologist. and that there is always hope for cases like mine".....  WHAT THE MOTHERFUCKING FUCK????????  I couldn't gather the strength to *even talk*, let alone execute any of the strategies described below.  Long story short I got grounded and my cellphone was confiscated "until further notice".  I wasn't even allowed to go to church with them today (*finally*), because "until I get my head straight, I should not be in a holy place of worship".... Currently my phone is taken away.  I have no idea where it is.  Maybe I'll go look for it.  My parents are at church anyways right now...  They won't be home for another 2 hours at least.


**[UPDATE] 3:13 pm:**  I went looking for my phone in my dad's closet while my parents are at church.  I found my phone in this box he apparently keeps random stuff in.  [YOU WILL NEVER BELIEVE WHAT ELSE I FOUND IN THERE!!](http://imgur.com/R0msJzA)  Okay, so that may not be so crazy to the rest of you, but to *my* family that is a HUGE no-no!!!  My parents are so unbelievably against birth control of any form, and consider others who use it to be sinners.  OMG OMG OMG!!!! The tables have turned like crazy right now.....  I'm wondering if I should use this leverage now, or wait until a different situation occurs (because this one is pretty much over)???  This is insane leverage I have on my parents!!
