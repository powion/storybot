My girlfriend's phone stopped working and the replacement turned out to be a piece of crap. Her brother offered to send his old phone as a replacement. We live away from home because of university. Delivering things to my parents' house feels safer. We already did that a few times. So we decided to let them know something was coming with the mail.  
  
I decided to give my mother a heads up with a text. So I texted: "Girlfriend is expecting a package." not thinking anything of it. My mother didn't respond and again I thought nothing of it. She does that often.  
  
However when I came home 2 weeks later I learned that she had been panicking the whole time. She thought I knocked up my girlfriend. She demandend an explanation. I gave one and laughing ensued.  
  
So as a bonus I learned that my mother thinks I'm capable of getting my girlfriend pregnant and announcing it through text with a shitty pun.

**TL;DR**: I texted my mother and she thought I knocked up my girlfriend. 

Edit: According to my girlfriend I'm wrong because it was 2 days and not 2 weeks.
