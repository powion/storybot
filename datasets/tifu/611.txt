I wake up, look around, and think "fuck yeah, labor day". It's maybe 8am. My gf had already left for work. 

Alarm goes off. Swipe. Bitch, it's labor day. 

Second alarm goes off. Swipe. Uhh, still labor day, shitty phone alarm. Gtfo

Third alarm goes off. Slept through it like a boss. No more alarms. 

Wake up at 1130. Check phone. 3 missed calls and 7 texts. Uhh. Reading a few... 

Then my shitty brain puts 1 and 0 together. DICKS. IT AM NOT BE LABOR DAY.

1230 now. Be rolling in to work. Will update.

UPDATE: Nobody even noticed. Winning.
