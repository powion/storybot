This happened Saturday night.  I was at a swanky bar and had been going at it hard for about the last 8 hours or so.  Don't judge!  My girl and I went downstairs to find the bathrooms, which were at the end of this long corridor.

SO, I go stumbling down the corridor, hang a right into what i thought was the mens room.  Down the hall, a guy is approaching me and we're doing that weird dance where you shuffle one way and the other person also shuffles that way, you go back and forth, etc.

As I get closer, I'm laughing with the guy cuz the dance is ridiculous, and I reach out to tap him on the shoulder and say "excuse me buddy" to him.

My hand reaches out and hits a mirror.  The guy I was doing the dance with was my reflection the whole time.

Worst is, a staffer in the hallway saw the whole thing:

Staffer:  "Uh, the bathroom's that way"
Me:  "Naw I'm good" *runs away

FML

EDIT: After I ran from the staffer, I found my gf and we promptly hopped in the photo booth at the bar:  [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/gAYJAw0.jpg)
