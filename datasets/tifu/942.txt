Well reddit, today I done fucked up. 
I work at a burger joint as a cook and have a pretty cool manager. By pretty cool manager I mean the guy fucks around with us a lot, we will have random slap fights, hide each others shit, spike co-workers drinks with sauces, just tomfoolery all around. Well today I decided I would take my managers phone and replace his wallpapers (which I have successfully done before) with me and other co-workers giving him the finger while he went to grab a smoke, but this time it was.. not a good time to say the least. As I snapped the first picture and brought up the photo album to set a wall paper I saw his "recent photos". This is when I was greeted with a 21 gun salute of dick pic's. God I dont think Ill ever manage to burn those images out of my mind. And believe me, its hard to keep a straight face talking to the guy when those images pop up in your mind.

TLDR: Tried to be a dick, ended up seeing dick
