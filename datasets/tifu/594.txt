So, I have an old iPhone 5 with a broken mic and home button and I had the last week of AppleCare service so I wanted to get it fixed before selling it on eBay. My mom really wanted to check out the new Apple Store that just opened in my town, so I brought her with me. We went to the Genius Bar, and I explained the problem. He was ready to replace it when my mom told the guy"My son is obsessed with electronics, he repaired that iPhone's screen six months ago by himself". *insert biggest facepalm ever here*
Not only he didn't replace my phone, but now my warranty is long gone and I can't get it fixed by Apple even by paying them.
Lesson learned: never bring your mom to the Apple Store because she's gonna fuck you up.
