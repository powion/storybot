I was just taking a stroll and decided to kick this rock in front of me. Turned out to be a snail and now I feel like an asshole. 

Edit: I was NOT expecting to this to blow up. And since I helped snail evolution out so much, I'll walk by the same place tomorrow and fuck up every single snail I can find. 

And oh my god, whoever gilded me is a boss and the snail probably thinks it was down just to laugh at him more. If he's even alive...
