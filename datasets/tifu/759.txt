Hi reddit!

Not really a TIFU, happened several months ago. I was in the hospital after rapid weight loss. Doctors suspected Crohn's disease and had to check through colonoscopy. Note: it was an university hospital, full of student doctors who specialise in a given field. In my case, there was this beautiful young female doctor, with warm attitude towards me and all the good stuff (*you know what I mean, boys*). I was joking with my now-girlfriend on the phone about how to flirt with a medical worker (my girlfriend is a nurse). Never had any intentions to do so, and was always respectful to the doctor in question. 



----------------------------------

###Until the day of the colonoscopy came.

I was lying butt-naked on the operating table, with a bunch of staff around me. The anesthesiologist injected me with something and then we talked for about 15 minutes, after which they asked me if I felt dizzy already. Well, I didn't. They injected more of the same sedative, and we talked for another 15 minutes. They asked the same question again, and I was still as fresh as a radish on a warm April morning. 

By then everybody was kind of pissed off this takes too much time. The anesthesiologist said something in the vein of "this dude requires a horse-sized shot", injected me a third time, and asked me if I feel dizzy again. Last thing I remember is that I answered "no".

Fast forward several hours. Nurses are trying to push me down, my head aches, and I still lie butt-naked on the table. After I calm down and wake up completely, they tell me the whole story.

The last thing I remember wasn't the last thing I did. Apparently, the sedative had some side-effects, namely turned me into some minimalistic half-Bane, half-Hulk. I started trashing around, yelling and even detached myself from the tubes on both of my hands. Then I stood up, still ass-naked, in a middle of a room full of medical professionals. 

And I slapped the buttocks of that good-looking student. When I say "slapped", I do mean it&amp;mdash;apparently, my rear-high-five was so violent, the poor girl had to sit down and later leave the colonoscopy room. 

I stayed for another two weeks in the hospital but I never saw her again.

--------------------------

**TL;DR:** sedative in hospital had some side-effects&amp;mdash;after I was injected with a horse dose of the sedative, I started acting violently, slapped a quite nice-looking medical student's ass, all while being butt-naked inside a room with ~10 medical professionals.

At least that story made my future-girlfriend laugh and we got together almost right after I left the hospital.

**EDIT:** Grammar.

##Update

Man. I never imagined such a response. Some questions have been raised by fellow redditors, which I'll answer below. I'll also elaborate further on the story.

Apparently, this is called [Paradoxical Reaction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradoxical_reaction) and is a real thing, albeit rare one. Mine turned out to be quite violent but judging by some of the comments here ("I was held down by 5 men") not the most violent one. I'd say it was violent enough for me to slap the poor doctor but not violent enough for a more gruesome ending.

I lost 16 kilos in 2 months time.

It turned out I didn't have Crohn's disease. Thankfully, cause it is an awful disease and I wish "good luck" to anyone who suffers from it. I was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome without diarrhea (I know, right). Doctors told me to stop eating leafy salads, and it did work. I regained 12 of my 16 kilos lost. It is likely related to some stress I've been under. My reaction to the sedative might be related to stress as well.

I never got the chance to apologise to the doctor. I saw her several times outside of the hospital but never got a "hey-I-remember-you" reaction. Mind we live in a relatively small town, I'm not some creeper dude who's following her around.

No, they cannot sue me for sexual assault. I was clearly sedated and out of my mind.

I wish y'all good luck. Be careful with any anesthetics, especially if a tube is to be inserted in your anal tract in the presence of an attractive young doctor.
