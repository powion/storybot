I work in IT at a graduate school at a large, semi-prestigious university.  

After attending to a call, I came back up the stairwell and as I opened the door I saw a yellow jacket (wasp) on the door frame next to the handle.

Keeping the door open (because I didn't want the little asshole to get spooked and fly off), I took my shoe off and THWAPED him pretty hard (perhaps a little harder than intended).  He fell, and I said to myself, "Good job, me, you saved the school".

Almost immediately after that, there's a school lockdown.  I'm told to get in my office, lock the doors and shut the lights off.  There's some important government people who work here, so I figure maybe they do this as a drill every so often so whatever.  But I'm still kind of nervous. 

I texted someone up at the front desk "wtf" and they texted back "there was a gunshot". 

I guess that staircase is pretty echo-y, because the next thing I know I'm trying not to laugh as police officer is questioning me, getting my information, and taking pictures of my kill like hes the fuckin wasp FBI.  At some point I heard mention of a SWAT team on standby.  It didn't even die, it was still wiggling around as he was photographing the crime scene.  

I can't work here anymore, everyone's calling me "shooter".  I was just trying to help.
