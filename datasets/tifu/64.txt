Walking towards door. Girl caught my eye. Got distracted. Went into revolving door segment.. 

'Oh shit, I'm dick to ass with some guy who is already in here.'

He looked back at me as if I just shat in his cornflakes and then we both shuffled our feet at breakneck speed because people were still entering the door in the opposite direction.

I tried to laugh it off, but I overplayed the laugh and just kind of did a maniacal laugh like it was some nefarious plot of mine. 

**Edit:** /u/MarkReadsReddit did a [narration of it](https://youtu.be/teglPZ7UrDc). Worth a watch, haha.
