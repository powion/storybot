TIFU by going to a thrift store but this is by no means something that happened today, it was actually about a year ago but i'm loving this subreddit so i thought i would share... anyway...

Normal Saturday afternoon, brought the hubby some lunch at work... driving around town... I'm pretty new in town so im still learning my way around. I remembered passing a Thrift Store sign when i drive to and from hubbys work so i thought i would go check it out.

Note: Many businesses in the area are repurposed homes. It's a bit odd to see so many businesses that look like houses, but i kinda live on the outskirts of town.

I find the place and walk up to the front door and try the handle. Locked. I then notice a post it note taped to the door that says "thrift shop around back". Er.. okay. So i walk around the house and all i see is a clearly man made staircase leading to the second floor. Okay... makes sense i guess, they live below, the store is up top.
I walk up the stairs and the door is wide open, just the screen door in place. It's unlocked. I walk in to what looks like a normal kitchen.
My dumbass thought they may have just laid their store out like a house.. I'm checking out the toaster for a good minute before deciding i dont really need a toaster and i walk into the next room.. to see an entire family.. mom, dad, sister, brother, grandma, grandpa.. eating dinner and watching TV. 
I was so shocked all i could muster was a meek "Is this your house?" then walked out terribly embarrassed. Almost fell down their man made staircase too...

TL;DR - I accidentally walked into someones house thinking it was a business. So glad i didnt get shot..

EDIT: IT WAS NARRATED! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onNAy2p9KEE

EDIT EDIT: I mean "man made" as in they clearly built it themselves
