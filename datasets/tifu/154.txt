So I'm a short white girl and I work at a Chinese restaurant.


Part of my job is putting food in boxes for you at the end of your meal. I don't know why I'm not supposed to let you do it, but I'm not. In any case, a few nights ago I was boxing up some food for a table of huge black dudes. As I was putting their chow mein in one box I was thinking ahead to where the rice would go. Some people are particular about separating food (though I prefer to conserve boxes and just put all that shit in one cuz who are you kidding all Chinese food tastes the same after a night in the fridge) so I decide to ask these guys what their preference would be. 


What I meant to say was "Would you prefer to **separate** the brown and the white rice?" 
Instead what I said was "Would you prefer to **segregate** the brown and the white rice?"

They bust out laughing and I was really embarrased, and if you were wondering, they were cool with putting all the rice in one box. 

TL;DR: was racist, but it was cool
