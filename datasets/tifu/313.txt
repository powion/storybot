TL:DR Rock out, til the cops out.

I was driving home from work and got really into this blues song (it was on Pandora, no clue who it was).  The bass was jumping like Jacks, the guitar was singing the melodiest of melodies, the drums had a beat that just rounded it off and got me jammin'.

So I'm tapping along to the beat on my wheel until we get to a red light. Nice! It just turned red. Pushed in the clutch, stopped the truck and now I have a kick pedal (thump my right foot on the ground). The roads flat so my truck stays without my foot on the brake. 

I'm pretty much fully engulfed at this point... Then I pick up on the high hat opening ever other 4th... So here I am, lost in the fucking music at a red light and lift my left foot instinctively to raise the high hat and my truck lurches forward into the cop car. 

He gets out, checks out the car. Luckily our bumpers lined up so there was no visible damage.  But I guess he was watching me flail around and thought I was high or some shit, made me do a sobriety test etc... Then lectured me a bit and sent me on my way. Not a terrible ending, I know, but it put a damper on the fantastic mood I was in. 


Edit: Some requested things and other errors. Also I'm searching for the song.

2: the throwout bearing gets replaced when I change the clutch out, so I'm not concerned about it wearing out. I'll throw it away long before that time comes.
