So I was at my local climbing gym, and talking to one of the guys down there who I know half well and in conversation he revealed he did magic. As most people would be, I was pretty interested so I said something along the lines of 'Go on, show me your magic then!' So this guy replies 'No, it's embarrassing man!' But I cajole him into it. So he takes me over to his locker and reaches into his bag and pull out what I assume is, I don't know, a special box of cards or some props to do a magic trick with.

It wasn't. It was a box of Magic cards, as in, a card game I'd never heard of before, and now this guy thought I was some sort of expert on the matter because I'd been pushing him for about 5 minutes to show me. I ended up spending half an hour pretending I had a clue what the fuck he was showing me as he pulled various good (?) cards out of his deck.

TL;DR: Asked a guy to show me his magic. He did. Oh boy he did.
