This happened last night, not today, but still less than 24 hours ago.

So my husband LOVES birds, all kinds of birds.  He thinks they are great.  He is especially fond of ducks.  Last night while he was in the kitchen prepping a snack, I thought it would be fun to change the desktop photo on his laptop (he had left it open on the couch).  I found a cute duck picture, made it his desktop background, set the laptop back on the couch, and made my way innocently back to the kitchen table where I had also been having a snack.

My husband finishes his snack a little while later and heads back to the couch while I remain at the table. He pulls his computer towards him and goes, "OMG honey look!  Ducks!" As he stands up holding his laptop and tries to come to me, he trips and falls over the glass end table we have, shattering it. If that wasn't bad enough, he fell onto his macbook, smashing it completely open and crushing it.  If that also wasn't bad enough, he also broke his wrist because of how he fell on it since he was holding the laptop.  

I feel like a terrible person, but my husband still loves ducks.

TL;DR: My husband got so overexcited over a picture of ducks I procured that he broke himself, a table, and his macbook.
