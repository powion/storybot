In my humanities class we had just finished reading "The Scarlet Letter". Tldr the book? A woman is caught committing adultery and has to wear a scarlet, gold-embroidered patch of cloth in the shape of an “A” at all times. A major theme of the book is that the main character is being punished for her sin and secrecy. 

"Ah, secrecy--that sounds like a good buzzword to bullshit my entire paper around. How about I take it one step classier and term the theme of this paper...secretion. "

I think you know where this is going. I got my paper back about a week later to find that I was given a C. My teacher left a note at the top saying "That word does not mean what you think it means" and had circled every time I used any form of "secretion" or "secreted" throughout the paper. Apparently Hester Prynne, the main character, did not secrete her identity from anyone. Secretion was not the most potent theme of the novel. Annnnnnd Hester Prynne did not feel pressured by society to secrete anything.

    ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
