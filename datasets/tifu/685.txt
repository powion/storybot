This wasn’t today. I’m male in my 30s now, this happened when I was around 16. I’ve been told by several friends I need to post this partly for entertainment and partly because I might find her. I apologize is advance. I know it’s long but I wanted to have some fun writing this so I wrote it to her in hopes that she finds this. I’m over this now but this was a brutal mindfuck then. 


You were a short, sexy, and nerdy MN Target employee around 2000-2001. You are one of the most beautiful women I’ve ever seen and I had the biggest crush on you. We were both in high school but at different schools. I was a nerd and not adept with women then. It took me a while to start talking to you. Even then my attempts to talk you were awkward because I was nervous……at first. You seemed to understand and just went along with it. We got to know each other and flirt but before it could go anywhere you had put in your 2 weeks’ notice. I finally worked up the courage to ask for your number which you happily gave. /excitement

With you gone from Target I had to work up the courage to call, only to find that I never added your number to my list. I didn’t have a cell phone then so I kept a list of phone numbers in a notebook. I turned the house upside down twice trying to find the little slip of paper with your number on it with no luck. Since I knew only your first name and the pronunciation of your last name which was spelled weird I couldn’t find you by name. I was disappointed but not through, someone had work probably knew. 
I didn’t have better luck at work. No one knew your number, and those that could have looked up your last name wouldn’t tell me for privacy concerns. They were right to do that but that didn’t help me. I felt like a detective working on his most important case of my life and failing horribly at it. 

Before you left Target, I needed a ride home one day. Since your mom picked you up (we were 16), she drove us to my place while we talked. It felt like a date and even though it was a short trip to my place and in front of your mom. It was October so we talked about Halloween plans. We had arranged a sort of date on Halloween. Where you were going to meet me at my place so we could go trick or treating together. Our quick date/ride home came to a short end at my house. We hugged and agreed to meet on Halloween if not sooner. 

Since you never took down any of my information the only way for you to come to meet me was by memory from going to my house once while we were talking. I wasn’t really expecting you to show but I really REALLY hoped you would. I did wait outside all night for you in case you did show. After you didn’t show, I thought that was it. I thought you were lost to me forever. 

Out of pure luck and randomness or maybe just the universe being a teasing bitch, I ran into you on my way out of Perkins in the waiting area. I think you were on a date with some dude, who wasn’t happy but didn’t do anything to stop us from talking. There was a moment when our eyes met that I was overcome by something and it just felt like we connected instantly. All the nervousness I normally felt when trying to approach women and even you previously (I was a nerd after all) was gone. You must have felt it too as you had this star struck look in your eyes. We shared a moment on your date with another dude. I quickly told you how I lost your number and how I waited for you on Halloween hoping you would show. I asked for your number again but this time asked you to put it in my phone. You eagerly entered your number in my phone and I had you write it down on a piece of newspaper I tore off as a backup. I wanted to kiss you before I left and I think you wanted me to but I already felt like dick because your date was right there watching this unfold. So I left on cloud 9 so happy and convinced I’d have a date with the girl I’d been crushing on for months. 

The next day, I woke up late. So I was extra groggy and rushing to school. My 89’ Beretta (PoS) had this kind of shelf on the dashboard that’s great for holding stuff. It also has a great “feature” where if the passenger window is open and I make a fast left turn everything on that shelf goes right out the window.  I thought I had the window closed enough that it wouldn’t be an issue. It was open just enough for my cell phone to go through. Bear in mind, I’ve dropped this phone many times including on concrete and on metal stairs. Though dented and scratched, it kept on going. Here’s what I think happened to my phone. My phone flew out my window and into the side of an invisible alien space craft where it shattered and fell to ground. Then the ship took off, scared by my cell phone attack. The shitty flip phone was closed when it flew out my window and there was nothing but tall weeds in the ditch that should have broken the fall. How it broke in half and shattered is beyond my understanding. I managed to recover the bottom half of the phone in several pieces but couldn’t find the top. 

I tried not to panic about losing your number in the phone because you wrote it down and I had that slip of paper at home. When I got home after school, I couldn’t find the slip of paper. I never added it to my notebook because I had my phone now. I turned the house, my car, and the alien ditch upside down looking, but found nothing. I was more panicked now but there was a chance they could recover if from the pieces of my phone.

I brought the pieces of my phone to the Verizon store. I told clerk the story thus far. After some laughs, the guy at the store pulled out an unbroken model of my phone to see if we could follow along with the key presses without the screen and a couple other things he could think of. No success and I could see that he really didn’t like giving me that news. He sympathized and gave me a new phone when the warranty I had called for a refurb. That was already awesome of him but he had more. 

I knew the school she went to so I could check a yearbook. Thanks Verizon guy, you are a gentlemen and a scholar! If I could find her in a yearbook, I could get the spelling of her name, which I could look up in the phone book to hopefully find her number. (I still feel creepy about that but you would have done it too.) I tried checking out a friend’s yearbook from her school but there was a possibility that your photo wasn’t there. I also realized I might not recognize you. I’d only ever seen you at work and at Perkins once but I only recall what you looked like at work. At work you always looked a bit stressed, tired, and never dressed up. It didn’t look like you put any effort into your looks but somehow you looked absolutely, inescapably beautiful. If you were taking yearbook photos, you would probably put in the effort to look good and therefore I might not recognize you. Whether that was the case or your photo wasn’t there, I’m not sure but that was my last lead. 

I had nothing else to go on, and that’s where the anti-climactic story ends. That’s what made this so much more frustrating. This whole ordeal felt like it was building up to an awesome climax where the protagonist overcomes adversity, gets the girl, and they live nerdily ever after. It was the making of every romantic comedy movie but with a shitty albeit real ending. This was the first datingish situation I’d ever been in. 

Cheers to you sexy Target nerd, where ever you are. 


**TL;DR** – I finally worked up the nerve to ask out my work crush, she gave me her number and I lost it. Ran into her randomly and got her number again only to have it taken from me by aliens. 

**Edit 1** This blew up. I have more comments than time right now. I'll respond to comments as soon as I can but it might not be till tomorrow.
