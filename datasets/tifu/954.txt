This happened last Valentine's Day. Deal with it.

Now I'm a chivalrous fella who believes in loving a woman every day of the year so I always played off Valentine's as the consumerist BS that it really is. Still, deep down I could see my girlfriend was into it and wanted something to mark the day.

So I ordered some flowers with a card to be delivered on the morning and booked a table at an awesome little restaurant. On the card I simply asked for "From ?" to be written, going along with the idea that I wasn't interested in Valentine's Day so it couldn't possibly be from me. This is where I fucked up.

When the package arrived and I playfully asked "Wonder who those could be from?" I did not expect to be met with the response, "Probably Steven from work." Who the fuck is Steven from work?!

Echoing that thought, I said, "No they're from me. Who the fuck is Steven from work?!"

My girlfriend explained Steven from work had been hitting on her for about 4 months and recently asked what her favourite flowers were (lilies - like I had ordered).

We spent the rest of the day going through Steven from work's attempts to pick up my girlfriend, had an uncomfortable meal at the restaurant then returned home to find a Valentine's card had been popped through our letter box.

It didn't say who it was from.

**TL;DR Put your name on Valentine's cards to your girlfriend or she'll think it's Steven from work.**

EDIT: Since this went waaaay bigger than I expected (did it make front page? I was asleep) and a couple of people have asked, I thought I should clarify that girlfriend and I are sadly no longer together, though we are on speaking terms and catch up every now and then. The funny thing is Steven from work is taking the hit but she is now seeing Rob from work. Fuck Rob from work.
