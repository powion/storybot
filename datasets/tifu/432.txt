This actually happned this morning.

One of my classes is a black and white photography class. We were assigned to take a roll of film worth of pictures. Photo assignments are weighed heavily so I wanted to take awesome photos. Anyways, I was taking a picture of a friend and this dude purposely walks in front of my camera and ruins my picture! He snickers and walks off. I am pissed because it is not like I can just delete the photo! So, I yelled my favorite insult

"You are a rude waffle! A crusty pancake with square holes!" 
 
He turned around and looked me in the eyes and retaliated with 

"This is why nobody **FUCKING** loves you!"

He walks off again and I just stand in shock. I knew this kid. He would follow me around sometimes and be really creepy. I turned around to finish taking a picture and one of my teachers comes up and starts ranting.

"Don't use that language! It is improper for a lady!"

I looked at her confused. 

"I just called him a waffle! He is the one that cussed at me!"

"Well, two wrongs don't make a right. I'm disappointed"

"He walked in front of my camera and ruined a picture for photography. I am getting graded on it!"

"He has a hard life. You don't know what he has been through okay?"

"I know he went through my fucking picture! I have a hard life to but I'm not an asshole."

She got really mad and sent me to the dean. I had to explain to my mom why I called a kid a crusty pancake. I have to write an apology note. My dad finds this hilarious though and we are making waffles for dinner.

**tl;dr: Called a kid a waffle. Got grilled for it**

**Edit:** OMG I logged on and my inbox was filled and I got happy over Internet Points! Thank you guys! To clear things up I am a senior in high school but do advanced college classes in school.

**Edit 2:** So, I have the picture of him walking across. I just have to develop it and enlarge it but I will try to post it in a few days!

**Edit 3:** For everyone saying that waffle is dumb or I am just "being random", the original insult is twat waffle but I enjoy the word rude. I also hate waffles so I added the crusty pancake part. I didn't want to be too insulting because I was upset but not angry. I just came out with a light-hearted, confusing, immature, insult.

**Edit 4:** Hey guys! Sad news, the picture doesn't show him at all. Just a mostly dark picture. Sorry :(
