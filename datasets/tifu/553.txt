Ok so this didn't happen today, but a few years ago. I recently discovered TIFU so I thought I'd submit my fuck up. 

Ok so my family was chilling next door at the neighbours so I decided to get my vibrator out (I'm a girl and was 18 at the time) so anyway I plug the toy in and get to work. It was going great until I squirted (TMI but it's important) I must've got some of it on the plug or whatever and it ended up shocking me! 

It was the single most painful thing that has EVER happened to me! In the shock my vagina decided to completely fuck me over and clamped down on the toy and wouldn't let go! (There's a technical name for it but I can't remember it) 

In pain from the shock and now the muscle spasms in my vagina. I spent forty minutes trying to pry the toy out. In the end I gave up and shouted for my mum from across the gardens. She came in, I explained what had happened. 

She took me to A&amp;E and I was given a muscle relaxer. The toy slid out and I left mortified. Imagine explaining what had happened to twenty+ staff and watching them trying not to laugh. I couldn't look anyone in the eye Including my family for the next year! 

TL;DR electrocuted myself with a sex toy and was sent to A&amp;E after my vagina wouldn't let go!

Update: wow front page! :) to answer a couple questions. 
Yes my vagina is working properly, there was no lasting damage.
Haven't used a toy since haha :)
And it wasn't the wand thing I used :D just a regular vibrator,that 
was plugged in whilst charging :) 
I'm British so sorry for using A&amp;E which means accident and emergency :)
And I've never questioned electrocuted until I read the comments! :D 
Some of these comments have me crying!!
