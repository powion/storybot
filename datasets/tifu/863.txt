TL;DR [worked with world’s greatest detectives to reclaim my stolen phone](http://i.imgur.com/jSymUSb.jpg)

This is a tale so epic it fits [the hero’s journey](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHerosJourney), so I’ve broken it up into appropriate chapters. Obligatory "obligatory, this didn't happen today." Obligatory "Gold!" ᴵ'ᵐ ᵃᶜᵗᵘᵃᶫᶫʸ ˢᵒ ᵉˣᶜᶦᵗᵉᵈ! ᵗʰᵃᶰᵏ ʸᵒᵘ ᵗʰʳᵉᵉ ʷᶦˢᵉ ᵐᵃᵍᶦ ᶠᵒʳ ʸᵒᵘʳ ᵍᶦᶠᵗˢ ᵒᶠ ᵍᵒᶫᵈ, ᵍᵒᶫᵈ, ᵃᶰᵈ ᶠʳᵃᶰᵏᶦᶰᵍᵒᶫᵈ! 

**ACT 1 - DEPARTURE**

**0) An Uncomfortable Home**

In February I went to the Secret Garden Festival. A laid back music festival held on a big farm a few hours out from Sydney, Australia. Sometime on the final night of the festival, between karaoke, bush treks, and laying in a room made of pillows, I let the phone slip from my pocket.

**1) Call to Adventure**

At 11PM I notice the phone is missing. This phone, was a well loved iPhone 4, all black, with a broken off-button. Destiny had broken that off-button. I checked everywhere I had been...

**2) Refusal of the call**

Nothing. Well, plenty of things, but nothing that was my iPhone. I decide to get some sleep, and wait until lost property opened at dawn...

**3) Meeting with the mentor**

*[Dun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8lDYrvTILc) [dun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wILFddYxKOM)*
Lost property opens up, and no phone.

Enter hero #1:

A girl I met the night before arrives. We’ll call her ‘**Emma**’ (because that was her name). Emma suggests I look for it using the ‘Find My iPhone’ ap. It’s an ap that allows me to GPS locate, call, message, and erase all the content on my phone if it goes missing. 

“Derr” I think to myself. 

She lends me her phone, but to no avail. You can’t install ‘Find My iPhone’ on an Android. Luckily a savior comes along with an iPhone... that’s out of power... And then lost property receives a box... filled with every phone charger known to man! We charge their phone. I log into ‘Find my iPhone’, and see that my phone is no longer at secret garden...

**4) Crossing the threshold** 

My phone is moving through Narellan, a nearby town. It’s moving slowly through shops... Someone has it, and is shopping. We try calling the phone. Nothing. I set it on lost mode with a message to return it, with a number to call. Nothing. We use find my iPhone to make it play an alarm a number of times. Nothing. They haven’t returned it to lost property. They won’t answer it, despite all the rings and beeps...

It’s been stolen!

My bus back to Sydney drives off without me. Emma agrees to give me a lift to Narellan. We jump into her car. The problem is, her phone can’t run ‘Find My iPhone’. So we will need to borrow an iPhone when we reach Narellan... Vroom vroom!

**ACT 2 - INITIATION**

**5) Road of trials**

I explain on the way: the broken off-button on my iPhone means that if it is stolen, no one can possibly turn it off. It can always be tracked, and we have roughly 10 hours to catch it before it powers down.

&gt; “But how are we going to find an iPhone?” Emma asks

&gt;“Hipster cafes” I answer

We arrive in Narellan and head to the trendiest cafe we can find. iPhones are everywhere. The first family we ask is more than happy to join our iPhone chase.

&gt; “This is like CSI!” exclaims mum

&gt; “What’s CSI?” questions child

&gt; “[WAAHHHHHH!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YMPAH67f4o)” posits baby

They crowd around the father’s screen as my iPhone’s location pops up... It’s about 10 minutes down the road, moving fast... moving by car. If we drive after it, we have no way to track it. We can’t even guarantee to catch up to it. Emma needs to get to Sydney and the phone might be headed to Newcastle (hours away). We set off the alarm a few more times, we call, no response.

* We can’t chase it.
* Emma doesn’t want to chase it. 
* I have to prepare for a trip to Adelaide tomorrow. I need a phone to run my theatre production down there.

It’s over. I’ll just have to buy a new one. I buy Emma breakfast for helping with the chase, and we talk about how crazy it would be to actually get the phone back.

**6) The Temptation**

Hours later, I’ve unpacked and showered at my city apartment. I charge up my laptop, and start browsing for new phones. None of them are right. I want my iPhone 4. It’s black to match my 5 pairs of identical sunnies, 5 pairs of matching pants, 20 matching black shirts, and 40 pairs of matching socks... 

I decide to check in on my phone. I ping it...  and the GPS tells me It’s sitting in Waverly. That is only 20 minutes drive away! 5 minutes later, still sitting there. 15 minutes later, still sitting there... 

I make a callout on facebook: “My phone’s been stolen. [I’m tracking it by GPS, I’ve found their home.] Does anyone have an iPhone and a car and would like to go head hunting with me today? I can pay in gratitude and blood.”

Our second hero comes to my aid. We’ll call him **Inspector Gadget** (Because that was his name) ((It wasn’t))

Inspector gadget says he’ll be at my apartment in 20 minutes with:
1. a van 
2. a phone with wifi hotspot.

Yesss! Social media starts going a bit crazy:

&gt; “Haley: The hunt is on!”

&gt; “Ben: This is a terrible idea.”

&gt; “Jeremiah: I think Ben is the phone thief.”

I get my camera and [crime fighting outfit together](http://i.imgur.com/MvvvhFH.jpg). Inspector Gadget picks me up, and we’re off to get *[justice](http://i.imgur.com/fbia5CO.jpg)*. I get on Gadget’s hotspot, and track the phone - it’s moved 5 minutes down the road to Bronte Beach cliffs and is sitting there. We call ahead to the nearby Waverton Police, who agree to meet us at the beach’s bus stop.

We get there asap, the phone hasn’t moved. We can’t find a parking spot. We find one. I grab my camera to film. Gadget grabs a parking ticket. Our parking is legal for the next hour. We’re late. We rush to the bus stop, no police, so we rush the the location on the map. It’s a long stretch of road overlooking the ocean with cars parked on either side.

The GPS dot jumps around a bit. There isn’t sufficient wifi nearby to pinpoint the location of the phone, but we get it down to a stretch of 40 cars, and begin walking up the street using ‘Find My iPhone’ to ping the GPS location, and make the phone play a sound.

We listen to each car... Nothing. No sound. No exact location. No police. We’re stuck.

We consider that they might have dramatically thrown the phone off the cliff to hide the evidence. But it seems like too much hassle when they could have handed it into a police station, or dropped it in a bin. I ask Gadget how long we have on the parking... Parking tickets!! 

We inspect the parking tickets. Inspect the times cars arrived. We narrow down the 40 to about 15 plausible cars that arrived around the time I saw the phone arrive. Then we start the equivalent of racially profiling the cars.

&gt; “This one has kids stuff, they weren’t at Secret Garden.”

&gt; “Business car, too rich.”

&gt; “No dirt, too clean.”

We get it down to about 10 cars. The dot still hasn’t moved... The phone is in one of these cars. Then it hits me. I get a photo of all the cars’ plates. If a car leaves, and the dot moves, we will know it’s in that car. Then we can check the plates on the photo. Cars leave but no dot movement.

**7) Meeting with the Goddess**

The police arrive and I continue taking photos as cars move off. The officers take down my story. They can’t inspect any cars without sufficient proof that the phone is inside. Without the phone audible, we won’t have sufficient proof until the car moves off. My laptop is low on power. Clouds roll in. The police have to go.

All in all, the cops are great. They look like American cops, but they don’t shoot me multiple times or try to destroy my recording equipment. ‘stralia. [So I shoot them](http://i.imgur.com/420L54X.jpg). We say goodbyes. The rain begins to spit. No dot movement. Gadget and I quickly check the rocks below and ask swimmers: 

&gt; “Excuse me- have you stolen an iPhone?”

No one admits to being guilty. Damn it! I was so sure.

* No dot movement.
* It’s raining.
* My laptop runs out of power.

It’s time to head home... On the way home we stop by the old Waverly location - it’s a parking lot for an apartment complex. Gadget is a genius: he says he’ll pop by later tonight and get photos of all cars. If we find plates that match the beach, then we’ll know which car had the phone!

It rains, it pours, but we have a plan. Gadget drops me home and heads off to his other evening engagements. I charge my laptop. The dot is still at the beach. I update Facebook. Half my friend list has been following along, waiting for an update. 

My thoughts wander... I need a phone before I board my plane to Adelaide tomorrow. I head to the Apple store before it closes. I discuss the merits of 5s vs 5c vs 6s vs new 6s3DSxl.

&gt; “Yes sir. You can buy a new one right now.”

I arrive home empty handed. I ping my iPhone. ITS ON THE MOVE. Oh no, it’s travelling fast, back through Sydney, it’s heading north to the Sydney Harbour Bridge, it’s...! It’s...! It’s stopped, in Woolloomooloo, one of Australia’s most expensive areas to live. There’s plenty of wifi and I have a location of the phone within about 5-10 meters! I google map the exact location and get it down to [5 car spaces](http://i.imgur.com/DTcZpNW.png). All we need is one plate to match, and we have our car!

And it will.

Inspector Gadget is busy. My phone is on 20% power. I make another facebook callout.

Enter hero #3. Not the hero we deserve, but the hero we need, **Batman**. (Because that’s his name) (-that he requested.)

Batman is nearby, and treks over on foot. Social media explodes. Hundreds are playing along at home. Friends of friends of friends are in on it, and one guy has been keeping his entire family updated over dinner. Batman stalks his way up the street taking photos of plates. 

&gt; “I feel like Batman”

He sends the plate pictures through! No matches. Shit. We play the sound. Nothing. Shit. Like a good Luscious Pennyworth, I make a googlesheet of all the licence plates from the beach, alphabetise, and send them through to the bat phone. And then...

WE HAVE A MATCH! 

**8) The Ordeal**

Directly across the road from the other 5 cars, is a car with two surfboards I recognise from the beach. We have our vehicle! Still no sound... But we have something better. On the dash is a [Bronte parking ticket](http://imgur.com/fl4Ycml) with the perfect time stamp, and right beside it is a sticker with a mysterious design and a number.

I post the mysterious sticker onto the facebook comments of my status, and quickly we discover, the design belongs to [REDACTED] club. Australia’s richest, most exclusive and powerful [REDACTED] club. The queue to be a member of [REDACTED] is years, and the number on the sticker? That’s the owner’s [REDACTED] membership number. We could call [REDACTED] and find out which of Australia’s richest people has stolen my iPhone. But they’re not likely to give up that information...

Unless the cops ask? 

I call the Waverly police using my flat mate’s phone. Apparently the story has been making its way around Waverly station. They pass me on to the nearby King’s Cross cops. I explain the situation!

The Kings Cross cops tell me:

* 1) There’s no cops nearby
* 2) Even if they came, they can’t open the car without evidence
* 3) We have the car in two places that the phone has been, but it could be a coincidence
* 4) They don’t want to run the plates, and call the owner because...
* 5) The owner is not going to admit to stealing a phone
* 6) Or let us search their car.

So the police won’t send anyone. And then...

* 7) The facebook status with all my evidence [mysteriously disappears](http://i.imgur.com/CsbQtlF.png). (And months later has never reappeared. Facebook won’t answer me about it.)

Too many updates? Too many comments? Perhaps the [REDACTED] has [REDACTED] in high places and doesn’t like their members being accused of theft? I’m told the Australian minister for [REDACTED] is a part of [REDACTED], and they just passed laws on [REDACTED]. Eh. It’s probably a coincidence.

All the while...

* 8) My iPhone is on 15% power.
* 9) Batman’s phone is on 9%.
* 10) It starts to rain again.
* 11) Batman’s stomach is on 5%.

We had it sorted! And now we’re stuck in the mud. Batman goes to get food. I begin to pack for Adelaide, something I was meant to spend the day doing. Gah. I haven’t even rehearsed my play, and totally neglected advertising my show. I don’t have any documents ready, or food prepped. Or a phone that isn’t my flat mates-

Ring ring! [(Or whatever my flatmate's phone sounds like...)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

The police have run the plates! The police contacted the owner! He’s the father of two girls who had just been to........ the Secret Garden Festival! They get me to file a report. They’ll keep me updated. 

Click. Beep beep beep. Waiting waiting waiting.

I consider cutting my losses and trading my iPhone for one of the surfboards on the roof of their car. Would make for a good bartering tool! -no no, the police are already involved. Could get messy. Maybe I’ll wait outside their–

Ring ring.

Police are sending officers! They’re armed with the plate numbers, and the information about the phone.

* My phone has 12% power remaining. 
* My phone is dropping in and out of contact with my pings.
* Batman can only wait around another two minutes for police.
* Batman’s phone runs out of power. Our dark knight goes dark.
* No word from police.

Waiting. Waiting. Waiting.

10% power remaining. I need to choose soon whether to erase all data on my phone to prevent any potential hacks...

My phone shuts down at ~2%. It takes 4% to erase. So if there's no updates by *6%* I will have to remotely erase the phone.

9% power. Waiting.

8% power. Waiting..

7% power. Waiting...

6% power... This is it. We tried.

**9) Apotheosis (from here out it’s iambic pentameter because why not?)**

The ‘erase iPhone’ button glows bright....

I move my mouse toward the light... 

And then... Ring ring.

A call from a hidden number.

––No one hears from me for 60 minutes––


I grab my camera, my flat mate’s phone And justice sunnies and run 10 minutes To meet the next train to King’s Cross station,  Slipping in just before the train doors close. I arrive at Kings Cross station and ask For directions to the police station.

I meet with our final hero, a man, Whom we will be calling **Chief Cop Kirby**. (Because that was his name) (Sort of: rule 5!)

The Chief Cop says he needs one thing from me.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So I ask him: “What do you need Kirby?”

And then shows me a face of regrets.

Kirby quickly digs through all his pockets, 

Pulls out his hands, they’re empty, he’s giddy.

Then Kirby says: “I need about tree fiddy”. 

Well it was about that time I noticed This Chief Cop was about 8 stories tall And a crustacean from the protozoic era– [No no, I am just kidding!](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/tree-fiddy)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**10) The Ultimate Boone**

Kirby checks my ID.

It checks out.

*I’m real.*


And then he shows me my phone! 

-and it’s still beaming with the return message onscreen. 

[We do the ol’ good-cop, cy-clops routine](http://i.imgur.com/jSymUSb.jpg).


**ACT 3 - Return**

**11) The Return**

With the number plate, proof the phone and car Were together and the revelation That the occupants had just been at the Secret Garden Festval... they were allowed To search the car and found my missing phone!

‘It’s a family car so anyone could have drove it’ so no theft convictions. Everyone wins. Noone loses... Great! I take my phone home, grinning that my Fuck up could not have turned out any better.

**12) Return with Elixir**

I update Facebook, easing their concern.

They cheer for the prodigal phone’s return.

The next day I am off to Adelaide.

And I think my plans are laid -till- ring ring!


A call. It’s my friend from the ABC,

They want to do an interview with me!

They want me on national radio!

But I can’t make it to the studio... 

“I’m about to get on a flight” I saide...

They say ‘they’ll record me in Adelaide!’

So my one hour flight touches down

And I get a lift to the edge of town.


[The assistant](http://i.imgur.com/KUkAroy.jpg) leads me into the room,

And I hear the disembodied voice boom

Of the host who asks for me to regale– 

And the nation hears of my epic tale!

I wait 10 mins for the host to appear, 

Until the assistant beckons me near.

It turns out the host interviewing me, 

Was actually stationed down in Sydney!

I being was a weirdo by hanging about,

So the assistant was told to come kick me out.

(That’s a bonus TIFU for you!)

**13) Freedom to Live**

Now, months later, my iPhone and I are still together, with a broken button, and living happily ever after. I haven’t a worry of losing it, It hasn’t a worry of losing me. It hasn’t worries: it is just a phone.

**TL;DR**

I met detectives, and we solved the case.

That is the tale, of my epic phone chase.
