When i was 18 i used to run food out to the customers for the local restaurant. But on my way to the table i Happen to glance over to see a girl playing the virtual hunting arcade game that you would see in the back of almost every restaurant. More particularly the shirt she was wearing. It was a workout shirt that had the holes for your arms cut down to about mid side, leaving the entire side of her upper body exposed. How she only had a bra on underneath, mixed with the way she was leaning left her entire boob just hanging out. When i saw this i walked over to one of my more favorite waitresses and said "Do you see that girl over there (nudging my head in her direction)."She is HANGING OUT if you know what i mean". She looked over at the girl and back at me and said "You mean my daughter"?
