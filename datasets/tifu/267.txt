I was just in a silly mood and thought it would be funny to mess with my waitress by faking an Australian accent, pretending it was my birthday, asking her a bunch of stupid questions about her life, about America, etc. She liked me so much that she wound up [snuggling next to me for a picture](https://i.imgur.com/FYDpZVW.jpg) and giving me her number.

She wants to hang out on Thursday. If I don't blow her off, then she'll eventually learn that I was being completely fake when we met.

I'm such a piece of shit. :(
