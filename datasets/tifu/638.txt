*Update: All jokes aside, I genuinely appreciate all the replies on here. This situation fucking sucked and not knowing anyone on campus sucks to. I always believed all comedy comes form a dark place and helps deal with shit and you guys just proved my point. Thank you*

This happened about a month ago. I just read another recent post about inscest on here so I thought I'd post this.

Backstory:
- I was *finally* starting to break some ground in my freshmen year by breaking out of my shell. For me, even saying hi or smiling at a classmate was a big step.
- I've been dating the same girl for over three years now and we've known each other since middle school. When we were kids, her mom would refer to me as her son and my mom would refer to her as her daughter. We would occasionally joke about the whole inscest aspect of our relationship when we started dating.
- Since iOS 8 came out we've been sending each other lots of voice memos instead of texts.

The Story:
The university I'm attending is in a city that is notorious for being hard to make friends in. It's a completely new area for me and I know absolutely no one. The fact that I was starting to at least talk to classmates was a huge positive step for me.

We get our usual break in class and I stay at the spot and check my texts. I see that my GF sent me a voice memo (it's usually quirky silly things) and I raise the phone up to my ear to listen to it. The voice memo is her saying in a very sensual voice "do you miss your sister's mouth?" The volume was loud enough that everyone two rows in front of me and behind me could hear me. Not positive if the prof heard. I start sweating bullets and just turn red. Word quickly spread through campus and now I just go to the library during my breaks and study. I figure I'll make friends when I get a job.
