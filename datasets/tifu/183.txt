I'm a kindergarten teacher that started the school year last week.  Everyday, the students have a 10 minute snack time.  During this time, I play read alouds of children's books on YouTube while I walk around assisting in opening milk cartons and such.  

We just got done listening to a read aloud of Green Eggs and Ham and I saw a suggestion for The Giving Tree.  I asked my students if they have ever heard of this book and they said no.  Hooray!  I get to be the one that introduces them to one of my favorite books! 

So I click on the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQtIx1V9QQc) and continue walking around, doing my snack time duties.  After about a minute into the video I think to myself, "Huh...I don't remember this part."  Then, the bomb drops at 1:22.  I rushed to the computer to turn it off, but it was too late.  Some students were screaming, some were crying and I was ready to sign a letter of resignation.  I called all the parents that night and told them about the mistake.  Fortunately they took it well, but I'm pretty sure I ruined The Giving Tree for my students.  =(
