Background info:  I've done martial arts since I was a kid.  My husband appreciates that and we play-wrestle sometimes for kicks and giggles.  Well, the other day hubby was standing in the bedroom by the dresser watching the news, so I thought that I'd stroll up and lightly tap/kick his stomach and initiate some fun times.  Except I was wearing a pair of skinny jeans, didn't get my leg up high enough and I ended up kicking him in the balls.  Also, I snapped the kick at the end from pure muscle memory.

The poor guy dropped to the ground and was in a fetal position for several minutes, just looking up at me like "wtf, wife?!".  I feel horrible.  =(

Edit:  thanks for the gold, kind internet stranger!
