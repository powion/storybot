Just came to the end of the massive organic synthesis unit in A2 Chemistry (UK) and decided that the best way to keep all my notes together would be by stapling them so they'd stay in order. We're talking pretty bulky here, too many pieces of paper to use a normal stapler - too thick. A-ha! Lightbulb moment! Let's use a staple gun. More precisely, let's put all the pieces of paper down on the dining room table and staple them that way. 

Fast forward 5 seconds, and over a month's worth of organic chemistry notes are stapled to an antique wooden table, along with the tablecloth and my dignity. I've managed to prise them free with only moderate ripping, but I'm unable to free the tablecloth without damaging it, so I'm just leaving it in place until I think of a solution. I feel like such an idiot right now.

UPDATE: I got the staple out using a butter knife, with minimal damage to either table or cloth! Thanks for your, uh, support chaps
