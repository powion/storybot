This is literally happening right now. Like most of us I use the same (really complicated) password everywhere because I can't be bothered to have to remember multiple passwords. So as you can imagine this came back to bite me in the ass... I got an email from Steam saying that someone tried to log into my account from the middle of fuck-knows-where USING MY PASSWORD. I was in a class when I got this email and knew that I didn't have any credit card information or anything on Steam so the guy couldn't screw me up too hard right?

Well yes and no. He didn't do anything on Steam, but did try to log into my facebook since it used the same password and email address. Now I'm in full freak out mode and change my password for facebook, Steam, twitter, my bank account, and anything else I could think of off the top of my head. Still a week after the initial Steam login I get emails from random websites saying that someone logged in, or tried to change passwords or whatever the hell else. 


TL;DR don't use the same password for all your accounts everywhere.
