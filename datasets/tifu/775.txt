This happened about 2 hours ago. The prank was entirely inadvertent.

I felt like getting something to snack on from the service station, being that most places are closed on Good Friday. So I put my shoes on, put a jacket on, brush my teeth, use mouthwash, floss, and get in my car. 

Within 30 seconds of driving I encounter a random breath test and me and the car behind me are ushered in to be tested. I am fumbling with my wallet to get my license and the cop says it isn't necessary and all he needs is my 'breath'. I jokingly respond something like "oh I guess I could give you that" implying I'm doing him a favour and he sarcastically thanks me in good humour. So I blow into the [breathalyzer](http://www.cmm.com.au/articles/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/breath-test.jpg) for about 5 seconds and he checks the reading. He is silent for a bit and I assume he's waiting for the reading to come up. He then asks when the last time I had a drink and I responded with "ugh like 2 years ago haha" and as I finished it clicks that somehow it's a positive reading. So I ask and he confirms and it's clear he is confused because the reading is ridiculously high. I realize that it might be the mouthwash I used a couple of minutes go, given I can still taste it in my mouth. I tell him this and he seems immediately convinced that I'm telling the truth and asks if I have a drink in my car to rinse my mouth out with. I find a nearly full bottle of [mountain dew](https://warosu.org/data/fa/img/0070/93/1382131029398.jpg) I discarded and gargle with it. I get tested again and the reading is 0 and he laughs and sends me on my way. The funniest part was it was clear that I hadn't had any alcohol based on how jovial and non-chalante I was about being tested, then realizing the culprit was something as simple as mouthwash.

Edit: This happened in Australia.
