This happened at my local game/movie store. As I was browsing the inventory a guy needs to walk in front of me, and as I back up I feel myself bump into a freestanding display of movies behind me. Fearing it was about to fall, I instantly get the clever idea to do a fancy 180 to grab it before it tips. Mid-turn, with my hand a little below shoulder height, I place my palm directly on the breast of a completely unseen girl behind me. Very nervous and wanting to explain the innocence of the situation, I instantly say "I was just trying to grab that rack" without realizing the double meaning. She gives me the most curious smile. Slightly confused and completely  embarrassed I walk away; not realizing what I said until 10 minutes later driving away.

TL;DR - walked away from the smoothest move I've ever made without realizing it

EDIT - The 2 most popular responses I'm getting are 1. FAKE And 2. "How hot are you/her?"

1. This story is 98% true; the only thing not true is that it didn't literally happen yesterday ; it was at a FYE store in the mall. No the rack didn't fall it just rocked back and forth for maybe 2 seconds.

2. I'm maybe 7 material on my best day; I remember her as an 8 but considering the situation 6 is entirely possible.

3. For the non English speakers "rack" is slang for breasts.
