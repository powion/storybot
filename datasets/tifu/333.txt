Do I get bonus points? This happened less than an hour ago and I'm still laughing. 

I had been expecting a delivery all day, but I had to get ready for work. "I'll grab a fast shower, what can go wrong?" Ha. Hahaha. I was shaving my legs when I heard the doorbell ring repeatedly, and my 120-lb German Shepherd going ballistic. I knew this was a delivery I would have to sign for, so I leapt out of the shower, fumbled for my glasses, and threw on a towel. I didn't notice that I was still dripping soap at this point. (This is important later on).

I THOUGHT I locked my dog in my room as I ran to the door, but I guess the door didn't shut all the way (also important). So I opened the front door, hiding behind it to maintain some decency as I scribble and drip on the pad the poor driver offered me. Then I hear it- the dreaded sound of paws racing across hard wood. My moron dog slips in a puddle of soap, looses his footing, and crashes into the door, sending me, towel, and scribble pad flying. I landed on my ass, naked as the day I was born and sopping wet, sitting on the very same scribble pad. The poor driver got a very X-rated look at my tattooed hide as I scrambled for my missing towel (somehow it landed halfway across the room), one hand across my tits and the other trying to cover my half-shaved lady garden. I stammered an apology as he grabbed his scribble pad and practically RUNS to his truck, so red his ears might be smoking. 

My furry asshole of a dog is now watching me type this and I swear the bastard is laughing at me. Fuck my life.
