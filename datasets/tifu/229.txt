I was in the kitchen reading the paper at the table, and my one year old was sitting in her high chair at the head of the table. Everything was fine until she started to try and rock back and forth in her chair when she tipped back a little too far and started to fall backwards. Like a cat, I sprung out of my chair towards her to save her from falling. 

Except...that's not what actually happened. It did happen in my head...as I was dreaming it. What ACTUALLY happened was, my wife was happily sleeping next to me, while I was dreaming this, and was rudely awoken by the force of both my hands slamming into her skull. I found out this morning, that when she asked 'WTF was that for', I muttered something unintelligible and rolled over and went back to sleep. 

TLDR: Dreamt I was saving kid's life. Punched my wife in the head.
