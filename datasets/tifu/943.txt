So this just happend and apparently I am single now. My gf randomly calls me and ask me if on my birthday i wanna have a threesome with her and her female friend.  I obviously suspecting it to be a trick question said no and i genuinely didn't care about threesome as I don't want to cheat on my girl. She kept pushing me and sending me her friend's pictures and saying how we should be trying new things and it will be fun. At that point I thought maybe that's something she wants to try and after a good 30 mins of persuasion I agreed to it. She hung up on me after and texted me saying it's over and that she was just testing me. I feel like an ass now. 

EDIT: Thanks for the comments and support guys, I really appreciate it.  I just woke up and saw 7 missed calls from her.  Got her text saying "If you ever loved me, pick up the phone". 

EDIT: here is my last message to her this morning.

EDIT: Sorry about my bad texting, it's just a habit of shortening everything when I talk to her on messenger. NO UPDATES for now. 

UPDATES: she tried calling me 20 times already and messaged me saying she still loves and wants to make it work. I am not gonna do it. 

UPDATES: Ok this is getting pretty messed up. She just texted me a pic of her with blood on her wrist. This is freaking me out. What should i do? 

UPDATE: Called her brother and she is ok. 

UPDATE: SHE FAKED THE BLOOD ON HER WRIST!! CRAZYYYY
