Obligatory 'didn't happen today' but when I was 9. This post was inspired by the recent Askreddit thread about your first experience with the internet. 

Anyway, do you remember when there were those make-your-own-website things way back? Sort of like MySpace but less focussed on the social aspect of it and more of a blog type of thing. Well, this happened around 2005 and a friend of mine was all hyped out about his own webpage. He would put pictures of cool cars and football players on there. As a result of this, I was stoked about making my own page to put weird Spongebob pictures and Lego sets that I liked on there.

Well, in 2006 Google's safesearch wasn't that advanced yet and I stumbled upon pornographic images during searches on the 4th page of images. Being young and innocent, I thought these images were exciting and in its own way funny. 

In my naivety I added some of these images on my website. I didn't know much about sex yet and it was a topic that I had not yet been educated about. I continued to add more and more search results of 'naked' 'vagina' 'tits' on the webpage. 

Now here comes the cringey part. My father had seen the website when it was still mostly a collection of cars and cartoons and thought it would be cute to show his coworkers my creation.

However, by the time he actually showed them, the website I had created had literally become a collection of porn. It must have been embarrassing as fuck expecting an innocent list of cool cars but instead showing a full on porn site your son created. 

That's when I got the talk about sex and internet safety and all that.



TL;DR: unknowingly created porn site, dad shows it to his coworkers
