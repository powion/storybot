This morning at the gas station a cute guy got out the car in front of us and I said 'ohhhh', my daughter looked up from her book and had the same reaction. I asked her if she could tell that he is gay and my son said that it was obvious. Jokingly I remarked that it would have been funny if my son had said ohhh as well.

My son is 14 years old and at his age insinuating that he might be gay is a big deal to him. His friend was in the car as well and I could see that my son was embarrassed by my comment so I tried to rectify it.  It just went downhill from there.

Without thinking I said 
'I'm kidding, I know you're not gay because I've seen your porn search history' 

His eyes widened and I should have stopped there but I just kept digging myself into a bigger hole.
‘I saw that you like big breasts, so you are clearly not gay’ 

My son cringed, so once again trying to fix it... 
‘Its ok sweetie, you don’t have to be embarrassed, everyone watches porn, even mommy has a porn stash’. 
By this point he was visibly upset and my last attempt to rescue the situation was 
‘Baby it’s fine, I will show you my porn’ 


By this point I realized that it would be better if I just kept quiet.
We drove the rest of the way in silence.
