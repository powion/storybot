My nephew Daniel is 3 years old, diagnosed with Down Syndrome, and hadn't said a word before last week. My brother and his wife have been taking him to speech therapy, but to no avail. 

Well, the stars aligned such that they were both working and, after going through all the in-laws and siblings, they chose me to take the little tyke to his appointment. 

On the way to the therapist's office, I notice a car pulling up to the street from a parking lot and think nothing of it. Lots of folks try to pull out onto the road at the first opportunity. No big deal... until the guy decides there's enough of an opening in front of me for him to get in. "Shit! Shit! Shit!" I yelled as I slammed on the brakes and swerved. Somehow we don't hit the guy, nor does the woman in the other lane hit me.

So heart's beating a little fast, and I'm nervous that I've scared Daniel. "How ya doing, big fella?" And that's when Daniel decided to talk. His first words. It was actually a little song.

*OOooh shit shit shit shit*

*ooOOoh shit shit shit shit*

*Oh shit shit shit shit*

*Oooh shit shit shit shit*

*OOoh shit shit shit shit*

*OOooh shit shit shit shit.*

I'm frantic. How do I keep the fact that his first word is a song of Shit from both the therapist and his parents? I mean, I'm proud of the little guy for talking, but geez, they're going to have my head!

Well, we get to the office, my heart's racing, and the therapist is a pro. She comes out of her office, kneels down to his level, and asks, "Hi Daniel, how do you feel today?" And my heart sank as Daniel performed an encore of his hit single, "Oh Shit."

*OOooh shit shit shit shit*

*ooOOoh shit shit shit shit*

*Oh shit shit shit shit*

*Oooh shit shit shit shit*

*OOoh shit shit shit shit*

*OOooh shit shit shit shit.*

I have no idea where he got this tune, but the lyrics clearly came from me. I'm panic-stricken. Dumbfounded. Thoroughly embarrassed. The therapist? She never misses a beat. "I see that you're talking now! That's great, Daniel!" And she took his hand and they walked back into the office/ playroom. What a pro.

My sister-in-law still isn't speaking to me.

Edit: I have sent /u/ThePeoplesBard the gist of the tune. Hopefully he'll come through a recording of his version soon. I'll edit the OP with a link when he does.

Edit 2: /u/ThePeoplesBard delivers! Thanks, friend! http://clyp.it/45w20e0o

Edit 3: And now my gold is ended. What a wild, wild ride guys. Thanks for the party that is reddit gold.
