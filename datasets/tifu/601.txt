I was watching movies with my boyfriend after he had gotten off of a long day at work.  He fell asleep while watching the movie.  I decided that I would take this opportunity to be spontaneous and sexy for him.  I started undoing his belt and he did not stir at all.  I kept going, undoing his button and zipper.  He was out cold.  I decided that this seemed way more rapey that I was comfortable with.   After I undid his pants, I just left them.  In the middle of the movie, I decided to go get a glass of water and disappeared for a little bit.  My boyfriend happened to wake up in the two minutes I was gone.  He freaked out.  He thought he had proceeded to undo his pants in his sleep which led to even more questions of why and what happened.  I came back to him wide awake looking like he had committed a murder. 

tl;dr Boyfriend thought he scared me away by furiously jacking off in his sleep. 


edit: Well, shit.  Everyone is saying that it's not rape. I know. He was just really tired and I thought I'd let him sleep because clearly he was old cold. Dude woke up to some hot pizza instead.
