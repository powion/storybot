Sooo...roughly a year ago I was about to take a shower when I decided I wanted to listen to some music to make the mundane process more pleasant. I had already disrobed, so I walked my naked self into the living room to retrieve the computer. My wife was lying between the computer and me, on the floor, face-up, playing with our dog Bert. So I stepped around her, got the computer, then turned to head back to the bathroom. 

Only this time instead of stepping around her, I thought it would be a lark if I pretended to teabag her as I walked by...you know, stand over her and squat a few inches then stop. We'd both share a good laugh at the thought of me tapping her chin with my scrote. You know, something all good husbands do! 

So I walk back over, stand over her face, bend a few inches at the knee--

-- and I tear my quadriceps tendon. 

EDIT: Thanks for the first gold ever, guys! And for taking my dumb ass to the front page :D
