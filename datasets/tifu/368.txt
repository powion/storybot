This happened yesterday.

My husband downloaded the water your body app and has been working towards tracking his health. He has been trying to get me to download the app for a few days, but I kept forgetting. So last night I finally got it on my phone, and today I was hoping to impress my husband with my dedication by reaching my goal on water consumption, 206 ounces. 

I am drinking water what seems like constantly, and check my progress half way through the day. It was only at 26%. I persist and drink more water. We had a tax return appointment that was so agonizing as my bladder was full for the whole hour, most relieving piss of my life. 

By the end of the day I lost count of how many times I used the bathroom. There was one time I peed, then almost immediately had to pee again.

In the evening we compare each other's goal percent and mine was barely over 50%. Wtf, how would I be able to drink twice as much without pissing myself I thought. I ask my husband what his goal amount of water is and its a little over 100 ounces. How could mine be 206? I check my settings and turns out I somehow entered 406 pounds as my weight. No wonder I had to pee so much today! And good news! I reached my goal and then some. 126%!

TLDR: Excuse me while I use the restroom.
