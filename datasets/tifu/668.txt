On New Year's Eve 2012, my girlfriend of six months and I were about to leave her parents house to go to Boston. Her parents were about to go Cape Cod. It's important to note that her Dad didn't like me yet for no reason other than I was banging his daughter.

I take a quick poop upstairs before we all leave. Clogged it. I re-flushed in hopes it would work the second time. The water overflows all over the wooden floor. I frantically start cleaning it up with a couple towels when I hear my girlfriend scream from the kitchen directly under me, "Mom! Water is coming through the light fixtures!" They all rush upstairs and GF's mom asks to be let in to help me. I open the door to the scene of a flooded floor and one pathetic nugget swirling around in the top of the bowl. The worst part was her sweetheart mother (who is a nurse) insisted on cleaning it up. Her Dad escaped to the car without saying a word to anyone. 

We're still together. Her dad likes me now.

EDIT: I know I should have turned the water valve off but I panicked. If I was on home turf I would have averted this crisis.
