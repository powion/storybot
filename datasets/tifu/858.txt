Obligatory "this wasn't today" post. It was last Saturday, and my friends presented me with the question,"Hey xXC0DExSILV3RXx, what does a vagina feel like?" 

Rather than trying to explain a whole new concept to my friends, I decided to relate it to something we all know and love... Or so I thought.

I responded with,"Do you know when you feel your butthole..." The room went silent. After a short pause, I was met with resounding laughter. Various "WHAT!" and "HUH?" sounds ensued. Turns out, not everyone has felt their own buttholes before. From what I've recently learned, nobody I know has ever felt their butthole. Now everyone at school calls me "Finger Popper" and "The Butthole Kid." Not just the guys I told, but EVERYONE. Fuck my life, and not in the butthole.
