So I have back and neck problems and often will ice my neck with ice packs and such. Well last night I couldn't find our ice packs and was too lazy to make my own so I grabbed a frozen bag of peas. I settled into bed with it on my neck. 
I fell asleep like that and woke up hours later laying on top of the smashed bag of peas and my bed soaked in pea juice all the way down into the mattress. 

TL;DR I pead my bed.
