Before I begin, it was about 12 years ago, and 1,000,000 % an accident.

I was a gangly teenager, 6' tall and 140lb. Size 12 shoe.

I had just gotten a new puppy - a miniature dachshund. Well, my dad did. I was bringing my laundry from the basement, and had the basket in front of me. The dog, all 1lb of him, apparently followed me down the stairs, or at least 2 of them.

I didn't see him. My canoe-sized right foot stepped on that poor puppy. I crushed him.

I was distraught. I actually called 911. I didn't know what to do.
The cops came. The paramedics came. The Fire Dept came. After about an hour, they calmed me down. There were grown men crying because the scene was so fucking tragic. They tried CPR on the dog for 10 minutes, but I crushed this dog, so it didn't work.

The first responders took up a collection, and 2 weeks later, went back to the same breeder to get the puppies sister - the last of the litter. When the breeder found out, she drove over to my dad's house and dropped the new puppy off. Free of charge.

Horrible experience.

Edit:  Just remembered, that when my dad came home, the firemen had already gone into the garage, gotten a shovel, and were in the process of digging the hole to bury the dog. Above and beyond there.
