This happened a couple of months ago. 

While in the midst of having sex, we get the idea of me being blindfolded and my hands tied while she rides me. It feels amazing and, at the same, feel *incredibly* comfortable. Just laying down, enjoying it all, head resting on a pillow, unaware of how suddenly drowsy I felt. Slowly drifting aware without noticing.

All of a sudden...

**SNAP**

She *rips* the condom right off. This immediately gets my attention, as you can imagine.

"**YOU FELL ASLEEP WHILE WE WERE HAVING SEX!!!**"

"I... *did*??"

"Yes, I must be that bad, huh?"

"Wait, really? What, no!!"

Should be noted she was moderately insecure.

"Yeah, while I was riding you, *you started snoring*!"

"....uh^I^really^did^that?"

"And then I asked '*Are you sleeping??*' before ripping it off!"

"Oh^my^God,^I'm^so,^so^sorry!!"

Cue me re-assuring her for the next 30 or so minutes convincing her she wasn't bad at all and I just was really, *really* comfortable .

Edit: Achieved gold status. I think I won the game.
Thanks for enjoying this.
