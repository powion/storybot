Like most TIFUs this happened a few years back. 

I was at a free clinic for women to get a physical exam. They basically only check to see if you have scoliosis or not and clear you for all physical activity. After filling out my paperwork and waiting in line for about 4 hours, I was finally granted my five free minutes in the office. 

I sat on the table in my t-shirt and shorts and smiled politely as the old man with the stethoscope entered. He bluntly asked "Please, show me your form." To which I replied by sitting up as straight as I could on the table. He looked at me, and again he said "miss, I need to see your form." Slightly frustrated, I sat up even straighter. When he again said nothing, I asked "How do you want to see my form? Sitting down? Standing?" 

At this point the doctor is staring at me with a look of mass confusion. He asked me yet again to see my form and in a flustered panic, I took off my shirt and stood there in his office, showing off my perfect form. The doctor proceeded to burst out in laughter and through his cackling squeezed out the words "Your papers! I just wanted to see your papers." 

He told me in his 30 years of working that clinic, a girl had never stripped for him when he asked to see her form. I never went back. Moral of the stories, if they ask to see your form, they probably just want to see your paperwork.
