Being a college freshman I've been mercilessly studying for finals trying to cram as much information as I can. Now usually I don't believe in performance enhancing drugs but feeling overwhelmed I decide that the best possible solution to get the most studying is to pop an adderall first thing the next morning.  My roommate as an assortment of perscription drugs in his dresser and he says I could have one. After some late night studying I hope into bed at around 2am. I wake up at 7, stumble out of bed half asleep, grab a pill from his dresser, and grab some breakfast. I start eating waiting for the drugs to kick in, expecting to feel something. About halfway into my egg sandwich, i start to feel it. Unfortunately it wasn't hawk like focus you would imagine getting in an adderall. No it was more like the largest boner I ever had in my life. Then it hits me... 



*oh fuck I took one of my roommate's viagra.*



I don't know why my roommate has viagra but it sure does work. Try studying for finals not being able to focus **and** with a four hour erection



TL;DR Tried studying for finals, ended being the hardest day of my life.

Edit: My roommate told me they were the pills loose in his drawer, me not knowing what the difference in pills were just took the first one I grabbed, yes I'm stupid, I get it. Also it deflated on its own in four hours, if it lasted any longer I would have called a doctor.

Edit 2: Wow first front page thanks! You can call this story "bullshit" or "fake" all you want but my dick begs to differ.
