This girl texted me the other day and I was reminded of my huge fuckup on our first date, which was about a year ago.

So I know her from highschool in our hometown, but I hadn't seen her for 5 years. I saw her working in a bar, we talked a little and exchanged phone numbers. Few weeks later we planned our date, which was at 22.00 but we hadn't decided on the location yet. The day of our date the fuckup began..

She texted me that morning saying :"You should really know I had a huge crush on you five years ago..". I kind of freaked out and didnt know how to react. I was hanging out with some friends of mine when she called me to ask where we were going to meet. Having set the location, I hung up the phone and told my buddies about the text I had recieved that morning. One of them told me I was definitely getting laid that night, that I should take advantage of the situation. Some typical drunken male trashtalking ensued. I told them there was a thin line between taking advantage and being taken advantage of, and left for the date.

So it's 22.00 and she isnt there. 22.15, still no one. At 22.30 she walked in and acted super cold. She didnt order a drink and was obviously not willing to have a normal conversation. After ten minutes she asked: "So who are you going to take adventage of tonight?"

Turns out I didn't hang up the phone when I meant to and she heard everything. EVERYTHING.

TLDR; Didnt hang up the phone when I meant to and my date overheard me and my friends trashtalking about me getting some tonight. Didnt get any.
