So the obligatory this didn't actually happen today, but Tuesday.

Our kids finally went back to school after the break, and we had the house to ourselves. Husband was doing paperwork online before going in to work. He came out into the living room to talk with me.
I decided I'd try and be playful and take advantage of the empty house. I crawled seductively across the room to try and get him to play. Well, what I forgot is, that it's winter and there's absolutely no humidity. So static everywhere. Once I got to him, I was kneeling and he bent down to kiss me. I thought "Hell yeah! I am a goddess and this is going to be awesome!" I mean, we haven't had sex out of our room, let alone during daylight hours for over 3 weeks because of the kids always being around.

As he bent down, his nose brushed mine. All of that charge I built up crawling across the room then jumped from me to him and went up through his eye! He said he actually saw the flash! The pain abruptly ended any desire right then and there. And not only that, it caused his eye to twitch for the rest of the morning.

TLDR: I tried to seduce husband by crawling across the floor, but instead shocked him so bad that he was left with a twitching eye and no desire for sex.
