OK reddit, unlike other stories this happened TODAY! like a few hours ago. Grammar sucks, I'm sorry. So I live in the great state of Texas, where everybody and their mother has guns. So I've been wanting a go-pro for a while and was a little short on cash so I decided to sell one of my guns and go buy my gopro. Anywho I find a buyer and decide to meet up at a local chicken place parking lot. Cool. I get to the parking lot of the place and see two gentlemen in a vehicle and they look like they're waiting for something, cool I found the buyer. I pull next to the driver side and get off my truck and look at the driver and say hello. He replies and says hello as well. Ok, so this whole time I'm thinking he's buying the gun so I open my back door and proceed to pull out my gun. The look of horror on this guys face as I try to hand the gun over to him and jokingly said go ahead and try 'er out there's a round in the chamber (was a joke chamber and tube were empty) Ok... so now the passenger is studdering something and the driver is just staring at me with his mouth open. So i asked you got the money right? then BOOM it clicked! I got the wrong GUY! shit shit shit I said I was sorry and noped the hell outta there. eventually the guy  who was gonna buy the gun called me telling me that he saw the whole thing happened and gave me an extra $5 for a giving him a good laugh.

Edit 1: gun was empty people
