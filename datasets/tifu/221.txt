Let me start off by saying for someone who is in their early 20's, I know basically nothing about computers. I know how to google things, download shit and watch porn, but compared to my 60 year old father I am Mr. Robot. You should also know that my Father loves printing shit. He probably loves printing shit more than he loves me. He probably loves printing even more than the dog I know he loves more than me. He is also extremely technologically challenged. Though, I don't blame him for not grasping modern technology, he is of the generation that didn't have a computer in front of them their entire lives. So, whenever he is having trouble with "that plastic piece of shit" he looks at me like I am a test tube baby formed from the DNA of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and I offer my technical savant abilities... 

&amp;nbsp;

It all started when I hear him sputtering away to himself about the computer "being the shits at printing" and "Lord Fuck! Google is fuckin' slow today". I ask him what the problem is and he says that Google is very slow today and he can't print something if he can't Google it. I don't bother to try to explain that the Google search engine relies on the Internet connection for it's speed and that it's just the Wi-Fi that is slow as it never sinks in. He gets up and offers me the chair and asks me to try and fix the laptop before "it meets it's maker" to which I reply "who? SumTing Wong?". He tells me that's racist and goes outside for a smoke. When he comes back in, I've got the internet network set to that of the previously shut off range extender that he always manages to turn off when vacuuming and it has significantly improved the speed. I also have the Window 10 upgrade in process... 

&amp;nbsp;

So everything is fine the upgrade is doing something, but you can still use your computer while it is getting ready and he gets back to printing the dictionary or whatever it is that he does. After a while he goes to his bedroom and starts yelling at the news and I take this opportunity to finish installing Windows 10. It begins and it looks like it is going to take a while so I head over to my buddy's house. I come back later to find the laptop on the floor, the printer in the sink and a brand new laptop on the desk in place of the old one. WTF.

&amp;nbsp;

Apparently, while I was gone Windows 10 started and my Dad attempted to get on the computer. It clearly didn't work out too well based on what I discovered. When I asked him about it he just said "that was a piece of junk, when I went to log on it had a virus, it was hacked, I couldn't print anything." He also breifly explained how a hacker named Cortana was taunting him so he threw the laptop on the floor and went and bought a new one... He asks me if I could set up the printer to the new laptop (which I am pretty sure came with Windows 10...) Instead, I picked the old laptop (miraculously still working) up off the floor, put it on the desk, connected the printer and restored it to Windows 7. I brought the new computer he had bought back to the store and gave him the money back. We haven't really discussed the days events yet, but I can't wait until it's not too soon to tease him about Cortana the hacker and to ask him why the printer was in the sink. We did manage to accomplish something today though, Google is a little bit faster now because of our range extender. You're welcome for the speed bump Google.

TL;DR otherwise reasonable 60 year old man gets angry at computer for taunting him, throws it on the ground
