This happened about 30 minutes ago.

I've been living in Asia for about two years now and during this time I've avoided doing "number two" in public restrooms that don't have sit down toilets.

For those of you unfamiliar with the alternative, it's basically a porcelain hole in the ground with a foot enabled flusher. These are very popular here but growing up in America left me without any crouch-poop training.

Well today the inevitable happened. While taking my father in law to the ER and waiting for hours I found myself in a bad situation. Diharrea. I could feel it coming.

You know how you test the waters by pushing just a little bit to see if it feels like an explosion waiting to happen? I pushed just enough to arrive at my anus and I could feel the cannons loading, full blast was approaching.

I walked myself into the bathroom, took a squat and let loose a fierce stream of poo. Unfortunately I missed the hole on the floor entirely, instead coating the wall and flusher with my failure.


TLDR: I chocolate rained all over the flusher.

Edit: and there goes my inbox, thanks for making my day!

Edit2: Thanks for the gold, you're awesome.
