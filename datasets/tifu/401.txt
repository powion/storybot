2 Edit 2 Furious: [*OP delivers*](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3a0z1g/tifupdate_on_forgetting_my_trousers_for_an_exam/)

As you may or may not be aware, it's exam season here in the UK, and us year 13s (grade 12s, to translate) are off school, permanently, unless we have to be on-site for an actual paper.

Today (yes, today, bonus points) was chemistry, unit 5. Transition metals and nitrogen chemistry, tricky stuff.  
Sadly, my fuck-up has nothing to do with benzenesulfonic acid.

A little backstory: I've been cycling a lot recently (shout out to /r/bicycling), and I recently managed to get to and from my school 10 miles away. I decided cycling to school *for my exam* would be a fun thing to do.

I wasn't late, if that's what you're thinking.

I slung my school clothes over the back of my chair in the morning, got into my biking stuff, had seven cups of coffee, stared blankly at the past paper I'd left out to do in the morning, and browsed /r/spaceporn for a bit.

The 46-minute bike ride was hot, sweaty, and invigorating (much like my weekends /s), so I arrived knackered, but in high spirits.

Ordering a fifteenth cup of coffee, I moved myself into one of the toilet cubicles to have a [Lynx](http://images-its.chemistdirect.co.uk/lynx-apollo-xl-deodorant-bodyspray.jpg?q=95&amp;o=Mi9rBG4GLTPI4Llta8tCU%40rZfkwj&amp;V=aQCk&amp;w=800&amp;h=800) shower and change into my suit.

No suit trousers.  
*Shit.*

To cut what is already a long story short, I ended up having to do the exam in a black suit jacket, shirt and tie, smart shoes, and black cycling shorts.

I am currently waiting on a photo that one of my teachers took on his iPhone between breaths of laughter, so I'll post that if this gets any form of attention.

TL;DR: You know the nightmare you have of forgetting your trousers when you go to school? That happened.

Edit: I can't believe this got to the front page. Cliche, I know, but in the midst of exam stress, this has really put a smile on my face! I'd like to [especially](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/39xio9/tifu_by_cycling_to_school/cs7k45g) thank /u/Arathorth, and everyone else who took the time to comment!

Onto the stuff you *want* to hear.

The photo was taken by one of my heads of year, while the other one was laughing his head off after I walked into their office and said "I've made a terrible mistake". I've emailed him and asked for the photo, and sent him a link to this post for good measure, but I don't expect a reply till tomorrow. I'll update here and probably make another post just for good measure (I don't get any karma from this, sadly...)  
*OP will deliver!!*

I'm saying this all now because I'm going off to bed. I have OCR Electronics tomorrow morning, so I need my shut-eye.  
As my parting gift, [here is a video someone made about this exact chemistry paper last year.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgPtLxbsFTc)

Thanks for being awesome, reddit!
