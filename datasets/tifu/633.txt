Throwaway account for shame...
Let me preface this story with the fact that we are currently potty training my preschool daughter. She almost has it down, but usually requires either my husband or myself to stand by the door to watch. This week, we have been working so hard to break her of the habit, and for the past few days has been going by herself. 

My periods are usually pretty heavy. I realized I had waited too long to take out a tampon when I went to pee, and it slid out in all of its bloody glory straight into the toilet. My dad constantly lectured me growing up about making sure I never flush any feminine hygiene products into the toilet, so naturally, I panicked and decided to reach in to get it. My hand clenched down on the bloody tampon, and I quickly pulled it out of the murky water. Only it wasn't a tampon. It was a big ol' unflushed preschooler turd log. In my haste to grab the tampon, I had put a master grip on that turd, and it was squishing through my fingers. Super grossed out, I quickly chucked what I could of the turd back into the toilet only to realize I still hadn't retrieved the tampon. In what had to be the least fun game of fishing, I re-thrusted my hand back into the toilet, and splashed around haphazardly looking for the hidden string. After an eternity, I triumphantly grabbed the tampon string, only to realize that I was triumphantly grabbing a tampon string. 
TLDR: My hands will never be clean again
