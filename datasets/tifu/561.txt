So tonight the wife made Italian lasagna with garlic bread, it was delicious to the last bite. 2 large glasses of milk to wash it all down and I was ready to pass out for the night. I had just fed the puppy and she was finishing up her food as I plopped down onto the couch. I was laying facing towards the couch when I felt the burn and the pressure building, the compilation of smelly foods that I had devoured an hour ago was already sending it's own "kaiju" in the Pacific rim sense, toward the portal to our world in my nether regions.
Upon releasing my flatulence, I could tell it was a particularly foul smelling concoction as it literally burned when it passed through the poop shoot canal. I had not realized my dog had come over to see what the loud crack of noise was and decided on saying hello to me while she was there.
I rolled over to see the final seconds of a face of complete and utter terror. I burst out laughing hilariously while  apologizing to her but she was frozen in place. I don't think anything could have ever prepared her for what she just had experienced.
She eventually started to walk away and I rolled back over to rest and then I heard her retch. She puked everywhere on the area rug that my wife bought a few years ago. Guess she couldn't handle the dutch oven she stuck her nose into any longer and just lost control of the dinner she just had.

Tldr: farted on my dog on accident, laughed histerically, turned around, and she threw up all over the rug from what I can only determine to be the smell of halfway digested lasagna.
