There was a nor'easter in my area last night. For those of you not from New England, that means high winds and lots of precipitation. Usually, these storms come with snow, but this time it's rain.

Because of the time of year, there were lots of clogged drains and sewers because of all the leaves. Because of the wind electricity was out in some areas and very few of the traffic lights were fully operational (the were mostly blinking yellow or red.)

My GPS app (waze) told me to take some back roads since the highway I usually go on was backed up, most likely due to flooding. 

Lots of roads are blocked off with police barriers or just jammed because of the traffic lights not working. I get rerouted to a road with a big puddle. I didn't know how big it was but some cars were driving through it, so I thought I could too.

Half way down the street the water is getting deeper, I'm committed now. I don't stop, I pictured myself a pioneer on the Oregon Trail attempting to ford the river. 

Much like the Orgegon Trail game, something goes wrong. The car stalls, water starts seeping in through the floor and doors. Luckily I waved down a truck behind me and got him to push me out into a parking lot. 

The tow truck came and the driver confirmed the car hydrolocked. The car will probably be totaled when the insurance adjusted comes to see it next Monday. 

I got to walk in the rain to the train station to get to work. I'm cold and soaking wet and probably need a new car. Not a great start to my birthday, but I get to post on /r/TIFU, so I got that going for me.
