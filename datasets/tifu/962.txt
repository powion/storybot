I am in a fairly new relationship with a girl who speaks English as her third language. She speaks English very well, but sometimes there are words that she mixes up from time to time. 

We decided to go on a group vacation with some friends, and we had a room to ourselves. We previously had sex a few times, but we were just starting to get into the "what do you like to do during sex?" phase. She told me that she really enjoyed the man being rough with her during sex. I told her I had no issues with that, and wanted to know how rough she liked for the man to get. She said that she really enjoyed being held down, hair pulled, slapped, etc. I agreed to try these things with her the next time. 

So fast forward to later that night. We are having sex, and I reach up and slapped her in the face. Nothing too hard, but enough to hurt for sure. She had somewhat of a shocked look on her face, but I felt like it was all apart of the act, so I reached up and slapped her a second time a little harder. She stops and asks "What are you doing?" I said "Slapping you like you asked" and she replied with "No, the slapping on the ass!" "Do you mean spank?" "YES! Spanking! Not slapping!" 

She was incredibly understanding, but I still couldn't help but feel bad about what I did.
