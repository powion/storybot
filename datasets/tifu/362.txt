TIFU by cussing out a telemarketer.

**bzzzzt** ... **bzzzzt** ... *ring ring*

As is often the case when I hear that *particular* ringtone for unknown numbers I pause to consider what I might possibly say to whomever I discover on the other end.  Typically I will be greeted with utter silence or the tell-tale click of a robo-dialer dropping the call, but I always steel myself for the possibility of genuine human speech uttered in response to my...

• Me: "Hello?"

• Phone: "***DO YOU WANT TO MAKE MONEY FROM HOME?!?!?!  MORE MONEY THAN YOU HAVE EVER SEEN IN YOUR ___LIFE___?!?!??!?!***"

Dammit.  It's a recorded message, and it was LOUD.  Those aren't nearly as fun because you don't get to cuss anyone.  For the most part I have learned that the only way to stop them from calling back is to wait until they finish their speech and get to the part where you can...

• Phone: "***PRESS 1 FOR MORE INFORMATION!!!!!***  (or press 9 to be removed from our list)"

• Me: Presses 9.

• Phone: "***THANK YOU FOR SIGNING UP!***  Someone will be calling you real soon!"

• Me: "You son of a bitch."

• Phone: "*click*"

It takes a lot to piss me off.  It really does!  There's very few things that make me want to punch faces in this world and this sort of thing ranks right up there... ~~just above sloths.~~  This put me in mind of that ol' classic "Cat Facts" prank.  Still, maybe they just got their wires crossed.  I highly doubt that my phone was going to...

**bzzzzt** ... **bzzzzt** ... *ring ring*

• Me: "Hello?"

• Phone: "Thanks for telling us you wanted MORE INFORMATION about this great offer!!!  My name is Mike and I want to ..." Blah blah blah... "Write down my number in case you have any questions!  That number is xxx-xxx-xxxx!!!"

• Me: "*click*"

Okay....  So now I have this piece of shit's *actual* phone number.  Time to teach him a lesson.

• Me: ... Dialing ... waiting ... Ringing!!!

• Phone: "Leave a message! ***BEEP!***"

• Me: "Hey Mike!  Guess what you can do?  You can eat my *actual* asshole!  That's right!  It's covered with fresh chocolate frosting, too!!!  It might taste a little strange at first, but you'll get used to it...  ***YOUR MOM DID!*** *click*"

Haha.  Yeah, I sure showed that guy, didn't I.  Just a little harmless fun, after all.

Right?

**bzzzzt** ... **bzzzzt** ... *ring ring*

• Me: "Hello?"

• Random Dude : "Yeah, did I just miss a call from you?"

• Me: Check the number... not the one I just called... "No, sorry.  Wasn't me."

• Random Dude : "Oh, okay then.  Bye." *click*

**bzzzzt** ... **bzzzzt** ... *ring ring*

• Me: "Hello?"

• Random Chick : "WHO IS THIS?"

• Me: "Excuse me?"

• Random Chick : "WHO IS THIS?  WHY YOU BE CALLIN MY PHONE?  TAKE ME OFF YO LIST." *click*

Oh shit...  A little light bulb just popped on over my ...

**bzzzzt** ... **bzzzzt** ... *ring ring*

• Me: "Hello?"

• Random Chick : "Did I just miss a call from you?"

***Mother.  Fucker.***

Over the course of the next 4 hours my phone was bombarded with calls from irate people wanting to be taken off the list.  It was NUTS.  HUNDREDS of calls.  Text Messages.  My voicemail box was destroyed.

***That bastard changed the number Caller ID shows to give people MY NUMBER INSTEAD.***  Pissed off doesn't begin to describe how I felt.  Fortunately that phone number was one I only used for close family, so it was a trivial matter to change it, but still.

So, yeah...  He got me good.

TL;DR - I left a choice message on a telemarketers voicemail.  He made me his bitch.
