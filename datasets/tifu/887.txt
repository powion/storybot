I'm an intern right now and have quick a long bus commute to work. We changed office buildings yesterday into a much nicer tower and today I dressed a little nicer than usual for it. This involves a pencil skirt (problem 1).

I'm running a bit late and tried to jump down the steps off the porch to save time, I ended up having to catch myself in a tiger pose and heard a small rip tear the back of my skirt. I didn't have time to change so I quickly put a safety pin in and decided I'd fix it in the bathroom. Big mistake.

So I barely make the bus and get a window seat. An older man was behind me and shuffled in right next to me. I should preface that I was wearing big, over-the-ear headphones and couldn't hear much else. So I sit down and suddenly feel a sharp, piercing pain on my vaginal folds. Like all the way in there. I let out a scream, that was much louder than I realized what with my headphones, and the entire bus turns to stare at me. I readjust so that the head of the pin is no longer in my skin, and sit back down, trying to lessen the scene.

I'm still in a ton of pain but figure it's just a sensitive area. About halfway through my ride the man next to me stands up to get off and I notice a red stain on the corner of his jacket that was next to me. Horrified, I inch my ass off the seat and realize I'm sitting in a small pool of blood that has soaked through and ruined my skirt and is covering the seat. 

Now, I'm used to bleeding down there, but something about this being real blood made my stomach queazy. Got off the bus immediately and called in sick. Not today.

Tl;dr I safety pinned my vagina and bled on a bus and an old dude.
