This literally happened 15 mins ago, I'm still slightly traumatised. To give just a bit of background, I'm a 17 year old male, and live with my sister who is a couple years older than me, and parents of course. 
I have this strange habit that occurs subconsciously whenever I feel the need to go to the bathroom. When I'm alone, I'll casually whip out the d as I'm walking towards the bathroom, and as soon as I reach the toilet I let loose. Easy peasy, I'm in and out of there in like 10 seconds. Usually this isn't a problem, if I notice anyone around I simply do what any other civilised human being would do and not unleash my genitals. 
Today I was watching a video on my phone so I had earphones in. On my journey to the bathroom, I was giggling like a little girl so I didn't realise my sister was already sitting on the toilet as I walked in. Why the door wasn't fucking closed I will never fucking know. As I stroll in (with phone in one hand and dick in other mind you) I hear a voice say "Sorry I'm in..." which then cuts off. Slowly I look up from my phone. I swear if you saw her face it would be like I killed someone, though a part of her probably died so yeah. 
I got the absolute fuck out of there, and here I am in bed, watching Netflix and writing this. I'm not getting up after that traumatising experience. 
TL;DR Had to take a leak, instead showed my sister my flaccid ding dong.
