we have been dating for 6 years and practically married.this happened a bit ago.  i've wanted to put some distance from the event, because you never know who's a redditor out there.  the company i worked for was an advertising company.  so needless to say, their website consisted of posting all of their work.  about a hundred or so video files.  and it was my job to convert them and put them up on the website.  here's where it gets a little tricky.  the website was hosted via a server that we also used to send out clients works-in-progress.  problem is, i was new and didn't know that.  i assumed the website linked back to some other server, not the server we regularly deleted media off of (via ftp).  in case you don't see where this is going, i had to free up space on the server via an ftp.  so i selected a bunch of files and hit delete.  then i see it.  a folder marked website.  and then it was gone.  my pulse starts to race; i can feel the color drain from my face.  i go to the website and start clicking around.  it's all gone.  every file.  just a quicktime symbol with a line through it.  even worse, i found out we didn't have back-ups for any of it, and this was work going back to when the company started 10 years ago.   when i say back-ups, i mean the converted files.  the files needed to be a certain size, codec, etc to play on the website.  i couldn't just put them up there raw.  also, they were scattered around in the archives.  also, they each had specific html code that linked them to the site that i didn't know.  long story short, i spent the next week covertly converting and resorting the entire website.  no one ever found out, but there was a very close call when the owner of the company brought up the site in a meeting with a client.  luckily he clicked on one of the only files i managed to restore at that point.  i spent that entire week horribly anxious, not sleeping well.  tl;dr: didn't know our company was hosting their site off a server we used via ftp to send clients materials. deleted the content, and spent the entire week fixing it.  edit for clarification:  i knew that the video files were on the server, but i was only told to put them there to send to the web designer.  i had absolutely no idea he was hosting off our server (meaning all of the video files on the website linked back solely to the ftp), which made little to no sense to me.  therefore, i didn't think anything of quickly deleting files off the ftp we normally deleted from.  edit 2: we were not a web design company, so i don't know anything about web design.  i merely was tasked with creating/converting the files and sending them.  we outsourced the task of web design to a particularly inept individual.  ***edit 3:the website was set up by an outsourced web designer not affiliated with the company.  i don't know where the website itself ran from.  for the videos however,  they were instructed to put all of the video files into a single folder on a server via the ftp.  he linked directly to that folder for all the videos.  this was not my design, this was someone else's.***  **edit 4: ok, now i see why everyone's having a problem with this post.  you have to understand, we just called it "the ftp", meaning we were uploading to a server via an ftp (transmit).  so when i say we threw it up "on the ftp" it means we used transmit to upload the files to a folder on a server.  there.  that should clear things up.  sorry for the massive confusion.**  (fixed instances of this in the post)  edit 5:  the video files for the website were in the same location as the places we put the videos we sent to clients.  they were in a separate folder, yes, but still in the same location.  we were always scrambling for server space, so we would have to delete things here to make room.  this particular day i was being hounded by my boss to make room very quickly.  so i just selected a bunch of items for delete, not knowing at all that the videos for our website were housed there as well until it was too late.  it was common practice to delete things from there, except nobody gave me the heads-up there was anything to avoid.  we only used the ftp to transmit files, so while i had transmitted website files before, i thought it was simply a transference, not that they were being hosted from that server as well.)my friend was complaining how bad fallout 4 looked on her ps4. i jokingly told her that she should plug her **galaxy s6** to upgrade the graphics and i even showed her a video how the ps4 can use the hardware of a smartphone to improve performance/graphics. she believed it and told me she'll try it soon.    i was internally laughing about the silliness of the situation, on my way out i told her "don't forget to charge your phone in the microwave first for 1 minute before plugging it in your ps4, google it if you don't believe me!". i left while having a laugh, thinking that she'd figure out its all bs, i mean the microwave your **iphone** thing... everyone knows that!    4 hours later (about 30 minutes ago), i got a phone call from her brother telling me the said friend "cooked" her phone and she is yelling like a banshee that she will murder me.    i switched off my phone, i logged out of everything on my pc...    guys... i am terrified...i'm home from college for winter break, and this fuck up starts november first, when i started growing the dirtiest, scraggliest beard for no-shave-november and deciding to rock it as well as not cut my hair for a couple months...because why not? basically i look [this fucking guy](http://i.imgur.com/y1igjq1.jpg).   well my mother was busy so she told me to go pick up my little brother from school. i hopped in the car and drove to his middle school, and pulled up in the line of cars where parents wait to pick up their kids. apparently there's a new system because i didn't see a guy directing cars when to move and i accidentally cut off a school bus that was trying to get past. the guy came over and knocked on my window and said "first time? we take turns here, sir. you have to wait for my signal."   so whatever, i stay in line and kids come out and their parents take them away. i didn't bring my phone because he usually comes out right away and i thought i'd be home in five minutes. ten minutes pass. where is this guy? fifteen minutes. dafuq is he doing? twenty minutes. by this point i'm straight staring at the front door watching all these other kids come out. i can't even text my brother. now the security guy from before seems to be watching me closely, and so are a few of the other teachers waiting inside to make sure all the kids make it home safely. and i'm staring back at them like don't hate me cuz i'm beardiful.   then it hits me...my brother doesn't go to this fucking school anymore.  he was in eighth grade last year and is now a freshman in high school. i'm at the wrong fucking school. so i just...pull away and leave.  from their point of view, a haggard, bearded guy they had never seen before, who was coming to pick up a kid "for the first time," just waited in front of the school for half an hour, watched all the kids intently as they came out, had what must have been a frustrated look on his face, (i think i sighed a few times as i got more and more pissed at my brother being "late") and then just fucking left.  tl;dr: i can never go back to that school again  edit: not that i would ever have to...  edit 2: i've been narrated! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7np5mecxr2afor the past 6 months, my best friend has maintained an excel doc on his laptop to keep track of every time he masturbated. he did this at the insistence of his girlfriend.   when he confided this to me i couldn't believe it. but apparently 7 months prior she had caught him masturbating in his kitchen (which is weird i know) and got very angry and disturbed. she insisted that he keep a log of every time he masturbated.   so for 6 months he's had an excel doc listing every time he masturbates. it had the following columns: date, time, location, what i masturbated to (if online pornography, he had to include a hyperlink to the video), and notes.   so the other day my friend left his laptop open. he left, went out to get beer. i saw the excel logo on the bottom of his screen and  i wondered if it was his legendary masturbation log. it was. i had to peek!   then i go the idea to prank him. i knew his girlfriend reviewed the log at the end of every week. so i scrolled up a bit to make some edits to his entries from a few days ago, to make it look like he masturbated to some weird ass shit.   here are a few of the entries i inserted:   what i masturbated to: your friend ashley's facebook album of her at that beach in mexico. (included a url for the album.) notes: she's very sexy. i imagine her often when we make love.   what i masturbated to: youtube video of a mouse caught in a glue trap. (included url to vid)  notes: mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.   what i masturbated to: imagined what it would be like to have sex with a pig in a factory farm.  notes: first time fantasizing about beastiality, i am into it.   what i masturbated to: (just a link to a gay porn video, something with "cock" in the title)  notes: very nice.   and a few more things like that. saved the doc.   so i thought it was a pretty funny prank. well...turns out he never noticed the entries, she saw them, and she 100% thought that he entered them. apparently she absolutely refused to believe somebody pranked him and she was completely disgusted. crying and shouting, i hear. she thinks he's a complete pervo.   she broke up with him.   my friend is furious. but he has no idea it was me who did it. he constantly leaves his laptop open, he has a lot of people over, the entries were from earlier in the week.   i don't think he suspects me. but he's really angry and also down in the dumps about it. his now ex-girlfriend told her friends about his "sick fetishes" and obviously the rumors are starting to spread.   i want to admit it was a prank, but i won't. i feel so awful.   i am thinking of sending an anonymous email to her telling her it was a prank, but not revealing my identity.   tl;dr - tifu by accidentally getting my best friends girlfriend to break up with him when i, as a prank, edited his "masturbation log" excel doc that she forced him to maintain. it wasn't today but i mentioned it in a comment and some people wanted a story so here i go.  in high school one day i was waiting for my mom to pick me up because my car was in the shop, and while waiting i was really bored and picked up a leaf and was just fucking with it. at one point i rubbed it against a wall and some of the chlorophyll rubbed of and onto a the wall. i thought to my self "oh that's cool, i'm gonna make a square". a few seconds later, while i'm making my square the school cop runs up and grabs my arm and twists it behind my back and handcuffs me and throws me in his car, screaming at me while he does.  luckily my mother was there to get me already and when the cop told her i was about to go to jail for rubbing a leaf against a wall, she demanded we see the principal first to tell her why that's stupid.  we told her the circumstances, and how i had no malicious intent, that it was just a guy being fascinated by something he learned at school 3 years ago, my principal said and i quote "well you may know that was chlorophyll but some of our less academic minded students will see that and think they can write on walls, that's why we have to suspend you for writing graffiti"  tl:dr i thought science was cool and looked at chlorophyll, and got suspended because some kids don't pay attention in freshman biology.this happened a good long while ago now so not really today...   it was april when i started this journey. during the winter i became a member of a magic mushroom forum and was learning all i could about growing magic mushrooms. i tried it once before and grew only a yellowish green mush that smelled of sweaty socks but this time would be different. i had a spore print sent to me and was off to the races.   i had tried mushrooms once before about 10 years prior and the experience was rather enjoyable. i have had way too many bad experiences with lsd to ever think about trying it and from what i remembered the mushroom experience was much less chaotic and harsh for me than the majority of my acid trips had been. after following every tip i could gather and about a month and a half of waiting, i have viable mushrooms drying in the food dehydrator.   the whole journey, from spore print to fruit, was done for reasons i don’t yet have a great grasp on. i was thinking at the time that growing them would impart some spiritual meaning into my experience. it had been a long, long time since i had taken any illegal substance and i wanted it to be special in some way. growing them myself was an attempt at providing that, i guess.   the night i took them i really wasn’t planning on doing so. i was borde out of my wits and chatting with on-line friends. i told them i was going to eat my mushrooms but didn’t know how much to eat without a scale. i took a few pics of my intended dose and posted them and immediately got advice to cut that dose in half. so, with my wife asleep, i went down to the kitchen and made a concoction of purple slushy and powered mushrooms and gulped it down. i came back up and told the chatters that the deal was done and that i was taking shower and would be back once the fun started.    in the shower about 5 minutes when i felt a rush like i consciousness was being pulled away from my body. i was fighting to keep it with me. it felt as though is i had let it fly away i would have had a full out of body experience but for some reason i felt compelled hold on to it. i quickly turned off the water and looked down at my feet. they seemed miles away. that is when it hit me that the shrooms were kicking in!   out of the shower and i put on the same clothes i came in with and headed up stairs. the shower is in the basement of the house and there is a door at the top of the stairs. opening the door, the light from the kitchen blasted my eyes and i got a good gauge of how far along in the experience i was. i would see that the kitchen floor looked smooth and had a liquid like texture. but before i could survey any more my black cat ran down in the basement.   i didn’t want to forget about him down there and it never really thought that i could just leave the door open and shoo any members of our herd that wandered down there after my trip. i trudged down the stairs after him and scooped him up and started back up the stairs. half way up, a brown blur flew down the stairs as another cat dove to the basement. i tossed the black one in the kitchen and went after the brown one. while s picking up brown one, the black cat came back down the steps again and i scooped him up too. now i am carrying 2 cats up the stairs.   at the top of the stairs, the door is wide open and i see our other 3 cats had come to investigate the commotion. as i made the final push to the top they all jumped into action like they planned it in advance. i started laughing hysterically, let go of the cats in my arms and sat on the top step as i watched all the cats bounce down the stairs. i found the whole situation so funny. here i am coming up hard on mushrooms. i can feel the confusion building every second and now i have to figure a way of getting all 5 cats out of the basement.   by the time i had collected myself and devised a plan my face was hot and objects were starting to move. the time dilation had manifested and minutes were seeming to take longer and longer. my plan was to go down and capture one cat at a time and usher them up stairs. once i got to five, the task would be complete. i raced down and grabbed the first cat i came across. and ran to the up to the landing and toss it, pretty forcefully, up the last 3 steps into the kitchen so it would get the point that i didn’t want them down there. back down i went and did the same thing…that’s 2 down and 3 to go. i was getting more confused by the minute and on the fourth cat…..i had forgot how many cats i had previously ushered up the stairs. *face palm*   on my way back down i decided to count the cats down stairs and that would let me know how many were upstairs. unfortunately, the whole time i had neglected one key detail in my foolproof plan….the door was still open. just as i reach the basement floor, the whole heard can stampeding down again. plan a was an utter failure.   formulated just as quickly as plan a, was plan b. cats have got names right? i will count the cats as i bring them up and remember the name of each cat so that i don’t lose track like the last time. briliant!!! i thump back down the stairs and grab funchee, the black one, and take him up stairs. he quickly tries to run back down and i push him back and close the door. back down stairs i grab another cat. “sammie…number 2”, i think as i put her up stairs and close the door behind me.    at this point my mind is worn out. things are moving very well and walls have waves in them and on them. it is all but impossible to keep my mind on the task at hand. those 2 things, coupled with the fact that the time dilation is making the last 5 minutes chasing these beasts feel like i have been at it for hours, is making this fool’s errand about as much as my brain could handle in its current state. i trudge on trying to complete this task and grab another cat but again at the top of the stairs i forgot where i was in the order. i put that cat up stairs and tried to count the cats up there to give me an idea of how many were left. but of course, they are not in the kitchen anymore. and again it escapes me that if i just keep bring up cats until i run out of cats to retrieve i will be through with this cluster fuck.   unable to think pass my current predicament, i race around up stairs looking for the cats that had been brought up and they are nowhere to be found. my state had grown worse and i start thinking that maybe they got outside. but there was no way they could get out because no one opened the……..doooooor!!!!!....... the dooooooor!!!!! i forgot the close the basement door. fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck!!!!!!!   ran back into the kitchen and down the stairs for the 50 quadrillionth time and bam….there they were all 5 of them… safe and sound. i had found the missing cats. hallelujah!! they weren’t outside…my wife would have killed me if they were gone. me, all high and shit and the cats go missing? i might as well pack my shit and go! what a relief! i love my kitties! *kiss * *kiss* *kiss*…..wait! are we still in the basement?!?!?! fucking cock sucking son of a bitch mother damn shit hell……  i am done. my mental ability is gone. each trip up and down felt like an eternity, i had only just enough energy left to get up stairs to the couch. i kneel by the couch and think about what i am going to do. i am mentally exhausted because apparently, counting to 5 is impossible while on mushrooms. my mind racing to come up with a solution to this impossible problem and never once did i think of just leaving them down there until they found something more entertaining to do than drive me out of my fucking mind.  the white flag was up. it was over. i needed the big gun. it was 2 or 3am, and she had to get up and go to work in the morning but i had no choice...i needed an adult. i have to wake my wife. she would make it all better. she will tame those damn hellions and all will be fine......but it wasn’t fine.   i went up stairs to our room and woke her in the gentlest way possible. by jumping on the bed and yelling “help!! i took mushrooms!!!5 cats in the basement and i can only count to 4.” not the way i had envisioned it going down in my head but i was happy to get that much out without forgetting the reason i woke her up in the first place.  sleepily she marched down the stairs and i lead her to the kitchen where the basement door was still wide open. all i could do was stand at the door and point down the stairs. i think i may have whimpered a little too with my gesture. she was not amused! i thought i was finally going to get closure. she would get the cats from the basement and i would be saved but noooo…..my savior turn to tormentor as she said the only words in the word that could crush me into an even more pitiful state. “well…go get ‘em” she said. she didn’t understand that i was fighting this fight for what seemed like days now and wanted nothing more than to curl up in the corner and cry until i fell asleep.   she had no clue how close i was to a break down. tears welled up as crossed the threshold of the basement door and descended again into my personal hell. i scooped up a kitty and carried it slowly up stairs setting it on the kitchen floor. one, my wife said in a long drawn out voice like she was talking to a 2 year old. back down i went and grab up another “bundle of joy” and slinked up the stairs only to be shamed again by a long drawn out 2. by the third cat, short audible “poo, poo” sounds were coming from me as i was almost to the breaking point. my wife had begun to laugh at me and seemed to laugh harder each time i came up even more beaten than before. when the last cat came up i was greeted by a sighing “5” and a “now was that so hard” from my wife. i tried to apologize but she waved me off with a stern “we’ll talk about this in the morning” and walked up stairs to bed.   the cat ordeal was over but the trip was far from it. i was immensely grateful to my online buddies who talked me into halfing the dose because the rest of the night was filled with confusion and mind fuckery and intense time dilation. not really a bad trip as bad trips go, but not at all enjoyable. i think i can cross mushies off the list of viable boredom relievers. i won’t be doing them again anytime soon that is for sure.  tldr: ate magic mushrooms for the first time in many years and chased cats out of the basement all night until i gave up and got my wife to tame the beasts.   update: wow!—made the front page, got gold….today was a good day. thank you for the gold whoever you are. i am at work and will get to the few questions when i get home.  the best part is seeing all the comments of people who can relate.   update 2: ok…first things first. i have 6 cats now and 2 large dogs. my wife is a vet tech and was coming home with a new animal every 6 months to a year. every time a kitten’s mother got hit by a car, i got a sob story a new cat.  now i think she hit her limit seeing that we have 2 litterboxes that hold 40lbs of litter each and she is cleaning them out twice a day. i told her that she was heading to “crazy cat lady” status and she stopped collecting them. but i really think that if i didn’t say something that i would be swimming in cats right now.  she has a problem…  next, as to why i didn’t leave the cats down there…i was incapable of looking past the task at hand and hyper focused on getting the cats out of the basement because of the effects of the mushrooms. under normal circumstances, i would have been able to get them up there just by shaking their treats or chasing them with the spray bottle or just left them down there with the door open. unfortunately, i couldn’t even consider any other options. that was my job and it had to be done. the mushroom gods had spoken.  to people giving me advice on how to have a good trip...you make the mistake that most drug users do. you assume i am a novice at (insert drug here) and just need your guidance. let me assure you, i my drug dick is bigger than most. the number of different substance i have taken is quite extensive. my lds experiences are in the 50+ range. i have given the same advice to other people countless times. sometimes, you just say fuck it…just eat that shit! sometimes it’s good and sometimes it’s bad. for me the majority of my lsd experiences were tough to get through. so much so that the mere thought of taking it again gives me anxiety. i will not be taking it again…so feel free to eat my share along with your’s.  i wouldn’t say i am 100% done with shrooms. but given that their effects are similar to lsd…the stars would have to align so perfectly, that having another psilocybin experience was the only practical option in that moment. it will only be a once in a lifetime event.  so the chances are next to none that i will ever eat them again.  i have to say again it is good to see all the people telling of their own psychedelic experiences. the movement is still alive and growing every day. it may not be in our lifetimes, but someday people like us will be able to experience any substance they want without fear of imprisonment. i hope i am here to see that day, even if i am too old and frail to take the journey myself.  http://imgur.com/7lgyjbnso this was on valentines day and i was making my girlfriend a nice card because she always liked me making her stuff instead of buying her stuff. she was really happy reading the card until 20 seconds in she just looked at me with angry eyes. she threw the card at me and said "seriously?" i felt strange that she did such a thing. at first i thought she was mad because the card wasn't good enough but it didn't really make any sense to me so i picked the card up and read it. everything was normal until the last line.  "if i was asked to put a price tag on you i couldn't because you are just too worthless"  i don't know how i could fuck up something so simple. i meant to write "priceless". even after i explained it to her she was still unhappy about it and i basically ruined our valentines day.  tl,dr : told my girlfriend she's "worthless" instead of "priceless"i don't usually open doors for anyone, but recently i've been trying to be more chivalrous because thats fucking awesome.  what better way than opening the car door for my sweet mom?  i park the car like a boss, turn it off like a light switch, get out like i'm about to finish, go to her door like a graceful gentleteen, and open it.  what i saw was my portal to this world.  she was in a dress, full on commando.  she didn't notice that i noticed, but i noticed that i noticed, and i didn't want to notice that i noticed.  but i did.  now i'm scarred.  tl;dr:  spawn point located.  &amp;nbsp;  edit:  **some q&amp;a**  is she hot? &amp;nbsp;  she's my mom and i'm not into wincest, sorry bros.  (that's a no)  &amp;nbsp;  how's the trimmings? &amp;nbsp;  didn't see it long enough to notice, and glad it's that way.  &amp;nbsp;  continuing the chivalry? &amp;nbsp;  yeah, of course!  &amp;nbsp;  also thanks for the laughs you guys provided, i hope you all have a great day!  &amp;nbsp;  edit 2: thank you to /u/ftp411 for the narration!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaomz_wj0qii am a 21 year old guy. today i was returning home from a dinner party when along the way i met this girl on the bus.  before moving ahead, let me bring to light the fact that she is very good looking (drop dead gorgeous if i may say so).   so we were standing on the bus, due to the lack of empty seats and she was right behind me. for some reason, the driver braked hard and we were all pushed ahead. the girl almost fell on me and i picked  her up and asked her if she was okay. she smiled and replied that she was and we got talking about stuff. she was a student and so was i and we both talked a bit about studies and all. we flirted a bit and hit it off; and also exchanged numbers. i was happy about being so lucky...   after a great time i arrived at my stop and bid adieu to her and said i will keep in touch. she smiled and waved me goodbye and i got down.   i started walking home from the stop, feeling lucky about having met this absolute stunner of a woman... then out of habit i checked my back pocket.  my wallet was gone.   (for those wondering, i tried the number and it was a hoax..)obligatory "this didn't happen today" announcement. this happened several years ago while i was in high school.  my freshmen year of hs, i had a science class in the very back of the school that was two connecting rooms-one for notes/lectures and the other was a lab.  after our first test of the year, those who finished first were sent to the lab room so we wouldn't have to sit silently. the lab had a bunch of breakfast bar type of tables, and each one had a gas line with a nozzle sticking out for the burners and stuff. the teacher told us not to worry about them since the gas had been cut off years ago due to low use.  so, i was done before any of my friends and started messing with the nozzle, trying to see how it worked. and then it snapped off. i spent a while trying to secure it back, but it was broken. so, i set it back on so it looked right, but would fall off if it were bumped/touched at all.  the next year, they stopped using those two classrooms because they were so far in the back, and they had rooms in a better place, so i never thought about it again until my senior year.   fast forward 3.5 years, i'm a senior sitting in my first block marine biology class. the fire alarm sounds, and the principal gets on the intercom telling everyone to calmly go outside. we all get outside, take attendance, and then are corralled into the field house for a couple hours.  right before they sent us home, the principal addressed the school and told us that the gas lines had been turned back on this morning, but no one knew there was a broken nozzle, so the gas leaked and filled a large portion of the school before a class noticed the smell.  **tl;dr** my fuck up took three and a half years to catch up with me, but when it did it leaked gas into my high school and caused a school wide panic and evacuation. just as a preface i am a college student and a year shy of being the glorious two-one so naturally like every felonious college kid, i have obtained a fake id.  anyways, so earlier this morning i went to the gas station to buy beer for the upcoming week since it it going to be a hectic week i knew the only time i could go would be this morning.  i walk into the gas station and grab a case of beer and proceed to the counter.  i plop the beer on the counter and am asked for my id.  now before i continue i need to preface that i have terrible handwriting.  like that of a second graders.  no idea why the elementary school decided i should pass but they did me wrong.  anyways, so just remember i have terrible handwriting. i give the id to her without fear and just wait for it back.  she takes a look at it and tells me to get out the store.  confused i ask her what the big deal is and she tells me that my id is obviously fake and that i need to get out now.  i have never ever had this problem before so i tell her that its not fake at all and she turns it around and points to my signature.  she says there is no way someone has that bad of writing except for someone trying to forge a signature since it obviously wasn't natural.  without hesitation, me and all my brilliance decide to pull out my real id to prove that hey its a really good fake id and i just have really bad handwriting.  i point to the signature on my real and she just gives me that "oh my god i can't believe we let people like you breed" look and starts to just laugh.  needless to say i am having a dry week and living a life without any fakes from here on out.  tl;dr: forrest gump and i compete for last spot in the classalright, so every year i prank my stepdad. it's become a point of contention in my household because he's a very angry person and my goal is always to make him angrier. i'm terrible i know. year to year the pranks have gotten worse and worse, last year i glued the milk carton to the top shelf of the fridge and he pulled the carton and the shelf along with it, ripping the carton and milk/other wet goods went flying all over the floor/stepdad. i'm glad i wasn't in the house for it.  anyways, this year i decided i'd be a good stepson and do something nice for him, but only at the cost of doing something extremely mean first.   the setup: i backed up his laptop to an external hard drive. he's not the most tech savvy so he won't really notice any of the fuckery i'm about to perform on said laptop. i then installed that old ass bonzi buddy virus on his laptop. afterwards, i took a firecracker, peeled it open and emptied the contents on some rolling paper and flattened it out after sealing it with the quick fuse that holds firecrackers together. i pried up his enter key and glued it to the bottom of the key. i let the fuse just barely stick out from under it so i could reach it. this was all done the night before.  the action: i came over my parents house early in the morning saying i needed to print a report and that i'd use his laptop because it was easier. i opened it up, hiding the fuse with my thumb and called him over.  "what the hell is that?!" he said pointing at the dumbass looking purple monkey. i told him it was a virus that certain fake porn sites can give you and he got all super defensive saying that he doesn't watch porn. not sure if he does, don't care enough to know. i told him i could fix it and that he should go make some coffee. so i walked with him in the kitchen and had the screen block his view of my hands. as i pulled my lighter out of my pocket i just said, "ah i think i go- oh shit" and boom, his keyboard literally exploded. keys went flying and i ducked. i hadn't expected it to be as big of a pop as it was. i must've laid out the powder wrong or something. or maybe the glue ignited? i have no clue.   he dropped to his knees and was holding his head, talking about taxes and other important documents i had just ruined. his shock quickly became anger as he pushed me away and saw his now dead laptop. i ran out of the room into the garage, and honestly i was giggling like a little kid. i couldn't help it. he stormed after me and found me in there at the table he usually drinks at, with a brand new laptop i got him as a belated birthday gift.   i've never seen him go from being so angry to confused to extremely happy. it's usually the other way around. anyways that was my eventful morning.  tldr: i'm a jerk and prank my stepdad too much. did a great prank with a surprise gift at the end. he hates me less.  edit: thank you so much for the gold! you guys rule![update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/41z1rv/tifu_by_telling_a_terminally_ill_friend_that_i/)   [update can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/41umb6/tifu_by_telling_my_terminally_ill_friend_that_i/)  holy fuck, reddit, this might be my biggest fuck up of all time... there's this girl i'm friends with that i've known for maybe 8 months or so who i've grown really close to.    the thing is though that i live in sweden and she lives in america so our communication is limited to snapchat and kik (don't judge, we're 15) so emotions are hard to recognize through text.    now ever since we started talking she would many times mention that she was going to the oncologist and having a session. now for those of you who don't know; an oncologist is basically a cancer doctor, but since i'm not a native speaker i mixedthis word up with orthodontist. this was supported by the fact that she had braces.   there were several hints that proved that an oncologist wasn't infact a dentist. she once said she had cancer but i assumed she was joking because we had joked about dieseases before this. she brought up the cost of her medical visits to the oncologist as extremely much.like several hundred thousand much, but i knew health care in america was expensive as shit so i just assumed that this girl went to a reaaaaalllyyyy expensive dentist (her parents are **loaded**). ofcourse a normal person would realize she had cancer, but me? nah, i'm retarded.    fast forward to 3 hours ago.   we had been talking for a bit and she sent me a picture of her smiling (with braces) telling me she was at the oncologist/doctor and that she'd be back in 2,5 hours. i told her good luck and watched a movie until she texted me "i only have 5 months left." i assumed she meant that her braces were coming off and i said "congratulations, finally! :d" this is ofcourse bad enough but the fuck up doesn't end there... "..." she said and me thinking it was a joke about her dying said "r.i.p, [girl]. i bet you will go to hellxd" (bad joke regardless) she just said "fuck you, [lgoku], i thought you were my friend..." then she blocked me. me not realizing what just happened was kinda laughing to myself thinking she was pretending to be angry (we often did this). my friend asked what was funny so i showed him the convo and he just looked at me like i had killed someone.   "dude... you realize an oncologist is a cancer doctor, right?" that's when i realized i had fucked up.  tl;dr told a terminally ill girl that she would go to hell.   this happened just now,  a long time ago i installed my cloud to butt chrome extension, which replaces the word cloud with butt, and i totally forgot about it.  i've been on the look out for a second hand iphone for the past few days, and was wondering why so many people were talking about the new ibutt storage feature. every time i asked about it on trademe they were rather confused and sometimes thought i was just fucking with them. eventually i got sick of it after finding nothing about this ibutt online and decided to contact apple.  the help desk didn't take me seriously at all and of course every time they asked if i meant icloud all i saw was ibutt, confusing me even more. i left the heated discussion with the poor lady when it suddenly dawned on my how much of an idiot i am.  edit: wow this blew up over night, all these inboxes are a pain in the cloud.so her pictures were pretty, she seemed normal. i hadn't done the tinder thing before so i didn't know what to expect, but when she invited me over to her place i figured i'd scored pretty hard. i  showered, groomed, and drove the 20-30 minutes to her address. i'm not even worried about safety,  she's just a small girl right? i'll be fine. my concern at this point is whether i'll measure up.    i get there and i'm wondering if i have the right place. it's completely overgrown. the grass hasn't been cut in 7000 years. the walls needed a fresh coat of paint a decade ago. are...are the windows boarded up? i check the letterbox for the house number and check the message again - yep, this seems to be the right place. i guess it's just a crappy old house.  i knock and after about a minute she comes to the door. unpleasant surprise no.1: she looks 15 years older than in her pictures and haggard; like she hasn't slept in a week haggard. i don't know what the fuck she's wearing but it looks like a vague attempt at sexy. like, i bought this leopard print dress at walmart 15 years ago sexy.   i'm already thinking about how to get out of this as she invites me inside. it's even worse in here. the paint is peeling everywhere, it's dark and messy. it smells quite unpleasant. she invites me into her room, which is lit up like a cheap brothel.   she sits down on her bed and asks if i mind if she smokes. smoking in your house? that's a bit gross, but it's not really a surprise at this point. i say sure.   and that's when she pulls the meth pipe out of her bag.   it all clicks. the garden, the paint, the boarded up windows, the smell, her appearance. this is a crack den and she is a crack whore.   now i'm afraid. what is this house? are we alone? are 4 gangbangers going to jump out of the other room and mug me?  so i nope'd out of there as fast as you can say "oh holy fuck nope", making some vague excuse about getting cold feet. she wasn't really bothered; she was higher than the empire state by this point and rolling around on her bed.   i drove home feeling dirty and showered again. and that was the story of my first ever tinder date.   **tl;dr: went for a booty call, ended up in a crack den.**  **p.s. fucking jenny.**so this story of mine happened about a year ago, and i don't think i will ever forget what happened that day.  i used to work at this certain coffee corporation, ya know, the one that pretty much rules over the world. my store had this regular customer that would come in every single day, and there was always something to yell at us about. her coffee was burnt, the tables are gross, it's too loud, we're all out to get her, etc. she was really ocd and freaked out if you so much as got a splash of water on the side of her cup. after about two years of dealing with this woman, biting my tongue and trying my best to give her the best "experience" she can get (even harder since i was a supervisor), one day i just snapped.  i saw her in line and immediately braced myself for impact. i tried to do everything for her the way she wants it, and of course it backfired. she usually liked to put her lids on herself, so instead of snapping it on, i just set it on top and informed her of what i did. she asked me why i did that and i told her that i'm just trying to be convenient to her. this bitch just started **yelling** at me, telling me i'm trying to burn her on purpose and get her sent to the hospital, and how she's going to complain to corporate as she always does.  i literally lost it at her ungrateful attitude. she said "how about you just get someone else to take care of me?!" here's my fuck up, i responded with "how about you stop being such a *fucking bitch*?!?!" instantly my store got quiet, and at this point i'm on a fucking roll so i'm just yelling at this customer, venting all of my two years of pent up aggression. my other supervisor had to drag me off the floor to calm down, and i just turned the keys over and left. several customers actually clapped for me when i was on my way out, saying they were proud of me for sticking up for myself. i'm just like "yay, there goes my fucking job", even though i felt amazing about it. i called my boss and told him what happened, his only response was "oh boy...", as this kind of thing was inevitable.  in the end, i got a write-up and didn't lose my job, even though she was doing her damn hardest to get both me and my boss fired. this lady has a track record in our entire district of being a cunt, and this final issue was enough to get her banned from every store in our district. i fucked up big time, but amazing things came out of it. moral of the story, don't take anyone's shit.  tl;dr: cursed out a customer, almost got fired, ended up getting her banned from our district.  edit: wow, you guys are awesome. first big post and i made the front page! i got gilded too which is wicked sweet. it's been a bit of a hectic day for me, so this cheers me up a lot. i'll get to responding to some of you guys later tonight when i get home!  edit2: for one, this incident isn't fake. it actually happened. and for those of you who are saying it's not a fuck up, it is. fuck ups don't always have to end in some horrible manner. i made a terrible decision out of anger, and really should have gotten fired. i put myself and my boss in a tough spot, and while it felt rewarding, it also hit my pride that i allowed this woman to get under my skin like that. so no, i "won" that fight, but only because of the mercy of the gods.throwaway for obvious reasons.  today was supposed to be a nice trip to the beach with my boyfriend, sister and her husband.  for reference my sister and i are 14 months apart in age (she is older) and we look enough alike that more than once in our life people have thought we were twins.  when we were younger we played it up and dressed alike and everything.  as we have gotten older we no longer dress alike however because we both have very thick black curly hair we still style our hair almost the same way.  today we both had it pulled back in pony tails even using the same scrunchies (lol, totally not planned either).  i say that to say that i honestly believe that my bil thought i was my sister.  we had rented a cabana that not only had table and chairs but also had two changing rooms.  my bil and sister had gotten there first and had all of our food set out and my bil had already changed and was in the water.  my sister was in her bathing suit and said she was going to run up to the restroom before she hit the water.  my b/f forgot his phone so he ran back to the car to get it.  i went into the changing room and had put on the bottom half but didn't have my top on yet and i was bent over looking away from the door when i feel  hands on my hips.  thinking this was my b/f without looking i grabbed his hand and pulled his hands up to my breast and pressed my butt firmly into his crotch.  i could start to feel the movement of his rapidly awakening erection when i hear my sister yell "what in the fuck is going on".  i quickly realize that this is not my boyfriend but my sisters husband and by this time he was no longer halfway up but had a massive erection that was going up my butt (well not really but it pretty much gave me a wedgie).  (side note:   i don't know how my sister can walk)  he let's go of me and he looks confused and starts apologizing profusely to both of us.  saying he thought it was her, didn't even know we were there yet, etc.     my sister starts bawling and runs back to the bathroom.  i quickly am putting my top on and wanted to crawl in a hole and die.  i went to the bathroom and tried to talk with my sister but she wasn't having it.  i kept trying to tell her that i thought it was my b/f and he thought it was his wife but the more i tried to explain that the dumber it even sounded to me.  my b/f shows back up and is confused has hell about why everyone is pissed off.  i left my sister to go back to the cabana, my bil was there and he was pretty much mortified.  he said he was sorry, he though i was her and he hoped i would not hate him for it and that he would never disrespect either my sister or me by doing that on purpose.  i told him he didn't have anything to apologize for any more than i did for grabbing him.  i told him i thought he was my b/f and we both talked about how we were going to help my sister understand that this honestly was a mistake.  she finally came out but by this time she wanted to go home.  i begged her to stay and that i didn't have some long drawn out plan to steal her husband.  i told her i love my b/f and i love her, how could she think i would ever do anything to hurt her.  ultimately she stuck around but was mopey the rest of the day.  my b/f was finally told what happened and he at first thought it was funny, then when we get to the car he started asking why i thought my bil was him when he hadn't even changed cloths yet.  then the rest of drive home was in silence and once we got home he started asking about if i had feelings for my bil.  ugh.....  finally after several hours i got him past his insecurities and am now typing this in bed.  so i have no idea if there is going to be any long term problems from this.  my sister i think still doesn't believe me.  i sure as fuck hope she doesn't take this out on my bil.  i am hoping things aren't going to be awkward with my bil either and ultimately i hope my b/f can just forget about this.  good god what a fucking mess.  tl;dr  while changing into bathing suit bil comes from behind me and grabs me on hips, me thinking it is b/f pull his hands from hips to breasts and firmly plant buttocks into groin causing erection and problems.i live in kyrgyzstan. here, two languages (kyrgyz and russian) are spoken simultaneously by locals and often mixed together. the word for 'ice rink' in russian is "katok" while the word in kyrgyz for 'penis' is "kotok". today was my day off and i wanted to go ice skating. when trying to find out details about the local skating rink, i forgot the kyrgyz word for ice rink and tried to use the russian one instead and i asked an old women in a store: "men bir saatka tsenterdagy chon kotokko kirip konki tepsem, kanchadan bolot?" which translates to: "how much will it be to go on the big penis downtown for an hour?".  i am no longer allowed in the store.so this actually happened a few months ago, when i started my new job.  so i'm an intern at a small web-development company. i'm here to write code but because there's not a lot of work going i frequently leave the building to go for smoke breaks. the building we're in has a couple of other companies in it. some of the other people are really nice but some see others as competition and treat people accordingly.  so first week, i hold open a door for a woman who works on the floor below us. she tells me that it's offensive for someone to hold hold the door open because shes a woman, i just leave it and tell her i'd do it for anyone, she's pretty pissed so i took the stairs instead of taking the elevator with her.  here the tifu really begins. so a few weeks later, i'm coming in from a smoke break i was on my phone, trying to get my auto correct to work. i walk through the door and see someone coming towards the door so as i always do, i hold it open. now this morning i was particularly annoyed, tired and stressed. i peek up from my phone to look at who's coming and it's her, mrs door assault. so i simply let the door go and get into the elevator. she mustn't have been looking as she got to the door because she walks straight into it, this big ass fire door. she breaks her nose and falls backwards, just as the elevator door closes. i saw her hit the door and fall backwards because fire doors close slowly to avoid slamming. according to my boss she was bleeding pretty bad. i feel like a total ass for the whole thing but everyone i work with thinks it's pretty funny. i tried apologizing to her a few days ago in the staff room and she ignored me completely. still feel very bad and i no longer take my smoke breaks for fear of injuring someone.   tl;dr: broke someones nose because they didn't like having doors opened for them.i like to lift weights before i go to work, and since i'm an early bird i'm usually at the gym around 4 or 4:30. it's a smaller 24/7 gym with card access and i'm usually the only one there that early. i enjoy being alone, because i like to dance and enjoy my music (but obviously wouldn't if others were around). i've danced countless times in the morning in between sets, but i realized yesterday (sorry, meant to post yesterday!) i have been fucking up for a while.  rather than going to the gym in the morning yesterday, i went after work. staff was actually there (normally it is to early and staff isn't around) and the girl at the desk looked at me and started whispering to her coworker. i shrugged it off and got into my workout.   as i was leaving, both girls stopped me and said, "hey, can we talk to you for a second?" i was not sure why they needed to talk to me and i'm pretty shy but reluctantly agreed. once they pulled me aside one of the girls said, "so do you always dance when nobody is watching?" i was literally frozen. how? how could they know? before i could even respond she said, "we noticed a couple months back when checking camera footage that you come in and dance in the mornings during your workout. it is hilarious!" i could barley utter a response, which mostly sounded like, "haha, yeah, i didn't even think about the cameras."  tl;dr - i go to the gym early when nobody is around. i get into my music and dance because nobody is there. realized yesterday for the past couple months the staff has been unashamedly watching my "performances." might have to switch gyms because of embarrassment.  edit: wow, i appreciate all the comments everyone. a little more background might clarify why i feel this is a fuck up. i am not a confident guy. part of the reason i go to the gym early is because i don't have a huge audience. i got comfortable having no audience and let loose more than i would normally. while i was flattered many in the comments interpreted the girls reaction as flirting, it was and still is very uncomfortable to me. i hope i don't sound like a bitch. i have laughed at the irony of the situation, but i'm very anxious about returning during the day. also...this isn't fake, i'm a 21 year old male, the dancing was not good and included classics such as the lawn mower, pelvic thrusting, and the running man.pretty much i thought that school started the day after labor day, like it normally does. decided to check my school email today and found that it had already posted its lab tech schedule (i.e. one of the work study program that i've worked for the past two years) as well as a couple of other emails from my professors about class stuff.   &gt; executing secondguessmyself.exe  didn't have the time to check the calendar though, because my dad needed me to help him with some house renovation stuff then went straight off to work. come home from work and check the calendar on the website:  &gt; fall semester begins: sep 1  mom's pissed, i feel the magnetic pull of my face to the nearest flat object, and i've probably got a mountain of things to catch up on before work at 4pm tomorrow. fml.  ___________________________________________________________________________  situation update: just checked in. went fairly smooth. doesn't make up for the fact that i missed at least two days' worth of teaching, but at least i didn't get dropped altogether. thanks for the kind words from some of you guys. note to self, though: *never* post on a large sub again. inbox freaking exploded on me &lt;.&lt;so i have back and neck problems and often will ice my neck with ice packs and such. well last night i couldn't find our ice packs and was too lazy to make my own so i grabbed a frozen bag of peas. i settled into bed with it on my neck.  i fell asleep like that and woke up hours later laying on top of the smashed bag of peas and my bed soaked in pea juice all the way down into the mattress.   tl;dr i pead my bed. this actually happened about two weeks ago.  my sister recently died at the age of 32.  we were very close.  her funeral was held at the lutheran church she was married in.  right before they started the service (after the viewing), i went to give my sister a kiss one last time.  when i went to stand up, i tripped over the altar they put out to kneel on.  falling forward, i put my hands out to brace myself which happen to be on the inside of the casket, on the ledge next to the hinge of the lid.  it pushed the casket backwards. luckily, no major harm was done.  the men put it back upright, fixed her hair, and placed her gifts next to her again. i swear if she were here, she would laugh so loudly.  my mom was so upset she was hysterical, and my step dad held back a chuckle. this is my life.  edit:  wow!  thank you all so much for your show of support.  it means a lot that you shared your experiences and laughs.  it was a funny moment for me, and i still get teased that i 'knocked 'em dead'.  just fyi, she died of complications from vasculitis.  in the end, her heart just wasn't strong enough to keep going.  once again, i appreciate all the well wishes!okay it seems that i must post that this wasn't today but like 18 years ago in hs.  i was set up on a blind date by a buddy of mine. i was the quiet but funny and nerdy kid who was essentially the king of the band geeks. she was a conservative and quiet girl about my age from the rich part of town.   we talked on the phone for a few days (as was the style at the time) and i worked up the gumption to ask her out on a date-date.   she said yes.   i picked her up, and after some basic pleasantries with her mother, we drove off in my car.   "where are we going?" she asked.  well shit. i hadn't actually connected the idea that i needed to plan. normally i just wing it. so... i winged it....  "where nobody can hear you scream" i replied.   i chuckled and kept driving, thinking that she got my "joke". a minute of awkward silence later and i asked "where would you like to go?"  "home" she said with the defeat in her voice that you'd expect from a 10 minute date-gone-wrong.  shortest date ever.let me start off by saying for someone who is in their early 20's, i know basically nothing about computers. i know how to google things, download shit and watch porn, but compared to my 60 year old father i am mr. robot. you should also know that my father loves printing shit. he probably loves printing shit more than he loves me. he probably loves printing even more than the dog i know he loves more than me. he is also extremely technologically challenged. though, i don't blame him for not grasping modern technology, he is of the generation that didn't have a computer in front of them their entire lives. so, whenever he is having trouble with "that plastic piece of shit" he looks at me like i am a test tube baby formed from the dna of steve jobs and bill gates and i offer my technical savant abilities...   &amp;nbsp;  it all started when i hear him sputtering away to himself about the computer "being the shits at printing" and "lord fuck! google is fuckin' slow today". i ask him what the problem is and he says that google is very slow today and he can't print something if he can't google it. i don't bother to try to explain that the google search engine relies on the internet connection for it's speed and that it's just the wi-fi that is slow as it never sinks in. he gets up and offers me the chair and asks me to try and fix the laptop before "it meets it's maker" to which i reply "who? sumting wong?". he tells me that's racist and goes outside for a smoke. when he comes back in, i've got the internet network set to that of the previously shut off range extender that he always manages to turn off when vacuuming and it has significantly improved the speed. i also have the window 10 upgrade in process...   &amp;nbsp;  so everything is fine the upgrade is doing something, but you can still use your computer while it is getting ready and he gets back to printing the dictionary or whatever it is that he does. after a while he goes to his bedroom and starts yelling at the news and i take this opportunity to finish installing windows 10. it begins and it looks like it is going to take a while so i head over to my buddy's house. i come back later to find the laptop on the floor, the printer in the sink and a brand new laptop on the desk in place of the old one. wtf.  &amp;nbsp;  apparently, while i was gone windows 10 started and my dad attempted to get on the computer. it clearly didn't work out too well based on what i discovered. when i asked him about it he just said "that was a piece of junk, when i went to log on it had a virus, it was hacked, i couldn't print anything." he also breifly explained how a hacker named cortana was taunting him so he threw the laptop on the floor and went and bought a new one... he asks me if i could set up the printer to the new laptop (which i am pretty sure came with windows 10...) instead, i picked the old laptop (miraculously still working) up off the floor, put it on the desk, connected the printer and restored it to windows 7. i brought the new computer he had bought back to the store and gave him the money back. we haven't really discussed the days events yet, but i can't wait until it's not too soon to tease him about cortana the hacker and to ask him why the printer was in the sink. we did manage to accomplish something today though, google is a little bit faster now because of our range extender. you're welcome for the speed bump google.   &amp;nbsp;  tl;dr otherwise reasonable 60 year old man gets angry at computer for taunting him, throws it on the groundscene: 4 year old birthday party. all girls except one boy. the boy found a black witch cape in the closet and proceeded to cover his head and chase the girls around the house and yard.   he quickly got named the black man. the girls started screaming things like, "run from the black man!" and "get away from the black man!"  received two phone calls from concerned parents after the party.   edit: not in detroitwas waiting for my coffee and got shat on by a minor bird. two girls walking past saw and started laughing. one said "getting shit on means good luck!" she didn't look too bad so quick thinking me goes "okay, what's your number?" turns out she thought that was even funnier and just laughed in my face.... so now i have bird shit in my hair and feel like shit.throwaway because my boyfriend is a redditor.     the other night my boyfriend told me he wanted to try anal. i'm all for trying things for my man, but my butt has pretty much been a poop-only chute. it got me thinking about my butthole, and what it looks like (i know, that's weird). freshly out of the shower, i laid down on my bed, spread my legs, and started looking around down there to see what it looks like for him. while i was doing this, i had to fart. my curiosity already piqued, i decided to watch myself fart. this wouldn't have been a problem, except last night i took a laxative to help persuade out 4 days of poop. i thought i'd gotten it all out of my system, but the geyser of molten shit that sprayed out of me indicated i was mistaken. for a stunned moment, i sat there with diarrhea all over my hand, my hand mirror, and my bed. the worst part is that my bed is completely bare right now because it is laundry day. cheers.     **tl;dr:** i pooped my bed while i was awake.this literally happened a few minutes ago, and i may be in need of searching for a new job, pls halp. i created a project at my work that allowed all of our products to be linked up to android apps that our customers can use to control them. today was the day i was presenting this to upper management. before starting my presentation, the ceo of my company stopped in and decided he was interested in my project. the presentation goes well, and is very well received. everyone thinks its a great idea to link our products up to apps instead of controlling them via switches and push buttons. the final slide of my project was titled "why android initially", this is where things went, very, very bad. i presented data showing that android based devices currently hold &gt;50% market share and apple is only around 38%. i then proceeded to tell everyone 82% of new phones being shipped right now are android based. i also explained that development for android was much easier than ios. after i finish making these points my ceo just responds with "well, 82% of people are stupid". obviously thinking it was a joke, and he just liked apple more, i responded back with "looks like we have a fanboy in the room". the room went dead silent for the remainder of my presentation. i finish up the presentation thinking it went quite well, and the ceo storms out. one of the vps in the meeting pulls me aside, and politely fills me in on the fact that our ceo is one of the largest shareholders of apple. i kinda just left work after that one...        &amp;nbsp;       tl;dr: shit on apple in front of my ceo who's one of the biggest investors in the company and called him a fucking fanboy      edit: rip inbox      edit2: in the presentation i talked about expanding to ios when the time presented itself. for now, having the fully designed android app fits everyone's needs. that's why the slide was titled "why android initially"       edit3: yes, i own an android. would i call myself a fan boy? maybe. i just prefer superior hardware (for lower costs) and open source. whatever platform offers me that is the one i'll choose. i stated the android facts not to discredit apple, but to show the usefulness of having the android app. an ios app could not be created in near the time i made the android app, because i would have had to learn other languages etc. it was also just flat out not needed initially. this happened yesterday.  so, i was lying on my bed in my room at home, reading, when i heard the front door open and my flatmate come in with a girl.  he clearly didn't think i was home, because they immediately went to his room (which shares a wall with mine). i was mildly amused by this, so i decided not to go out and ruin their fun.  before long, they start getting down to it and, since they didn't think i was home, they weren't shy about being vocal.  he was grunting away, and she was moaning pretty loudly, shouting his name, etc.  all this noise started to turn me on, so i started masturbating, figuring that this was better than porn because it was real-life.  eventually, the girl started moaning even louder, which i took to indicate that she was cumming, and there was some definite wall-banging as well, so it didn't take me long to finish either.  satisfied, i went back to my book.  after about half an hour or so, i was bored of being confined to my room, so i went out into the lounge, not really caring if i'd embarrass them; we're all adults, we can just laugh it off.  i walked into the lounge to find my flatmate sitting on the couch, watching tv, with his arm around my little sister.  christ. what have i done?  edit: wow, this really took off. thanks to all who have commented. i tried to reply to a decent number, but there are way, way too many for me to get through. if you desperately want to grill me for details as some seem to want to, or you want an update, feel free to pm me. no insults, though, hopefully :) . so as the story goes, my girlfriend and i have been dating for almost 5 years, but just moved in together about 6 months ago. she is very smart, clean, fun, and generally just an all-around good person to live with. until about 5 months ago..  she typically wakes up earlier than me and hops in the shower right away, so by the time i get up she is finished in the bathroom. one morning as i was getting in the shower i noticed some brown... stuff near the drain of the tub. i thought nothing of it really, and made a note to clean the bathroom later that day as it had been a couple weeks.  the next day i hopped into a freshly cleansed bathtub and to my dismay, there again were traces of some brown material in different areas of the tub floor. concerned and a little disgusted by this mysterious matter, i rinsed it away the best i could. it couldn't be what i thought it was, right? maybe we had mice! yes, mice. i should tell my girlfriend to pick up some traps on her way home. fast forward a few weeks; completely empty mouse traps, zero evidence of mousey activities, yet still almost every morning i was met with a greasy brown substance hastily mashed around the shower drain.  i planned my words carefully; it was not my intention to embarrass her, as i would expect this type of behavior would indicate some type of underlying mental disorder or strange fetish that i was somehow unaware of. whatever her reason, we would work it out together and move on with our lives.  the moment finally came after dinner tonight. i took a deep breath, put my hand on her knee, looked her in the eye and asked, "laura, have you been pooping in the shower?" a mix of confusion and mild amusement crossed her face and she responded with, "um, excuse me? is that a serious question?" i guess my uncomfortable body language made her realize that i indeed was serious, and she immediately became alarmed. i explained the strange matter that i would find in the tub every morning, and it didn't look like residue from any of the products that she used, so i couldn't imagine what else it could be.  there was a pause before she began giggling hysterically. "i use my morning coffee grounds as a face scrub!" the amount of relief that washed over me was intense, but i was only able to enjoy it for a few seconds before she stood up and said,   "wait.. how long have you been suspicious exactly?"  "a couple weeks after moving in was the first time i noticed, why?"  **".........you thought i was shitting in the shower and you waited 5 months to confront me about it?!"**  edit: to those of you saying i'm stupid for not being able to tell the difference between coffee and feces, you aren't understanding the *amount* that was in question. it was never a massive clump of grounds, but more like a half of a teaspoon of an oily residue. maybe i am profoundly stupid.. but some of you are way too angry about it too :( buck up, kiddos!   edit 2: yikes. some of these comments and angry pms make me feel like i posted to youtube accidentally. yeesh! my dog was inside. she stepped on the lock button. i am now in the parking lot waiting for my brother in law to arrive with my spare key.i was in the kitchen reading the paper at the table, and my one year old was sitting in her high chair at the head of the table. everything was fine until she started to try and rock back and forth in her chair when she tipped back a little too far and started to fall backwards. like a cat, i sprung out of my chair towards her to save her from falling.   except...that's not what actually happened. it did happen in my head...as i was dreaming it. what actually happened was, my wife was happily sleeping next to me, while i was dreaming this, and was rudely awoken by the force of both my hands slamming into her skull. i found out this morning, that when she asked 'wtf was that for', i muttered something unintelligible and rolled over and went back to sleep.   tldr: dreamt i was saving kid's life. punched my wife in the head.  so over the past few weeks my girl has been carless, so being the considerate individual i like to pretend to be, i've been offering to drive her to and from work.   it's about 7 p.m. and i'm on my way back from work. i give her a call to double check what time she would be done for the night, and we establish that i'll pick her up at 9 oclock. my exact words were, "absolutely, i'll be there at 9." rookie mistake not leaving room for error.   exactly 50 minutes later, my phone buzzes for a reminder notification. "tip off for the wizards / warriors game is in 10 minutes!" fuck. my mind is racing. did i buy tickets? oh my god. is it february?! how could i have forgotten mr. curry was coming to the district tonight?!   i call my buddy tim immediately. "tim. where are you right now?" to which he replies, "i'm on my way to class, what's up?" (tim is in law school at georgetown, so thankfully he's already in the city.) i remind him about the game and the tickets we purchased way back in december, and we both panic for a split second. tim asks, "so, what do we do? are you coming?" i tell him about my prior arrangements with olivia to get her at 9. i say i can't go, right? i can't just leave her stranded at work, right?   ....   here's my thought process: "well, sure i can! olivia is understanding. she knew about the game and would want me to go. i'll just call her a cab to make sure she gets home safely. there's no way she would be that mad at me." brilliant! time to execute said plan:  i send a flurry of texts to liv, the first being this: "fuck olivia the basketball game is tonight."  the second: "i literally just left my house i'm already 10 minutes late but tim and i decided that we are going to go anyway. we both forgot we have no idea how and i'm sorry that i can't come pick you up." now you may be thinking, "why are you speaking in run on sentences man? ever heard of punctuation?" yes, i have. however, at this particular moment in time i was using my voice-to-text function because i'm flying down the expressway and i have no hands to text.   i make it to the city, scoop my buddy from his apartment, then make it to our seats in time for the second quarter. at this point it's about 9 oclock and i haven't heard from olivia yet. tim's asking me how angry she's going to be, and i assure him it's a non-issue. it was odd that i hadn't heard from her yet, so i step out to try to call her again. she answers:  -"hello?" -"hey! liv, i'm so sorry. did you get my messages?" -"yeah, i got your message. fuck you too. have fun at the game. " -click-  ??? bewildered, i call her back. i assume she's upset because i didn't come to pick her up, so i tell her i'd call a cab for her to get back. i quickly realize that wasn't the problem, it was the first text i sent her. she thought i meant to send that to my buddy tim, essentially saying exactly what the text said: "fuck olivia. the basketball game is tonight." when what i meant to say was, "fuck, olivia, the basketball game is tonight!"   we laughed about it this morning. i apologized profusely for the mess, but i'd probably do it again to see steph drop another 51 points.   tldr: i accidentally told my girlfriend to fuck off, abandoned her at work, and went to the washington wizards game.   (music for your time: https://youtu.be/p_i1xk07o4g)well then, i hope you guys are ready for a sob story.  as is custom with these things it should be noted that this did not in fact happen today, it happened on new year's eve 2015.     so to get the formalities out of the way: yes, i do mean blown it off, as in i now only have 1 hand. yes, i was stupid and i believe i got punished enough for that.   and yes, i am typing this with one hand.     anyway, me and my friends have always been fans of fireworks. it started young with my dad having connections left and right and getting all the illegal fireworks that 10 year old kids could ever want. i still think it is beautiful stuff, even after what's happened. but i digress.   this particular newyears we were messing about with something called cobra 8. they're basically big dynamite sticks that blow like fucking grenades, so you can see why they're illegal.  these things are made in a factory in italy or something, where i heard they are actually legal. the thing is that when you light the fuse you have about 10 seconds before the fuse runs out. once that happens a warning flame burns for another 10 seconds, and then it goes off. that's if you get the original product, however. sometimes you'll get imitations which don't have the warning flame and shorter fuses.  this was, unbeknownst to me, the case.    as i placed one of these things on the driveway my friends were talking to eachother about the immense blow they were about to experience. i got my lighter and tried to get the fuse going.   next thing i know i'm sitting on the floor, ears ringing and a weird tingling sensation in my right hand. the thing had gone off with my hand and face right over it. eardrums ruptured and hand ripped clean off. this, however, i did not realise yet.   funny thing is, when your hand get's ripped off you expect excruciating pain but i didn't realise what had happened for a few seconds. i was sitting on the ground, thinking ''what happened?'' as my friends started pulling on my shoulders. their mouths were moving and they looked visually shaken. i couldn't hear them, all i felt was a ringing noise and a tingling hand, which started tingling more and more.  one of my friends pointed at my right arm, and i decided to look at it.   that was the most shocking moment i've ever experienced. it was gone. ripped off. a bit of bone and some flesh was all that was left of my hand. i tried moving my hand but, of course, it didn't move. it was gone. now that i was looking at it suddenly i could feel it. my wrist, right where the hand was blown off, started hurting more than anything i'd ever felt before. i started screaming and desperately grasped at the missing hand with the other hand. the next thing i remember is when i was in the hospital after my friends had taken me there.    as it turns out, i had actually gotten lucky. remember how i said i was hovering over with my hand and head? if my hand hadn't been in the way my head would've suffered considerably more damage than just burst eardrums.     fast forward a year and i still haven't quite gotten over the loss of my hand. my passion was playing the piano, and i was just starting to learn guitar. neither of those hobbies is now possible and i spend many a night crying while listening to old piano recordings i made. to worsen things it's the dominant hand i lost so a lot of basic things, like writing, took months before i could do again.   i fucked up. and now i'm suffering the consequences. please, be careful with illegal fireworks. especially with the fake stuff.      tl;dr: got an immitation of heavy illegal fireworks, blew my hand off. can't play piano anymore.       edit: this account is a throwaway, obviously. the reason is i have an account i use frequently but i don't want to infect it with the stigma of this story.  edit 2: thanks for all the support guys :d you all are great.this actually happened today, yay!  so my aunt and uncle just had a baby boy a week ago. they also have two daughters, a 4 year old and a 2 year old (i'm a 26 year old guy, so my cousins are a lot younger than i am). because they had their hands full, with the newborn and two young daughters, i volunteered to take my 4 year old cousin to the park for the day. she's very attached to me and love spending time with her. when i got to their house, she was eating so i just hung out at the house for a while. as she ate, my cousin told me about her new friend "mimi," and my aunt filled me in that mimi was my cousin's new imaginary friend. i thought nothing of it, as many young children have imaginary friends. enter the fu. so i start to ask my cousin questions about mimi. my cousin answers them with an adorable swiftness as if mimi is a real person. she tells me all about her curly hair and how she wants to go visit mimi at her house. i asked her where mimi lives and she said that she'll show me on the way to the park. this is strange because, as a 4 year old, i didn't think she would actually be able to point out a location of where mimi lives, let alone tell me it's "on the way to the park." anyway, so we head out a little while later, and as we're driving, my cousin starts telling me from her car seat "hereafter superman, this is where mimi lives." i look to the right but there's nothing there. "no the other side!!" i look to my left and nearly crash as i realize she's pointing into a cemetery. "cousin, you've made a mistake, mimi doesn't live here," i say, trying to laugh it off. "yes she does! she told me this is where she lives and sleeps!" tl;dr cousin may be interacting with a spirit. i will be crying myself to sleep tonight.  *edit: well i have had quite a few people ask me to go to the cemetery to investigate. my initial reaction was: ya'll stupid. but the next day i'm off from work is friday, so we'll see. maybe then. *  edit 2: i've provided the name of the cemetery to a fellow redditor who said he/she will look up the graves and see if there is a mimi. let's be patient.  edit 3: a very caring redditor has looked up some info about the cemetery and came back with this: "there is a single mimi buried in that cemetery. she was 37 at the time of her death in 1949. that said, there are 16,800+ burials there so it's likely we could have a match on any name your niece gave you. still, i'd also think there would be more than one mimi. i'm happy to do more research on her, if you like." so there is a mimi! we will see. i will go back and talk to my cousin again.  edit 4: just wanted to add that i've never had a post blow up and get this much attention before. this is so cool. thanks reddit :d  edit 5: ok, so i'm going to see my cousin friday and ask her a few more questions and maybe visit the cemetery. i just want you all to know that in reading all of your comments and they mean so much to me. thank you for all of this attention, i had no idea this post would blow up like this. i wish i could respond to and thank you all individually but know that i'm trying my best to respond to as many people as i can. if i miss you, i really am sorry. thanks again, reddit, you've made my week :)  edit 6: i think i need to clarify. i will be visiting the cemetery alone. i am not taking my 4 year old baby cousin to a cemetery.   friday edit 1: ok, everyone, i want to thank you all for being so patient with me and getting so invested in my post. this has literally made like my month lol i want you to know i will be posting an update today sometime, which will include details about my visit to the cemetery, info found by the wonderful u/gutterpeach about the mimi buried in the cemetery, as well as any conversation i may have with my cousin. i am going to try my best to visit her and speak to her one on one and get some more insight, however i do ask of you to be a little more patient because today is in fact the most important holiday in my religion so i also have to visit other family members and i'm not sure what my aunt and uncle's plans are. but i will do my best to find some time to go visit them when i go to the cemetery. again, thank you all so much for this opportunity. lastly, just wanted to thank the splendid u/gutterpeach again for all her hard work in uncovering the enigma that is mimi. for more of her amazing amazing work, i would definitely check out her sub, r/cemeterypreservation. talk to you soon!!  friday edit 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3dpba5/tifu_mimi_update/this massive fuck up actually happened yesterday, but it didn’t dawn on me until now that it would be horribly right for this sub.   so last night my wife decided to make turkey a la king for dinner since we had some frozen leftovers from thanksgiving. it’s important that i note we also had a full size ham also in the freezer that my wife was planning on baking for christmas eve dinner.   so my wife was in the kitchen listening to music and dancing around like the causal gomer she is, and i was in my office playing some fallout. after listening to all the commotion my wife was making i decided that it would be a great time to sneak up and scare her, a thing i do regularly because my sense of humor is perpetually that of a middle schooler. i creep my way down the hall and around the corner to the kitchen, moving silently like a ninja in the night. she suspected nothing.   i get to the kitchen and see that my wife is rummaging around in the fridge with both the its doors wide open. our fridge is rather old and the freezer is on top, so with both the fridge and freezer doors open it was impossible for my wife to see me creeping up on her. the scare was going perfectly. i moved up and crouched right behind the freezer door and stayed perfectly still, keeping a manic look on my face that resembled the one jack nicholson makes in the shining.   after about four seconds my wife swings the door shut and immediately throws her hands up and screams, seeing her psychopath of a husband with a murderous grin on his face. i then hear a loud thud and an audible crunch. it sounded like someone threw a bowling ball on a bag of cheetos. my wife immediately lets out an agonizing scream which quickly transitioned into a tidal wave of guttural profanity. i apologize like quicker than charlie sheen in confession and move around the fridge to see what she dropped.  that’s when i saw the blood. she was wearing these pink fuzzy socks, and the one on her right foot was immediately soaked in blood with some amount of skin and bones protruding out. she was moving the frozen ham out of the way to get the leftover turkey when i scared her and the ham fell on her foot. i lost my shit. my wife was crying and screaming and i ran around the kitchen like a turkey with its head cut off looking for my phone. after a few seconds (obligatory “which felt like hours”) i grabbed my wife’s iphone and called for an ambulance.   the ambulance came and took her to the hospital, all the while her cussing me out like a sailor in heat and me frantically apologizing and trying to explain to the ambulance drivers that i did not take a sledgehammer to my wife’s foot, and was actually just a complete fucking moron.   now she’s scheduled to have surgery tomorrow and our plans for taking a new year’s cruise are cancelled. also, her father is going to come by and have a chat with me tomorrow morning.   tldr; it wasn’t the grinch who ruined christmas this year.   edit: wording/clarity. so this happened yesterday at lunch. i am an intern at a big engineering company in another country this summer. i am an incredibly difficult person to embarrass, but 24 hours later and i am still blushing at this situation.  i (female) emailed the director of engineering (male) and i asked if he wanted to grab lunch one day before i leave this summer. we proceed to exchange some brief emails about when (it happened yesterday, same day as the emailing started - all very quickly). the emails were in spanish. i am not bilingual, but i am learning. this is a critical detail.  so we finish emailing and we meet at 11:30 to go out to a restaurant and we have a nice lunch, we talk the entire time in spanish (slowly) and it was very fun and interesting. then, as we are right about to reenter the work building on our way back from lunch, he stops me and speaks in english (weird, considering the past 1.5 hours were in spanish, so i felt immediately like he wanted to make sure i understood his next words clearly).  he says "you know, you said something really funny in our emails... " and he flips through his phone and shows me my last email to him. "i know it's not what you meant to say, and i appreciate you are trying to learn the language, but this does not mean what you think it does..." and he points to the last line of my last email to him, which reads: *estoy emocionada para almorzarnos*.  i meant to say "i am excited for us to eat lunch together". apparently, as he described to me, that actually means: ***i am excited for us to eat each other out (sexually) for lunch***.   i told the director of engineering at a global engineering company this. wow.   well we clarified things and had a chuckle, and i think we diffused the situation pretty well... but.. needless to say i am still astronomically embarrassed.  **tl;dr translated spanish incorrectly and offered to have oral sex for lunch with the director of engineering of the company where i intern.**last night my husband, "dan" and i celebrated new year's eve with his family. we were both drinking, and just having a good time. after counting down the new year, we went inside and his mom told us just to sleep in his sister's room.  the alcohol intensified both of our libidos, so we started making out. things began to escalate, and dan said, "hey, let's do butt stuff." so, in my drunken state, i replied, "why the fuck not."   he started trying to put it in, but between being intoxicated and it being too dry, it just wasn't going to happen. dan started looking around his sister's room for some lotion and found two bottles. there was a tube of lotion and a squirt bottle, so he went with the squirt bottle out of convenience.  he put the lotion on his dick, and slowly started to put it in. i was drunk to the point that it didn't hurt too badly, and it was going in fairly easily. around a minute later, the lotion started getting really cold to the point it burned. i yelled at him to stop, and he pulled out. we both started writhing in pain.  turns out, he used fucking **menthol** lotion. my vagina and ass burned like a bitch, and he ended up burning his penis and penis hole.  on the bright side, the next morning i was putting the tubes of lotion back in place, and low and behold, the tube of "lotion" was actually acrylic paint. so i guess it could've been worse.  tl;dr:got drunk, got fucked in the ass, and now my shit is minty fresh.  eta: to the ones who found this fuck up as hilarious as i now do, thank you. to the ones calling me a whore/skank/tramp for trying something with my husband, i hope you spend your year being fucked in the ass by a menthol based paint. it's 7:30am on black friday and a few buddies of mine were getting breakfast at a restaurant before heading out climbing for the day. the restaurant is busy and full of middle aged people we assume are out for the day to enjoy a nice morning meal before enjoying the cold but sunny day. it's a small town so anyone who wanted to do some crazy black friday shopping probably drove out of town. i was wrong.   as we're eating, i looked across the street at a local shoe store that a woman just unlocked and walked into. she was getting the store and cash register ready and i realize it's an old ex girlfriend from early high school who got surprisingly attractive. i decided to step out of the restaurant for a second and walk over for a quick chat and see how she's been doing.   i'm dressed in dirt bag climber style (cut off jeans with long johns on underneath, beanie, ripped shirt etc) and look a little ridiculous as i approach the store entrance. i knocked on the glass and she looked over and took a second to realize who i was. she smiled, came over and unlocked the door to let me in and give me an awkward hug.   at that moment i'm giving her a hug, her eyes lit up. i turned to see every fucking person in the restaurant comes running over and through the doors of the shoe store. she obviously still didn't have the register ready, an open sign on, anything ready for the epic retail workers nightmare of black friday.   they came pouring in, her face is going "oh god, no no no no no no no." and all i say is, "shit, i'm sorry. i'm headed climbing now, good luck!" and walked out.   i returned across to the now nearly empty restaurant to visit my friends. "dude, we just saw that all go down. you just ruined that girls day!"  moral of the story, black friday is a terrible day to get a retail workers number. this technically didn't happen today, but i still felt like sharing it.  i recently accepted a job to act as a substitute teacher at my local high school. i was relatively new to teaching so it was a pretty nerve-wrecking experience for me. i entered the classroom and immediately introduced myself. i realized that i was stuttering so i just began lecturing math. at this point, i haven't spent anytime time trying to get to learn the faces and names of the kids. 15-25 minutes into the lecture, i was getting a little bit more comfortable and started observing the class. i noticed a kid sleeping at the back of the classroom and said "hey, can you please stop sleeping in class?" the kid didn't respond at all. so i walked over to the kid and as i was walking, i realized that the kid wasn't really sleeping. he was asian and had really really small eyes. he then realized that i was talking about him and said "who me?" the whole class bursted out laughing. he'll probably be made fun of the rest of the school year.  tl;dr: called out an asian student for sleeping in class, turns out he just had really small eyes. he'll probably be made fun of the rest of the school year.  edit: wow, didn't think this would explode. i felt really bad about what happened. regrettably, i never really had the chance to correct it. i learned my lesson...i guess i'll donate to charity. happened recently.  the wife has pinched off a couple of kids, so her stomach is...not taut. anyway, we were getting a bit froggy and, instead of thinking with my smaller brain, my actual brain decided it would be funny to knead her stomach like a big lump of dough.  "what are you doing?" "kneading the dough."  if looks could kill, i'd be dead twice.   **tl;dr**: soured her dough  **edit**  for the record, i love my wife's body. i also love the pun thread and all the great comments. if i could change one thing about this whole fiasco it would be this: the tl;dr would've simply said "d'oh!"so, this actually happened today!       i work at a winery owned by a fairly large player in the game. to give some back story, we are employed as "vintage casuals" for about 4 months of the year, to help out with the busiest part of their season. its good money (i take about $1800 aud clear a week for a 72 hour week) but overall, its pretty mundane work. the permanent staff call us "insurance policies" - basically making sure the wine doesn't go off, heat up to much, and add bits and pieces to stop it from doing the afore mentioned.      at one point in the wine making process, the grapes that have been sitting in their tanks for days are pumped to a machine that gets rid of all the skins and seeds and crap (a press), leaving only the juice. the juice is then reverted back into its original tank like a massive super soaker to push the seeds and skins to the first machine until its only just the juice going around and around. to start this process off, a little bit of finished wine is used for the super soaker, but this also means that the crappy grapes and stuff is connected to the finished wine's tank.      onto the fuck up - so one of the permanents had just started this whole process, using the finished wine to begin. he then called me on the radio to shut of the valve to the finished wine and "swing it" so that just the juice from the unfinished wine is being used.      now i've done this a hundred times, but as i walked up to the tank, i only saw one tank tap and thinking "that's odd", i turned the tap on, and as always, just walked away to continue my other jobs.      a couple of hours later, my supervisor calls me into his office and asked:   supervisor: did you swing the tap on tank 934?   me: yeah?   supervisor: did you close the finished wines tank?      it was then to my horror that i realised what i had done... at the end of the day, i pushed through 20,000l of unfinished wine that was eventually destined to be about $5 a bottle (cost), making that a $140,000 loss... bad... but in the big scheme of things... not the worse. however, i pumped that 20,000l of unfinished cheap crappy wine... into 150,000l  of $15 (cost) a bottle wine... making a total loss of $3,350,000.      i find out if i keep my job tomorrow night... my only saving grace all depends on if i've totally ruined the wine or if it can be re sold as some thing cheaper...  tl:dr pumped 20000l of crappy unfinished wine, into 150000l of finished wine costing about 3.3 mil if it cant be resold...      edit: words.... lts to l....  update:   well.... i've kept my job. my saving grace was one of two things:   one: i've never screwed up before, this year or the previous year i had worked here.  two: as /u/ripinpeppers pointed out, the percentage of wine i put into the tank didn't change it enough to have to create a new label for it, but it will more than likely change the price point it is sold at, and that won't be known until waaaaay down the process when they get a couple of wine peeps to taste it and say if it's any better/worse/some other wino snobbery than last years label. so at the end of the day, i could make the company money, or i could loose it, but luckily the wine is not a total wrote off. sadly this means no chateau tifu though (credit to /u/srslynotanaltguys for the name).      my supervisor, especially at the meeting i had earlier where i recieved a first and final warning, is still a bit pissed but had a great laugh at some of the wine puns here, so thank you guys for lightening the mood for me. a couple of the wine makers came out and had a chat to me and have told me there have been much bigger fus in the past which made me feel slightly better.   oh, and thank you for the gold 😄 so this actually happened 3 years ago when my daughter was 4 years old. it was a situation that started out terribly but actually ended up being a funny story my wife and i can now laugh about.... until today.   we adopted our cat from a local shelter before my daughter was born. he was an orange kitten named six. the shelter had named him six because he had six claws on one of his paws. we adopted him and changed his name to chase, because that's all this cat did. he chased his own tail, dogs, birds, other cats, etc.   i work from home, and every day i would drop my daughter off at preschool where she'd stay for 4 hours. when i returned to the house after dropping her off on this day, i opened the door to the house and chase raced outside. i didn't think much of it, because he'd frequently go outside in the afternoons and come back home around supper time.   a few hours after sitting at my computer working, i got up to get a drink out of the kitchen. i glanced out our front window and noticed a dead orange cat in the middle of our busy street. my heart sank, and i ran out to it. it was definitely dead, and i was so freaked out i panicked and ran into the house and grabbed a shoe box and put him in it. i called my wife at work, and she was devastated. chase was really more her cat than mine, as he always preferred her lap, and never really paid much attention to me unless he needed something. she told me she was leaving work early and would pick up some flowers and we could have a funeral for him after we picked up our daughter.   i didn't really know how we were going to tell our daughter. she was an animal lover, and chase slept with her every night. my stomach hurt just thinking about how this was going to hurt her.  so my wife comes home and she is crying, and i ask her if she wants to see him. she tells me she can't bear the thought of seeing chase dead, and just wants to go pick up our daughter so we can honor our precious cat and put him to rest.   when we pick up our daughter she can see her mommy has been crying and immediately asks what's wrong. my wife can barely get out to her what has happened before breaking down again, so i end up having to tell her, and my daughter starts crying in hysterics before i can even get all the words out. now, call me a puss if you must, but seeing my daughter cry like that made me cry.   we get home and while my wife continues to console my daughter by looking through old pictures of chase, i go out to our backyard and choose a spot to bury our beloved kitty. i dig the hole and go inside to let them know i was ready for our celebration of life for chase.   i bring the box out, and my wife and daughter are following close behind and my daughter is clenching a photo of him to her chest while sobbing. i feel horrible. i hug our daughter as she sobs on my chest and i start to tell the story of when we first adopted chase.   my wife and i are huddled with our daughter staring down at the box in the ground when all of the sudden an orange cat walks up and rubs his side along my wife's leg. i stop talking and my wife grabs the cat and yells, "oh my god! it's chase! what the hell?!" and looks at me like i am the scum of the earth. "didn't you check the dead cat for the six claws?!" i didn't. honestly, as weird as it may seem, it didn't even occur to me in the slightest that this might not be our cat. it was the same color and size, and i was so freaked out i didn't even consider for a minute that it wasn't him.  my daughter was beyond thrilled chase was still alive, but sad that someone had lost a kitty.  so, we ended up having a funeral for a cat that somebody had lost, even though we never ended up finding out who's cat it was. (we had put up flyers throughout the neighborhood with information.) a few days after this happened, i got a collar with tags for chase, so i never have to worry about this reoccurring with us or some other idiot, for that matter.   now my daughter is in 1st grade, and today she brought home a journal where on one page they had drawn a picture of a day that they felt very sad. my daughter drew a picture of me, my wife, her, chase, a box, and above it her teacher narrated the drawing with, "the day my dad lied and told me my cat died, even though he didn't."  tl;dr i thought our cat had died, although he hadn't, and my daughter still hates me for it.  there was a field trip today, and i was in the lab browsing reddit.  long story short they left without me.  thanks reddit.  edit: the teacher didnt attempt to make any contact with meso i'm new to this accounting job and fresh out of college. i'm not used to waking up earlier than 10am, and now i have to wake up at 6. unfortunately i'm in the habit of sleeping after midnight so i've been getting less than 5 or 6 hours of sleep most days. it's not too bad, but every day i get very tired at around 11am and 4pm.   well thankfully my company is very chill. they encourage you to get up and walk around, take a 10 or even 30 (rarely) minute break, no problem. obviously don't abuse it, be reasonable, but a 15 minute break every 2 hours is very reasonable.   so i started using 2 of my breaks every day to take a nap. except there aren't any safe places to nap in this office. there are conference rooms but i can't just take those because if someone needs them then it's a hassle. and i can't just sleep at my desk because that's not the best idea, obviously.   so there's 2 bathrooms on this floor. one is a normal bathroom with stalls and everything. the other is a private room. great bathroom, cleaned top-to-bottom daily. there's also a very nice chair in it. not sure why, but it's a very comfortable leather chair. if the door is closed at all then it's being used. so i go in there if i feel too tired, and take a 15 minute nap.   now this bathroom inside a customer support center. the other bathroom is very close by (15 second walk) so i'm not preventing anyone from going to the bathroom. so i go in, set an alarm, and sleep.   i've done that at least 10 times now. i always woke up on time, everything seemed fine.   today, i woke myself up 2 minutes before the alarm rang. i was snoring pretty loud. i don't normally snore but i guess when sitting up on a chair snoring is easier?  the fan in the bathroom is pretty loud and people in the customer service center are all talking anyways, so i thought nothing of it.   well, when i came out of the bathroom today, one of them joked at me and asked "had a nice nap?" to which i replied "haha yea..how'd you know?" she told me that i'm actually snoring in there every single day.   so every day i slept in there, my loud snoring was heard by the entire customer service team, above all their talking, above the bathroom fan. and then they would hear a quiet alarm ring, a fake bathroom flush, and then me walking out.   i think i'll start sleeping a bit more at home now...   **tl;dr slept in the bathroom at work during allowed breaks. everyone heard me snore, every time.**on the train on my daily morning commute i met my former teacher who was currently chatting with another middle aged woman i'd never seen before, but i just sat down with them and casually joined the conversation. at some point stranger asks my former teacher: "btw did you know that x and y are getting married?" – both x and y being former classmates of mine. and without further reflection i articulate what's been word on the street for a while: "ah yeah, that's because x is pregnant heh." silence. dumbfounded and sort of sore, stranger turns to me: "oh good that **i** get to know that too!" turns out stranger is x's mother -.-ok so i am the mother of a 12 boy.  today we were just hanging out and i thought we could catch up on some holiday movies on netflix.  so i say "there isn't anything on tv you want to just netflix and chill? " i had heard the saying on tv and social media a lot. his face turned bright red and he replied "what the hell is wrong with you?" i get mad at his response and ask him why not. basically we have a 20 min conversation about in my mind why i'm not good enough for him to hang out with, and in his mind why i'm not good enough to have sex with! i said things like "don't you love me and want to spend quality time with me?" finally he embarrassingly explained what it meant.... i said "do not tell your father."  edit: changed capitalization, didn't realize i hadn't capitalizes not as well.   tl;dr: today i unknowingly asked then begged my son to have sex with me.so 4 years ago i bought the star wars mmo called something along the lines of the old republic. shortly after the release it turned free to play but you were still able to subscribe at a monthly cost, which would grant you something called cartel coins. i was absolutely certain that i had turned off my subscription (i was 13 at the time) but as it turns out my older brother wanted to play the game today for some reason, he then burst out laughing telling me that ive got around 29.000 cartel coins (the real money currency) just for the sake of scale 5000 cartel coins cost around 55 dollars.  tl:dr i wasted around 320 dollars on a game subscription that i did not even know that i had acquired   edit- you were supposed to make me feel good about myself not make me sadthis fu actually happened on halloween, but i'm just getting time to post it now.  i don't go out on halloween because i'm in my mid 20s and i'm just not into going out on the same night as people who rage and get drunk on a holiday that was intended for children to enjoy. my neighborhood gets slammed with kids, and i enjoy handing out candy anyway so no big deal.  kids start showing up at around noon, and throughout the day i handed out over 350+ goodie bags that i made up with 4 pieces of candy in each. it was intense. the last of the kids showed up at around 10pm, right around the time that the hooligans started running around with shaving cream wreaking havoc. my neighbor across the street lost his cool and ended up calling the cops on the kids and they came by and parked two marked cars at the corner of my block for about an hour then they left. right around this time i notice my neighbor to the right is having a party. rather, their high school age daughter is having a party. these kids are all wasted, carrying on, but whatever. i was young once. as long as they stay over there it's cool.  so around 11:15 i decide to go out into my back yard to have a cigarette, but i walked through my front door to bring some trash to the cans and i was going to go through my gate into my backyard. as i'm turning the corner i hear a radio.  now i'm a cop. i know what a radio sounds like. i hear keys jingling and i hear a radio. it's dark though and i can't really see, but i make out the silhouette of a cop walking into my neighbors back yard. the keys, the radio, the shoulder patches from the local pd, and the reflection of the name badge that i caught a glimpse of made me sure that this was a cop.   i'm thinking in my head that these cops came back that were parked at the end of the block and noticed this party and were walking around my neighbors driveway to see what was going on in the back yard. i decided to go inside and watch what was going on from the window.  all of a sudden there are about 15 kids in the street in front of the house and i see the cop under a street light on his phone. he's sitting with a kid who is clearly black out drunk who can't move. i assumed he was calling to make sure this kid had a ride home and was going to be okay. i can hear his radio, and i notice he has a gun, a nightstick, the whole deal. it's occurring to me now that he's there clearing the party out, but i don't see a radio car anywhere. i'm thinking okay, maybe the call came over the radio and he knew my neighbors so he was coming by after his shift to tell them to cool it or something.  i then start hearing one of these kids asking the cop to mace him. i'm sitting here thinking okay, now i'm sure this isn't a costume. costumes don't come with mace. i decided to go into my backyard where i could get a better view and hear them better. so i'm sitting there and i decide to break out my camera and start filming this, because if this cop maces this kid he shouldn't be a fucking cop.  one of the kids in the group says something about the kid being 14 and then the kid is asking for more vodka before he gets maced. the cop then starts warning him that it really hurts and it isn't going to be funny. the kid keeps pressuring him and finally he folds. he maces this kid in the street in front of this house!  the kid starts screaming in agony, my neighbors daughter starts telling everyone to get back into the back yard, and this cop starts going with everyone.  i'm sitting in my back yard and i'm fucking astonished. i can't believe that i just saw a fucking cop mace an intoxicated 14 year old. he should have been making sure they weren't in the street carrying on at the very least. he was now going back into the party though which was really freaking me out because now i'm thinking that he's at a high school party drinking with his fucking firearm. having just seen him mace someone, i'm thinking that it's only a matter of time before he hands his gun to someone to "see" and he have a national news story about cops again.  i decide to call the local pd. i tell them who i am, where i live, and what i'm seeing. the guy on the phone freaked out. he said that there would be cops there in 5 minutes. 4 unmarked cars pull up to my house and i'm already standing outside. i show them the video of the cop macing the kid and they go to my neighbors house.  my heart is racing at this point because i can't believe what i just did. i'm thinking i should have gone over there before calling the cops, but i work in a different department and a lot of the guys out where i live don't like people from my department and being that he was drinking i thought he would just tell me to fuck off.  about 45 minutes go by and they have this cop in handcuffs and they're taking him out of the house. they come over to me with his gun belt and tell me they want to show me something. his gun is fake. his radio is real. his mace is real. his mag pouches are empty. his keys are just his keys. his baton is real.  i'm confused as hell and i asked them what the fuck is going on.   turns out, this kid's dad is a cop in the department. he's 19 and knows my neighbors daughter from his high school. he thought it would be a good idea to take his dads uniform and gun belt and wear it as a costume.  the local cops told me that i should have gone over there and seen what was going on before calling them. they ended up charging the kid with endangering the welfare of a minor for macing the drunk 14 year old. at least that's what they told me, but they're probably going to bring him in and then make his dad pick him up. i'm sure his dad is going to be in a fuck ton of trouble for letting his kid go out there with one of his uniforms and his gunbelt.   now my neighbors think i'm a douche bag for calling the cops on their party and getting their daughter's friend arrested. they're pissed that i called the cops on a party, they don't believe that i thought the guy was actually cop. now i have to worry about my car/house getting egged or worse. the local pd thinks i'm a douche bag for turning in one of their cops even though he wasn't actually a cop, it's the principle. all in all, a pretty spooky halloween.  tl;dr: saw a cop at my neighbors house late on halloween night. neighbors 18 year old  daughter was having a party and all kids were wasted. watched cop mace a drunk 14 year old. called local pd. turns out he was a kid wearing his dads gear. local pd and neighbors pissed at me.  edit: used the wrong "they're". had to fix it before the grammar police called me in.  edit 2: everyone is asking for the video! [here is part of it.]() i had to cut the end off because i started talking and i mentioned the name of the police department and my neighbors address. i don't want that shit online so i'm not posting it. unfortunately that was when there was most of the screaming. my iphone sucks at video in low light, but you can see what's going on.  last edit: thanks for the gold! my inbox is over loaded. i'm getting pms calling me a cunt and a piece of shit. i'm getting messages saying good job, other one's saying i'm a nosy piece of shit. some of them are saying i'm bad for not charging the kids all with mip others are saying i'm bad for getting involved at all. make up your fucking mind people!  **last last edit**: i'm getting tons of crazy pms. i'm getting people asking me to do interviews for articles, i'm getting people from /r/protectandserve pressuring me to send them photos of my uniform and police id, i'm getting people going through my post history and trying to identify me, and i'm getting people threatening to "doxx" me and post all my info online. i didn't think this post would blow up the way it has, and unfortunately i'm getting way more heat than i am comfortable with. in retrospect i probably shouldn't have even been posting on reddit, but i've seen other cops from my department do it so i thought it would be okay. i'm really second guessing that thought process now. it's for that reason that i've deleted my post history and i'm going to be deleting my reddit account. i don't want to get into trouble for this and i don't want to have some of the local cops knocking on my door or iab asking me questions because of some article they read in the paper or on facebook.   thanks a ton to the people who gave me gold, sorry it's going to go to waste. i also want to say thank you to all of the people who left positive comments and to all of you who support your local law enforcement. i'll leave this post up though so people can continue to enjoy it. right off the bat, two thing. 1) as with all things, this didn't happen today, but a couple of weeks ago. 2) i'm on mobile so things might be a bit fucky with the formatting.   last weekend my sister and her husband were heading out of town and i got to be the responsible uncle for my 10 year old niece, who we'll call emily. which is super awesome. i get to see my sister and brother in law a lot so i've built up a pretty good relationship with emily over the past few years. so saturday morning they drop her off at my apartment, give hugs all around, and hit the road. emily gets a bit flustered, but does that worry me? fuck no. i'm the cool uncle, and i got the prescription for this panic attack. i pack her up into the car, and we hit the mall. we grab breakfast, and spend all day hitting one shop right after another. by the time we get to build-a-bear she's on cloud 9.  we waste the whole day away and get home. as soon as we get through the door she crawls on to the sofa and is out like a light. i grab a blanket and cover her up.   so i waste a bit of time playing halo, keep an eye on her, make sure she's alright. about 5 she wakes up, and i go ahead and make dinner. and then smooth cool uncle strikes again. boom! ice cream for desert. and what goes good with ice cream? movies. blazing saddles. loves it. spaceballs. even more. princess bride? fucking rolling. i've got this kid in the palm of my hand.  10 o clock rolls around. bed time. she's begging and pleading "don't make me go to sleep! more movies!" and yes, i want to be the cool uncle, but i also have to be the responsible uncle. so i call my sister. "emily wants to stay up and watch movies, what do?" and she says, it's fine as long as she gets plenty of sleep before they come get her tomorrow night.   i'm digging it, so i tell emily to go pick out another movie, and go back to talking to my sister. "how's the trip? everything alright? blah blah blah." as i'm still on the phone emily comes running back up to me, movie in hand. and out of all the movies on my shelf which one does she pick out?  poltergeist.  what fucking 10 year old wants to see poltergeist?  so i go back to talking with my sister. "uh, there's no way i can let her watch this." and she responds, "no it's ok, but if she gets too scared, movie goes off and she goes to bed." and against my better judgement, i let her. i did tell her it was a scary movie before we started, but she just have me that thousand mile smile and said she wanted a scary movie.  alright kid.  to my surprise, she did fairly well through most of the movie. she huddled into her blanket and let out a few gasps and yelps every now and then, but every time i asked if she was fine she just smiled and said yeah more movie.  until. the pool scene. for some reason the skeletons in the pool freaked her the fuck out over the rest of the movie. so i took my sister's advice, i turned the movie off, switched it over to boomerang, and tried to call her down.  and here's where the fuck up comes.  as i'm calming her down she keeps talking about how scary the skeletons were and she hated skeletons and started crying a bit, so i'm trying to talk her down, and thanks to you fuckers, i say the first thing that pops into my mind.  "it's ok honey, skeletons are fine, everyone has a skeleton inside them, even you."  and in that moment. as her eyes got wider and wider, and tears starting flowing like niagara falls. i knew. i fucked up.  almost instantly she's in full panic mode. shaking, full on bawling, screaming, and then she barfed. ice cream and pizza melted together into the fibers of my sofa. i'm in full lock down mode now trying my best to take control of the situation. it ain't happening. so i have to call my sister who instructs me to take her to our mom's house so she can take care of her. i bundle her up as best as i can, and she is dead silent for the entire car ride over. i passed her off to my mom, and went back home to salvage my couch.   sunday my sister called and said she picked her up and emily wouldn't say a word about anything that happened all day saturday. she told me she wasn't as mad as she should be, because i did get the go ahead from her for a scary movie, but i was a dumbass for telling her she had a skeleton. wat?  friday i got a call back from my sister, telling me emily wouldn't stop talking about going to the doctor to "get her skeleton out", leading to several conversations about why emily had to keep her skeleton inside her. followed by my sister telling me that she tried to bring emily back over to my apartment and was met by several tantrums.  tldr: mr. skeltal scared my niece with too much calcium and reset three years of trust bulding.  edit: i saw a couple of people mention why she freaked out about skeletons being inside of her at 10 years old. i called my sister and asked her to pry a bit more info out of emily. apparently she took what i said to mean she actually had one of the skeletons from the movie inside her. like a pile of fresh fleshy bones just hanging inside of her. i would have thought that through a bit more that night if i hadn't been freaking out myself trying to calm her down. so thankfully she isn't freaked out about her skeleton it's just spoopy movie skeletons she has a problem with.  double edit: obligatory whoo thanks for the gold!!!!  triple edit: i've gotten quite a few replies asking if she's "special". she is not. she was just freaked out from the movie, and misunderstood what i said, which freaked her out even more. i've gotten an update from my sister and it seems she's already starting to understand what i was saying, and she does not have a poltergeist skeleton inside her. just her normal old skeleton she was born with.to begin, i masturbated at work. yup, don't blame me.   my girlfriend decided that sending me an exposed picture of herself was a good idea. like any other straight man, a naked picture of your so gets you a tad frisky. in combination with the animal urge i also needed a shit so thought i could kill two birds with one stone.   the bathroom i went to has two cubicles and three urinals. i take my seat in the first cubicle and when the coast is clear, do my business. i. spunked. a lot. i'm not talking your ickle dribble, i'm talking volcanic eruption. i cleaned up as best as i could and buttoned up my trousers. as i was leaving and washing my hands i passed one of my senior managers, a nice bloke but stern. we greet each other as we pass and i walk off, checking my phone until he rushes back out of the bathroom and says to me with no subtlety whatsoever, "what is that mess?"   i freeze and accompany him as he walks me back into the toilet and asks which cubicle i was in. i realised i could get out of the sticky situation and replied that i was in the second cubicle.   he drags me to the second cubicle where someone had previously been and had there was smeared shit on the toilet ring with a puddle of piss on the floor.   tldr - sticky situation turns shitty real quick.   edit: i should add i cleaned up my jizz perfectly; i just froze and though i hadn't.  edit2: disclaimer - not only straight men can get that frisky feeling from a picture of their so. throwaway because boyfriend knows my reddit account.  bf and i are both 19 and we have been dating for three years.  tonight i went over to his house to play some steam games (i finally got a job and decided to play some games that he recommended), and he wants to test them out on his new laptop.  he decides to show me surgeon simulator.  having had brain surgery a few times, i am absolutely terrified of anything having to do with my noggin organ.  but i say oh fuck, why the hell not.  it's cartoonish, right?  no big deal.  after a nutritious dinner of corn dogs fresh from the oven, i turn my head and he says "hey, nora, look."  i turn and he has the poor patient's brain lolling about the tool tray and the screen is positively spurting with blood.  i manage to vomit all over his new laptop, his jeans, and his carpeting.  (the dog managed to move away).  he projectile vomits into my hair.  reddit, tifu bad.  edit:  jesus fuck, reddit.  front page.  i love you.growing up i was a stereotypical boy. played with little toy guns and cars, peed standing up (via a spectacular penis), loved shop class, had a preoccupation with my female teachers... you get the idea. having the appropriate amount of external protrusions, holes, and inclinations my gender and sexuality were always strongly "male." then puberty hit.  while i'd always been attracted to women (and still am) i developed a sexual interest in men as well. it grew over the years and was kind of awkward; you know that weird feeling that you get when dealing with people you're attracted to? well i started having that with almost everyone. my platonic friendships felt... uncomfortable... and by my early 20's i'd pretty much stopped developing new ones.  around this time i took the plunge and with the help of the internet started having sex with men. i'd been having sex with women since i was 17 and it was great, but for the first time since i started dating i was single and there was just something about being penetrated that i really enjoyed. sometimes it was a good experience, other times it was terribly painful. i chalked it up to "welp, that's buttsex for ya" and took it in stride.  in my mid 20's i was hospitalized with severe pain in my lower intestines.  i never had any intestinal problems before but suddenly i was passing blood with my stool and thought that i'd somehow perforated my colon. since i hadn't had anything inserted in a couple years at that point i was clueless as to what could have caused it and a little embarrassed; it turned out that my mother was the only person able to take me to the hospital and she insisted she stay until they figured out what was wrong. nothing more uncomfortable than looking your mother in the face while a nurse inserts a few fingers into your ass to see if some foreign object is jammed in there. i ended up spending most of my hospital visit sedated due to the ridiculous amount of constant pain. after a week i was discharged with the prognosis of an ulcerated colon and put on an appropriate diet. somewhat regularly since then i've noticed blood when i poop. this is regardless of being penetrated or not. for the last decade i thought this was just a normal thing due to colon ulcers.  this morning i woke up feeling rather horny for buttplay, and being unable to locate my buttplug decided to knuckle-bust the old starfish. i've literally never put my own fingers in my ass beyond the very first knuckle so this was a new one by me. for the most part it felt like any other rectum... except for a "mushy" spot about two inches in. at first i thought this was an ulcer and i'd have to abandon ship, but there was no blood... and rather than hurting when i poked it, it felt good!  could this be my "male g spot" i'd heard so much about? i continued to prod with cautious curiosity, slowly building confidence and speed until the neighbor's dog startled me and... ouch! my finger went "through" the soft spot. i pulled it out immediately. then came the blood. i was concerned, but there wasn't really any pain after a few minutes - i still went to the hospital though.  i decided to give a fake name due to the circumstances, and as a result the doctor didn't have my old records. she asked me some routine questions and i explained what happened while i was being cleaned up, we made some smalltalk and joked around a bit to lighten the mood while she got the glove and lube ready, then in went her fingers. she pretty quickly found the spot, which wasn't sore at all by this point, and a strange look came across her face as she asked me, "did you have gender reassignment surgery at some point?"  i assured her i've always been male - having gotten my penis into a variety of embarrassing situations as far back as i can remember i think i'd be aware if it wasn't around at some point. she assured me that in her professional opinion i have a vaginal tube which opens to my rectum, and that although she wasn't a gynecologist she was pretty sure what i'd poked with my finger was a sort of hymen. she asked me if i wanted x-rays to confirm. being rather surprised (and poor) i passed. besides, i know where to go for answers.  it all makes sense now. i could never figure out why my mother was so adamant about being present during my hospital visit for intestinal pain all those years ago. while when i was a child my parents and the doctor would step out of the room and talk after each physical i had prior to coming back in and telling me i was superbly healthy. i don't know that this changes anything about my self-image - i've always been pretty comfortable with my sexuality and feel gender identity to be a rather secondary aspect of my personality. i still feel just as male as i did yesterday. nonetheless i intend to confront my parents about this over the weekend and figure out wtf is up. although not an outright lie i feel this would be a huge crime of omission on their part, and if it's the case that i was surgically altered to emphasize one specific gender i'm going to be rather pissed.  **tl;dr**: *i accidentally discovered i may have been born an intersex person, and my parents may have actively hidden that from me for my entire life.*  edit: fixed!

[part 2 is here! you can stop flooding my inbox with requests.](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2dwve9/tifu_by_not_simply_titling_this_the_mangina/)so the story goes... i'm male and i posted "i'm pregnant!" on my facebook wall for april 1st and things spiraled out of control.  but first there are a few things you should know about me.  1. i'm 100% male, testicles penis and everything. 2. i have a gf that my family doesn't like. 3. my family is extremely conservative.  so later in the day my mother calls and when i pick up she is hysterical, screaming, and is basically disowning me. i'm bewildered and entirely confused so try i ask her through the screaming, what did i do wrong?  she says "you got your girlfriend pregnant", and that's when it dawned on me.  my little super obviously a joke facebook post on april first saying "i'm pregnant!" actually tricked my family leading them to chain call each other to gossip about how i got my girlfriend pregnant.  long story short, my whole extended family is pissed off at me and thinks i got my girlfriend pregnant, i almost got disowned, and i won april 1st this year. fml....ok, so this was a year ago, but since i am new to reddit i thought you'd all enjoy this.   i teach acting for a professional actor training program in theatre, and i had a class of jr. high kids last year. so, one day i was teaching the concept of subtext, and that words can mean just about anything you want them to mean. sometimes it's not about what you say but how you say it. to which a boy student replied: "you mean like innuendo?"  me: "not where i was going, but yes, just like innuendo."  multiple students in unison: "what's that?"  me: (oh, no) well, it's when you say something that is not sexual in nature, but by the way you say it, it sounds sexual.  same boy student: "yeah, like saying 'that's what she said...'"  group of students: "i don't get it."  (this is when i really start to realize i might be in trouble)  me: (sighing) "well, when someone says something not sexual, you can blurt out "that's what she said..." at the end and it kinda makes it dirty.  (giggling)  girl student:  "oh my god, that is awesome"   i'll tell you, if these students grabbed onto any other of the concepts i teach as fast as they got this, my teaching tactics would be of legend. these kids turned into the most dirty, ruthless, sexual wit monsters the rest of class. they were fully loaded with an amazing new skill...and i was fresh bait.  me to student: "i need you to be bigger!"  random student yells out: "that's what she said!"  me to another student: "you are rushing this moment. slow it down."  random student yells out: "that's what she said!"  etc. you get the idea.   so, here is when this comes back to bite me. fast forward a week. just before class, one of my students comes up to me. she is the normally really quiet one. shy. completely unassuming. sits in the back. rarely talks. the kind you usually forget about you know? she comes up to me with a mischievous grin on her face and says:  "soooo, i kinda got into trouble this week. i got my first detention"  me: "oh wow, really?! what did you do?" (she then proceeded to tell me this amazing story while i stood in complete shock)  girl student: "so, i was in band the other day (she plays the clarinet) and our teacher was working with us on group sections in class and when he was working with mine he got really frustrated and shouted 'finger this harder!' to which i accidentally blurted out "that's what she said!" the entire class stopped talking and went silent. my teacher then told me to see him after class, and then gave me detention."  i stood in silence, not knowing whether to feel proud, or afraid for my job. stunned, i asked her, "do you even know the meaning of what you just said?"  girl: "yep!" (then she walked away)  outside of the fact that this might have been the best delivery of that joke i have ever heard, thank god she only got detention...and i still have a job.  kids today are messed up.  tl;dr: taught my teenage students about "that's what she said", helped one student earn her first detention like a boss.   edit: cleaned up formatting.  edit 2: just a small bit of perspective. many of my students are homeschooled. they've spent much of their lives training in dance, singing, acting, etc. for many, this class is their only real regular social outlet.   sweet! front page. thanks guys!for valentine's day, my boyfriend wanted to go to an adult store and buy some things to enhance our sex life. i, being the adventurous girlfriend that i am, was totally down for it.  among many other items, we purchased two different butt plugs, one was a ball and one was a christmas tree shaped plug. both of these are not supposed to be able to be sucked up into your butt.   bullshit.  so, we used the christmas tree shaped one first. he put it in and went back to having sex and i could feel him hitting the butt plug when he would thrust and it felt great, so i was like heck yea!   then, i didn't feel the butt plug being hit anymore. i told my boyfriend it fell out and we stopped and searched the floor, under the bed, even out into the hallway and bathroom, thinking maybe he kicked it when it fell out. we didn't find it.  we chalked it up to the room being dark and figured we would find it later.  so, he grabs the ball shaped butt plug. he attempts to put it in. the ball has a flat, circle shaped stopper that is supposed to prevent it front sliding all the way in.  i lube up the butt plug and tell my boyfriend to shove it in! don't be shy! so he does and got way too excited. he starts screaming. i had no idea what was going on. i was screaming at him to tell me why he was screaming. he tells me the butt plug went all the way inside me.   i start crying.  he's running around saying things like why? oh god why? and he's apologizing.  i'm yelling at him and asking him why he did this (like he purposely did it, but i was freaking out). i am squatting on the bathroom floor trying to push this thing out of me. i have two fingers in my butt and i'm desperately trying to get a grip on it. i'm crying still. the boyfriend is asking me repeatedly if i got it out, i'm yelling at him to shut up.  total chaos.  i pushed like i was giving birth and i finally got a grip on the ball part and pull it out.  it was foul.  i take a steaming hot shower. i am so relieved. beyond relieved.  my boyfriend now knows that sexy time is done. so he starts cleaning up our bedroom. i asked him to find the other butt plug, the big one. he comes into the bathroom and, very timidly, tells me he has torn the room apart, even taken the mattress off the bed frame and cannot find the butt plug.   i knew what he was suggesting. i squatted, did an internal check, nothing.  he told me to get dressed and took me to the er.  so, we tell everyone at the er what's going on. one nurse says to me... my husband begs me all the time to do that and i tell him absolutely not! this is why!   so they have me change into a gown and then the er doc comes in. she says...  i heard the story, are you sure you searched everywhere?  we told her yes and then i told her my butt keeps clenching itself and i feel like i have to poop. she told me to try but nothing came out.  they did an x-ray and it didn't show the butt plug. the doc also did an internal exam and couldn't feel it. she said she believed it was inside of me because my butt kept clenching itself. she told me that some companies design the butt plug to show up on x-rays for this reason, but others don't and plastics and rubber and silicone may not show.   she told my boyfriend that she hopes we had fun and are happy because i'm going to have to go into surgery. she said they were going to admit me and get me into the operating room stat.   dude, i was like dry heaving. i was beyond freaking out.  i all of a sudden felt like i had to poop again. the doc told me to try but not strain.  i sat on the toilet and rocked back and forth and prayed like i've never prayed before.   i pooped.  the nurse had given me a plastic hat shaped tray to put in the toilet in case i pooped out the butt plug, but i didn't put it in the toilet. so, after i pooped, i looked in the toilet and it just looked like a huge turd. so i was bummed and figured it was just poop.   as i'm reaching down to pull my pants up, the toilet starts to flush on its own, before i can really inspect the poop. i had to make a split second decision. find out for sure if the butt plug was in there or let the docs go in me and find out.  i reached my bare hand into that toilet faster than i've ever been capable of moving before. sure enough, i felt the rubbery butt plug. it was completely covered in poop.  it was the most disgusting thing ever. so now i'm carrying this giant poop covered butt plug in one hand and trying to pull up my jeans with the other and my hospital gown is falling off. i drop the butt plug into the sink, wash my hands like 5 times, get my pants on.   i run out to the er desk and announce that i've pooped it out. they give me gloves. i go back in and attempt to clean it off. i washed the skin off my hands.   i went back to my er exam room and got dressed. my boyfriend was like yes! we're leaving! i was like... i want chinese food, now.  the doc came in and asked if i pooped and i said yep, the but plug is right there. she removes the paper towels and examines it. she was shocked by the size.  the nurse came in and i was like... i'm not trying to show off, but it's over there. she was like... by all means, show it off, i want to see.  my poop covered butt plug was on display and the whole er staff was rushing to see it.  i felt like a superhero.   the doc was like... you literally just saved yourself from going through surgery.   i was like... that's how i roll.  we left the er, got chinese, and i gave my boyfriend head to make up for the interruption earlier.  happy valentines day.  p.s. - i took a pic of the poop covered butt plug. they actually asked me if i wanted to keep it haha. my boyfriend was like ... burn it.  http://imgur.com/a/0llhn  discharge papers for the skeptical. http://imgur.com/a/uabzt  found the box while cleaning up our room this morning. it looks like someone tried to rob us, my boyfriend went crazy trying to find the "missing" butt plug.   http://imgur.com/a/1zuqz  4.75"  http://imgur.com/a/vait0  the one i was able to get out myself: http://imgur.com/a/jzvm5  tl;dr: ended up spending valentines night in the er due to a butt plug stuck inside my bum.so this happened around a month ago, but i only just gained enough confidence to post it here. i'm a 6'3 18 year old from sydney, and my 5 year old cousin and i like to take walks along the boardwalk at darling harbour. during these walks he likes to drop behind me a bit, and then run up to me. when i hear him coming, i spin around and grab him, spinning my cousin through the air and back down in front of me. anyway, i heard my little cousin running up behind me, so i turned around and swung him up into the air... only to hear (mid-swing), a raspy voice exclaim: "put me down you giant fuck!" i saw the little person. everything went into slow motion, and at the arc of the swing, i let go, causing him to eat the boardwalk. needless to say he wasn't very happy and i had an angry crowd demanding i explain myself.  tl;dr - mistook a little person for my 5 year old cousin, swung and accidentally threw him much to his distaste.  edit: holy shit, i did not expect this to blow up overnight, thank you all! and whoever the amazing soul was that gifted me gold, please contact me so i can thank you properly. also, thank you for letting me come home and laugh my arse off at these comments/puns. i love you, people of reddit.i was taking a two hour history final in a tightly packed room. the desks were barely a foot apart. somehow the desk behind me was pushed up to my chair and the girl behind me was bending down over her exam. i straightened up and stretched my neck by moving it back and looking at the ceiling in a swift motion (to crack my neck). my head nailed that girl on her head and she was so surprised she slammed her head into the desk. she down fell out of her chair holding her forehead and somehow pulled the desk down on top of her. she was alright and finished her exam. (first time posting on tifu)  edit: and i was very, very sorry.  edit: [diagram](http://imgur.com/d0bpzz7)  edit: because people doubt the existence of stretching necks. i stretch this way because it straightens my neck and cracks it. i have horrible posture so leaning my head back kinda fixes the orientation. plus it feels nice. just lean your head back all the way and stare at the ceiling for a few seconds.  edit: because too many people are hurting themselves. to do this correctly just lean your head all the way back and stare at the ceiling.  tl;dr during an exam i reverse-head-butted a girl behind me by stretching so as to crack my neck; she ended up on the groundthis was about 2 weeks ago but new info about the story made me want to post it.   i work at an industrial waste water treatment plant, and one of the things we need to monitor is the gasses in the manholes outside.  our meters test for h2s, co, o2, and lel (lower explosive limit of methane).  for testing these manholes we have a little air vacuum that we use to pull air from the lower portions of the holes to test.  high h2s levels are deadly.   (here's 2 pictures of what our equipment looks like  http://imgur.com/a/km0zs)  now i was working 5 days in a row with 12 hour shifts,  and i like food. the day before my shifts  i made a nice triple batch of chili, not just any chili though,  spiced italian sausage with extra hot seasoning and extra beans kind of chili. you can probably guess what that does to the digestive system...  on the 3rd day of work, after eating maybe 2 bowls of chili a day, i went to take manhole readings on the street with my vehicle.  i have the gas meter hooked up to the vacuum and the vacuum is pumping whilst sitting on my lap while the hose is falling between my legs.  feeling a nice fart coming on i give a nice push, letting out the fumes of the chili only diet of the last 2-3 days.  the vacuum hose, sitting between my legs, picks up plenty of the gasses and sends them to the gas monitor.  the monitor is astounded at the levels of gas it's receiving and goes berserk with its alarms.  all of the gasses that it monitors were over the reading levels (except for o2, that went under level), and threw the entire monitor out of whack, so i couldn't take my manhole readings.  i shut it down and set it to the side for later.  now today i've learned that the gas monitor that i had farted into needs to go back to the company to get recalibrated because our calibrations aren't making it work properly...  my farts potentially killed a 700$ piece of equipment...  tl;dr: my manhole smells worse than the others...  -edits-   we have the monitors fresh air calibrated daily and have them recalibrated elsewhere by the hse head every 2 months. we keep the monitors calibrated properly so the readings are on point.   found the reading limits for the gas meter  h2s ppm: 0-200  co ppm: 0-1000  o2 %: 0-30  lel %: 0-100  as for the levels of gas it recieved from my concentrated fart, i don't remember what some of them were,  but the lel % was at 100%, and the co went over range.   good grief, gilded?? thank you kind stranger!   really enjoying most of the comments too  :p ok, my first ever post but this has to be the funniest most awful mistake i have ever made. i was composing a message on fb to my sister in law with a pic of her wedding dress in it from a dress fitting she had. i could not find where my photos were on the family laptop so went in to a folder that was marked viber downloads thinking it might be in there. no mini pics appeared on the screen, just little text boxes. i clicked on the first one and it opened up straight into the fb message to my sister in law but i didn’t know that yet. i was shocked to see a pic of my husband holding his bits on screen but remembers the pic from previously. he had an infection and sent me a photo of the infection because he was doing an awful job describing it over the phone.  i suddenly remembers i was composing a fb post to my sister in law..... there is was in all its glory.... of course she was anxiously awaiting the pics of her dress and so obviously opened it the second it came in to her in box. i laughed, then i cried, then i screamed and then laughed again.   i then explained the pic as she had seen it but not replied. we laughed about it. when i told my husband what had had happened he stood up and said ' for fuck sake' and went to the pub. he later saw the funny side but for the last two days he has been letting off loud cringing noises at random.  ok reddit, unlike other stories this happened today! like a few hours ago. grammar sucks, i'm sorry. so i live in the great state of texas, where everybody and their mother has guns. so i've been wanting a go-pro for a while and was a little short on cash so i decided to sell one of my guns and go buy my gopro. anywho i find a buyer and decide to meet up at a local chicken place parking lot. cool. i get to the parking lot of the place and see two gentlemen in a vehicle and they look like they're waiting for something, cool i found the buyer. i pull next to the driver side and get off my truck and look at the driver and say hello. he replies and says hello as well. ok, so this whole time i'm thinking he's buying the gun so i open my back door and proceed to pull out my gun. the look of horror on this guys face as i try to hand the gun over to him and jokingly said go ahead and try 'er out there's a round in the chamber (was a joke chamber and tube were empty) ok... so now the passenger is studdering something and the driver is just staring at me with his mouth open. so i asked you got the money right? then boom it clicked! i got the wrong guy! shit shit shit i said i was sorry and noped the hell outta there. eventually the guy  who was gonna buy the gun called me telling me that he saw the whole thing happened and gave me an extra $5 for a giving him a good laugh.  edit 1: gun was empty peoplei've waited 16 months since marrying my wife to get my us permanent residency. i was finally travelling today to finalise everything. i hand him the sealed packet that he has to inspect, he looks it over stoically, silently. all of a sudden he extends his arm towards me, hand up, palm facing me. without thinking i high five him. his hand is limp. i knew immediately i had done wrong. a look of confusion and anger flashes across his face. those in the queue behind me fell silent. "follow me sir". turns out he was about to demonstrate how i give my fingerprints correctly.  i finished the process in a locked room with a different officer and no doubt a lot more questions than i would have otherwise had to endure.  edit &amp; bonus tifu: so when i had to go to the embassy to present my evidence for them to make a final decision i had another fuck up. i don't know if anyone has been to the us embassy in london but they have a little security room outside the building with an xray and guards etc and big heavy doors. i've just been through the xray and i'm struggling with my belt and my bag and i'm pushing on the heavy door with a single finger and it won't open (obviously) so naturally i start looking for a [door release]( http://www.jwsltd.co.uk/index.asp?function=productimagewindow&amp;closedelay=20000&amp;src=http://www.jwsltd.co.uk/ekmps/shops/timwainer/images/-door-release-exit-switch-525-p[ekm]300x300[ekm].gif) , see a switch on the door frame, press it, and all the lights turn off. fucking great. i was convinced they would decline my green card on the grounds of stupidity.  edit: for those wondering, green card and permanent resident are the same thing.  edit: please res tag me as the inappropriate high five guy (or whatever you want) and say hello to me when you see me in other subs! makes my day when that happens!so this story actually happened yesterday, for what it's worth. i've been on a new diet/exercise regime for the last few weeks, and every now and then i get really hungry. i'm obsessively counting calories, so i was scouring the cabinets looking for something low-cal to eat. entire can of marinated jalapenos for only 40 calories? bingo! so i eat the entire can of jalapenos, and go about my day. two hours later, i'm browsing the internet on the couch when i suddenly realize i must make an immediate sortie to the toilet, as bad things are about to happen.  i pull down my pants just in time to unleash a torrent of pepper oil diarrhea. my stomach is churning, and my asshole is on fire. i sit on the john for a while until the pain subsides. as soon as a i stand up, i realize that i've shit not *into* the toilet, but rather all over the back of it. fuck. now i suddenly understand how it happens. *now i'm one of those people.*  horrified by the mess all over the toilet and all over my backside, i tip toe out of the bathroom to the cabinet under the sink, and grab a baby wipe in one hand, and a clorox wipe in the other. cue the fuck up.  absconding back into the bathroom, i promptly forget which wipe was in which hand. the mistake is readily apparent once my anus is ignited into a broiling agony that rivals the deepest pits of hell. shoving a steak knife up my ass would have been a walk in the park compared to this torment.  so, i start screaming and my partner comes running, only to find me clutching my shit-covered butt in a shit-covered bathroom, sobbing. a bit much for a month old relationship...  tl;dr - confused the wipes, wrecked ma pipes.there are a lot of stray cats near where i live. one of them, who some of my friends have named troubles, is actually quite friendly unlike the others. i'm walking to work (about a 2 min walk from my front door), and notice troubles sitting on the dirt path, sunbathing. he sees me, and meows. i of course, meow back at him, which leads to him walking over to me. i start petting him, and he rubs himself against my leg, purring etc. 20 minutes go by, and i'm still hanging out and playing with troubles. i am now late for work. i get to work, and understandably my boss demands to know why i was late. i'm then berated for being a "child" after i explained that the reason i was late, is i was distracted by a cat.  tl;dr: i, a 23 y/o man was late for work because i couldn't resist playing with a friendly kitty.  edit: i left early for work, because i was gonna make coffee there, so even after 20 minutes of pussy petting, i ended up only being about 5-6 minutes late.so this actually happened yesterday. my husband and i were making dinner and started play-fighting. i tried to pinch hus butt, he pinned my arm and started tickling me, and i went to slap him lightly on the cheek. as my hand was approaching his face, i suddenly remembered i've been growing my nails, and they're long enough to do some damage. i didn't want to hurt him! so did i stop my hand? of course not...it was too close to stop the contact, so i did what any sane person would do. i curled my fingers in so they wouldn't scratch him....into a fist...  and punched my husband in the face.last night, i meant to go to bed early, because i had to get up this morning at five to help my grandpa sort calves we were selling. i went to bed at 1130, but proceeded to browse reddit until four. i only got like 30 min of sleep, and ended up being exhausted during the sorting.     i was so tired that my reaction times were crap, and didn't get out of the way of an angry mama cow soon enough. she head-butted me up against the feedbunk and cracked 4 of my ribs. :(     i guess this gives me time to play fallout 4 for the next few weeks... tl;dr: stayed up too late, reaction time was crap, broke ribs.debated about creating a throwaway for this one, but decided to kind of just embrace my past. so like a lot of tifu stories, this happened a while ago.   this was eight years ago when i worked at a megaplex movie theater in orlando. it was a summer day and i was tearing tickets. usually ticket-rippers switched off after two hour shifts, but i enjoyed getting paid to just stand at the podium, doodle on theater schedules, and pretty much do nothing, so i usually volunteered to just rip tickets for my entire eight hour shift. anyways, it was summer and it was a particularly hot and muggy day in florida, so a lot of the female customers were wearing short shorts, tank tops, etc. like any horny seventeen year old male, this was all rather relevant to my interests and i got to the point where i needed to release the tension that had built up throughout the day.   towards the end of my shift, i took a fifteen minute break and went into one of the handicap restrooms to jerk off (the nice restrooms with a single toilet, sink, and where you can lock the door). now when i do the deed, i like to be laying down. don’t ask me why, it’s just something i’ve always done since i was little. i guess i like to be able to stretch out my legs and i can also finish quicker that way. since time was of the essence here, when i got into the handicap restroom i laid out on the floor and proceeded to jerk it. they cleaned the restrooms regularly and i’m not much of a germaphobe, so the fact that it was a restroom floor wasn’t an issue. anyways, i guess in my haste in getting in and getting off, i didn’t properly lock the door. to this day i don’t know why the door didn’t lock. i can only assume i didn’t turn the latch all the way. about half way through my jerk off session, the door opened and one of my female co-workers came in to clean. now i was laying on the ground along the wall that the hinges to the door were closest to, so when she opened the door and pushed it inwards, she didn’t see me at first because i was hidden on the other side of the door. she managed to enter the restroom without seeing me laying there on the floor behind her with my pants down. i knew i was dead in the water and it was only a matter of seconds before she would turn around. so i had to think fast. at the time i had recently watched some cnn documentary about kids with epilepsy. as the girl turned, i started convulsing on the ground and pretending to be having a seizure. the girl yelled “oh my god!” as i just lay there shaking violently on the ground and staring off into space. she ran out of the bathroom and started screaming in the lobby for someone to help. as soon as she stepped out, i quickly pulled up my boxers to at least conceal my penis. luckily the sheer terror of the door opening killed a good 75% of my erection on the spot, so i like to think it didn’t look like i had a boner. on the bathroom floor i debated how to proceed. i knew people would be entering any second. i then realized i was at the point of no return.   the assistant manager of the theater soon burst into the bathroom and i continued to convulse on the floor. he kind of just knelt by my side and put his had on my shoulder as i continued to shake there like an idiot. i mean there wasn’t much he could have done. an ambulance arrived in literally three minutes. when the paramedics came in, i decided it was time to “snap out of it” and so i stopped convulsing and just started to grovel on the floor and pretend to not know where i was. they put me on a stretcher and wheeled me through the lobby to their vehicle. a good sized crowd had formed at this point. they were about to take me away in the ambulance, but i got off the stretcher and insisted that i was fine. i made up some story about having had seizures my entire life and that this happened to me a couple times every year. i kept insisting that i was fine and was able to talk the paramedics into leaving.   the theater had my mom as an emergency contact so she eventually came and took me home. i could never tell my parents what really happened, so to this day they think i really had a seizure. in the following months i had to take several neurological tests, had to do several overnights at the hospital, and was put on a few medications (that i only pretended to take when in reality i flushed the pills down the toilet). thank god for health insurance. in retrospect, it would have been better to have just gotten caught jerking off then to have had to go through all the lies, doctor appointments, and medical bullshit. this is where the true tifu aspect of this story lies. after a while it looked like “the seizure” was just a freak one-time thing and it finally all kind of just went away.  i ended up working at that theater for another couple years and people were always really nice to me and thought i was just some poor schmuck who had a seizure while trying to take a shit.  tl;dr: pretended to have a seizure to get out of getting caught masturbating at workmy dad is a professor at a university and not originally from the usa which means he's twice over not hip with lingo. therefore he learns all his hip lingo from my two brothers and me!   so being great sons we decide to mess with him and tell him 'touching tips' is the new way of saying connecting on linkedin. you know, "let's touch tips" = "connect with me" "have we touched tips?" = "have we connected on linkedin?" etc etc.   fast forward to yesterday when he's meeting a younger guy to work in his lab... i get an angry call from him later saying that he ended the interview with something like "all sounds good, have we touched tips?"  so this actually happened on monday (don't kill me.) i'm from britain and i'm currently in sixth form (junior and senior year for any confused americans) so, in college, you get 'frees' which basically are periods where you can do whatever as you don't have a lesson and they're usually an hour long.  in my case, i had three frees in a row, so me and my friend decided to go out shopping for a little while and then come back for our last lesson.  anyway.  skip to three hours later and we were making our way back to college, near our college there's a church.  this is where it gets bad.  i looked over at the church and saw that there was a family walking out of it, they were smartly dressed so i'd assumed they'd just come from a wedding, as a large majority of the family weren't wearing black.   and me being me, i can't keep my gob shut and exclaimed "congratulations!"  to which my friend turned to look at me in sheer shock/terror. not knowing what she was so shocked about, i looked towards the family, who's jaws had practically hit the ground.  it was only then, i saw a couple holding a large framed picture of a little boy. i walked as fast i could, not bearing to look at the couple, who i could now hear sobbing hysterically.  tl;dr - thought a funeral was a wedding, accidentally congratulated a couple on their sons funeral.   edit: so i was reading through the comments and couldn't help notice how many people were confused about if i was a boy or a girl; i am a girl.i was just in a silly mood and thought it would be funny to mess with my waitress by faking an australian accent, pretending it was my birthday, asking her a bunch of stupid questions about her life, about america, etc. she liked me so much that she wound up [snuggling next to me for a picture](https://i.imgur.com/fydpzvw.jpg) and giving me her number.  she wants to hang out on thursday. if i don't blow her off, then she'll eventually learn that i was being completely fake when we met.  i'm such a piece of shit. :(alright. 10 minutes ago i was doing my mom a favor by taking all personal files from my mom's old computer, to her new one. nothing special, she has zero clues about technology.  thing is, she specifies what she want to send to her new computer.  she said "movies" so i go onto the movies folder to throw the movies over to the usb. thing is, it's a very old computer, so i doubletap to go into the folder. accidentally open the first video, sees my mom in a threeway with her ex boyfriend and another lady friend that i grew up with. all of this while my mom's so watches right beside me. quicky closes the computer and i quickly walk out of the living room, with the husband being completely silent and my mom doesn't understand what just happened. i'm currently in my room listening to music.  **tl;dr: cleaning mom's old computer, accidentally finds a porno with my mom, her ex and a woman i grew up with.**   edit 1: currently on a silent train with my gf on my way to my grandparents. thank you for all of your texts, you've made me laugh, frustrated and terrified!  edit 2: i'll be out of town for two days, hence no contact with my mother or her so. posts an update on sunday  edit 3: mandatory hello mom edit. i'd never have this freaking picture in my head without you!  edit 4: a lot of people ask why i looked at the file. she had two partitions of the hdd, and i didn't know which one contained files so i had to check for it. also, rip inbox.  edit 5: i just got home and i found a note which said "we're off mushroom-picking. home in a few hours". i think everything's all right and i'll leave this thread now. thank you for all the replies, both hate &amp; support :) as everyone knows, school can get to us. every morning i struggle to wake up and get out of the house in time to catch my bus. this morning in particular, was very different.   i woke up and frantically checked my clock, because i was late yesterday. through my groggy eyes, all i saw was ":45". typically i leave the house at 6:30, so i jumped out of bed and quickly got dressed. i ran downstairs and out the door, ignoring the fact that nobody in my family was awake yet. the fact that it was still dark didn't bother me because where i live, the sun doesn't rise until about 7:30.   on my way to school, i noticed that there were not as many cars on the road as usual. i kept walking, because i was just focusing on not being late. about 30 minutes later, i reached the main road that lead to my high school. there were absolutely no people or cars anywhere. i thought i was dreaming or that the roads were shut down. i checked my phone to see if i was late or at least close to being late. it was 1:15 am. i just kinda sat there hating myself for a minute, then realized how much of a fucking idiot i was. i slowly turned around and walked home, wondering if my family had woken up and saw me missing. luckily i made it back to my room without disturbing anyone.   tl;dr: i tried to go to school at 1 am.  i'm currently typing this in my world history class, so thankfully i wasn't late today.  edit: apparently people can't read the multiple replies that i have left earlier about when the sun rises where i live.so i had a surgery monday afternoon. bunions are genetic in my family, and for some reason, mine are particularly bad for a 23 year old. i elected to get the surgery now, while under my mother's insurance and to prevent it from getting worse. also, this way my mom can take a few days off work to stay with me if i need anything.  long story short, they had to break 2 of my bones, then realign them, add some screws and pins, file down the side of my foot, then put the bones back into the sockets. i have 12 stitches and am on heavy narcotic drugs for pain.   well, i have a super high sex drive. i flicked the bean before surgery monday, but it's been 4 days. so i was horny and put on some porn. so i'm going at it and getting really into it. a few attempts at finishing pass because of mild pain in my foot. i decide to play through the pain.  bad.  so i'm finally about to come, and i get ready, straighten my legs. and i curl my toes as i climax, as i always do.  i curl my fucking toes.   there's a loud **crack** then my earsplitting scream of pure fucking agony. then i have about three seconds to think *oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, what did i do* before my mom comes barreling through my door.   there i am, covered in sweat, vibrator in hand, porn still on my tv, and my mom staring at me in shock. she stammered "are you... uh, oh. um. are you o-okay? uh..." she keeps glancing from me to the tv. i'm yelling at her that i'm fine, just go, i'm fine, **go.** but she's in shock i think because she's still just glancing wide eyed from (half naked) me, to my tv, back to me, then my foot.   so i throw something at her to wake her out of her confused daze to make her go. the only thing i had within reach. my vibrator.   i threw my vibrator at my mother.   she backed out of my room slowly. we haven't spoken since.  edit: best proof i've got: http://imgur.com/a/bqc5m  i have 12 stitches and i'm not allowed to remove the bandage, so that's literally the best i can do. want more proof? go fuck yourself. also thanks for the gold, strangers.alright a bit of background. ive been a piercer at my local tattoo parlor for several years, and i have seen people do the simplest things like eyebrow piercings, cartilage piercings, etc. ive also seen people do the most bizarre things like dick/clit/ball piercings, and even anus piercings. ive only done 2 anus piercings in the 6 years i've worked there. this guy comes in, and says he wants his asshole pierced. i wanted to laugh, but i put my professional face on, and told him prices, and answered his questions.   we get to the piercing room, and i tell him to pull down his pants and get on all 4s up on the table. awkward already... now im trying to get him to position his ass cheeks just right so i can get to his asshole. i finally get him to spread his ass cheeks apart, and i get my needle. i can tell the guy is getting really nervous so i said "dont tense up man just relax its only gonna take a second. just relax your anus don't tense up or it will only be worse."   i have my face right up to this guys anus and am about to pierce him, and i say "ok here we go". 2 seconds after i get the needle in he blasts shit all over my face. i start screaming like a motherfucker trying to wipe shit off my face, and he starts trying to stand up but the needle is still in his ass, and he screams bloody fucking murder. my boss runs in to find me wiping shit off my face, and this poor fuck screaming and crying with his pants down.  after i got cleaned up, and we got the needle out his ass i said "why did you shit on me??!" he just stood there obviously embarassed, and he says "you said to relax my anus! im so sorry!"   i will never pierce an anus ever again...  edit:holy shit this really did blow up. thanks for front page r/tifu!this was back in high school where the setup for desks was in rows and columns, less spread out.  i have a bad habit of cracking my neck like someone would crack their knuckles. i know it probably isn't good for me but it helps relieve some tightness for a little while so i do it anyway.   over a week i began cracking my neck much to the dismay of the girl who sat behind me who cringed every time i would do it. one day i thought it would be funny to crack my neck, then slump over as if i had just done one of those movie "snap their neck and they die" kind of things.  one day my neck was feeling particularly stiff, so as i go to crack my neck i turn around to look at her, turn my head sharply to the right and lots of loud pops echo out into the classroom, then i slump over and fall to the floor. the girl who sat behind me screamed bloody murder and freaks out the rest of the class.   my teacher told me to stop cracking my neck after that.  tl;dr cracked my neck, hit the deck.a few weeks ago, my cousin was driving behind a ford galaxy on a rural road. as the cars went over a bump, something fell from the wheel well of the car in front of her. she slammed on her brakes and got out of the car to see it was a tiny orange kitten! (she never could find the owners, and we assume he was a feral cat)  because i just had to put down my 17 year old orange cat, she decided to let me have the kitten, which we appropriately named 'galaxy', due to his origin story.   fast forward a couple of weeks. i just bought a samsung note 4. ever since i got the phone, it has been doing weird things. namely, the voice recognizer will randomly turn on and search for things while i am casually browsing reddit. i couldn't figure out why, and the staff at the store was of no help.  a few minutes ago, my kitten jumped on my lap while i was browsing twitter. so i said "oh hi, galaxy, silly kitty!" then my phone started a google search for "silly kitty". ("hi, galaxy" is the phrase to start voice searches on samsung phones)  this is going to get very old, very quickly.  edit: as requested, http://imgur.com/jqhfsaxi hate all the excessively long posts so i'm going to keep this short.  my little sister is 6 years old. the way i convinced her she was invisible was simple; i took a picture of our couch before she was on it. then, i called her and she came to me and i pretended i couldn't see her. naturally, she didn't believe me. so, i told her to sit on the couch and i'll take a picture.  but here's the zinger: i showed her the old picture with no one on it. this was all it took to convince her.  unfortunately, people react differently to learning they are invisible. she was skipping around tormenting my other family members (they were in on it too). it was pretty harmless until she started picking her nose and whatnot.  we had to stop the gag when she began to undress. we gave her some honey and said it was anti invisibility potion and that was that.was at a club last night and thought the mirror was a passage way into a new room, went to go through it and saw someone coming towards me. tried to move out of the way and he moved the same way as me. then i looked up and apologised, saw his glass was moving towards mine and proceeded to cheers him, at this point realising it was my reflection....  edit: wow, thanks. my first post and made it to the front page :d for those asking it was in nottingham8 days ago my girlfriend gave birth to our daughter. she had a mild infection so stayed in the special care baby unit for a few days. my girlfriend came home 3 days after the birth but we've been going back to the hospital to see our daughter every day since. today our daughter was discharged from hospital so we went to pick her up. my girlfriend went to sign some papers in another room.  i was super anxious and if i'm honest i was not thinking straight. i ended up walking into the wrong hospital room, the one next to where my daughter was. i was a complete and utter idiot. both hospital rooms looked exactly the same and this other baby was wearing a white babygrow and a yellow hat, just like my daughter. my daughter had a wristband, this baby didn't but i didn't realise it until later. i put the baby into the car seat and went to reception where my girlfriend was meeting me. while i was waiting, my mum showed up with some stuff for my daughter. she asked to hold the baby and i said yes. she picked her up and said "mike..." i could tell by the time of her voice that something wasn't right so i started freaking out. she said the baby looked different but i insisted it was because the last time she saw her she was in an incubator.  we continued to wait and my girlfriend arrived. my girlfriend looked at the baby and her face turned white. she said that it was not her baby. we rushed over to the desk and a nurse came with us to the ward to see what had happened. there was another couple there freaking out because their baby had gone. i was forced to admit my mistake.  we picked up our daughter and headed home but now my girlfriend is being cold towards me and i feel like a crappy father for not recognising my own daughters face. wish me luck for the next 18 years.like most of the other posts in this subreddit, this didn't really happen today (or this year), but a few years ago when i was in high school.   it was my senior year in high school and wrestling season had just ended. my aunt sent me a congratulatory musical card -- the kind that plays part of a song when you open it -- which i thought would be fun to tape to the inside of my locker (i shared this locker with a friend of mine) so that it played every time i opened it. this one played "simply the best" by tina turner. it worked, and i enjoyed it for a few days until the weekend which i spent in the mountains on a hiking trip with my dad and brother.   when the trip was over i checked my phone and saw that i had a voicemail from my locker-mate saying there was "a bomb scare or something" and that i had to talk to my principal on monday. that monday morning, i met with my principal who explained to me that a night janitor heard a ticking noise coming from my locker (apparently that's what those cards start to do when they run low on battery) and called the police, who called the bomb squad, who shut down the two major intersecting roads near my school and brought in a robot to inspect my locker. when the robot x-rayed the locker, they saw the "device" taped to the door, some half-empty water bottles that happened to be on the top shelf that they thought must have been chemicals or explosives. they also thought they saw wires connecting everything together. eventually they saw the monstrosity for what it was and shut down the operation, but apparently it was a pretty elaborate production. the article made the front page of the local newspaper the next day, complete with a photo and everything.   i never really got into trouble in high school and the principal knew who i was, so after talking for a few minutes we agreed that the whole thing was an honest mistake and that there was no malicious intent (although he said some parents were upset to the point that they wanted me suspended, expelled, or even to pursue some kind of legal action) and he let me off the hook.  in his own words: "i'm not exactly sure what i'm supposed to lecture you about, but i have to say something. i guess don't... uhh... modify lockers anymore?"  [here's the article](http://www.pottsmerc.com/article/mp/20090407/news01/304079981)  tl;dr: i taped part of a musical card to my locker door in high school, which a janitor mistook for a bomb and subsequently got the police and bomb squad involved.  edit: fixed some grammar and punctuation (sorry, using my phone).  edit 2: wow, did not expect this to blow up like this... especially for my first post. thanks guys. i'm a middle school teacher, and apparently i have a high number of aspiring basketball players in my classes. there's always one or two students in every period who insist on "shooting" their trash into the garbage. daily. they also insist on missing...daily.   of course, unless they are prompted, they don't pick up said garbage when it lands outside of the can. due to this, i've gotten pretty good at throwing down a stern "you need to pick that up. **now.**" phrase in the blink of an eye.    teaching a lesson across the room? bam!   breaking up a fight between other students? bam!  no trash goes unnoticed.   so today i'm walking into the grocery store and pass two men off to my side. immediately my brain registers the motion of the jump shot and a paper bag landing far away from the trash can.    teacher brain kicks in and i look at them very sternly and say "you need to pick that up. **now.**"   almost immediately upon saying this my brain realizes i am not in class, these are not my students, and those men were not about to simply leave their trash on the sidewalk.   too late.   now, to add insult to injury, i am a pretty young teacher who typically appears to be in her teens while donning day clothes, as i was. these men were probably 10+ years my senior.  one of the men quietly mumbled sorry while looking at the ground. the other, somewhat frantically apologetic, explains that he was just about to pick it up and *really really* wasn't going to just leave it there. he promised.   in the midst of my embarrassment and lack of a good explanation for their sudden scolding, i just said "good." and continued into the store.    tl;dr: i scolded grown men outside the grocery store because they reminded me of my bobcat-esque middle school students.    *edit:* wowzers! i'll try to respond more later today.   since a couple people have inquired: i don't mind the shooting of the trash. it's the missing and leaving garbage on the floor that i don't allow. we actually have a little score card going on the board for when they make a shot. the points are irrelevant and don't really do anything, but they haven't seemed to catch on to that yet.   edit 2: i finally understand rip inbox. also, death threats? seriously?! ya'll need a chill pill. or detention. ;)  gold??? that's awesome :d     sup pals?  the foundation to this fuck up happened about last week with the execution of it happening just a few days ago, but since it violates both the weekday rules, i had to bite my tongue and wait.  anyways, down to brass tacks; i've been working odd hours to meet deadlines recently plus promoting a few parties for some side scratch, basically my sleep schedule has been completely fucked for the past couple months. naturally my girlfriend, who sleeps like a normal human being for the most part, started getting a little bummed out recently on account that we are living on two different schedules.   so, about 3 weeks ago she started trying to wake me up when she felt my 6 hour quota had been met to give us a few hours of quality time together before she went to bed. very fair, but i'm also very deep sleeper, so she was very frustrated that she only got me out of bed a handful of times with the majority of those consisting of me roaming around the apartment like a husk with only one eye open for the first hour of consciousness. we had a talk about it, and i assured her that this wouldn't be forever, and i joked that if she really wanted to get me up maybe she should blow me into awareness. we laughed, made up, and the week pushed on.   fast forward to thursday night, i'm in the strong embrace of an epic sleep, adventuring through the alternate reality that is my dreamscape when i feel this beautiful, warming sensation emanating from my loins, embracing my whole body, and i was so content, so happy, so relaxed until it was all shattered by a high pitched scream. a mixture of anger, complete horror, and utter disbelief which manifested itself into the words "what the fuck!" simultaneously, of a sudden my face is now being splashed with some luke warm mystery liquid, and a slightly warmer liquid is gently raining down everywhere. i snap awake and realize...  i just pissed in my girlfriends mouth, she spit that mouthful of piss in my face, and i'm now continuing to rain down a morning, or in this case evening wood sprinkle system-esque cascade of piss. fuck.   tl;dr: asked my girlfriend to wake up with a blowjob and instead of waking up to a glorious orgasm, i filled her mouth with enough piss to make bear grylls flinch.   edit: thanks for the gold homie! i can't wait to tell my lady all the new reddit perks pissing in her mouth just afforded me! perfect timing because just last night before we went out she told me i spend too much time browsing on here (i do).so here i am, nice sunday morning taking a dump and browsing reddit of course. i finish up, put down the phone, stand up only to realize both my legs are completely numb and i face-plant into the towel rack...  happy sunday everyone! this has actually been happening for 8+ years.   since i was a kid, my mom would always tell me how  healthy tea was for you, and how much antioxidants it had in it.  well, i took that **too** literally. in order to get all them goodnesses, i would rip open the tea pack and pour in all of the spices and drink them. this would result in me coughing out my lungs and a dry throat. i thought "oh well, its worth it for all those goodnesses." until today, when i was drinking tea at my girlfriends house and both her and her parents saw me and proceeded to laugh their assses off. they then took a couple pictures of me, had them processed and hung. my mom now wants some prints of those pictures as well. we're driving to walmart right now to pick them up.  tl;dr: tl;dr been teabagging incorrectly for 8+ years   **edit**: we got the pictures. i look like a fool, they took several and had them specially made so that you could see my fu unfold.  **edit** #2: i speeled *been* wrong in the title lol waht an idoit  **edit**:#3: wow this **blew** up. thanks  so my two buddies and i dropped acid in my empty house.  we ordered pizza for dinner since we couldn't go anywhere.  time passes  by and we realize it's probably time to get our money together. the three of us go out to the main foyer to count money. my one friend asks, "what do you got b?"  and since i recently broke a hundo i had a bunch of cash in my wallet so i started fanning it out.  he asks again, "what do you got b?" this time more  of a chant.  i start makin it rain with my money and now my two friends are chanting "what do you got b?! what do you got! what do you got b!? what do you got?!  im now making it rain and dancing while taking my shirt off like its a dance circle.  we are having such a good time, vibing, laughing, that other friends follow suit, one taking his shirt off, both emptying the contents of their wallets on the floor, all three of us chanting, "what do you got b? what do you got?!" and dancing in front of the front door totally forgetting what we were supposed to be doing when all of a sudden there is a pound on the door.  wham wham wham.   all of the color drains from our faces and turns to unadulterated laughter. we open the door, the three of us shirtless with money and cards and shirts all over the floor, scrambling to find $25.   sent that pizza guy back with a nice story.i work as a loans officer in a rural branch of a small canadian bank.   sorry for your suddenly-sodden panties, ladies.   definitely not my dream career as a kid – the fisher price banking is fun! playset is not a big seller – but when i lost my job selling computers in my early 20s i got this job and it stuck like soiled underwear. i’m okay at it and i’m a well-liked mentor to many of the staff, but i’m definitely a goofy round peg in a humourless square hole which is what ultimately led to my wtf shitstorm.  if i have to work in an office i’m gonna have a bit of fun. i love thinkgeek. in my office i have a [conan the barbarian letter opener](http://i.imgur.com/xwqpqajh.jpg), a [salvador dali melting clock](http://i.imgur.com/hg0ot5q.jpg) and a [magnetic levitating world globe](http://i.imgur.com/rm1luhbh.jpg) among other things purchased there, and as fate would have it this past christmas in my stocking i discovered that my kids bought me an [annoy-a-tron](http://i.imgur.com/vfo4usi.jpg). it’s a small device that makes maddeningly short, faint noises at totally random intervals and can run for 3 months on a watch battery, designed to be hidden to drive someone harmlessly bonkers. here’s the description [from thinkgeek’s site:](http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/b278/?pfm=search&amp;t=the%20thinkgeek%20annoy-a-tron%202.0)  *“the annoy-a-tron will do its part to drive your co-workers slowly mad with its short and seemingly random beeps. and when someone does locate the annoy-a-tron, they're not going to know what it is - which is almost as much fun as watching them search for it. muahaha...”*  and hilarity will ensue!  right?  as it turns out, much less than zero.  i came in early on a monday and placed it behind a metal poster frame hanging on the wall in the office of one of my co-workers. i flipped the on switch and went blithely about my day, waiting for a reaction and to share a few chuckles.  monday came and went. nothing.  tuesday, nothing.  wednesday and thursday, not a peep. at that point i figured it was broken. frankly, i kinda forgot about it. i had friday off and i suppose i would’ve checked it when i got back the following week.  monday comes, lurching out of the weekend like a reanimated corpse. as soon as everyone arrives, the manager calls all 16 of us into her office for an unscheduled conference call. i end up standing at the back of the group near the office door. she dials in and our district vp announces herself through the little speaker. i stifle a yawn. the vp then introduces our company’s head of security. my brow furrows. this is unusual.  “by now,” the vp says, “some of you know about the device that was found at your branch last week.”  *device? what the hell? what kind of device could they possibly be talking--*   *oh holy jesus fuck nuggets.*  “when it was found it on thursday nobody knew what it was, so it was brought to the branch manager, who then sent pictures of the device to me—“  *fuck.*  “—and i forwarded the images to our head of security. he couldn’t identify it but guessed it might be a listening device so he sent the pictures to the rcmp corporate crimes division—“  *oh fuck me.*  “—as well as the canadian security intelligence services in ottawa. they suspected it could potentially be a bomb—“  *fuckity grand fucking canyon of fuck.*  “—so we closed the branch, told all staff to stay home and hired a team of investigators to search every square inch of the building over the weekend for any additional devices.”  if i had sat down ahead of time to brainstorm a worst-case scenario, i wouldn’t have even come close to this epic corporate craptastrophe. i had no choice. i took a shaky breath, steeled my nerve, clenched my ass cheeks tight and tried to say “excuse me” but choked out a pubescent squeak instead. i cleared my throat, interrupted the conference call in that stuffy room full of my coworkers and spoke up, telling them it’s a harmless noisemaker, taking responsibility and apologizing profusely.  the room was dead quiet. the vp slowly says thank you for speaking up, they’ll stop the investigation, and the call ends. everyone files out. i ask the manager if she wants me to stay, but she says she can’t talk to me right now. she doesn’t talk to me for three weeks.   i found out later that she was in her car with the device on the passenger seat when she got the call that it might be a bomb. she apparently burst into tears and nearly drove into a ditch.  the district vp threw a fit and despite my 17-year unblemished work record she tried really, really hard to have me fired. ultimately a senior executive in the company understood my benign intent and overruled her. luckily they didn’t charge me the $50,000+ in lost business, staff wages and other miscellaneous costs.  no, i don’t know why my manager didn’t just ask her staff if anyone knew about it instead of sending a fucking urgent memo to the entire fucking universe. my office is full of a lot of things but common sense isn’t one of them.  **tl;dr: thinkgeek + corporate zombies = fail.**  **edit:** so *this* is what it's like to be the bottom in an upvoted reddit relationship. my god... it's full of *stars*.   some clarifications:  * i don't work for thinkgeek. i doubt they'd be allowed to use the term "suddenly-sodden panties" in their attempts at viral marketing. * my post is as accurate as i remember (it happened a few months ago). i can only relate what was told to us during the conference call about the theories about the device and the involvement of the authorities, but i can't and wont verify if that's what they actually did. i'm not going to poke that particular dog with a pointy stick. * although my post focuses on my frustration about the overreaction to my prank, there's a reason i posted this in tifu after i found out this subreddit exists. 'cause i fucked up. as i mentioned somewhere in the comment deluge below, had i given a modicum of thought to the type of risk-adverse industry i work in, i never would've placed the annoy-a-tron at my work at all. there would've been no overreaction to have if i hadn't done this to begin with. and my office pranking days are dead and buried - my wife will make damn sure of that. if i even *think* about trying something like this again, my wife will shove an annoy-a-tron so far up my ass that i'd have daft punk vocoder farts.this actually happened less than 5 minutes ago.  my daughter was born last week, 10 weeks early. my wife and i have settled into a routine of visiting the nicu every morning. because i already work remotely, i just use the wifi at the hospital.  between lack of sleep and too much reddit, i'm starting to get a little foggy brained.  while my wife was reading some children's book to our daughter, i hear her say "you like that?"  without thinking, i finish the sentence with "you fucking retard?"  even the nurse in the room felt the look of death. posted this 3 days ago. was removed due to rules. reposting now that it's the weekend. enjoy.   this did not happen today. and i'm a rebel so i don't care if you have a problem with it.   my housemate often has his girlfriend over, and she's kind of noisy during sex. not in an annoying way; i just hear her a lot. he has apologized to me about this repeatedly. i never really get bothered by it, but a few weeks ago we had a bright idea to show her what it's like to listen to another couple have sex.   first i had him "bring up" with his girlfriend the fact that my girlfriend and i are into some seriously kinky shit, and it's a little bit disturbing to overhear us. then i had my girlfriend agree to play along in the shenanigans.   so my girl comes over at night (claire), and my housemate's girl (jess) is already there. i hear jess and my housemate talking softly in their room, so it was time for the show to start. my girl and i start talking a little louder than normal, and we essentially [re-enact this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lq0-dwl7wo) (she's a great voice actress).    then the real fun begins. i start saying some shit like "yeah, spank me, spank me like a baby" and shit. she slaps my ass really loud a few times. i can hear jess from the other room saying "oh my god..." really softly. i know my housemate will keep a straight face; his acting is like kevin spacey-level.    claire then says some shit like "mmmm i always loved it when you used to fart on my neck. will you do it again?" and i'm like, "i'll give it a shot, babe." then i just make pushing/straining sounds for about 15 seconds, then tell her i'll get to that later. things heat up, we say a few more ridiculous phrases, i drop the obligatory south park reference "oh you do that just like my father..." etc.   but then we took it too far. jess is in the other room obviously hypnotized by our 'activity' and she keeps whispering to my housemate, "omg! listen! are they serious??" and laughing and stuff.   then i get a real bright idea, and say, "oh yeah, oh yeah, baby stop, stop." claire goes "what?" and i say, "pour some of that candle wax all over my asshole." claire almost loses it, but maintains. we remain silent for about 5 seconds. jess is utterly silent. then i start **shrieking** at the top of my lungs, super high-pitched, as though i'm in severe pain. i hear jess say "what the fuck!!!!" and then she and my housemate start arguing. he tries to calm her down, and tells her it was a joke, but she gets furious that we pranked her and storms out. now they'e in a fight. and she thinks i am an asshole/psychopath.   **tl;dr: never pour candle wax on your anus**   edit: spelling   ------------------   edit 2: jess and housemate are fine. jess is slightly irritated/embarrassed that she got pranked, and that the pranking was a commentary on her clownish sex noises. i understand why she is not happy with me and i have apologized. claire is overjoyed that people on reddit think she's a keeper.   whoever narrated, thank you.   ------------------   edit 3: thank you for the gold, to both strangers.so this fu happened this morning. university resumed this week after winter break and i started a new course together with a friend.  in this course we were going to use matlab to calculate some economic stuff, so the first lecture was an introduction to matlab for those that had not yet worked with it. my friend and i had used matlab before, so we weren't really paying attention, as it was still very basic stuff being explained.  so my friend was arranging matlab and excel in a way that he could both see the data and matlab or easily switch between the two. in order to do this he googled the multiple desktop feature for w10. so he was busy for a few minutes and when he finished i looked over to see his final arrangement. while i checked out his screen setup he turns to me and went like [this](http://imgur.com/gallery/bdnpcxv). i didn't expect that so i burst out laughing and kinda tried to play it off as a cough while burying my face in my hands. after i calmed myself down i looked up, face red and tears still in my eyes.  at this point the prof asked me if something was funny. i responded by saying no and apologizing. he didn't want any of that though, because his next sentence was: "get out, i don't want to see you in my class again." after he said that he left the room for a brief moment while i shut down my computer. he returned and repeated, that my friend and i should leave. so we packed our things and left the room while he gave us a grumpy glare.  i don't know why he was so harsh, maybe he thought we were laughing at him, because of his thick accent or he just didn't like that we didn't pay any attention to his matlab introduction. anyway, i guess we have wednesday morning off now...  tl;dr: friend approved of his new desktop setup - professor didn't though.     update:  i just talked to the professor. the reason he kicked me out is because he finds it offensive when people laugh or behave noisily during his lectures. i told him, that i find it too harsh to not even warn someone before kicking him out, especially considering there are other lectures that are much more relaxed where even the professors joke around from time to time.  in the end we both apologized and i think both parties had more understanding of the other after the talk.  i'm not gonna take this course this semester though. maybe next year.when i was in 10th grade, i had a really close friend who was a girl, i  was head over heels for this girl, would hang out non-stop, text non-stop, and all around i wanted to date her more than anything at the time. i also had no testicles at the time, and never had the courage to ask her. at the end of 10th grade, we had these yearbooks, and the custom was to get people to sign it, and they would leave stuff like "have a great summer", "nice to have known you" etc. when i asked her to sign it, she put in the following.  http://imgur.com/dvqhlbw   here i am almost a junior in college, and i found my yearbook by accident while looking for something else, and just read this.. pondering life.   edit: i didn't expect this to blow up like this. i'm currently out at the moment and typing  this from my phone. i will call her when i get home which is like 2 hours from now. thanks for the people who responded positively.  edit2: i'm going to text her, i really don't want to make another cringey moment in my life, and have an extremely awkward phone conversation. i'll update soon.  edit3: i texted her, found her number through mutual friends on facebook, she changed it. i will post the conversation after i edit her number out. 5 minutes.  edit4: http://imgur.com/hkilsjv,xne06sy,ioe5b5j,ccvvjm7#0  edit5: sorry for not calling in the text she mentioned she cried from 3 pm till 12 am, and hearing that over the phone is just too awkward, glad i didn't call. thank you for the people who guilted me into this, i needed it.  edit6: yeah i realized blocking out the name alexis was pointless, so i didnt for the last 2 pictures. i blocked out mine though, it's very uncommon name.  edit7: i understand the skepticism, if theres a definitive way to prove it i will that doesn't compromise our identities. i just want to say i wouldn't do this for fictional points on a forum, the past couple of hours have been a very weird rollercoaster.   edit8: i do have a girlfriend, getting coffee with someone isn't cheating. i'm not going to fuck her on the coffee machine.   edit9: i don't know how somebody was able to edit my title on my first imgurlink, but this is not a "wheres waldo book". here's more pictures. http://imgur.com/uxpfevl,sy9knop,dd9xda2#0  edit10: i gave her the link to this thread, she has never heard of reddit, and thinks it's insane that the original picture has 250k views.  edit11: probably the last edit i will make to this i want to answer everyones major questions.  "**what college do you go to**?"   ###the ohio state university.  "**does your girlfriend know?**"   yes both of them know, and have access to this page.  "**are you lying?**"   it's very hard to prove without giving up my identity, and even then i will receive criticisms. i can assure you this wasn't done for fake fictional forum points, but believe what you like. if there is a way to prove it, i would.  "**where are the rest of the pictures?**"   http://i.imgur.com/seasxzn.png  "**why didn't you read it?**"   i was more preoccupied with getting as many signatures as i could it was a good self esteem boost, i didn't come home, and read it. i probably put it down somewhere, and it got moved around for years.  "**do you have any interest in her?**" i don't know, shes a stranger to me at the moment.  good night, i'll try to keep people updated if anyone is interested.  "**pursue hailey op, she loves you**"   i honestly don't even know who that is.. at all i don't even remember her   editlastoneiswear: so sorry for the very late update, i'm drowning in school work at the moment, but here is how the coffee get-together (not date) went great. we sat around talked about old times, added each other on the newer social medias (ig, snapchat etc), and talked about past and current relationships, before you ask she's single, and before you ask i'm not interested in her. i genuinely came in thinking i was going to be, but i'm just not, and for some reason tried because i was so sure i was, but it turns out i'm not, not even slightly. she's transferring to my university next year, and we'll most likely keep in touch pretty heavily, but that's as far as it's going. i know most of you wanted a love story, but i don't know she felt like a stranger more than anything. we will definitely rebuild our friendship, and move on. my girlfriend which most of you asked about, was way more understanding than i expected, of course she was skeptical, and slightly upset, and i'm pretty much enslaved for the next month so.. theirs that. i will definitely stay with her. above all i genuinely want to thank the people who abused the hell out of my inbox urging me to contact her. this started as a tifu, i expected around 10 comments, and expected it to get buried in the reddits history, but it really helped me reunite with someone, and the fact it stayed up for so long is honestly amazing. thank you so much.  -***please bare with me i'm going on zero hours of sleep about 20 beers and a bad hangover. plus i'm writing this on my phone because well... my fucking house burned down with everything in it.   last night (halloween), my girlfriend who i live with and myself decided to have a halloween party, it's saturday and we normally get fucked up on saturday anyways so why not drink and dress up.   we have about 15ish people over at our 2 bedroom place and about half were dressed including my girlfriend and my self. i was dressed as mario and one of my buddy's dressed as bowzer. well 4 of us start playing some bp to get our drink on and have a good time. we get a couple games in and the night seems like it's gonna be a good and long one. well it was my turn up on the bp table. myself and a good buddy of mine are on a team vs my girlfriend and bowzer.   before i go any further, i have a house rule that i made up to stop people from throwing air balls. if the opponent throws and over shoots the table without hitting anything you can catch it and instantly throw it and if it hits the person that air balled in the face that team has to pull a cup from their side.   so bowzer throws and air balls and instantly catch it and throw a fast ball as hard as i can towards his face. in his drunken stuper he ducks by throwing his ass backwards which in turn bumps the side table with 2 lit halloween candles. the candles flew around 5 feet straight towards our curtains that my girlfriends grandmother made us.    i saw everything in slow motion. it took for ever it seemed for the candles to land. my butthole puckered so fast i'm surprised it didn't whistle. then in less than a second the entire curtain is in gulfed.   panic mode. i scream, he screams, my girlfriend screams, everyone screams. i rush to get anything that can hold water and start filling it up. it doesn't help my sink is over flowing with dishes already. i get one pot of water about half way filled and i can tell from the commotion from the other room that things are getting worse and the pot of water isn't going to help. i take it in the living room and way and dump it on the curtains that have already been pulled down onto the floor. it was at this point i realized that i've been living in this house for 8 months and never bought a fire extinguisher. (the house is super old and i'm an army vet so i should know better than to take a chance and not have one) we try stomping out the curtains but it had all ready reached the ceiling before they were pulled down. at that point i grabbed my dog and usher the remaining people out of the house and call 911.   it's pouring outside, so all of us are standing out in the rain waiting on help as we watch my living room glow like a jackolanturn. help arrived working 5 or so minutes of calling them probably about 10ish minutes from the whole thing starting. the fire fighters save the back half of the house but the living room and the dining room are fucked.   will update with a picture later when i head back to the house after getting some sleep.   tl;dr hurled a ball at bowser, turned my house into a jack o' lantern.  thanks for the tl;dr /u/matiac last wednesday, the girl of my dreams asked me to go to prom with her.  i readily accepted, and that was that.   the only problem?  i'm a girl as well.  my parents thought that i was straight, so i decided to tell them that i was bi that day to get it over with.  so, i go to my mom, and tell her that i need to get a prom dress this year.  where i go to school, only seniors can go to prom unless you are asked by one.  as a junior, my mom automatically wanted to know which hot guy asked me.  when i told her who it was (let's call her stephanie) my mom had an..... interesting reaction.     she told me that it wasn't funny to make fun of lesbians.  they are people too, and deserve respect.  she doesn't care if i go to prom or not, but i have to be respectful of others.  this led to a mildly awkward mother-daughter conversation in which i tried to convince her that i was, in fact, a bisexual  **tl;dr i forgot it was april fool's day   edit: wow, i left for school, came back and this blew up! thanks for the gold and the support :)   for those wondering,  yes stephanie was serious.  she wanted 'april fool's' to be her response  if i turned out to be straight.     this happened about an hour ago. i had just gotten the kids to bed and was multi-tasking by taking a piss while talking to my wife with the bathroom door open. i was distracted from the conversation when i noticed that there was a spider hanging down directly over the toilet bowl, inching closer and closer to all that i hold sacred. naturaly, i couldnt just stop mid-stream, so i did the next best thing and tried to knock the little fucker down with my stream of pee. unfortunately, the spider realized that i had missle lock and started to retreat back up the web, and when i tried to lead the target (that is what your are suppose to do in such situations) i missed and pissed all over the floor/wall/everywhere but in the bowl. right about this time my wife rounds the corner into the bathroom to inqure as to why i was not responding to her inqueries as to whether or not i paid the cable bill. of course, from her vantage she couldnt see the spider and thought that i was just pissing all over the walls for the sport of it. so last night at jimmy john's we get a call from some lady who's online order apparently didn't come through for 45 mins. we get the order as she's calling but she doesn't believe us and is all pissed off. about half an hour later we get a a prank call from some kid who asked if our blowjobs are "freaky fast" - 'cause that's funny, right? my coworker suggested we text the kid just to mess with him so i take her phone, get the number, type and send the message "are your blowjobs freaky fast???!" just to kind of mock him. it wasn't even that funny but we were bored so whatever. then, maybe 10 minutes later we get a call from the first lady and i realize i typed the wrong number in (it was still up on our first phone screen). apparently she was so offended even after it was explained to her that she needed to talk to our general manager the next day. i come in the next morning  and find out me, the coworker and manager are all getting fired. and it's completely my fault.this actually happened today, and i'm still in the library!   every tuesday and thursday, i have 8am classes. naturally, i'm pretty tired afterwards and sleep in my favourite library on campus for a few hours before my next lecture.   i always set an alarm on my phone, put in some headphones, and get my snooze on.   today, at around 11:30, a girl randomly poked me awake and told me that my phone has constantly been ringing.   this is when i came to the awful, embarrassing realization that for some reason, when my phone rings to wake me up, it bypasses my headphones and just rings. (not sure it's some weird techy thing that happens with these new earbuds i'm using.) i don't realize it's ringing like this, because i sleep with my phone next to me on the desk, and expect the alarm to be pretty loud.   now, this wouldn't be such a big deal if my phone only rang once, maybe twice, max three times. but no, i'm an awful, snooze button lover. i had wanted to wake up at 10, but have been snoozing every 9 mins (wtf apple??) since 10, all the way to 11:30.   what makes it even worse, is that i've been sleeping in this library every tuesday and thursday, for the past month and a bit since this term started.   oops. i'm sorry for interrupting your studying.   edit 1: i worked till 12:15am the night before, and had to be up at 6am for my 8am. i'm usually not this bad. have mercy on my uni student soul.   edit 2: i'm now aware that the 9min thing is not because of apple, thanks eli5 peeps! :)   edit 3: i'm a commuter. no dorm on campus for me!   edit 4: seems like a lot of people who were there are redditors. if you see me, please let me apologize in person! especially if you're at that library often on those days. i usually wear a bright red jacket. (maybe we can even be study buddies. i obviously need the motivation. i promise i won't sleep with my headphones in when we're supposed to be studying.)i met a guy online, and we have been talking/snapping/texting for about two weeks. our first date was supposed to be friday, but he really wanted to meet me, so i agreed to meet him at his house once i got off work (at midnight.) i pull up to his house, and his mother (i wasn't aware that he lived with her) came out and told me that i shouldn't be showing up at her house to fornicate with her son in the middle of the night. as i was turning to leave, he comes out and apologizes for her behavior, and tells me that she's just looking out for him. he then says that they had had quite a few drinks. as he was explaining that she acts insane when she's drunk, not to mind her, he suddenly throws up all over me. i had to drive home covered in puke.      edit: wow, front page. i didn't realize my massive fuck up was that massive. also, i have learned my lesson. no, i did not go to his house with even the intention of going inside. it was supposed to be talking for a bit, and then i go home. thanks for all the concern, but i do understand how stupid of a move i made. the vomit taught me a lesson.  edit: gold?! thanks! good to know my awful experience has made a lot of you laugh. i am laughing with you. :)so i'd been dating this girl for about 3 months, most saturdays she would stay over but leave on the sunday morning as sunday was 'gaming sundays' (i know i'm very cool) she was always pretty cool with it and didn't mind.  she stayed over, everything was normal the morning came and she left. before i settled into my gaming session i checked facebook first. the first thing to pop up was people wishing her happy birthday. yep. it was her birthday and i'd sent her home so i could play video games. i've never apologised so much in my entire life.  tldr; i wasn't aware it was my girlfriends birthday, sent her home so i could play games.   edit: thanks for the gold stranger i'm glad you liked my tale - edit: people are getting pretty mad about this... i saw my gf usually about 3-5 days a week, what's wrong with 1 day a week for me? - edit: because so many people are asking i'm 21  **the plan:** tell a starbucks barista that my name is spartacus.  when my drink order arrives and the barista says "coffee for spartacus?", claim boldy that "i'm spartacus!", then watch and laugh when everyone else joins with cries of "i'm spartacus!".  we all have a good laugh for a couple of minutes and i'm hailed as a comic genius.  **the reality:** i told a starbucks barista that my name was spartacus.  when my drink order arrived the barista said "coffee for spartacus?".  i claimed boldy that i was spartacus.  no-one else joined in with cries of "i'm spartacus!".  i meekly grabbed my drink and trudged the long, long walk upstairs.  my mother, to whom i had explained the whole plan and who thought the idea was below average, went and sat at a different table.  tl;dr? i am an unfunny man.  **update** um, thanks for all the replies.  having collated them all in great detail in a spreadsheet, it seems that 23% of respondents would have joined in with my crap attempt at a joke, 35% of respondents want my mother's contact details because she's awesome, and 41% of people think i'm autistic and need immediate medical help.    have a great day everyone, and thanks to the stranger for the gold.this happened over the weekend.   the wife and i got hitched about a month ago, but have been together for 6 years. we have been enjoying each other’s  *ahem* company quite a bit since we got married. something about saying ‘i do’ really got the freak juices a flowing if you catch my drift.   so aunt flow was supposed to visit last week but never showed up. that’s cool, we just got married and  then we immediately moved and didn't really get a chance for a honeymoon. stress can delay mother nature for a few days. it has happened with her before… but then my wife got one morning and spewed all over the bathroom. as she kissed the porcelain god, a wave of panic encompassed my being.   i, a man child of 26 years, could possibly have spawned another human being... my entire adolescence flashed before my eyes. visions of little league games, late nights playing halo, ninja turtle themed birthday parties, and drunken college shenanigans danced around in my head. i then pictured myself sitting at the kitchen table surrounded by dirty diapers while doing taxes. *i have to be a grown up now… fuck*.   so my wife is freaking out a bit, but being the amazing husband i am, i tell her to lie(lay?) down and i head up to the store and grab her a pregnancy test. i get to the local cvs and start making my way down the aisles trying to find a plastic stick for my wife to pee on. as i am looking, i pass through the toy aisle with all the goofy, crappy, cheap toys they sell at drug stores. you know, the cap guns, the bouncy balls that don’t bounce, the puzzles, that stuff. looking over these toys i am crippled again with nostalgasm from my youth. i remembered going up to eckerd (before they became ‘rite-aid’; whatever i still call them eckerd to this day) and begging my mom for an awesome beast wars transformer to play with. i smiled as i looked at this generation’s transformers that don’t turn into tigers and raptors, but are still pretty sweet in their own right. it was right there that i decided that i need to get in some last minute youth stuff in order to come to terms with my fate. but what on earth could make me feel like a kid again? oh shit they have candy.   sweet, sweet candy.   i merrily skipped to the candy aisle and began perusing their selection. i was determined to buy it all. butterfingers, snickers, mr. goodbar, goobers, reese’s (pronounced ree-sez, not ree-sees for those of you who are illiterate dickspanks) were all cradled into my arms as i began to beam with joy. candy fucking rocks and i’m going to eat it all and no one will tell me otherwise because i’m an adult (but i don’t want to be so i’m buying candy to feel young again). i was about to head to the checkout when i noticed a treat that i had not even thought of since i was a young lad: fun dip. for those who don’t know, [this is fun dip](http://imgur.com/gallery/e1khr8l). i remember getting hopped up on that crap before my mother would dump me off at my babysitter’s when she had to go out somewhere and couldn’t take me. then i remembered the amazingly tasty dipping stick and how you use your own spit to scoop out the sugar from the separate pouch. i actually said “oh hell yes” out loud, grabbed 3 fun dip packs and made my way to the counter. after paying for the candy and then remembering why i went there in the first place, i grabbed a pregnancy test and drove home.   my wife was in bed, looking sickly and pale and i rushed in with the test and showed her my grocery bag filled with delicious treats beaming with pride as if i were a child showing someone my candy haul from halloween. she was not as amused as i was, but doesn’t matter, have candy. i open up a reese’s and dig in as my wife trudges to the toilet to pee. as i wait for her, i continue my newfound quest for diabeetus and stuff my face with sugary treats. i finish off my reese’s and decide now is the time to dip into some fun. i grab a pack and begin to furiously suck off the candy stick in a manner that would make jenna haze jealous. when it is good and lubricated, i jam the stick it into the sugar to coat all the moist areas that it may come in contact with, throw that bad boy back in my mouth and accept the sugary scratchy goodness on my tongue. lather, rinse, repeat.   wife comes out of the bathroom, goes towards the bed and rests the pregnancy test on her nightstand without the cap (gross woman, you just peed on that) and tells me it is time to wait. me being the observant and attentive husband that i am, notice something off about my wife. i ask her if everything is alright and she starts to cry. i walk over to her as she sits on our bed, put my fun dip down, and give her a hug. she is scared. of course she is, she’s about to grow a baby, carry it around for 9 months then force it out of her body as it splits her in half. i’d be scared too. we certainly haven’t planned for this, but we decide no matter what happens, we will keep the baby and move forward. i try to cheer her up and i offer her some fun dip, (because i’m an amazing and considerate husband) and we make out on the reg, so why wouldn’t she want some? she declines and sniffles, so i try and make her laugh by maintaining eye contact and reaching for the pack and saying “are you suuuuuuuuuuure? it’s delicioussssssssss”. i then jam the stick into the sugar and plunge it into my mouth. this is where i fucked up.   her eyes grow wide, and i immediately notice that this scoop of sugar tastes... off… and colder than it normally does...   i pull the stick out of my mouth, and to my horror, am looking at a pregnancy test covered in green sugar crystals. my mouth agape, i look at the nightstand, and see the fun dip stick, sitting by its lonesome, taunting me like the little bitch that it is, glistening from the slob job i had given it earlier. my bottom lip quivers, as a faint “no” escapes from my soul and out my mouth.   cue hysterical laughter from my wife as i scream like a 5 year old girl that just saw a spider and run to the bathroom to vomit all the sugar and chocolate that i had consumed not even 10 minutes earlier. she couldn’t stop laughing.   test ended up being negative (she tried another one that wasn't "compromised"). she went to the urgent care down the road when she wouldn't stop throwing up and it turned out she had food poisoning. she got her period later that day.   tl:dr: pregnancy scare leads to quarter-life crisis, that ends with me eating pee.   *edited to fix the 'cue' and to clear up the ending.   user [cyae1](http://www.reddit.com/user/cyae1) narrated [my fuck up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abexre2zcda&amp;index=24&amp;list=pll0dkyqa9aqu_awjvjzvysizc8phuppo6). i am incredibly grateful. thanks for all the kind words and encouragement from everyone, you guys have really brightened my daythis didn't happen today, it happened about 15 years ago..but it's still stuck with me all this time.  i was about 10 years old, hanging out with my friend in my room, doing whatever it is 10 year olds do. we were listening to music when my little brother knocked on the door. me being the mean big sister ignored him, turned the music up, and pretended like we were having a party that he couldn't come to. i imagine that made him feel crappy and he went back downstairs.  fast forward to a few minutes later, and my mom knocks on the door, kind of angry with me. she tells me to come downstairs to see what my little brother did for me.  i go downstairs and find a clue, written by him in his little 6 year old handwriting. it lead me to another clue, and another clue. the last clue said to look in the other room for my "valentine", and there he was sitting on the bed. he gave me a hug. i felt awful. still do to this day when i think about it.  tl;dr: ignored my 6 year old brother knocking on my bedroom door, turns out he had put a lot of work into making a valentine's treasure hunt for me that ended with him as my "valentine" and giving me a hug. cue the awful feelings.i drove my wife's car (a 2001 hyundai accent) to the bus station today, and after work, as i pulled into the driveway, i had a monumental brain fart.  i left the car in neutral as always, however i failed to set the handbrake. my driveway is an inclined gravel carport, roughly 2.5 car lengths long. it has a waist high brick wall on the drivers side (getting higher as you go down the driveway) and a carport overhead, supported by steel beams, one of which comes out the top of said wall.   i stepped out the drivers door, and took a step away from the car. it was my neighbour across the street that alerted me to the problem. he must have seen it start to move, so he shouted.   i jumped towards the drivers seat to hit the brake pedal with my foot. this is what followed:  i was hit by the still open drivers door, and knocked to the ground, then dragged downhill. the door hit the steel beam of the carport, with my hand/wrist caught between. my hips were slammed between the door and the bricks, and my knees were dragged along the gravel. my right ankle was run over by the front wheel of the car. i was left in a heap, and the car rolled i've the street, and into my neighbours yard. it stopped short of his hedge/house (lucky!) and sat on his front lawn.  i am fine, with only some cuts, a sprained ankle, and a lot of bruises on my hips, legs and arms. plus some gravel rash of course.   the car has a ruined drivers door, which i will now need to replace. my pride... yeah that's gone.   i think the worst part is how my wife is taking it all. shes not stopped picking fun at me since it happened. an example:  her: "you're an idiot."  me: "i am aware."  her: "no,  you're not a were, you're an idiot all the time."   so there you have it.  tl;dr i ran over myself with my wife's car, and i doubt i'll ever live it down.   edit: for everyone telling me to dump my wife,  i think there's some context missing. i'm from australia, and it is very common to rib each other on a regular basis. if i had been seriously hurt, she would only have been 100% supportive and helpful. i wasn't, so the correct response is to laugh at me for it.   please stop berating my wife, i put those lines in there because i thought they were funny and clever.   it's possible you missed the joke (being the were- animal humour)   for everyone asking for photos, i'll be posting some later this morning.   edit 2: album here:  http://imgur.com/a/hmgou  note the damage to the door, and the wall i was dragged down. the yard you can see is the neighbour. i've always been a fan of wake and bake, this morning i packed a fat bowl and took it straight to the dome. i saw parks and rec was on and exclaimed "fuck yeah" (i live alone)  and started it up. at some point i fell asleep and woke up to a commercial that said exxon and chipotle teamed up.  for some stupid reason i was pissed. hell, chipotle just took an item off the menu because of they way they were treating animals, how could they possibly justify teaming up with a company who is destroying the planet?!  so i wrote this to chipotle:  "i'm amazed with your company, you pull pork from the shelves because pigs aren't treated properly, which is awesome!  now you've teamed up exxon, a company who is destroying the planet and laughing about it as they run away from their responsibilities to the environment.   your food is delicious, your moral compass is fucking disgusting."  chipotle has awesome customer service, i wrote them once before about my meal before and they wrote back within an hour, great people. again they wrote back in about an hour, it hurt so bad to read...  "we definitely haven't partnered with exxon. the only thing i can find online that might suggest this is a fake commercial that aired on parks &amp; rec recently. which is an awesome show as far as i'm concerned, but i'm sorry if it caused any confusion! you can read the article i found on that here: http://www.eonline.com/news/626472/parks-and-rec-can-never-leave-us-after-those-two-incredible-episodes-plus-who-played-mayor-gunderson.  thanks for your support of our stance on the carnitas shortage!  from the fellowship of the foil,  a"  my god... it still makes me feel like a complete ass hole. fuck me i can't believe this shit just happened. the next quotes are the last two exchanges we had.   "wow i'm retarded, i need to stop smoking so much weed."  "glad to have set you straight, alex. the next time the munchies hit, hopefully you can head for chipotle and feel good about where your money is going. :)  your friend in the burrito business, a."  if you read this a, you're awesome, thanks for setting me straight.  tldr: i'm stupid and wrote an angry letter to chipotle for teaming up with exxon. at least i didn't rant about it on facebook i guess.obligatory: this happened last nigh, so still within 24 hours.  my friend (whom we will call jake), got dumped by his girlfriend for someone else. knowing him since early teens, i knew he always took stuff like this too hard. i immedietally called him when i found out. he was already a crying mess. so being the good friend i am, i offered to go out for drinks so he can take his mind off her. we go into a nice bar and have us a few beers. i took the classic route: ''bruh she wasn't worth it, there are other fish in the sea, she was a ho i told you, bla bla bla'' but no that wasn't working (in retrospect: when did that ever work?) jake only got mildly drunk (he is a very lightweight drinker) and that only make him more miserable.  so we got out of the bar. keep in mind that i was also tipsy as well. but i knew i shouldn't leave him alone in a state like that, so i said that we could take his laptop from his dorm, then go into my place, order some pizza and play some counterstrike. so we played for around two hours, eating pizza and drinking more beer. after seeing that jake's mood finally improved i decided to (note that we are both drunk at this point) gift him a game from steam. jake likes adventure games very much, so i search for adventure games and this game called life is stange pops up. i saw that it had very positive reiviews, and instantly gifted him a copy. when he saw the game (that we both didn't know much about beforehand) he got happy and started downloading it right away. i was very tired at that point, so i told him i was going to sleep because i have a class tomorrow and went off the bed. i woke up at noon, because drunk me set the alarm at 8:00 pm. i instanlty recognize an acrid, weird smell hung in the air. i got out of the room and see him laying facedown on his puke, a half finished bottle of vodka in hand. i go into instant panic mode, screaming ''oh shit fuck shit'' and frantically checking to see if he's breathing. he is alive, but i can't wake him up at all. i had to call an ambulance. they came in and took him off after 10 minutes. i followed them to the hospital. the doctors told me that he won't have any lasting harm but he probably won't wake up for half a day or so. i left my number to a nurse to call me when he woke up, and went back to my house to clean up the mess.  the pool of dried puke proved to be more than i could deal with. i called some cleaning guys to deal with it. i had to pay extra when they saw the mess. then i took jake's laptop with me to the bedroom, plugged it in and tried to boot it up to pass time. surprisingly, it wasn't turned of at all and the game i bought was running. might as well see what this game is about, so i started a new save file and played from the begginning. for the uninitiated: it starts out just like another high school drama where our character has a superpower. cliché. but then things got interesting, then things got so interesting that i couldn't get up except bathroom breaks, then the game took a very unexpected trip on the feels train that i was played it in teared-up mode for the last hour. by the ending i was loudly crying my fucking ass off (check the reactions on forums). i turned it off, went back to my freshly cleaned living room and took a large gulp from jake's leftover vodka.  after drying my tears off i got curious about how far did jake play. so i went back to his laptop and boot it up to see his save file. fucking completed. only then i realized what the fuck have i done. if the game made me cry like a fucking bitch then i coulnd't even imagine what did it do to him after a fresh breakup. might as well snuff a fire out by pouring gasoline over it. so here i sit, waiting a call from the hospital while wanting to slap myself.  tl;dr: friend is dealing with a break up. buy life is strage to help him deal with it. the game fucks him up even more.  edit: he woke up! he's still hammered though. he swears he will never play anything else i buy him ever again. :d  edit 2: guys seriously i'm not trying to market this game. i would post this without even giving the game's name away if i could. stop accusing me of marketing :dthis did actually happen today, about an hour and a half ago.  i recently started working a job in a county courthouse that requires me to arrive at 8am. i typically get to the courthouse around 7:40 and, while i'd prefer to head right to my desk and get an early start on my day, due to union rules i'm not technically allowed to enter my office until 8am exactly. so typically, i stop at the courthouse coffee shop which opens at 730am.   side note, i hate having coins, and this coffee shop only accepts cash. they have a cup positioned right in front of the cash register for "take a penny, leave a penny" purposes. so i use this very frequently, and unfortunately, i'm usually taking more than leaving. i know i know, it's bad karma but i really hate coins. they're like little subway handrails that you carry around in your pocket, it's disgusting.   so today, i pour my coffee, walk up to the register and an greeted by a very cheery high school student with special needs. this is common as the county allows them to volunteer at the shop as a means of gaining experience to help them find a paying job. i put my coffee down and rings up the transaction. it comes to $1.06 and all i have is a $20 bill. so i reach into the cup, as i've been many mornings prior, and grab six cents to hand to her. the look on her face tells me something is wrong. she then informs me that the cup is a collection cup for donations for the special needs volunteers. as my brain is trying to process the fact that for weeks i've been blatantly helping myself to the money in this cup, right on front of plenty of the volunteers and other employees of the court house. i insist that can't be the case, as i've used it before. she then spins the cup around to show that it says "donations for our volunteers" the rest of the transaction is dead silent. she hands me my change which immediately dump into the donation jar and mutter a weak "im sorry" as i slink away.   tl; dr tifu by stealing donations from special needs children.    edit; apparently the dick move in this post is me abusing the take a penny leave a penny system. i do typically break a bill at the end of the week and dump the remaining 94 cents into the cup. so i end up giving more than i take. just clarifying.  also, front page is pretty neat  edit: i worded the giving taking part wrong. i was saying i tr to put money in when i can, but i usually still take more than i give. unlike most tifu, this one actually happened today.    so, i'm a dentist.  there was a young early 20s new patient in the office today whose boyfriend tagged along.  at some point during the exam, the topic of breaking bad came up. i'm a huge fan and pretty much recommend it to anyone if i find out they haven't seen it. i know it's on netflix so, at some point, while talking to them, i'm mentioning how good it is and i tell them they can go netflix and chill. i've seen the phrase here a bit and on other social media.  since netflix has become so big, i assumed it just meant relax and watch something on netflix and that was what the young kids were doing a lot these days. they both kind of look at each other, giggle, and mention something like they could do that. i'm not young, but i'm under 40 and i thought they just found it funny i would use a newer phrase.  fast forward to tonight.  i'm just sitting here watching baseball when this epiphany strikes out of nowhere.  i realize there was something a little off about their reaction to my using that phrase.  so i googled it... just to make sure.  now i'm horrified that i told a young couple to go home and have sex. i only hope it was obvious, i didn't know what i was saying.  edit:  i'm just glad i'm not the only one who didn't know.  hopefully this helped others not repeat my mistake. :pi've collected several prescriptions for seretide, my preventer inhaler, but i don't use it too often so i accumulate a few in the bathroom. i always use them before a big day out. so, in preparation for nye, i get out of the shower, deodorise, open the inhaler and take a deep blast into my lungs.   what i didn't do was check the inhaler before i used it. turns out a nest of baby cockroaches had moved in right on the nozzle inside the mouthpiece. i sprayed the back of my throat full of cockroaches.   tldr: it's five sentences, just read it.  edit:  jesus ok i get it it's 6 sentences fark!long-time lurker, first post!  *this happened when i was but a young, dumb lad, about fourteen years ago.*  if anyone remembers what airports were like in october of 2001, then this story will make a lot more sense. only a month after the awful 9/11 attacks, my parents decided it would be a lovely time to take a good ol' family trip to disneyland. we left home (canada) without any problems - airport security was immense, police presence pretty heavy - but nothing that we didn't expect. some of the extra security was a little scary (as i was seven), but i was too excited for disneyland to care all that much.  as expected, disneyland was all that a little boy could want. we rode the rides, we ate the food, and most importantly, i bought a huge helium mickey-mouse shaped balloon that i *loved*. the kind of inexplicable, irreversible love that any young child develops for a new toy. like i *really fucking loved* this balloon.   the day after i purchased my priceless treasure, it was time to leave. now our family was prepared for extra airport security, but we had *no idea* what was in store for us when traveling out of the us.  american security made canadian security look like semi-retired mall cops.   fast-foward to the security line headed out of anaheim. i was happily holding my beloved balloon, completely oblivious to the army of tsa officers, hi-tech security machinery, and immense police presence surrounding me. when the family in front of us began the process of opening their bags, taking off shoes, etc, my mother realized that i probably wouldn't be able to bring a giant bag of helium aboard a plane. just before we stepped forward to get screened ourselves, she told me to dispose of the balloon. so like any smart rational seven year old, i popped it.   holy hell. the sound alone of the giant balloon popping sounded like a miniature explosive. all hell broke loose. people all around us started crying (yes crying, this was a month after 9/11), sirens started blaring (complete with flashing lights), and about 10 men dressed in hardcore military get-up rushed in, pointing their ~~fully automatic~~ really big and terrifying weapons at my *entire family*. of course, we were all detained.  four hours later we weren't on our plane, but instead were just being released from the hell that is the tsa airport-prison. after countless interviews, questions, and additional screenings, we were allowed to rebook a flight and return home that night.   tl;dr, popped a ballon in security shortly after the 9/11 attacks, almost got my entire family arrested / shot.  edit: gun fact. not sure if they were automatic, but tsa doesn't carry automatic weaponry so thought i'd edit for improved accuracy (thanks to paxgarmana for pointing that out).  edit 2: front page?! wow, thank you! didn't expect my first post to blow up like this, made my week!well, that was awkward. like 2 hours ago, i must have been having a bad dream or something. i woke up to the sound of knocking on the door and thought i heard crying. i rushed to the door thinking it was an emergency and it ended up being johovah's witness recruiters. 2 younger (probably around 20) girls. all i had on were my pajama pants. they continued on with their pitch as i stood there awkwardly. they gave me a packet and went on their way... and then i realized... my dick was just hanging out of the front door of my pajamas!  thinking back to their opening statement... "is now a bad time? we can come back later"... and my response, "oh no! it's fine!" and then me reaching out for the impulsive handshake at the end... what have i done?  update 3: narration by /u/markreadsreddit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8chpuhmpteg  update 2: here's a picture of the packet thing. some people wanted to know what they gave me. http://i.imgur.com/bz9sy9z.jpg  update: they ended up coming back, but this time with a guy. i apologized to them for answering the door like i did to which the guy responded, "it happens to the best of us". they handed me another watchtower packet and left.  tl;dr: answered the door to jehovah's witness recruiters with  my dick hanging out, shook hands, realized afterwards. check your pee hole before answering the doorokay so this morning i go into the bathroom to do my morning business.  my nephew is spending the weekend so his mother brought his stool to stand on when he brushes his teeth.  as i am sitting there trying to go, the cramps hit and i am serious pain and need to poop.  i think back about a previous post about raising your feet up off the floor helps you take a dump.  so i drag the stool over and put my feet up.  it is not particularly comfortable and i am not sure how high my feet are supposed to be.  well mine are about 8-10" off the ground.  all of the sudden the urge hits me and i let loose.  the hard plug followed by a severe poopsplosion.  well, when you raise your feet that high, you also change the angle of your anus. a large part of the spray escapes the toilet painting my calves as it goes by.  i look up to see it on the floor, shower curtain and all over my legs.  it was the worst cleanup job ever, i am even gagging as i type this.  around three months ago i applied to be an extra in the new star wars film. they are shooting in the uk this summer fairly close to where i am based and had put out a casting call for 'salty sea dogs' (http://collider.com/star-wars-episode-7-casting-call/).  having spent the last 6 months allowing my beard to grow out, i thought it would be a great opportunity to put my 'young captain birdseye' look to some actual use. so i fluffed up the facial hair, sent off some pictures of my heavily bearded face, and waited for a call from the casting agency.  three months later and i hadn't heard anything back. by that point i thought it was fair to assume i hadn't got it. after all, every bearded man in the country had probably applied.   so i finally got round to shaving.   to be exact, i shaved at 1.50pm today.   exactly seventeen minutes later i got a text from the casting agency, specifying that i more or less had a part so long as i 'still have a good beard'.  the photos below were originally just the obligatory before/after beard selfie for facebook. instead they just documented one of the most badly timed shaves in history:  http://i.imgur.com/qdovgre.jpg  warning to all my bearded comrades: don't ever get rid of it! the universe will get you back for it.  no star wars for me. and i look about 15 now.    edit: **update** 4th july, 11.56am (gmt)  so... i replied with 'available' and received an email this morning that laid out specifically the look they were going for (long beards/long hair). the email finished with:  *"if your hair is currently similar to this and you are generally free for filming in august on a major new feature film as an extra please email me back a 'selfie' of your current hair by the end of friday 4th july"*  disaster.  as much as i would have loved to send them another pre-shave photo, the honest side of me resisted the dark side and sent back an email explaining my predicament and with a photo of how the beard will look in around 6 weeks time (http://i.imgur.com/pumk7hm.jpg).  if they want me they will reply. so now i wait. and as soon as i hear back i will let you guys know.  ps - to the conspiracy theorists suggesting it's impossible for me to have shaved and showered in 8 minutes, there's this great new invention called an electric razor. you just run it over your face and the beard is gone. it's like magic!   edit: **update** 11th july, 17.51pm (gmt)  as much as i wish i could deliver great news at this point, i still haven't heard back. i will send a quick followup email now, but from here it looks unlikely i will get it. not 'salty' enough, clearly.  on the bright(ish?) side, and as some of you have pointed out, it seems that the original casting call which did the rounds online (http://collider.com/star-wars-episode-7-casting-call/) could have been mistaken about 'salty sea dogs' being for star wars. instead it could well be for the next peter pan film (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3332064/), which is shooting in shepperton around the same time. sadly i can't verify this as i was given very little information in my contact with them (as you'd expect).  of course if i hear back i will post here immediately... but sorry to let you down!this was a while back when my daughter was a toddler.  my husband and i didn't want her sipping on his beer so we called that daddy's juice.  "no, you can't drink that it's daddy's juice"  one day i went to pick up my daughter from daycare and her teacher saw me and started giggling.  it was around mother's day and she had the kids do a little project where they answered some questions about their mommy.  how tall is mommy?  what is mommy's favorite color?  including "what is mommy's favorite drink?" the answer being... daddy's juice.  well, that was a bit embarrassing to say the least. i explained to her what it was and we had a good laugh. this actually happened yesterday, so it's relatively fresh   right, so at the moment i am at disney world orlando with my dad and little sister. my sister is 10 and i am 17. as my sister is a dumbass and can't walk in a straight line as she is looking at all the disney shenanigans, i sometimes put my hand on her back and guide her through the crowds.  now the fuck up: we are walking in a big crowd towards the haunted mansion and i see my sister walking the wrong way so without really paying attention i again start guiding her for a few minutes. when we get to the haunted mansion i look down and realise, that's not my sister. she was wearing similar clothes and looked similar but this was definitely not my sister. fuck. that's also when my dad noticed. i had managed to lose my sister, and kidnap someone else's daughter at the same time.  luckily ad disney they are used to lost kids, petrified parents and confused siblings/ child thief's and managed to find the girls parents. and sadly, they found my sister too.  tl:dr went to disney.  saw sister. kidnapped a little girl.   edit: haunted mansion not haunted house  wow okay this has blown up, i'm glad you are all enjoying my sisters misfortunes.   narrated  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki6ph8dnz7k&amp;amp;feature=youtu.belemme see how i can start this... so every day i look forward to going to my history class, i love history. so my super chill teacher, who is really more of a role model to me than a teacher. he decided that our class has been working hard in preparation for finals, and that we should watch some show called "the office."  so the open scene shows some lad talking about how bosses are like teachers, and the boss said that teachers also bang students, akin to bosses banging coworkers.  well, i didn't quite catch that part, i'm kind of hard of hearing. i only caught the part about how bosses are like very good teachers and that some bosses are good teachers or something like that, i didn't really catch it.  here's the fuck up; he asked me if i was enjoying the show. "stevie," he said. "are you enjoying this show brotha'?" and i tried to come up with some witty comeback, and unfortunately i need to work on thinking before i say something. i said; "yeah! this show seems like an autobiography of your life." and i didn't hear or realize that i said that right after the big boss guy said; "also teachers bang their students."  he looked at me for one second, and said; "dude that's so disrespectful." it took me a second to think and i said "i've never seen the office... sorry dude... what's the show about?" and he just said; "turn around, please." in one of the most upset voices i've ever heard. i did as he said, and he was so mad that he turned off the show and said we had to read from our textbook for the rest of class.  i was very confused of why he was mad, and someone explained me the context. i felt very bad, and i went up to him and said; "hey, can we talk about this?" he just told me to go and sit down. so i started writing an apology note. at the end of class, i successfully wrote a one and a half page note.  after class i said; "now do you want to talk about it?" he said; "sure, what you said was very inappropriate and mean spirited. i was so embarrassed by what you said." and i tried to explain to him the context in which i heard it in, but he didn't want to hear it. i gave him my apology note, and he said "thanks, for that, i want to talk about this on friday." and usually when he says he wants to talk later, i know he's going to throw some sort of detention at me.  i wanted to say more, but i choked on my tears and left. when i got home i started bawling like a baby. not because i don't want to get in trouble, but because i had lost one my friends today.  teacher, you told me you lurk reddit. if you see this, i hope you can forgive me one day. i really didn't mean to imply that you're a pedophile. i know your passion is teaching, and please don't feel down...  tl;dr: watched the office, tried to make a witty remark, now my teacher and friend hates me.  **update**: i'm going to school now, i'll report back in a few hours.  ok, so i decided to use reddit's advice and just not approach him and have him approach me about it. i went in to take my exam, and he said; "might want to move your backback, stevie." and gave me a pat on the back. also someone at my school showed this post to him, so i suppose he isn't mad at me anymore, which puts me at ease.   i'm sure you have all heard the story about the person yelling "are you fucking sorry". well.. today i did something similar.   5:30pm comes around at work and i'm just chatting with a few people as we are finishing up. i then thought it might be cool if we go for a couple of beers after work. so i turned to my female colleague and went to ask her if she was game.   however being the excellent clear speaker that i am i stumbled over my words and started saying " do you want a quick one" except halfways through saying quick i changed the word to sneaky.   i ended up asking her "do you want a quickie".  luckily she just laughed and told everyone else but i'm not going to live it down for a while.  edit: to all those asking a sneaky refers to getting a drink or two when you wouldn't usually have one.   and i'm australian so you don't even need to use the word beer or drink in that sentence.tl:dr rock out, til the cops out.  i was driving home from work and got really into this blues song (it was on pandora, no clue who it was).  the bass was jumping like jacks, the guitar was singing the melodiest of melodies, the drums had a beat that just rounded it off and got me jammin'.  so i'm tapping along to the beat on my wheel until we get to a red light. nice! it just turned red. pushed in the clutch, stopped the truck and now i have a kick pedal (thump my right foot on the ground). the roads flat so my truck stays without my foot on the brake.   i'm pretty much fully engulfed at this point... then i pick up on the high hat opening ever other 4th... so here i am, lost in the fucking music at a red light and lift my left foot instinctively to raise the high hat and my truck lurches forward into the cop car.   he gets out, checks out the car. luckily our bumpers lined up so there was no visible damage.  but i guess he was watching me flail around and thought i was high or some shit, made me do a sobriety test etc... then lectured me a bit and sent me on my way. not a terrible ending, i know, but it put a damper on the fantastic mood i was in.    edit: some requested things and other errors. also i'm searching for the song.  2: the throwout bearing gets replaced when i change the clutch out, so i'm not concerned about it wearing out. i'll throw it away long before that time comes. so, i'd got pretty drunk with my girlfriend and a married couple we're friends with, and was appropriately hungover this morning. i walked my gf to work and then started to make my way home.  my apartment is like an hour walk away from hers, and i'm starting to feel my beeriod coming on, and realise i'm not going to make it back without making a pit stop on the way.  now, i have this thing about hating using starbucks bathrooms without having bought anything, and i wasn't in the mood to go anywhere i had to talk to anyone. luckily, i know the national art gallery is both free, and has really nice bathrooms.   this is when the fuck-ups started. i'm *profoundly* hungover, so i don't think it's a big deal when the nearest door i find isn't the big one, and has a guard posted at it. he's busy talking to a woman so i just walked on in. i realised pretty quickly that i was in the wrong section, so tried to get to the main gallery.   so i go downstairs and can see a part of the gallery i recognise through a glass door, and luckily there's a guy going through. i was too far away to get through with him and hate making noise too much to hail him, so i just watched the code he put in from the end of the hallway and copied it. lo and behold, it actually worked.  i go and answer the call of nature, and decide i'm gonna have a bit of a jolly and look at some paintings. so, i'm having a great time looking at a portrait of a woman partying down with some jank-ass cherubs and shit, when i decide i'm too hungover to deal with art anymore. so, i tried to get out.   except i couldn't. the door was locked, and i must've set off an alarm or something when i tried to open it, because about two minutes later this giant security guard comes up behind me and says "sir, i'm going to have to ask you to come with me, or i'm calling the police."  luckily, i think he realised i wasn't an art thief by the fact i was whistling really loudly when he found me and had spent most of the time verbally mocking the paintings. apparently the art gallery wasn't open for another half hour, which i didn't know. so i got escorted out by big mclargehuge, and then made my way home, where obviously my first recourse was to tell reddit.  tl;dr -  help will always be given at hogwarts to those who break into an art gallery  edit: rip in peace my inboxthis literally happened 15 mins ago, i'm still slightly traumatised. to give just a bit of background, i'm a 17 year old male, and live with my sister who is a couple years older than me, and parents of course.  i have this strange habit that occurs subconsciously whenever i feel the need to go to the bathroom. when i'm alone, i'll casually whip out the d as i'm walking towards the bathroom, and as soon as i reach the toilet i let loose. easy peasy, i'm in and out of there in like 10 seconds. usually this isn't a problem, if i notice anyone around i simply do what any other civilised human being would do and not unleash my genitals.  today i was watching a video on my phone so i had earphones in. on my journey to the bathroom, i was giggling like a little girl so i didn't realise my sister was already sitting on the toilet as i walked in. why the door wasn't fucking closed i will never fucking know. as i stroll in (with phone in one hand and dick in other mind you) i hear a voice say "sorry i'm in..." which then cuts off. slowly i look up from my phone. i swear if you saw her face it would be like i killed someone, though a part of her probably died so yeah.  i got the absolute fuck out of there, and here i am in bed, watching netflix and writing this. i'm not getting up after that traumatising experience.  tl;dr had to take a leak, instead showed my sister my flaccid ding dong.  i'll preface this by saying that my love for hot sauce borders masochism. i often carry a bottle of dave's insanity sauce or the like wherever i go.  redditting on my phone and about to add said sauce to my salad, i didn't bother to look up before habitually giving the bottle a good shake. i'm not sure when or how the cap on the bottle broke but as soon as i gave the first upward shake, the cap flew off, followed by a steady stream of red all over my right shoulder. upset, i grabbed napkins and was about to clean myself off. within seconds, the shrill screams tore through the grocery store alerting me and everyone else to the horror unfolding.   this poor baby, who, only seconds ago, was fast asleep, had been awakened by an unnaturally spicy sauce around his eyes, nose and mouth. he had already started to rub them in an attempt to relieve the pain, exacerbating the burning. his mom grabbed napkins and ran to the sink to soak them. in desperation, i took my cold coconut water (with chunks) and proceeded to pour it on the child's face.   15 minutes later, the ambulance showed up. a store employee had called paramedics. they took the kid and mother to the ambulance to properly care for him and probably take him to a hospital.  at this moment of relative calm, i realize the crowd who had gathered to help had sharply focused their attention on me. it felt like the end of the birds. i stepped carefully (with my salad and hot sauce in hand) through an eerily quiet crowd, hoping to not evoke a brutal attack. as i walked past the ambulance, i offered my card to the mother, asked her to please send me the medical bill and repeated my profuse apologies. they were not well received.   tl;dr: cap broke on insanely hot sauce and accidentally sprayed a stranger's baby in the face with it.  edit: thank you for the gold and the comforting remarks. still no word from the mother. i don't know if that is a good thing or she's formulating a plan of attack. and yes, i definitely should have put my finger on the cap before shaking.i work at a small video game development studio. we recently attended a major exhibition/convention to promote our new title—a strategy game with real-time strategy and card game elements. we had a fancy booth with half a dozen computers set up and a full set of staff recruiting people, pitching to them, and showing them the game. the key "sell" that we were trying to make was to collect emails for a mailing list that we would use in the future for marketing, beta testing, and crowdfunding/kickstarter. emails are the holy grail. without them, showing off the product would be virtually worthless.  a few important things about booths at conventions/trade shows:  * there is seldom and cell phone reception because there are tens of thousands of people walking around. * the wifi is unusably awful. * wired internet costs $700/day, or $2800 for the 4-day convention.  fuck-up number 1: i had chosen to skimp out and skip getting the wired internet. our game demo didn't require any internet connectivity.  fuck-up number 2: all of our nice computers were being used as demo machines, and we were stuck with a chromebook to collect the email sign-ups. chromebooks don't work very well without internet, but i had managed to load up a google doc spreadsheet in "offline mode" to collect all of the emails. or so i thought.  over the course of four days, we collected hundreds of email sign-ups in the spreadsheet. everything seemed just fine. however, when we got back to the office, the chromebook reconnected with the internet, synced, and the entire spreadsheet was erased in an instant. turns out that it wasn't properly set up in offline mode, so none of our edits to it were saved.  the entire product of our trip to the trade show, which required weeks of preparation and over $6500 in costs, was gone.  edit: yay, looks like this is actually the top /r/tifu post that has nothing to do with sex.  edit 2: as others have pointed out, the game is called [prismata](http://prismata.net). i'm not sure if posting that is a violation of the rules on posting personal information; i will gladly remove the link if mods so request.  edit 3: thank you to everyone trying to help. we've tried just about everything. the chromebook is an hp cb2. the one thing we have not tried is scraping the hard drive, but every method i've seen for doing that seems to involve booting the device in developer mode, which apparently erases the hard drive. if anybody knows a method of actually doing this, we'll certainly give it a go.  edit 4: damn, now this is on top of all the sex posts.  edit 5: thanks to everyone who pmed me offering to sign themselves up to our list; you guys are awesome.  edit 6: holy shit! i just checked our site stats; apparently thousands of you clicked that link above, and our list grew by more today than it otherwise has grown in the last month! we added **more new emails than we lost at the exhibition**. honestly, i have no words; you guys fucking rock.  edit 7: what the fucking fuck!!?!?! i get in this morning and our mailing list has tripled. you guys have added 2x more names than the rest of our company's entire marketing efforts to date. what is this shit?  edit 8: so apparently the r/bestof crosspost is now one of the top links on r/all; here's what you guys did to our mailing list: [http://imgur.com/edrqhjx](http://imgur.com/edrqhjx)  edit 9: here it is again at the end of the day, it's literally 1100% times higher than it was 48 hours ago: [http://i.imgur.com/s33tyqy.png](http://i.imgur.com/s33tyqy.png) just fucking unbelievable. even a few media folks contacted me about the story. the google docs offline team also contacted us to try to identify the problem and possibly recover our lost data. thank you all for your interest in prismata; we will try our damnedest to get the servers running at their max capacity so that you can all play as soon as possible!last night, i was on the bus coming home from visiting a friend in a nearby town, and i fell asleep. so i start dreaming about her, and before i know it, it turns sexual. a slow, lustrous tension builds up as, in my dream, i slowly slide my hand up her naked thigh. the second i reach her privates, all the muscles in my body release in a wonderful spasm of ecstasy.  it's enough to wake me up. of course, with a sinking stomach, i realize instantly what is happening; my dick is happily pumping cum into my underwear like it's waving freely in an open field. except i'm sitting in the window seat on a fully packed bus with two hours left to go, and the bathroom is out of order. to my horror, as i'm contemplating my pitiful existence, i feel the cum start to slide into the crack of my ass. there's no way to move to make it better. water finds the fastest, most efficient route to succumb to gravity, and any way i move gets my cum deeper into my ass.   if that wasn't bad enough, by the time i eventually got to a bathroom, it had crusted most of my ass hairs together. pulling my cheeks apart has never been more painful - both physically and emotionally. i cried all kinds of tears last night.  tl;dr: i had a wet dream and came in my own ass.this all started when i was christmas shopping 2 days ago and i decided to get my parents a christmas card, i grabbed one that said something along the lines of "happy holidays" and left the store. i gave my dad the card and as he reads it his eyes fill up with tears, he calls my mom near him and she starts screaming out of happiness, i was really confused as it was just a card, they suddenly say "so is it a boy or a girl i'm so happy!" i'm really confused now and apparently i found out that the card says "happy holidays grandma" and my parents thought it was a way to tell them i was expecting. they're very upset now.*my* doggy. so yes, i'm biased. still:  it's 630am. i stumble downstairs to get my wife's lunch together for school (shut up, she's a teacher). and there's buster, his entire body whipsawing back and forth under the force of his tail-wagging joy at the reminder that i exist as an entity. he's already been on a three-mile run with my wife that morning, but is he the slightest bit tired? heavens no.  i stump over to the coffee maker. buster jams himself between me and it, his desire for pettins an almost palpable form hanging in the air, his big soulful eyes following me like a junkie tracking a hit. i decide (well, it's decided for me) that the booboo better have his felt needs addressed, and i lean over to pet him, give him ear-scratchings, etc. you know the drill.  buster, however, feels that the time it's taking me to lean down is altogether untenable and decides to meet me halfway up. he launches all seventy-five pounds of lanky half-chocolate lab/ half weimaraner muscle up at me with the speed of a thousand lasers. his weaponized skull, which i swear to christ must be made of adamantium or some shit, connects with my face so hard the air around us ignites. there is a massive pa-*ploom* as my eyeballs bounce off the back of the inside of my (surely freakin' *liquified*) skull, purple and green shockwaves ricocheting around behind my eyelids.  i get back onto my feet (oh yeah: my lil' boo laid me the *fuck* out) and claw my way up to the kitchen sink, blood geysering everywhere from my destroyed nose. i do what any sane man would do, which is bellow something along the lines of "oh you fucking dog" over and over again whilst bleeding into the plumbing.  this of course prompts my wife to come charging out of the bathroom, all naked and soapy from the shower, which in any other situation would be just fine with me. however, i am still shrieking invective into the sink, so i don't actually see this. what i *hear*, however, is the squeak and thudity-thud of her being bodily tackled by a thoroughly freaked-out dog who is learning more about the world being a confusing place every day.  anyhoo. buster has calmed down now. i mopped the blood off of the floor and gave him his antler to gnaw to pieces as a calming exercise. he's taking his mid-morning nap now. my wife was able to rinse the blood, soap and dog hair off and still get out the door on time. i've been sitting here with a bag of frozen peas across my eyes, hoping the shiners aren't too bad by the time i have to go to work myself.  [this is buster.](https://imgur.com/33c2pyn) he's my buddy and i love him very much, but omigod fuck him so much right now.so this happened to me a few days ago.   i am heading back to toronto after a lovely christmas in belize. i am in line to clear customs at the houston airport, because for some reason you need to clear us customs even if you're transiting through to canada.  since the line is moving so slowly, they move all the toronto people to another, slightly less slow-moving line. i am at the back of the line, along with a girl from south korea. she seems very worried that she is going to miss her flight (which is going to leave in about 15 minutes). i tell her that we are on the same flight, and do my best to assure her that we're going to make it. we are indeed cutting it very close, but i try to distract her by making small talk.  right before it is my turn to speak to the customs agent, she says to me, "i'm sorry to ask you this, but do you mind if we go together?" i interpret this as her asking if it is okay if we go to the gate together. it is obvious that english is not her first language, so i thought she was worried she would get lost. i reluctantly agree; even though i don't want to miss my flight, it wouldn't be right to leave someone like that. as i am walking up to the customs agent, i see her walking with me. turns out she did not mean "go together" to the gate, but rather "go together" through customs.   now, you have to understand, i am a young, south asian male in an american airport. at the time i not only had a two-week beard (didn't bother bringing a razor to belize), but was also wearing a shemagh around my neck. i feared that once the customs agent saw through our ruse, that i would be taken to the back and cavity searched.  the agent looks at our passports, then at us. looks at our customs forms. back at us. passports. custom forms. back at us. finally he says, "i'm trying to determine if y'all are married." i reply, "not yet…" and laugh nervously. after what seems like an eternity he tells us we are free to go.  we now have less than five minutes before our flight leaves. we are in terminal a and our gate is in terminal e. we basically sprint the entire way there and make it just as they are about to close the gate. we make it to our seats – which are coincidentally next to each other – laughing and congratulating ourselves on a job well done.  i figure that i should take this time to get to know my new fake wife-to-be. it is a three hour flight after all, and she seems cool enough. i ask her what she was doing in belize. "working at the ministry." wow! like the ministry of finance? or agriculture? she must be super smart to work for the government of another country. what's more attractive than an intelligent woman?  turns out she didn't say ministry. she said missionary. she was working as a missionary. "i'm a jehovah's witness." she explains. after an awkward pause, she asks, "do you know about jehovah's witnesses?"  at this point i know i'm screwed. if i say no, she'll tell me about jehovah's witnesses. if i say yes, she'll ask me what i know, and then tell me about jehovah's witnesses.  needless to say, when we reached toronto three hours later, i regretted not leaving her at customs.  tl;dr risked my anus (at least in my mind) to help a stranger catch her flight, ended up getting missionary for three hours.  **edit** [hilarious narration](http://youtu.be/bkas_gbhoma) by /u/cyae1 (thanks!)  yes, i suppose i could have politely told her i wasn't interested. i honestly kept thinking she was going to stop at any minute and didn't want to hurt her feelings.as i am walking out of work, i finally check my phone and see i have 4 or 5 missed calls from the same number, all within a few minutes time span. i also notice i have a text from my younger brother a few minutes before the phone calls. the phone starts ringing again, so, naturally, i answer it. shouting and commotion-- i start to worry and am a little confused. "who is this? hello? hello!" i tell them my name.  "your brother has been in an accident, he's very badly hurt man. he's bleeding really bad. he said to get your number and call you." i'm very panicked at this point, but trying to hold it together. i'm starting to put together in my mind, that text i received from my brother was probably sent while he was driving and he probably crashed. he lives in a part of the city with a lot of mexicans, so the guy's spanish accent checks out too, as well as the city area code. then it get's way darker.  "i'm about to tell you something man, and i need you to listen. your brother he's in a lot of trouble man (i'm thinking he's dying in a car crash) your brother was texting on his phone and backed out and ran over my little nephew man! he left him in the street like a dog to died. he got scared and tried to run. i know it was a mistake but he left him like a dog. he's not breathing."  at this point, the text i received makes more since (texting and driving), he lives next to a bunch of little mexican kids, so it is very plausible that he was not looking and accidently did something so terrible. this guy then explains to me through tears, and screaming that they ran down my brother who was trying to run, and have beat the shit out of him. they have him back at their house and have a gun to his head. i can hear screaming and shouting in the background, one of an english speaking person through spanish. my first instinct is, he ran over a gang member's little kid, holy shit, holy shit. i immediately ask to talk to him to make sure he's still alive and haven't hurt him too bad (they say he's bleeding, but only needs stitches at this point). my thought is that this might be the last time i talk to my brother if something goes wrong, so they put him on the phone screaming "don't call the cops, don't call the cops!" and all i am saying over and over is "i love you, i love you, i'm gonna fix this, i love you."   this guy explains that obviously they have warrants and cant go to the cops, so i need to give them money in exchange for my brother's life. "are you going to do this, yes or no, tell me now or i pull the trigger!" of course, yes, yes, anything. i'm told if i hang up he dies, if they hear me talking to anyone else, he dies, if they hear me texting into my phone he dies. i'm told to drive to the nearest walmart and fill out a money gram for 2000$ and send it to their relative in pr as to not have it tracked back to me. the moment they get the money they will put my brother on the phone, put him in a car and push him out at a hospital. i'm told to talk about sports as i wait in line in walmart, and if they think something is up, they will just kill him. the entire time, this guy is switching between crying about his injured nephew, shouting at family members in the background, talking about how he is so sorry to do this to me, but they have no money and police records and they have to do it, but man to man i have his word they wont hurt my brother if i just do as they say. at that point i don't give a fuck, i am so scared to death that i will give them every dollar i have to save my brothers life, and know it needs to happen fast to get him to a hospital.   the lady spells the name wrong on the money gram, as i am reading it back to the guy on the phone i realize.
