This happened today and Ill start with some context. So already looking like a middle eastern man, I get dirty looks by people on a daily basis. Today in history, we learned about terrorism and the event of 9/11 and why it happened. Being a reddit lurker, I remembered a funny thing I read on /r/jokes. I told it to my friends:
Goes something like:
Hey man did you know my dad died on a plane on 9/11?
O thats so sad to hear
Do you know what he said before he left me?
What?
ALLAHU AKBAR!!!

which then made me and my friends burst into laughter. Being a quiet guy myself, my teacher asked me whats so funny and I had to say it cause I thought it was funny, but all I got was looks of shock. Good bye my good reputation.

**TL:DR** ALLAHU AKBAAAAAAAAAARRRRRR!!!
