Actually yesterday. I couldn't sleep, so I wanted to kill some time on chatroulette. I met this cute girl from Morocco (She was white, but I didn't think about it. She could've moved there later or something, right?), and one thing lead to another and she's masturbating on cam on Skype.

She says that if I don't show my dick she will delete me. I was just starting to get horny, so why not. But I was smart enough to not have my face and dick in the picture at the same time.

She lost the connection and logged on again. The first thing she does is send me a link to a youtube video. If you didn't guess it already, the video was first me on webcam with my face and then me showing my dick. The title of the video was my full name with my facebook link in the description.

If I don't give "her" 630 USD she will send the video to all my friends, and she listed up some of my friends on my facebook friendlist. Since I'm panicking, I get my card and empty my savings just to please him. He ended up deleting the video, but he wanted more. That's when I blocked him and he stopped. The video is not online now (at least not with my full name).

**TL;DR Showed my dick on chatroulette and got blackmailed for 630 USD**

EDIT:
I see a lot of the same questions asked over, so I thought I'd add an FAQ.

*Why exactly 630 USD, and not a round number?*

It was a round number in the original currency, but I converted it to USD since most people here are from the states and/or knows how much a dollar is worth.

*You actually paid the guy?!?!???! FUCKING IDIOT*

I was in panic, a lot of you would've done the same thing. He didn't give me a lot of time, so I didn't have time enough to think.

**I see a lot of good posts here, and good answers to what I should do. I've done everything I should to prevent the "hacker" from doing anything more.
And you guys really helped me calm down, and as you say the worst that'll happen is that some of my friends and family sees it. They'll forget about it sooner or later, and after a few months it'll only be a joke to us. But that would probably make it easier to track the guy too, and I think he's in way deeper shit than I am then. Thanks so much for your help!**
