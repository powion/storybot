I posted this in another sub two days ago but i figured that i could post it here as well. 

I was dating this girl when we decided it would be nice and fun to do a bath-date together... Sooo, this night we set up our plan to bath together at her place because i don't have a bathtub.

We already had sex some weeks prior but i didn't want her to see my flaccid dick. Yes, I'm a grower not a shower. And for some stupid reason i just didn't want her to know how my not erect dick looked.

While the water was cooling down and we were waiting for it to reach a comfy temperature she went downstairs to get some wine. This was my chance to strip naked, get in the tub as fast as i could and hide my dick under the shampoo bubbles we just put in.

I didn't feel the water first, there was no time for that so i jumped in there like an olympic swimmer. The water didn't cool down at all... it was still fucking hot. I mean this water was practically boiling. Sauron could've forged that ring in there.

The heat almost got me fainted, I started screaming like a lobster which got my date run up the stairs to see what was happening. There i was, completely naked, with my ass hovering above the water with my flaccid dick peaking through the bubbles.

tl;dr - just show her your flaccid dick or you might burn it

edit - I never could have thought that so many people would be talking about my dick today. Thanks for all the do's and don'ts, will come in handy the next time!
