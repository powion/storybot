This morning I decided to rub one out before going on a family outing. I'm in the shower, and searching through some videos when my wife walks in. 


She sees I have the phone in the shower and gets mad. Not because she knows what I'm doing, but just thinks I'm wasting time on Reddit when I'm supposed to be getting ready. She opens the shower to take my phone and sees my raging boner. This does not go like it does in the movies I've been watching. She reaches for my phone, and I jerk back to exit the private browser. 


This is where she flips the fuck out. 


Wife starts erupting with all her pregnancy hormones. Throws my phone across the room. Starts screaming about me cheating, and asking who I was talking to. She storms out, and I go after her, still naked and luckily grab a towel. She's still freaking out, and our 3 yo daughter comes in to see what's wrong. 


I have to try to explain to her what happened with my 3 yo there. She doesn't quite believe me. Threatens to cancel family outing which involves my parents and sister. Eventually she calmed down, believed me, and has been making fun of me all day. She's gone to bed now, and I'm on the couch for the night. 


TL;DR I tried to jerk, wife went berserk
