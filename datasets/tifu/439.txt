This happened yesterday as most stories on this subreddit. 

So we had a bomb threat all over Massachusetts schools yesterday, we had to be exracted and everything. Police search dogs, bomb squad, FBI. The whole 9 yards. So me and my friend  were walking home when we were released from the school, and we got stopped by some reporter. My Boston accent shines through at the worse times, and the Italian in me makes me speak/think kind of fast. So when the reporter asked (on live TV) if anyone would do something like this, I responded "No one in this school has the fucking balls to do it" the reporter dropped his mic and the camera guy turned away. 

TIFU by swearing on live TV.
