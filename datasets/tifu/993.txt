I was going to my local bank in order to get a replacement debit card. As soon as I enter the bank I begin to look at the cameras and vault access thinking of PayDay 2. I catch myself and continue to the desk and ask for my replacement debit card.

She tells me "have a seat and someone will be with you shortly". I get seated and I again see myself paying attention to employees using keys, entering the vault access, and myself viewing the cameras. I catch myself again and stop. I thought it would be funny to take a picture of the vault access with cameras watching it and sending it to a friend I play PayDay 2 with saying something like "These GenSec cameras are everywhere".

I ensured my phone's audio settings are set to silent. I then take a picture while trying to look non-suspicious. But it turns out that the setting on my Note 3's camera has a separate setting called "Shutter Sound". Need less to say it was enabled. The bank is having a slow day I assume, it was quiet. Then you hear this loud *shutter* noise! I did the opposite of what I should have, I freaked out and hide my phone. Looking nervous I can see the front desk lady looking at me and calling someone on the phone.

Sure enough the police show up and they take me into a conference room at the bank to "talk". The bank employees explain the story and the police ask why I've acted suspicious and took a picture. I felt really dumb, I explained the game and how I wanted to send it to my friend. They look at me like I'm retarded and say "okay, please refrain from acting in this suspicious manner blah blah". I'm thinking of moving to a new bank.
