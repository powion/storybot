So, my life seems to be stitched together by TIFU moments, going back as far as I can remember. Anyway this one happened this morning...

I was taking a shower, pretty normal, nothing out of the ordinary. I have a toothbrush and some toothpaste on the little rack thing, some days I'll brush my teeth while showering, some days I'll do it over the sink. 

I was up early so was taking my time doing stupid stuff like filling my ears up with water, seeing how hot I could handle the water...stupid shit like that..I'm 32 btw! 

Then I decided to brush my teeth. But instead of brushing to and fro with my hand, I closed my eyes and shook my head side to side. I was trying to see if I could get my whole mouth done while keeping my arm in a fixed position. It worked quite well until I'd finished...

The second I stopped brushing and opened my eyes I was unable see straight or balance and it felt like the whole bath tub was sinking on one side. I grabbed the shower curtain to steady myself, this immediately came off of the pole, I fell forwards out of the bath tub and ended up in a heap of naked ness and shower curtain on the bathroom floor! 

Still kind of disoriented I just lay there laughing, then I heard my 8 yo son run up the stairs and open the bathroom door to check on me! He immediately burst out crying! This made me laugh even more!!

When I finally got up off the floor and sorted the mess out and had spoken to my son he said he thought I'd gone crazy...he says heard me scream, then a big thud, then he came running up the stairs and saw my laying on the floor, naked, wrapped in the shower curtain, laughing my head off while I was foaming at the mouth! 



EDIT...tl/dr Brushed my teeth in the shower by moving my head only. Fell out of the bath tub, son burst into tears when he saw me naked, wrapped up in a shower curtain, laughing while foam was coming out of my mouth.

Wow, someone gave me gold for my FU. Thank you /u/kay_k88
