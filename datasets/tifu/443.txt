Today, my gf and I went to go get our nails done together (as good lesbians do). I was really excited for the massage chairs, and unbeknownst to be, they were a little more intense then the ones I am used to. When I sat down, the woman to the left of me commented on how the chair was massaging her ass and she seemed uncomfortable. I figured she was overreacting... That is until the woman who was going to give me a pedicure turned on my chair. 

The woman to my left was right, it was a butt massage, but as I was sitting straight up with my butt in the back of the chair, it hit a different spot. I squealed and my girlfriend gave me a look to shut up, and there were about 20 other women in the place so I didn't want to make a scene. I was like a deer in the headlights, frozen and unable to move, crippled with the anxiety of anyone finding out I was getting a hitachi magic wand straight to my clitoris. Needless to say, I came more than once and almost kicked the woman giving me a pedicure in the face. The chick to my left definitely knew, and gave me cut-eye as she walked out. 

TL;DR: Show me on the doll where the chair touched you.
