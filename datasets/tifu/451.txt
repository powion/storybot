I never thought it would happen to me reddit, but today I fucked up by calling my interviewer gay. 

I've been interviewing for a new position at work over the past several weeks. I have been really stressed, but I had just finished the last interview and decided to unwind by playing ping-pong in the break room with one of my colleagues. 

This is were my fuck up occurred. With my brain near mush and what little concentration I had left focused on the game I made what has to be one of the most cringe-worthy statements of my entire life. 

Enter one of my previous interviewers. He had interviewed me several weeks prior and was clearly gay. Super nice guy, just one of the nicest guys you've ever met and clearly homosexual. 

In any event, he walks into the break room, looks right at me with a big smile and says "YAY /u/cawdrizzle, did you hear the good news?!" and in my delirium I found myself replying "Yeah, the Supreme Court really came through this weekend!"

I have never seen a smile turn into a scowl as quickly as that moment but I tell you if I was timing it, it may have been a world record. My interviewer then coldly says, "You got the job" and walked out of the room. 

So now I'm trying to find out where I can dig a bunker to go live in for the rest of my life. 

Thanks for reading :(


**UPDATE:** Well it's rather anti-climactic but some of you are asking for an update. I passed him in the hall this morning and we exchanged pleasantries like normal. I chose to forgo the apology and just accept that I have the social skills of a newt. I didn't want to unintentionally offend further. However I had previously wrote him a nice letter for being so awesome and checking up constantly on my interview process, so I guess I will be be giving that to him a little sooner than expected. Thanks for the feedback everybody!
