Ok so I live in Colorado and have separate gas and electric companies and typically this time of year your gas bill goes up and electric goes down. 
So money has been tight with the holiday's coming up we have had to forgo some things we have wanted like everyone does this time of year. I pay the bills every Friday. So today I go online to pay my gas bill, and keep in mind the last few months I have paid $90.00 then $117.00 then $247.00 last month which seems oddly high but it was minus 11 at one point so I chalk it up to that. 
Today I check it and its $597.98 and I lose it I'm WTFING all over the place, I call customer service and I am ready to fight. "Listen my bill is to high I have no idea why it would be that much!" 
So the lady on the other end calmly says "Well sir back in august you over paid by about 58 dollars and a credit went onto your account see that CR on your account?"  "Yes..." I say slowing starting to realize what's going on. She says "Well... you have been paying the credit balance the past 3 months and that 596 is a credit on your account not a past due would you like us to send you a check for the 596?." I of course say Yes and needless to say I am an idiot but we wont be completely broke this Christmas. TIFU in a pretty decent way.
