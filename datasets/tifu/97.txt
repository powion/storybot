Got back home in the early hours of the morning with no key. I live in a terraced house and so usually use the back door as an entrance. So I went around the front of the house and proceeded to lift open a grate which I thought would lead into my basement. I opened the grate and slid through this really tight sloping hole. Got covered in cobwebs, the lot. When my feet touched the ground I couldn't see a thing. Pitch black. I then stumbled into something metallic, like a drum kit. I turned my phone light on. I don't own a drum kit. Shit, this isn't my house. 

At that moment my next door neighbour comes running into his basement with a baseball bat ready to knock me the fuck out.

The lights switched on and i'm just stood there with the most sorry look on my face. He laughed it off in the end but I still felt like such an idiot.
