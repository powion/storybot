Ok apparently I have to put this at the front of the post cause no one reads edits. Buttplay is not entirely just for gay people. I get it. Pls don't comment that 

Let me keep this short. FML. So you know how when you search Amazon for let's say electronic parts it will recommend other electronics for you. So rewind a couple days I searched Amazon for huge dildos as a joke to a friend. Then today my dad asked if he could use my Amazon account because I have prime. I give him my account details. He then logs in and comes into my room and begins talking to me about how it's ok to be gay. I asked why he was telling me this and he told me how Amazon had recommended me a transparent swirly dildo or some shit. RIP my sanity

TL;DR: searching Dildos one day makes your dad think gay.


Edit 1: so first off. RIP inbox. Second off the joke was he said something that made him seem gay so I searched Amazon for some dildos and sent the link to him. Also no I'm not homosexual or a homophobic

Edit 2: ARE YOU TRIGGERED YET

Edit 93: I understand that Buttplay is not gay all the time. pls stop telling me

Edit 84724: K this blew up. Quick update my dad knows the situation (hopefully) and he understands. Also DM me those pussys (I mean cats of course, no pussy please (cause I'm gay (triggered now?)))
