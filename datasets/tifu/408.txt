This happened last week but it feels appropriate to still post it here. I like to think I have a pretty good "Gollum" impression. I was practicing my Gollum voice at work (I work in tech support, so people are usually on the phones around me so no one hears me being a weirdo) and I was having a skitzo conversation between myself, Gollum, and Smeagol. The three of us were arguing about work when I said something about skinning my co worker (we'll call her Angela) and wearing her hair like a cape in my Gollum voice, only to follow as Smeagol and say 'Quiet! She'll hear us!'. It was at this point I noticed everyone in silence around me. I peered over my cubicle and Angela was there staring at me in utter fear. 3 days later, Angela quit. 

**UPDATE**: Fellow redditor /u/IsThisNew has uploaded a [voice over narrative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsiP9pPCLsU&amp;feature=youtu.be) of this post, and it's hilarious.
