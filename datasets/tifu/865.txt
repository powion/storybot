I'm 23 years old, and I admittedly deserved this for my cheap, filthy ways. 

Earlier today I was in a grocery store with a friend who was finishing up a transaction with the cashier. During that time, instead of just breaking change at the register like a normal human being, I thought I would casually walk over by the gumball machines to check for free candy, maybe someone put in a quarter and forgot to collect their reward?

I checked four candy dispensers; all empty. One last chance. I opened up the very last dispenser, and to my joyous, dirty surprise, I find a delicious blue gumball just waiting to be devoured. Without any thought or inspection, I excitedly tossed it in my mouth and bit down. At the exact moment of impact from my teeth to the gumball, blue paint bursts all throughout my mouth and starts flowing down my face...Someone put a motherfucking paintball in the gumball machine's dispenser.

So there I am, a sad, teary eyed grown man in a heavily populated grocery store, freaking out in disgust as I spit blue paint out of my mouth by the candy machines. I'm certain I looked ridiculous, and I'm still brushing my teeth. Fuck. 

EDIT: Yes, in the grand scheme of things, it was better that this happened to me than to some unfortunate kid. It was an unintentional good deed having bit the bullet.
