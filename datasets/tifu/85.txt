Obvious throwaway for this one. 

So I play a game called "CS:GO". In this game you can bind your keys to the different types of grenades for fast access. As a result of this and all of the other keys in use, all the keys that are available are super uncomfortable as a push to talk. Then I had a great idea. I went on Amazon, and bought a pedal that I could connect to my PC. I couldn't find the exact one, but this is similar http://www.amazon.com/Control-Keyboard-Action-Switch-Pedal/dp/B00B3PV47O . Paid extra for overnight shipping and viola! I had push to talk bound to the pedal the next day. It all felt so natural. Now, I'm 15 and just recently I got my learners permit to drive on with a parent or guardian. My mom does this thing where she asks me to drive her to places to run errands or buy groceries so I can get a lot of practice in. One day she asked me to take her to the local grocery store. Me being the kid that loves driving, I agreed. Now at this point, me pushing down a pedal to talk to someone became complete muscle memory. Around 2 minutes into the drive we have to stop at a red light. My mom starts talking to me about what car I want to get when I turn 16. I opened my mouth, and it happened. Next thing I know the frontside of the car that I'm driving is in the bumper of the car in front of me. 

Needless to say, I won't be driving my own car for a while.

TLDR: Bound push to talk to a pedal on my PC, ended up rear ending a car when trying to talk to my mom in the car.
