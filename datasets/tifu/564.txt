It's not a very entertaining story, but it will have a good moral at the end for all you young people about my stupidity. Slightly nsfw.

I had a girfriend of 4 years and we broke up. There's a quote from an old movie that goes something like this: you can love them all your life and then stop loving on Thursday. You know, it comes to a point when you just can't bear the person anymore, even if you still love them. 

So when we broke up, it wasn't even hard or bad, I was relieved. For the first time in years I felt some peace in my soul, this serenity and I almost remembered what it's like to be happy. And I thought to myself that I want this feeling to stay, I will not do anything against my will ever again and will be open to everything I come across. Just let go and flow with the tide, right? 

Of course, it backfired just a couple of days later. My friend had a birthday and we went to the woods camping for three days. And there was this girl: 19 years old, freckles, great tits and was the most strange thing ever — seems like she was into me. So we hit it. My friends at this point don't know me and my gf broke up so they're giving me these angry looks like "Wtf man? What are you doing? Are you seriously considering doing her?". That was hard to withstand and also funny in some weird way. Anyway, we get drunk, and she's more and more willing. I have to say that I'm a shy guy(24) and never even came up to a girl on the street and all my sexual "adventures" was with someone I knew for some time and I never had any random one night stands. This is new, strange and EXACTLY what I want cause hey I'm a yes man for tonight. 

My friends are already starting to be vocal, trying to pun me and joke about us, so I get pissed at them (mostly because implying she's a whore may offend her and then I won't get any), say them to fuck off and storm off to the beach alone, thinking it's over and they deliberately done it to piss me off and to prevent me from having sex, those bastards. And then she comes like nothing happened, calms me and we almost have sex right there on the beach. 

We run to my tent, drunk as hell, hot and all over each other. She's probably the most gorgeous woman I've been with: young, very smooth skin, big tits and ass, lips that you wanna just bite off and the tighest, most magnificent pussy ever. We undress each other and I lay on the bottom and then something terrifying happens: she starts giving me a blowjob and I close my eyes, but in a minute she stops and sits on me. I wasn't prepared for that. I sobered for a second, because I DIDN'T USE A CONDOM and she's already fucking me. Never having any unprotected (or with an unchecked partner) sex this really scares me even through all the alcohol. I was so mad at her for not saying anything, for just going in, never asking me shit and all that, but in the end it's my fault and responsibility too, so I say something like "hey bby move", dump her off me and finally get a condom from by backpack. We proceed and I fall asleep with the thing on. What can go wrong, right? She's 19, 19yo girls are shy and carefull, right? You probably can guess what happens next... 

We did it again the next night. And then couple of times again when we returned to the city. Protected now, of course. It was awesome, but I couldn't get that first time out of my head. But in a week my dick starts to hurt, more and more and I freak out. I go to the doctor and get like 7 or 8 tests done, even for HIV because fuck it. Aaaaand — Herpes. I have a fucking herpes, probably the worst thing after HIV cause you can't cure it. I had unprotected sex literaly one time in my life, for less than a minute, with a young and should-be-clean girl and bam — herpes. I have a semi-compromised immune system and it sticks, and I have to eat Aciclovir every damn day or I get pimples and ache on my penis. Probably, for life.

Oh and also now I need to have "The Talk" about it with every woman I'll intend to have a serious relationship. She even said to me once that her mother always told her it's better to have an std than get pregnant. Lol. Yup.

 Don't get me wrong, the disease itself is fine, you live a normal life like with an allergy, just eating pills from time to time. It's my own fault and I promised myself to never be sorry about that week. What gets me is this....karma I've got. The only time in years I let myself go and this happens, instantly. Stupidity, alcohol, nice tits and you can lose your head and do the craziest things. It could've been worse. But it could've been much mech better, It's been almost a year since that and I still don't know how will I tell a girl I really like (because fuck one night stands) that I'm sick and we'll have to deal with that.

**tl;dr**: had first unprotected sex ever, insta herpes. Don't do that.

The moral of this story is simple: kids, always use a condom and don't you ever fuck a stranger, even if it's a hot barely legal girl that wants you bad. 

edit: [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/35dnb4/tifu_for_life_by_sleeping_with_a_hot_19yo_girl/cr3k1bs) is what happened after

edit: people are suggesting I might had it before. I read a lot about it, double checked it, talked to a few doctors and I'm sure that was the date and place I got it. My ex tested negative (yup I told her just in case) and my previous relationship was almost 6 years ago, so, having health issues (with immune system) I think there would be some outbreaks in 6 years if I had it before or I would transmitted it to my gf of 4 years. 

hopefully, last edit: so this is over 2000 posts now, I can't catch on. If tou have any questions please pm me, I can't read all these posts.

**LAST ONE, IMPORTANT EDIT**: I've had so many pm's people asking advice or what to do so I decided to keep this account. If you have any troubles, questions or just want to talk to someone feel free to PM me, I will read and answer to everyone.
