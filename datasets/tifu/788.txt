I have some issues with premature ejaculation, and have had for a while. Today I had to go to my doctor to get a rash on my dick checked out, which I knew might be an issue but my doctor is usually a nice old guy, so I figured I'd be alright. When I got there, though, I was told I'd be with a different doctor; didn't recognise the name. Got in and she was FINE. I mean, seriously beautiful. Just the thought of this woman looking at my dick, touching it, made me feel all kinds of feelings and then BAM. Great. So I excused myself, went to clean up (said I suddenly needed to piss); she seemed to think it was a bit odd but I guess she's seen weirder. (I actually just did it again thinking about it.)

Get back a couple minutes later and we discuss the problem, she asks to take a look. I knew this was coming but I figured I just came, so I should be fine, right? Nope. A single rubber-gloved finger touches my tiny flaccid penis and it pathetically ejaculates the tiny amount of jism that was left in me. Hopefully it'll be the old guy again next time.

TL;DR: Came to the doctor's, came at the doctor, came on the doctor.
Alternate TL;DR: I came, she saw, no conquering involved.

Update for those weirdos wanting to know more: She was very professional about it, asked if I wanted to clean up (I did) and then carried on and asked if I wanted help with it (I am seeking medical help and therapy, so hopefully that'll sort it out). As for the guy who asked how much for some unfathomable reason: imagine letting a teaspoon of golden syrup drip down your fingers and you've about got it.
