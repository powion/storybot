I am a 21 year old guy. Today I was returning home from a dinner party when along the way I met this girl on the bus.

Before moving ahead, let me bring to light the fact that she is very good looking (drop dead gorgeous if I may say so). 

So we were standing on the bus, due to the lack of empty seats and she was right behind me. For some reason, the driver braked hard and we were all pushed ahead. The girl almost fell on me and I picked  her up and asked her if she was okay. She smiled and replied that she was and we got talking about stuff. She was a student and so was I and we both talked a bit about studies and all. We flirted a bit and hit it off; and also exchanged numbers. I was happy about being so lucky... 

After a great time I arrived at my stop and bid adieu to her and said I will keep in touch. She smiled and waved me goodbye and I got down. 

I started walking home from the stop, feeling lucky about having met this absolute stunner of a woman... Then out of habit I checked my back pocket.

My wallet was gone. 

(For those wondering, I tried the number and it was a hoax..)
