One of my cousins lost her left middle finger in an accident a few years ago. 

The other day, she posted a photo on Facebook of her **right** hand nails after she'd have them painted. In my quasi-drunken state, I decided to leave a humorous comment. The next morning, I checked my phone, to see numerous angry comments. Confused, and unable to remember what I'd written, I went to the photo.

Turns out that I'd written "Do you get a 10% discount?"

Next time I meet with her should be... fun.

I posted proof in the comments earlier on, but I think it's been buried. [Here it is](http://i.imgur.com/j4iRORf.png)

The "How to count" Edit: A lot of people seem to be confused as to why a 10% discount is necessary and not a 20% off.

To clarify, most people get both hands worth of nails done at once. You have 10 fingers. 10% of 10 is 1. 10-1 is 9- the number of nails that she needs done.

Also, someone did a reading of this. It's on YouTube with the same name as this post, but I can't link it here- at the request of the mods.
