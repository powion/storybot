So this happened just today. 
I work at a Dominos pizza, and right across the street is this Dairy queen, and I've been trading pizza for dairy queen stuff with this really cute black haired girl for a bit. I built up the courage and asked for her number and we've been texting and talking to each other for about a week. today she asked if I could bring her pizza to her new place, so I jumped to the conclusion that, that was her saying "hey come over." Later after I clocked out, bought a pizza, and got one of my delivery drivers to drive me to her place (I don't drive and her place was on his way). She took the pizza saying "thanks" I stood there thinking she was going to let me in, we talked a bit and I immediately knew she wasn't down. She asked "how did you get here?" I said "one of my drivers drove me" she said "oh did he leave?" "Yea..." "oh really! oops, can you call him back?" So I called my driver back after he was done delivery and went into the front foyer of the house and waited, and seen this dude up stairs, I knew what was up and I just waited like 1 minute and left when my driver got outside.  he said "what happened?" 
"I guess she wanted the P instead of the D." I got a ride home afterwards.

EDIT: wtf front page, and gold.
