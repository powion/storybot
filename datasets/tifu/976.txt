I've been working as a host at a fine dining restaurant which opened up just a few months ago.  One of the things we've been instructed to do is use last names as much as possible while interacting with guests.  So this guy, probably around 45-50 years old walks up to me with his wife.  He asks me to make him a reservation for their anniversary in a couple of weeks.  I ask him for his last name, which I then type into the computer we do the reservations on.  This computer also happens to store information on the guests and their previous visits to our restaurant.  He had visited before and we had two names under the reservation- a man and a woman.  Let's go ahead and say that the two names were Robert and Sarah.  Excitedly thinking to myself "I can really surprise the guests and impress them by using their first names!" I look up and ask "Oh, Robert and Sarah?"

The look on the woman's face was like nothing I have ever seen.  She is not Sarah, but she certainly knew exactly who Sarah is.  "I thought that was over 4 years ago" was the only thing she said to him.  Keep in mind, the restaurant had only been open for 6 or so months at the time. She then took off her ring, put it on the counter in front of me, told me to "give it to a nice girl someday" and then left.

The man looked like he was about to jump over the counter and strangle me.  I managed to spit out a half assed "Sorry" but the damage was done.  He gave me a look, grabbed the ring and then took off after her. So there's how I ended a marriage by attempting to be fancy.  Lesson learned.
