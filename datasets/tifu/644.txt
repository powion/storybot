So my girlfriend and I were talking about her upcoming holiday to Japan when she mentions that she's lost a lot of weight from walking a lot at her new job. GF: " I'm going to be so thin for my trip!" And now I, knowing she loves Japanese food decide to take a jab at that and go to say, "And when you get back you're gonna be so fat from all the food you've eaten." But instead what comes out of my mouth is, "When you get back you'll be fat again." It took her a second to process what I just said (as did I) and we just fell silent from shock. She then says, "You always thought I was fat?"

No I never did, damnit brain.

Edit: Of course my highest voted post ever is about me accidentally calling my gf fat. Good work Rob.
