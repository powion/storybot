Recently my wife and I got two kittens, Harvi and Moxxie. They have been rambunctious little twerps, and they love to run around climbing on things. Their new favorite thing is climbing up our pant legs and fighting on our laps.

Tonight was the breaking point. I couldn't take the kittens constantly clawing their way up and down while I was at the computer, so I finally declared "That's it! You can't climb up my pant leg if I'm not wearing pants!" With a flourish, I whipped off my pants and sat back down.

It was a glorious five minutes before Moxxie leapt into the air, sunk her sharp, little kitty claws into my skin, and then stopped to contemplate climbing up the rest of the way.

Distracted by the devil attached to my leg, I failed to notice Harvi running toward me in an attempt to get to Moxxie. As the poorer climber, Harvi has always gone for the easiest route. She went for the only cloth she saw... and promptly sunk her claws through my boxer briefs and into my scrotum.

My wife claims to be in as much pain as I am, due to laughing so hard.

TL;DR - My kitten's claws have touched my balls more recently than my wife.



EDIT: Apparently the picture is titled "As a lonely college student living alone, I decided to adopt some roommates". It appears that someone has taken my image and published it as their own roughly 30 minutes before this edit.

EDIT 2.0: I have added new pictures of the kittens, one including my wife. You may now rescind your claims of "bullshit" if you would like.
