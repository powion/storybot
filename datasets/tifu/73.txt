Obligatory, this happened two days ago.

I work at an art gallery, and sometimes move around very expensive art pieces. Well, last week I had a terrible ear infection that gave me vertigo. I called in sick, but my boss told me I had to come in. After taking a tremendous amount of medicine, I felt alright, as long as I didn't stand, move, or breathe slightly.

My boss asked me to move a piece of art work, and I obliged because I'm an idiot. Not only did I have to move the artwork, but I had to put it up high on the wall because of the way we place our art. I had to get on a ladder and everything was fine until I started to get dizzy and dropped the canvas. The framing popped open, the glass shattered, and the canvas had a tear in it. 

I was near tears and my boss runs in and starts freaking out. Although I work in a gallery, I had no idea what was and wasn't expensive. This particular piece is worth $300k, and the artist, who is very well known, was loaning it to us.

I haven't been to work since and my boss let me go home early that day. I wish she would have just let me take the day off.

TL;DR Boss forced me to go to work, I damage $300k worth of paint.

EDIT: I haven't been to work since because I only work Monday-Wednesday. This happened on Wednesday. I haven't talked to anyone from the gallery since. 

Update: I decided to call my boss and she said she's setting up a meeting with the curator of the gallery and I should expect a reply on Monday if I still have my job. Might need to change this to TIFU by getting fired. 

Update Part 2: My co-worker just texted me and told me that the curator just got out of a meeting with the Board of Directors and they walked out of the meeting laughing. I might be safe. Maybe.

Update Part 3: I just got out of a meeting with the curator. He told me to let him know if I'm ever am sick and can't make it to work. I asked what happened to Linda (my boss). He said to wait for the employee meeting at noon to find out. RIP Linda.
