I just started working nights at this hospital and had enjoyed it so far. I was on my break this morning and printed off an application for my local volunteer rescue squad. When I came back to my computer a notepad file opened up that basically said all my data was now encrypted and I would have to pay to get it back. (Rasomware, it's been on the news)

So, I email the IT guy thinking this is no big deal and that shit like this happens all the time. NOPE. Apparently I awoke some super mutant virus that deleted all of my departments folders and fucked everything up. 

Now I have administrative people blowing up my cell phone, my boss is "unsure" if I'll keep my job, and my co workers have started a rumor that I watch porn at work.


TL;DR Anyone hiring?

Edit: They managed to contain the issue and I haven't been shit canned yet. Lesson learned though!


Edit edit: thanks for all the replies! I feel like less or a moron because of you guys.
