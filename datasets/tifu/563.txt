Happened just this morning.

While brushing our teeth, I left the water running which I usually don't.  My son says to me, "We need to conserve water, you should turn that off."  

It was so unexpected, especially coming from my little dude, that I reacted without thinking and asked, "What are those godless liberals teaching you at school?"

Of course kids pick up new, interesting phrases and he started parroting it back to me all morning and all the way to his daycare/preschool.  "Apple juice is godless liberals, I don't want it." "Mommy, is that tree a godless liberal?"  "Mommy, traffic is godless liberal."  "Godless liberals are making the air stink." (As we're passing the local paper mill.)  

I really, really tried to discourage him saying it but damn, it was funny and I laughed just a little too much.

I didn't notice all last week but they're doing a "Conservation" theme at school this month and he noticed me noticing all the eco swag on the walls when we walked in.  So, of course the first thing he says when we greet his teacher is, "Conserving water is godless liberals."   Ffffffffffffff!

Now everyone thinks I'm a raging fundie Republican.  I mean, there are worse things to be in South Carolina but damn.

TL;DR OMFG, just read it you lazy godless liberal.

Edit : (removed, personal information) Dude deleted it anyways.

Edit! Part Deux : First, thanks for the gold!  There goes my cherry.  Second, holy shit.  SJW's are out in force.  I'm a godless liberal living in the seat of religious political conservatism.  You gotta laugh to keep from crying sometimes.  Calm down.
