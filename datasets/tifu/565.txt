I met a girl a few weeks ago and we've been on one date so far, just casual coffee/chit-chat. Today was our second date, I invited her to my place and I was going to prepare dinner for us both and watch a movie.

She told me before we met that she's incredibly allergic to peanuts. No biggie. I'm not too fussy for peanuts but sometimes I cook with them. I buy some peanuts, roast them, grind them up a bit, and put in a peppermill for when I feel a meal could use with a bit more savory saltiness. I use them maybe once a month. A buddy of mine is also allergic to peanuts, so I do wash my things thoroughly so as to not have lingering peanuttiness for when he visits.

So I make a beautiful dinner: pork roast rolled with prosciutto and olive oil, with some vegetables and beans, and a little bit of gnocchi. I made a nice sauce to go with it. To note I didn't add any peanuts. I ask her to set the table: she grabs forks, knives, spoons, wine glasses, salt shaker and peppermill.

You can probably see where this is going, but the tl;dr is she grabbed the wrong peppermill (she didn't grab the one sitting beside the salt shaker, but instead went into a cupboard to get my peanutmill). Sprinkled some on her food, took a bite, and immediately had a violent reaction. She seized up, couldn't talk, was burning up, the whole nine yards for "oh fuck what do I do?".

I went into her purse (my father always told me to never go into a woman's purse for any reason, but I felt this was an emergency) to look for an Epipen. Thankfully she had one. I've got no idea how to use this thing: I know you jab it in your thigh or butt, but is it over clothes? Under clothes? Reading instructions be damned, I had to take her pants off. Undid her belt, slid down her jeans, and unfortunately her underwear slid off when the pants came down. I get a good look at the sight but there was no time for that, into her thigh the Epipen went. She calms down a bit and 911 is called since I honestly don't know what else to do. She hurriedly struggles to put her pants on and begins to cry, and she sits in silence, shaking, for the ambulance.

I feel real bad and haven't moved from my couch since. This happened just under two hours ago and haven't called her (or received a call back). I'm sure she's okay, but I don't think this is how our second (maybe final?) date should have gone.

**tl;dr: peanut-allergic date accidentally sprinkles peanut dust on the meal I made. Had a reaction. Took off her clothes to use an EpiPen not knowing if it could be used over clothes or not.**

*Update 1*: I gave her a call and her mother picked up. I explained what happened and she said her daughter was fine. She's resting right now and said she'll have her give me a call tomorrow. She completely understands and says she isn't upset, just awkward the date turned out like that.

*Update 2*: She stopped by about fifteen minutes ago (completely unannounced) and wanted to apologize to me for how she reacted. I don't know why she's apologizing: she didn't do anything wrong, but she gave me a hug and said we can continue the date another day, but asked me why I had peanuts in a peppermill.

*Update 2.5*: To those asking why I have a "peanutmill", it's just for ease of use. If a recipe calls for a dash of peanut dust or something, I'm not going to take out my mortar and pestle, take out a peanut or two, grind it up, then put in the meal, every time I need 'em. I put them in a food processor so they're small enough to fit in a peppermill, put it in the mill, then whenever I need it, it's handy. I'm sure lots of people put things other than pepper in a peppermill for a similar reason. I keep my "peanutmill" in the cupboard and the peppermill and salt shaker on my countertop. I wouldn't have assumed she'd have to look for the peppermill and stumble upon the peanuts, else I'd have hidden them a bit more.

*Update 2.75*: Here's a way I'd use a peanutmill:

- chicken breast (150g maybe?), filleted so it's thin
- knead peanut dust into the meat, add salt and pepper
- wrap in prosciutto, keep a small skewer or something on the top side to keep it bound if it doesn't readily stay put
- fry in 2tbsp olive oil on medium heat with half a crushed clove of garlic
- I'm not good at gauging doneness, so I usually go 4-5 minutes, flipping two or three times and then cut a piece off to check inside
- set the wrapped breast aside to rest
- add a knob of butter to the remaining olive oil, 1 or 2 crushed blueberries, a small squirt of tomato puree. Deglaze with red wine (only a little bit)
- reduce, add corn starch + water for desired thickness
- apply to chicken breast

And peanut dust also goes well with sautee'd vegetables, mushrooms, or just on top of food. Most of the ways I use it is kneading into meat or on top of things. It's wonderful on salmon.

*Update 3*: She's inviting me to her house tonight (she lives with parents) so they can see the goof who almost killed their daughter. None of them are upset, they think it's hilarious. Then we're going to go see a movie.

*Final Update*: Her family is real cool, and completely understanding. They like me and I like them. We canceled our movie date and I'm spending the night here. I think I'm in lads.
