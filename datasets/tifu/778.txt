So, my co-worker's butt is broken. She fell and broke her tailbone and has more or less been in excruciating pain since, so when it's starbucks hour I usually volunteer to go get a latte for her.

Naturally, I usually draw a butt on it with a heart, or a bandaid. (I swear this is normal in our office. We're designers, or something. Mostly just a HR nightmare come to life.) So today my other co-worker and I go into the starbucks and both broke-butt's and mine come out at the same time, decaf and regular lattes.

As per usual, I ask for a marker, and draw a butt, this one has a thumbs up sticking out of the pelvis.

Then another decaf latte comes out, and I pause. A woman with a bad case of RBF is hovering and asking where her decaf caramel macchiato is just over my right shoulder. I freeze and look down, sweat beads down my face as I examine the little order strip. The butt cup is tagged with CM instead of L for latte. Oops.

I turned the butt towards me and nervously presented her with her caramel macchiato. She took it, looked at it, her nose wrinkled as she looked to the barista, "I don't want one with a butt on it."

I look to the barista with a horrified *I'm so sorry, oh my god I goofed* face. He calmly offers up an additional cup to nestle it into. She reluctantly accepts this censor sheaf, and without looking at me turns her nose up to walk off as I ask for the marker again.

She might have covered it, but she'll know. She'll know she sipped that sweet caramel macchiato out of that butt cup.
