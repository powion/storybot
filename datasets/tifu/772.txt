Today I had to make my way to my company's main office. As I got there for an unrelated matter, the HR lady hands me my paycheck and says:

 "We made sure to include your bonus here."

"What bonus?"

"The extra $20,000 addition to your salary."

"I'm not too sure what you're talking about but okay."

"Hang on"

She goes to speak with her boss and comes back and said she made a mistake and needs to change it.

And that's how I gave up the biggest raise I've ever gotten!
