Last Christmas, I bought myself a dildo (for educational purposes only.) This dildo has a suction cup for sticking on walls and such. I stuck this dildo to my horsehair plaster wall about 15 minutes ago and tried pulling it off. There was quite a lot of resistance from the dildo and then the dildo finally came off, taking some of the wall with it. I need to get plaster before anyone in my family find out about my wall and the dildo.
