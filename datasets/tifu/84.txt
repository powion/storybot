So today I went to the store to get some oranges as I'm trying to eat healthier and needed some fruit in my life. On my way out I notice a homeless man sitting by the wall and thought I'd be generous and throw him an orange, so with a weak underarm throw the orange goes flying through the air and hits him square in the face, I quickly find out he's blind after a lot of apologizing and offer to peel the orange for him.

TL;DR Threw an orange at a blind, homeless dude, you can guess the rest

Edit: threw to through, I suck at spelling

Edit2: time to do the HOLY SHIT THIS BLEW UP and RIP my inbox

Edit3: and I made my username for the Gangplank rework because I am unoriginal, it's just a coincidence that it matched the story
