Definitely NSFW but it's exactly as the title says...

i was so tired and it'd been a huge day and the bf had been giving off signals all day (which i gracefully ignored because we were busy or others were around) but he'd gone and done a heap of nice things for me throughout the week, so when he started giving signals i thought i'd just give him head, he'd enjoy it, it wouldn't take long and hopefully i'd be asleep in 10 minutes... turns out all of that was true... except i was asleep in about 2... and he wasn't finished...

I woke up the next morning sleeping alone.. and i didn't remember falling asleep during it... but i definitely didn't remember finishing it.

Bf apparently felt so weird about the fact he had to take his sleeping gf off his dick and tuck her into bed that he went and slept on the lounge... I don't offer sleepy sexual favors anymore, and he doesn't ask for them after a certain time...

TLDR: I'm a shit gf
