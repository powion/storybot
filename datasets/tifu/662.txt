When I was 15, (not today but whatevs) whilst I was home alone I discovered masturbating.

For a prudish shy teenage girl, I was totally addicted, but unfortunately lived in a house with 4 siblings and paper thin walls. Online it recommended using the bath tap or shower head.

So, I ran a bath, added a few capfuls of olive oil bc soft skin or whatever, and lowered myself in.

Now I have advice for anybody masturbating with a bath tap for the first time.

1. Don't fucking put the tap on full blast.
 I swear to God I came straight away, to the extent where my stomach was pulsing and I couldn't see. I hit my leg off the tap where it was burning hot, I don't know even what kind of noises I was making. Thought it was a fit smh

2. Don't put oil in the fucking bath.
After I was done, I stood up and had no idea about the jelly legs. This combined with the already slippery bath meant I fell, hit my stomach off the bath, winded myself and my head on the ground. I remember lying there for a couple of minutes, just looking at the floor. I genuinely thought my family was going to find me dead, naked, and oily.

3. Make sure your parents aren't in the bedroom beside the bathroom.
To this day I have no idea if they heard me, I can't remember if I made any noises, although I'm pretty certain I did. All I know is I left the bathroom redfaced and winded.

TL;DR: Masturbated with the water jet for the first time, was punished by Jesus for sinning.

edit: holy shit so many creeps. yes i put olive oil in the bath makes u so silky smooth try it. thank u, this is my first post n shit blew up!!
