I travel quite a bit, am always moving from hotel to hotel and am at some point of recovery from jetlag.

Flying into the States, I checked into my hotel and crashed out almost straight away.  

Waking during the night for a bathroom visit, I had an adrenaline explosion as I realised there was a fat naked guy in the room with me, and he was moving my way.

In my sleep befuddled state, I reacted by instinct more than thought, and threw a huge roundhouse punch at him.

Result:  A $380 bill for a shattered hotel mirror and a badly cut hand.
