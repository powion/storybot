This happened late yesterday afternoon, and I'm still trying to deal with the aftermath!

Since Sept of 2013, I've lost about 30 pounds, which has been really great, but it came back to bite me yesterday. It bit HARD.

After my wife was done with work yesterday afternoon, she thought it would be a good idea for our two boys to play in the 6 or 7 inches of snow that had fallen overnight. So we bundled up the kiddos, grabbed the saucer and went out in our backyard to slide down the little hill. Since the kids are 1 and 3, this little grade is perfect for them to sled down.

Being dad, I had to take a few runs myself, just to see what it was like. It was good, but it could be bit longer, so I decided to go down a different way and make a new path.

I ran. I jumped on the saucer. I went down the hill and fell off, getting powder all over me, in my boots, up my pants, and in my gloves. Quickly I pulled my glove off of my left hand and shook the snow off. That's when I felt it go. It felt like eternity, but there was nothing I could do in that split second. 

My white gold wedding band went flying off my finger and landed somewhere in the snow.

After losing the weight, my ring has been really loose, loose enough to come off while shaking my hand!

I have no idea where it is. My attempts at raking the snow were futile last night. My finger feels weird without it, and my wife thinks I'm a complete nimrod.

YIFU.

TL;DR: lost weight, went sledding. Got snow in my gloves and flung my loose wedding band into 6 or 7 inches of fresh powdered snow.
