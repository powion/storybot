Someone in another thread said you can stop a mosquito bite from itching by putting boiling water on it since it denatures proteins or something, so I tried it on a mosquito bite on my knuckle.

Now my knuckle has a burn on it and still itches, but also hurts when I scratch it.

Thanks reddit.

**EDIT:** Okay, now to make up for being such jerks go post something nice everyone can do over on [/r/multitudeofdrops](http://www.reddit.com/r/multitudeofdrops/) to balance it out.
