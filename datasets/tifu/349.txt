I bought the Citi Kitty toilet training system about two months ago. If you've never heard of it, it's a shallow plastic litter box that fits between the rim and seat of the toilet. It has inserts that can be removed to make a hole in the litter box. Over the course of a few months, you gradually take out all the inserts until your cat is doing his business in the toilet. 

The first week went flawlessly. Cat transitioned from his regular little box to the Citi Kitty with no problems. I decided it was time to remove the first insert. This is when I began smelling strange things in my bedroom. I soon discovered that instead of pooping in the Citi Kitty training box, my cat had been sneaking into my closet and pinching off his kitty loafs into various sneakers and boots. I thought to myself, "Okay, he's just transitioning. He'll learn." 

With the use of ample cat nip and praise, Cat began doing his business in the Citi Kitty training box. Victory! After a few weeks, I removed a second insert. The removal of that one insert shattered my cat's world and sent him on a downward spiral into a psychological kitty breakdown. He began to believe that everything white and porcelain was his toilet. One evening, I discovered him hunched in the bathtub, doing his best to hide behind the shower curtain. The final straw was when I went into the bathroom, looking forward to washing my face and brushing my teeth after a long day, only to discover a steaming pile of brown shame in my bathroom sink.

That was it. I couldn't take it anymore. I put the insert back in and postponed training for a month. During that month, Cat got used to doing his kitty business in the Citi Kitty litter box. All the inserts were back in, so there was no hole for him to see the toilet water below. I figured, eh why not, might as well give it another go. I removed the insert. It was a terrible mistake.

This morning, I woke up to the sound of my cat howling and moaning in pain. I rushed out of the bedroom and the smell of cat poop hit me like a brick. I searched high and low for the source of the smell. Finally... I found it. My fucking cat took a shit on my cactus. 

So, purchase the Shitty Kitty toilet training system if you enjoy cleaning poop out of your shoes, the tub, and the bathroom sink, and if you would get a kick out of seeing your cat puncture his butthole while trying to relieve himself on a cactus.

THANKS FOR THE GOLD! Totally makes the scratches, poop under the fingernails, and chance of contracting E.coli worth it.
