This is a dual fuck up as it is equally my husband and I's fault. We have a 110lb mastiff pitbull mix that chews, destroys and eats all toys we've ever brought home within a matter of hours. After many months of going through one or two $10+ toys a week, we were feeling pretty discouraged. A friend recommended that we try ordering from a site online that brags about having indestructible dog toys. So we order a bone shaped toy for him made out of some hard nylon material.


The toy has been here for over three weeks now and it still looks like brand new. He loves it, we love it, it's great. From the second we got it we started calling it a "boner" instead of a bone because that's funnier. "Go play with your boner, pup!" "I'm gonna get your boner!" "That's a nice boner you got there!" type of thing. 


Well, today my three year old daughter went to a little arts and crafts party at a local crafts store and she was telling everyone how Daddy plays with the dog's boner and how much fun it is to watch Daddy play boners. I was mortified the entire hour long class and had some explaining to do. My husband and I have decided to make an effort to call it something else.


EDIT: Here's a picture of my dog with his boner: http://imgur.com/ewK62Xc
