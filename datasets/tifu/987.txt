Social media nightmare. 

My girlfriend and I have a morning routine on the weekends where we drink coffee in bed naked. We call it 'naked coffee.' 

She's out of town, so I decided to send her a Snapchat. I took a picture of me, naked, spread out on my bed with a mug of coffee in my hand. I put 'Naked Coffee' in the caption and sent it promptly at 9am. 

I went about the rest of my day, went to the gym then did a few errands. At 4:30pm I received this message from a good friend of mine: 

"Hey ...! Wasn't sure if you meant to do this or not but there's a naked picture on your snapchat 'my story' which is visible to the public. you can delete it by holding down on your username and I think it will point you in the right direction to delete it."

I was feeling beyond embarrassed at this point. I quickly deleted the photo, then sent an update on FaceBook. I called it my "leaked photo debut on Snapchat." I texted my girlfriend about it and she thought it was hysterical. Best part about this whole mess is that she commented on the update and said, "I liked it."

TL;DR: I sent my girlfriend a naked photo of myself on Snapchat. I stupidly posted it to my story on accident and it was live for well over 4 hours, until I was notified by my friend. 

**EDIT:** I understand a few of you asked to see the picture for proof. I know you are disappointed but it has been deleted. I'm not about to debase myself any further. It really happened. 

**EDIT II:** Regarding it being on accident, I'm being honest. I use Android. I just tapped the arrow on the bottom to send it. When I figured out how to adjust the Snapchat settings after the fact, I saw that all posts were sent to My Story (the default option). It was pointed out you can specify who your stories are sent to; it's the custom option  but I didn't configure it until it was too late!
