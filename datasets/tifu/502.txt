Yeah, it's pretty much a "half of my life" fuck up.

I do all the cooking at home, and I love it.  But I'd always been frustrated that whenever I made rice, it always came out in sticky clumps, never the lovely fluffy clouds that I wanted.

Why?  I never rinsed the rice grains beforehand.

Just last weekend I finally did this and voila: a bowl of fluffy delicious rice that doesn't have the texture of freshly mixed epoxy.

Yep, I've been making shitty rice for almost four (edit: three) decades until I finally realized that I should probably follow the directions.  5 extra minutes of extremely easy prep, and I was too fucking lazy to bother.

Damn, I'm dumb!  And stubborn!  And lazy!

Better late than never, I guess.

Edit 1:  I should have clarified that I usually on buy Basmati or Jasmine rice from Trader Joe's.  Don't know how much of a difference rinsing would make with other kinds.  BTW, it should be about thirty years.  Yeah, I can't tell time either!  I'll be forty six in July.

Edit 2: HOLY CRAP.  Front page!  What a great feeling to know that such horrendous apathy unabated for decades could reap such ephemeral rewards.  I feel like Patrick Star!
