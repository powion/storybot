I was cleaning my 6y.o. son's room, and doing my annual purge of crap he's managed to hoard. I have this big pile of stuff to throw out in the living room, when he comes in, pulls some stupid paper butterfly out of the trash pile and tells me I can't throw this away because it was a present.

He goes to a lot of birthday parties and gets a lot of goodie bags with this sort of thing, so I tell him it's junk and it's going in the trash. Besides, it's all bent up and I tell him (like a douche-dad) that if he values things he should take care of them.

He leaves, and some 5 minutes later he returns, visibly distraught (he's clearly been thinking hard about this). He says "It was a present...for you."

"For father's day."

I swear at that moment I heard every angel in heaven slow clapping.

EDIT: Whoa, go to sleep, then to work, then come back to a crap-ton of comments. Deserving of some additional context.

As some hawk-eyed redditors astutely noted, it's nowhere near Father's Day so the "T" in this TIFU is symbolic. This allows me to provide some more details. First, my son is 10 now, I was reminded yesterday of the incident which of course put the pit back in the bottom of my stomach again. I thought about adding the "obligatory this wasn't today" disclaimer but after reading the sub rules I was convinced not to.

Following the "No, it's a present for *you*" revelation, I apologized, then we smoothed out the creases in the butterfly and my son took it back into his room. He ended up wrapping it up for me on Father's Day anyhow, and he was so excited to see me open the present even though I had figuratively shat all over it. It was really sweet.
