BACKGROUND: This happened two hours ago and I'm still embarrassed.  For those of you who don't know, Michael's is a craft store with EVERYTHING.  I'm an 18 year old girl in college and I happen to have a boyfriend.  Parents like said boyfriend, blah blah blah.  

Now onto the story...
My mom was excited because Michael's was having a 70% off Christmas sale and a lot of other things were marked down too.  I live in a dorm room so I went to check out baskets (oh sweet storage space).  After examining several that were cute but still out of my price range, I found a grey wicker basket with a white canvas lining.  It fit perfectly with my color scheme and I was psyched to see the price, after the discount, was $7.  I touched it and said "I like this one" and then turned to my mom to ask if I could get it.  
Her jaw had gone slack and tears welled up in her eyes.  "But you're so young," she said.  Confused, I looked at the basket and realised the front had "Baby Things" embroidered in French script.  For some reason, I thought the response, "Oh no, I'm not pregnant yet," was the perfect response.  My dad, an aisle over, said "What the fuck" and everyone immediately looked in our vicinity.  
After a few moments of mortal terror, I convinced my parents that, no, I was not pregnant and yes, I was telling the truth.  After my mom calmed down, we immediately checked out and left.  In the car they asked if I was using condoms.  Good times.  And I didn't even get a basket.

TL;DR fucked up by making my mom cry in a crafts store by telling her I was pregnant but not really

EDIT: fixed a typo

EDIT2: thanks for the gold! :D
