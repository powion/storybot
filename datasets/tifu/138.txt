After she had hinted for about a week that it would be a turn on if I urinated on her. She said she hadn't done it before, it would be a first for both of us. A couple of nights ago, I finally did it in the shower on her leg, but she quickly dropped to catch it on her face. Surprised, my stream stuttered, but once you start, it's hard to stop so I resumed urinating on her awkwardly. Lo and behold she had to bang right then and there so we did and it was awesome. 

Later, when we were having dinner, she casually mentions that it's weird how my pee tasted a bit sweet so I jokingly ask her how she knows what it's meant to taste like. She didn't answer so I left it. 

While cleaning up, she breaks down and tells me that she'd had several exes do it before. This was the last lie in a series that ended the relationship. So far not too bad right?

At lunch today, I was regaling a buddy with the story of how I ended things with the urine-faced pisswhore, and ended it with "Hey, at least she thought my piss was sweet haha." 

Buddy is a med student and immediately took me to a clinic.. 

TIL I have diabetes.

Edit 2: Honest question how does feminism slutshaming etc some into this? 

She deceived me into doing something I was/am/DEFINITELY WILL BE FROM NOW ON super uncomfortable with, saying we could share a "first time" together. I wanted to make this work, since I forgave her for such massive things in the past and now I'm a dick for ending shit with her because she asked her ex pissed in her mouth while we we were together? I was trying to understand everyone's reactions, but honestly some of you can just go fuck yourselves.

Edit 3: The humorous "OP who is this girl?" replies aside, can people stop asking, "Is the girl's name _____?" I'm pissed at her for the toxic relationship, but I'm not going to leak that kind of info. (hurhur but seriously stop)

Edit for responses: 
To the silver lining people (I like you people): I am actually glad that I know about it now, and at this stage, I guess it's better than going undiagnosed. Thanks for the encouragement and information. 

To the kink defenders (I get your reaction): I have to explicitly state here that it had very little to do with her hiding that she has a kink, but rather who with and when. More on this in the following response.

To the series-of-lies enquirers (Your curiosity is justified): If you believe that her hiding her kink was the only reason I broke up with her, then I agree it's petty. But no. When we first started, she hid from me that she was still sleeping with her ex. To this day I am unsure if they broke up before or after we began, but I am sure that after we "went official" she slept with her ex again when I was overseas and she.. got kinky then. Fun fact 1: I found out from his friend that they banged, who was surprised she and I "got back together". Fun fact 2: She asked her ex to piss on her face when I was overseas for work. 

To the judgmental insulters (Suck my sweet dick): See parentheses.
