So today, I was playing some Pokemon Y looking for a female Combee to evolve. Great. After killing a few Ralts that I spent an hour the day before to find, I still didn't find a female Combee. Then I found a shiny. The first shiny I've ever seen. Me, being a huge nerd, I decided to take a picture of it *before* I caught it. I grabbed my phone and tried to hold it close. Then I accidentally bumped into the touch screen. Shit. The next thing I knew was that the touch screen turned blurry and the only words I saw was "You got away safely!"


EDIT: Thanks for the gold! It's just as shiny. :)
