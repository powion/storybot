Context: My mom and I need to clean house desperately, so we're doing a deep clean and possession filter this week.  Stuff we want we keep, stuff we don't we trash or give to Goodwill, etc.

So I'm going through my room, sorting things into piles of keep and donate.  On my desk I notice a pillowcase.  *Huh, I didn't put that there... I wonder what's inside?*  I look inside to see if I need to sort this.  Inside there's a cleaning rag, a couple of pens... and a dildo.  This is a BIG one too, like a foot long and about the width of a lacrosse ball.

I have no idea what to say or do at this point.  Conveniently, my mom chooses this exact moment to walk in and check on my progress.  She sees me holding the bag and her eyes instantly bug out.  We stare at each other for a good ten seconds.  It's awkward.  I hold out the pillowcase and say, "I think this is yours."  All she can do is look back at me, take it, and say "Thanks."

TL;DR- Found my mom's dildo while cleaning, palpable tension as I give it back, shudders 4 dayz

EDIT: Holy crap I didn't expect this to be this big. Thanks y'all for making it this big! Not sure if front page yet, but still.

EDIT 2: Hello /r/all. Goodbye inbox. 

EDIT 3: I finally figured out why there were so many comments involving broken arms. Ew.

EDIT 4: Aw, gold? Thanks! Now I can tell my friends that my first gold and big post came from a dildo.

But seriously, thanks to the redditor who gilded me!
