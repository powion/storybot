2 nights prior to a scheduled doc's appointment I had drawn a face on the top of my penis. I had used a black magic marker. 

When I am bored and drunk on vodka/cran-tangerine, sometimes I draw a face on my penis and then enact a sort of puppet show for myself. I just move it around and do a weird voice or whatever. Or I use it to talk to myself. 

Anyways I somehow forgot that I had drawn this face on my penis and I didn't realize it until the moment right before the doctor told me to remove my pants. 

I was thinking "Oh...shit. I drew a face on my penis." 

I asked the Doc if it was really necessary to examine my penis. He gave me an odd look. I felt compelled, in my idiocy, to just drop my pants. 

I have never been so shamed or humiliated in all of my life.

The Doc just said "Um...." but I guess his professional decorum or whatever prevented him from further comment. The rest of the visit was extremely awkward.

I will never visit this doctor again. NEVER. 

I will always wash my penis from now on the morning after I have drawn on it. Not washing the face off of the penis can lead to so many potential risks. I almost had a panic attack realizing this. Like, what if I was in a car accident? And they had to remove my pants or whatever? And all the emergency crew and doctor's would be seeing a face on penis? Oh my god. 

It's so awful. 

Oh god. What does this doctor think of me???

Shit!!!!!

Well that's how I fucked up.
