This happened years ago when I was in college, and still haunts me to this day.

I had been casually dating a girl for a few months, not being careful enough, and she became pregnant. She decided she was going to keep the baby. We were both terrified because we were still in college, not committed, and not at all ready for that.

A few days after taking multiple pregnancy tests, we were having sex and something just didn't feel right. The texture was different, kind of like anal, but...sticky, and chunky. I pulled out and looked down and saw this bloody substance all over my junk, my stomach, and the bed.

Neither of us had any idea what it was, and didn't think much of it, assuming it was period remnants or something. 

A few days later she went to the doctor to get a checkup on the pregnancy. When she came back and told me the news, it was then that I realized that the substance covering my body, and her sheets, was my miscarried child.
