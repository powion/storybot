Was at a club last night and thought the mirror was a passage way into a new room, went to go through it and saw someone coming towards me. Tried to move out of the way and he moved the same way as me. Then i looked up and apologised, saw his glass was moving towards mine and proceeded to cheers him, at this point realising it was my reflection....

Edit: Wow, thanks. My first post and made it to the front page :D For those asking it was in Nottingham
