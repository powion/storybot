It's improtant to tell you guys I'm jewish...
So my gf was taking a shower and I had to pee, so I went into the bathroom and told her that I'm coming in... I started peeing and after a few seconds she said "when you're done you can come to into the shower with me if you want", and while usually I'd say yes and hop in, I felt extra funny that moment, so I replied with "Sorry dear, my grandpa already fell for that trick"...
I really thought she'd like the joke... But she didn't...
