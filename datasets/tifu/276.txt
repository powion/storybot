8 days ago my girlfriend gave birth to our daughter. She had a mild infection so stayed in the special care baby unit for a few days. My girlfriend came home 3 days after the birth but we've been going back to the hospital to see our daughter every day since. Today our daughter was discharged from hospital so we went to pick her up. My girlfriend went to sign some papers in another room.

I was super anxious and if I'm honest I was not thinking straight. I ended up walking into the wrong hospital room, the one next to where my daughter was. I was a complete and utter idiot. Both hospital rooms looked exactly the same and this other baby was wearing a white babygrow and a yellow hat, just like my daughter. My daughter had a wristband, this baby didn't but I didn't realise it until later. I put the baby into the car seat and went to reception where my girlfriend was meeting me. While I was waiting, my mum showed up with some stuff for my daughter. She asked to hold the baby and I said yes. She picked her up and said "Mike..." I could tell by the time of her voice that something wasn't right so I started freaking out. She said the baby looked different but I insisted it was because the last time she saw her she was in an incubator.

We continued to wait and my girlfriend arrived. My girlfriend looked at the baby and her face turned white. She said that it was not her baby. We rushed over to the desk and a nurse came with us to the ward to see what had happened. There was another couple there freaking out because their baby had gone. I was forced to admit my mistake.

We picked up our daughter and headed home but now my girlfriend is being cold towards me and I feel like a crappy father for not recognising my own daughters face. Wish me luck for the next 18 years.
