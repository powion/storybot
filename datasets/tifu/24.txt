So, not today, but in early 2010 I was in the hospital for a few weeks with really bad pneumonia, I didn't realize how bad it was until the day I was discharged when the doctor told me they basically thought I was going to die every day I was there.

On my first day in the ICU, I received an emergency chest tube. Due to the severity of the situation, there was no time to prep, no time to put me under, no time to apply anesthetics. This was the most painful and scary moment of my entire life but that is a whole long story of it's own.

During my hospital stay, I underwent surgery where they cut into my lung to scrape all the fluid out ([called a thoracotomy: warning, gross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracotomy)) and was given 2 new chest tubes. Miraculously, I was discharged a week later with about 40-50 staples in my back and some **very** strong pain meds to be refilled every two weeks.

Two weeks later (just after getting a fresh bottle of pain meds), I went in for a check up with the doctor. He wanted me to pee in a cup so they could see if the medicine was having any effect on my liver. I peed in the cup and all was well.

Are you ready for the fuck up?

I woke up. 

The entire doctor's visit was a very vivid dream. What happened IRL was I got up in the middle of the night, opened my full bottle of pills, and peed in it. By the morning, it was just a sludge of pills that had dissolved into a chalky piss-sludge. I was devastated.

Because I had been given such a strong dose of a highly controlled pill, they could not give me another prescription, so I was stuck in horrible pain (while trying to catch up with my courses) until I could order my scheduled refill.

EDIT: forgot a ")'

EDIT 2 for those of you complaining there is no TL;DR: **TL;DR: Peed, shouldn't have**
