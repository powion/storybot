My dad and my six-year-old sister often have playful "fights" about who my mom likes better. It's kinda stupid, but she's a kid so whatever. I was home for new years, and I hear my sister and dad at it again, jokingly making up silly ways why Mom likes either of them better.  It usually goes along these lines:

sister: Mom likes me better!
Dad: nuh-uh, she made me bacon for breakfast!
sister: Well she let me [insert activity fun for a kid]
Dad:Yeah well she let me [one ups my sister playfully]

Eventually they moved into the living room where I was sitting and I hear my sister say to my dad:

"Well, I'm so close with mom, I've been *inside* her [referring to being in her womb as a baby]" to which I stupidly interjected: "Yeah well so has Dad." She looked really confused, as if actually contemplating the idea that my mom had birthed my dad.

To clear that up and prevent further misunderstandings, today my six-year-old sister learned about sex.
