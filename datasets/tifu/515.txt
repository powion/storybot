So last night I was in bed waiting for my wife to finish her before bed rituals when my 8 year old daughter comes in for a good night hug and kiss. We get to talking and I use the line "girls rule and boys drool" cause she's at that age where the boys at school think otherwise. 
The part where I messed up was at that exact moment I catch the eye of my 4 year old son who was also in the room, and the look of pure defeat on his face was so depressing and his poor little soul crushed I thought maybe I scared him for life. In an attempt to bring back his manhood I had to tell him Girls go to Jupiter to get more stupider and boys go to mars to get more candy bars. He likes candy, so he probably won't be scarred for life.
