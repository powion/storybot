So for a nice day out, me and my girlfriend decided to go paintballing.

We get there, buy our paintballs and other extras ready for a day of ultimate pwnage.

Well, it's the first round and I get clocked in the shoulder in the first 10 seconds. Damn. I'm out.

So when we switch sides I decide to carefully consider my route to the objective. Should I go left (long) or right (short)? I chose left because I thought I'd be clever and go a longer route in order to be sneaky beaky like. I eye up a set of barrels as my first bit of cover.

The marshal shouts "3, 2, 1, game on!" and I rush to my barrels for cover like I'm fucking James Bond or some shit.

Unfortunately I slip before I get there, fall on my own leg and snap it in half at the ankle.

So, now I'm in a hospital bed bored out of my mind with a fucked up leg. The worst part? They've got Britain's Got Talent on the ward TV and I can't change it.

I'm the fat guy on the floor obviously.

For anyone complaining that this isn't a true TIFU, I will retroactively state that my footwear wasn't appropriate. So TIFU by running around a forest playing paintball wearing totally the wrong kind of footwear. gg no re
