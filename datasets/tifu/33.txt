Today I had a phone interview with Chevron for a chemist position. The interview began with usual pleasantries and they asked how I was. I'm from Boston, and as any of you Bostonians know the weather here is currently exceptional. So I responded "It's 70 and sunny in Boston in November, so I certainly can't complain." They chuckled at my line, so I went full steam ahead with the career-ruining followup:

"Haha, you guys at Chevron keep up the good work with this global warming!"

Silence on the other end for 5 solid seconds.

Needless to say I probably won't be getting a call back.
