A few weeks ago my friend and I were driving around listening to an 80's compilation CD. In the middle of the song "Africa" by Toto my friend changed to the next track. I exclaimed, "hey, go back to Africa" because I wanted to hear the rest of the song. This all happened at a stop light, windows down, while a black man was crossing in the crosswalk very close to my window. It was like slow motion as the syllable "ca" came out of my mouth, I saw him about 3 feet from window in my peripheral. He looked at me in utter disgust and continued through the crosswalk. As I stuck my head out of the window to try to quickly apologize/explain, the light turned green and we drove off.  If you're reading this and you're that man, I am so fucking sorry, it was Toto's fault.
