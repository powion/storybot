Literally happened today, and I ffffed up pretty awkwardly, Reddit.



Technically, it starts a week or so ago when I was moving shelves around at work. My colleague, "J" suggested moving an item a little bit more to the left, to which I explained that then it wouldn't line up with the items above and below it, concluding with "I guess I'm just being a bit anal."



Apparently [anal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_retentiveness) isn't a term that is used internationally (J is German, if that helps), so she was very taken aback by my slightly crude, Aussie slang. I quickly explained that "anal" (short for *anal retentive*) is used to describe people who pay annoying detail to small things (basically). 



She accepted the term, and we moved on.


Today, a customer was at the counter talking to their sales rep, with whom they have a close relationship (more like friends). They were joking and laughing around about how picky the customer was being, and she said "I know, I know... I'm just being anal!" 


J immediately lit up, recognising the new term she'd just learnt, and I quickly explained to the confused faces of our sales rep and the customer  **"Oh, I literally just taught J anal!"**




&gt; Oh, I mean... I explained the word... I didn't... Uhh, no, I didn't mean that... Anal retentive, you know? Ughhh....




I floundered like a fish out of water to take back my words, but the damage had been done. Everyone was in hysterics, and news of my fuck up had traveled around the office in minutes.



Now I'm known as the girl who "teaches anal". Reddit, I fucked up. 





Edit: Wow. This did quite well over night! 




1. No, OP does not teach *actual* anal. Sorry :c




2. Yes, the term "anal" is probably used internationally, 30-something German J had never heard it used in that situation before, though :)



**Edit #2) Most of the responses I've got on here have been quite humorous, so I thank all of you who have had something nice or comical to say.**




**To those of who posting comments like**




&gt;**Yawn**.



**Or,**



&gt;**I've basically seen this post before.**



**I would like to ask you to please consider the following:**




* **Are you paying to read this story?**



* **Am I being paid for the service of providing you with something to read?**




**I believe you will find the answer in both cases is "no". So unless you're going to give me some gold for this 'service', please get over it and move on. I wrote this to share the hilarity of an awkward situation, not to make ~~pretentious~~ unappreciative Redditors pleased.**





**To conclude, thank you to all the people supporting my "anal" lessons and potential career choices, you're all wonderful!**
