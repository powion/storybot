I work an office job and a coworker invited me to smoke a blunt with her after my shift. We'd never smoked before and it had been a long time coming. We both lightly flirt with each other sometimes but she has a boyfriend so I wasn't gonna try anything. I didn't have any weed on me but she did so I bought the blunt wrap at the gas station. After we smoke she offers to drive me to the subway so I can get home. Now I did not specify which subway I needed to be dropped off at (my high ass assumed she knew) so she automatically assumes the one closest to her house. I am so high that I'm so busy trying to make normal conversation that I don't even realize that I am getting dropped off fucking two miles outside of my usual commute. She stops the car and I stare at her for what felt like ten seconds thinking "why are we stopped?". 

After the long pause she says "uhm here we are" and I realize I'm outside of the wrong train but I was too high to tell her she dropped me off at the wrong train. I get out of the car and proceed to take about two hours to get home via public transportation. On top of that she probably thought I was gonna make a move on her when I was trying to compute for ten seconds why she was dropping off at the wrong train.

edit: when I say "we've never smoked before" I mean "we've never smoked before together"

Edit 2: we never left the area of my work. going back to her place was never in the question. for further context I was getting off work and she was smoking on her lunch. also not that this is relevant but she does not live with her boyfriend and I have met him before, pretty cool guy.

Edit 3: for the love of god people read the post i was never gonna make a move!!!

TL;DR: I got high with a coworker, she dropped me off at the wrong train station, I was too high and awkward to say it was the wrong train station, it was a severe inconvenience for me in terms of transportation but I trucked it out anyways.
