My fiance and I had been using my queen sized bed for a long time while my roommate was using a twin sized bed. Now that we are about to get married, we replaced my queen with her king sized bed and yes, it is glorious. So we had an extra queen with no place to go and I asked my roommate if he'd like to use it; of course, he agreed. So we wash the sheets and move the bed to his room. Fast forward to today and he tells me that his throat is hurting a lot. Rewind three weeks ago and I was huddled in the blankets having the worst case of strep throat I had ever experienced. But we were puzzled, we washed the sheets... until we remember that we didn't wash the comforter because,"...I don't think we need to wash that one."


**TL;DR: I accidentally went Christopher Columbus on my roommate by giving him my strep throat blankets with my old bed.**
