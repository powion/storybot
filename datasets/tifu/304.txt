I've collected several prescriptions for Seretide, my preventer inhaler, but I don't use it too often so I accumulate a few in the bathroom. I always use them before a big day out. So, in preparation for NYE, I get out of the shower, deodorise, open the inhaler and take a deep blast into my lungs. 

What I didn't do was check the inhaler before I used it. Turns out a nest of baby cockroaches had moved in right on the nozzle inside the mouthpiece. I sprayed the back of my throat full of cockroaches. 

TLDR:
It's five sentences, just read it.

EDIT:

jesus ok I get it it's 6 sentences fark!
