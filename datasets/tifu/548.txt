This past week I've been exhausted and have had some trouble getting up at a decent time. I am supposed to be up at six but even with my seven different alarm clocks set up on my phone to play Eye of the Tiger at varying times, I have been unable to wake myself any later than 6:50. So of course, I thought that the sound of Shia Lebouf's "Do It" would be a good alternative to help wake me up. So, I set it for 5:59AM with max volume and thought everything would be dandy. Unfortunately I forgot I had set the alarm and the next morning my phone began blaring Shia's screams. I immediately thought a man had broken into my home and was screaming at me. I jumped out of bed with my eyes half shut, my pulse furiously racing, and throwing karate kicks...only to eventually notice the 'intruder' yelling things like "YESTERDAY YOU SAID TOMORROW! ...SO  JUST DO IT!!" Long story short, it woke me up but I was freaking terrified.
