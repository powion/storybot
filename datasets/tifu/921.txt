I had been out for a long night of drinking and ended up crashing at a family friend's house at around 6 AM. I woke up some time around 8 AM and still felt drunk. I remembered that most of my stuff, including my pants, was in the guest bathroom down the hall. The problem was:

A) I could hear his family having breakfast

B) I had a lumberjack-esque case of morning wood. 

Being keen to leave, and still in a heavy daze under the sheets, I defaulted to doing the waistband trick to hide my erection. I started walking through the living room -- only to be halted by a large collective gasp. It wasn't because I was in boxers, it was because I had forgotten that the waistband trick only works if you're wearing a shirt. I tried to play it off by saying, "It's an optical illusion." Surprisingly, I haven't been invited back since.


**Edit: Definition** | The waistband trick is where you tuck your boner up into the waistband parallel to your body and under your shirt to avoid unintentially displaying your goods to people
