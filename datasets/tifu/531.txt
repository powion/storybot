Happened about an hour ago. Lunchtime, I'm walking the short distance from the separate building where I work to the main office where the cafeteria is. As I approach the doors from the side I spy a pretty girl I've never seen before approaching the same door from straight on.


The timing (and the fact that the door opens towards me) means I can do the gentlemanly thing and open the door for her and let her through first. I plan to bow and smile, cool. I reach the door and these doors are quite heavy so a little effort is needed to open them.


As I reach for the handle I turn my head to do the 'after you' smile. This is where I FU. By looking at the girl I miss the handle. But Iâ€™m already leaning back to counter the weight of the door and I fall over in the most uncool fashion imaginable.


By brain fails to react and I literally go down backwards like a felled tree. I hit my shoulder hard on the post which supports the canopy over the door. Had it been my head that I hit I would've been out cold.
I get up pretending to be fine, she seems concerned but is trying not to laugh. I'm trying not to cry. I am not cool.
