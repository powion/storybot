Several years ago, my wife and I were visiting a friend and her girlfriend for the weekend. On Saturday night they threw a party with all of their friends, most of whom were also lesbian couples. I saw that one girl had Chinese characters tattooed on her forearms, so I asked to see them, as I had recently been living in China. She was like, "Oh, they're actually *Japanese* characters. This one (万) means 'man,' and this one (女) means 'woman.' Basically, I'm trying to describe how all of us exist on a gender continuum between the two and integrate parts of both into our identities to different degrees."

I responded, "Actually, Japanese characters (kanji) and Chinese characters (hanzi) are really the same thing. And I don't think that one (万) means 'man.' It actually means 'ten thousand.' The correct character for man is 男. 万 and 男 aren't that far off, but the calligraphic style on it would make it hard to replace..."

I look up and this poor girl is literally in tears. The entire party had come to a standstill as I pompously embarrassed this kid in front of all her friends. She had had the tattoo done two or three years earlier and no one had ever caught it.

I had to add, "On the bright side, Chinese doesn't really have a plural, so 万女 is a perfectly grammatical way of saying 'ten thousand women.' Make it a life goal!"

Crickets...

TL;DR: Lesbian didn't check her facts and I gave her a life goal.
