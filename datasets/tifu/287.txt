When I was in 10th grade, I had a really close friend who was a girl, I  was head over heels for this girl, would hang out non-stop, text non-stop, and all around I wanted to date her more than anything at the time. I also had no testicles at the time, and never had the courage to ask her. at the end of 10th grade, we had these yearbooks, and the custom was to get people to sign it, and they would leave stuff like "have a great summer", "nice to have known you" etc. When I asked her to sign it, she put in the following.

Here I am almost a junior in college, and I found my yearbook by accident while looking for something else, and just read this.. pondering life.


Edit: I didn't expect this to blow up like this.
I'm currently out at the moment and typing 
This from my phone. I will call her when I get home
Which is like 2 hours from now. Thanks
For the people who responded positively.

Edit2: I'm going to text her, I really don't want to make another cringey moment in my life, and have an extremely awkward phone conversation. I'll update soon.

Edit3: I texted her, found her number through mutual friends on facebook, she changed it. I will post the conversation after I edit her number out. 5 minutes.

Edit5: Sorry for not calling in the text she mentioned she cried from 3 pm till 12 am, and hearing that over the phone is just too awkward, glad I didn't call. Thank you for the people who
guilted me into this, I needed it.

Edit6: yeah I realized blocking out the name alexis was pointless, so I didnt for the last 2 pictures. I blocked out mine though, it's very uncommon name.

Edit7: I understand the skepticism, if theres a definitive way to prove it I will that doesn't compromise our identities. I just want to say I wouldn't do this for fictional points on a forum, the past couple of hours have been a very weird rollercoaster. 

Edit8: I do have a girlfriend, getting coffee with someone isn't cheating. I'm not going to fuck her on the coffee machine. 

Edit9: I don't know how somebody was able to edit my title on my first imgurlink, but this is not a "wheres waldo book". Here's more pictures.

Edit10: I gave her the link to this thread, she has never heard of reddit, and thinks it's insane that the original picture has 250k views.

Edit11: Probably the last edit I will make to this I want to answer everyones major questions.

"**What college do you go to**?"  
###THE Ohio State University.

"**Does your girlfriend know?**"  
Yes both of them know, and have access to this page.

"**Are you lying?**"  
It's very hard to prove without giving up my identity, and even then I will receive criticisms. I can assure you this wasn't done for fake fictional forum points, but believe what you like.
if there is a way to prove it, I would.

"**Where are the rest of the pictures?**"  
http://i.imgur.com/seasxzn.png

"**Why didn't you read it?**"  
I was more preoccupied with getting as many signatures as I could it was a good self esteem boost, I didn't come home, and read it. I probably put it down somewhere, and it got moved around for years.

"**Do you have any interest in her?**"
I don't know, shes a stranger to me at the moment.

Good night, I'll try to keep people updated if anyone is interested.

"**Pursue Hailey OP, she loves you**"  
I honestly don't even know who that is.. at all I don't even remember her


EditLastOneISwear: So sorry for the very late update, I'm drowning in school work at the moment, but here is how The coffee get-together (not date) went great. We sat around talked about old times, added each other on the newer social medias (ig, snapchat etc), and talked about past and current relationships, before you ask she's single, and before you ask I'm not interested in her. I genuinely came in thinking I was going to be, but I'm just not, and for some reason tried because I was so sure I was, but it turns out I'm not, not even slightly. She's transferring to my University next year, and we'll most likely keep in touch pretty heavily, but that's as far as it's going. I know most of you wanted a love story, but I don't know she felt like a stranger more than anything. We will definitely rebuild our friendship, and move on. My girlfriend which most of you asked about, was way more understanding than I expected, of course she was skeptical, and slightly upset, and I'm pretty much enslaved for the next month so.. theirs that. I will definitely stay with her. Above all I genuinely want to thank the people who abused the hell out of my inbox urging me to contact her. This started as a TIFU, I expected around 10 comments, and expected it to get buried in the reddits history, but it really helped me reunite with someone, and the fact it stayed up for so long is honestly amazing. Thank you so much.
