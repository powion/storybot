Today was not a good day.

Starts off with me in class, as I feel the urge to shit, i go. Whilst I was shitting the lights went out, (some generator fail as I assume.) and I think, well fuck. I'm still gonna finish, but shitting in the dark is no easy task. As I'm almost done, I hear the door open, as the room is filled with light, only to be taken away. I hear a slight "[hehehehehe](http://i.imgur.com/zqVZy.jpg)." Shit that was scary. I start to hear crawling of sorts. All of the sudden, the lights came back, and I find a kid with Down syndrome crawling underneath the stall I'm in looking at me. He goes "**HEHEHEHEHE**" in the most terrifying voice. After my initial scream I react the only way I knew I could. I kicked his face, sending him into the stall door, where he passed out. I quickly gathered myself, got up, and ran. I'm thinking of dropping out.

Now this is, I shit you not what happened. I am in no way making fun if people with special needs. Nor should you.

EDIT: it's 11 AM and I just got called into the principals. Will update later

UPDATE: 11:40 AM Got called into principals for a reason that's uninvolved with my story. I see Down syndrome kid in the office w/ a black eye. He points at me saying "ITS HIM HEHEHEHEHEHE" I shit you the fuck not. Waiting outside principals again, will update soon.

UPDATe: 11:56 AM Principal yelled at me for kicking Down syndrome kid in the face. He still couldn't help but laugh. Got a Saturday school, but that's about it. I left my principal in tears of laughter though. Will be responding to most posts if you got any questions.

UPDATE: 2:47 PM Got call into the office, principal said he saw the reddit post and read over it. After "further investigation" of the comment section, he has lifted the detention. REDDIT: 1 DOWN SYNDROME: 0 and no I don't know his username

~~EDIT: Im now playing DayZ, if anyone would like to play and hear a wonderful story of how i kicked a down syndrome kid~~

**MANDATORY EDIT**: Fuck up of the week ey? Damn did I really fuck up that bad?
