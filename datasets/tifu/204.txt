I don't usually open doors for anyone, but recently I've been trying to be more chivalrous because thats fucking awesome.  What better way than opening the car door for my sweet mom?  I park the car like a boss, turn it off like a light switch, get out like I'm about to finish, go to her door like a graceful gentleteen, and open it.  What I saw was my portal to this world.  She was in a dress, full on Commando.  She didn't notice that I noticed, but I noticed that I noticed, and I didn't want to notice that I noticed.  But I did.  Now I'm scarred.

TL;DR:  Spawn point located.

Edit:

**Some Q&amp;A**

Is she hot?
&amp;nbsp;

She's my mom and I'm not into Wincest, sorry bros.  (That's a no)

&amp;nbsp;

How's the trimmings?
&amp;nbsp;

Didn't see it long enough to notice, and glad it's that way.

&amp;nbsp;

Continuing the Chivalry?
&amp;nbsp;

Yeah, of course!

&amp;nbsp;

Also thanks for the laughs you guys provided, I hope you all have a great day!
