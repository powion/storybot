This happened less than an hour ago....

Let's preface this by saying that tonight my wife and I have been best friends for 10 years, but have only been married for 3 months. We recently moved to New Zealand, where I started a new job. Needless to say, we haven't been getting a lot of 'quality time'.

So my wife and I are in the bath together, enjoying some naked time, and all of a sudden my stomach starts churning a little.  I just tried to not think about it, even though the grumbling was becoming more insistent.

All of a sudden, I feel it.

A fart moving so quickly towards my ass that I couldn't hold it in and it fired out of me, the noise burbling from the depths of my bowels until it met the surface of the water.  Needless to say it turned our bath into a temporarily steamy Jacuzzi.  

My wife stares at me for a silent second, and says "Great, now I'm just sitting in your beef stew" before getting out of the bath. 

I don't think she was all that impressed when I, clearly thinking straight, replied with "Awwww, we still have firsts!".

TL;DR: Ruined romantic bath with bubbles *eau de moi*
