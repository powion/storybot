Vanity is one of the seven deadly sins. 

I run a fashion blog, which in itself should let you know just how vain I am. Today, I thought I looked pretty cute in my tastefully clashing black-and-white patterns and leather boots. I thought, “Hey, I should take some photos after work for my blog.”

I’d started my period this morning with some light spotting, so I just decided a regular tampon would do the trick, with a panty liner for good measure.

Cut to just around lunchtime, when I’m thinking of the delicious salad waiting for me in the break room fridge. That’s when I start to feel it—the telltale trickle. 

Just when I was about to get up to go change my tampon, I felt a gigantic rush flow out of me. A crimson tide, if you will. Blood covered the insides of my thighs, soaking through my leggings. I leapt out of my seat and walked through the office, convinced I was covered in blood. 

Through some sheer miracle, I hadn’t bled through the back of my skirt, and because my leggings are black, no one saw the blood seeping down my legs. I tore down my leggings, managing to get blood all over the toilet seat in the process, and splattering blood spots along the stall wall. It was like a fucking CSI episode. 

I packed my overflowing hell-hole with toilet paper the best I could, sprayed down the toilet seat with disinfectant and wiped off the blood, and charged out of the bathroom and to my car. I keep trash bags in my glove compartment just in case, so I used those as a barrier for my butt, and drove my red ass to Walmart for some giant pads, new underwear, and a change of leggings. 

Luckily I didn’t leave a blood trail all over Walmart (but really, would that have been so out of place?), and managed to get everything I needed, then changed in the bathroom. It was all over. 

So, I took some deep breaths and a Midol and went back to work. Just as I was about to enjoy my salad, I knocked the damn thing over and spilled balsamic dressing all over the front of my skirt.

**TL;DR: Angered God with my vanity, paid for it in blood and salad dressing.**

**EDIT**: Holy shit, front page! Amazing. Thanks for making this crappy day a bit better, reddit. I love seeing how weirded out and confused all the dudes are.

For everyone asking to see my blog, no way you loonies. This is a throwaway for a reason. 

**EDIT 2:** sorry for calling you loonies. Self-promo goes against the tenets of TIFU.
