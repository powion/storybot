EDIT: [Update here.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2feoep/tifupdate_tifu_by_letting_my_boyfriend_finger_me/)

It was supposed to be romantic. It was our last night together before he left on a plane, not to see me for months, and we were about to get groovy.

We were under the stars, kissing and holding each other and spending a long time on the perfect foreplay. It was fucking amazing. We were ready to fuck like animals and to make sweet love all at once.

We were naked and touching each other to build up suspense, and he began to finger me hard, leaving me moaning, but with an... odd... sensation as well.

   "There's something inside you," he said.

   "There's nothing, don't stop," I replied, uneasily. 

   "No, there's something inside you. It feels plastic."

Horror chills my veins. It had been about two weeks since my period. But I knew then that I had left my menstrual cup (basically a plastic cup for blood/period gunk not to be left in longer than 12 hours) in for the past *14 days.* 

IDIOTICALLY, I asked him to help me remove it so we could continue. MOTHER OF GOD... it smelled like an eviscerated decomposing body mixed with rotting broccoli, sewage, and rotting eggs ALL IN ONE. And the smell DID NOT GO AWAY. I threw out the cup and its contents, but the stench of 14 day old rotting blood and uterine gunk is not one that fades easily. I could tell my squeamish boyfriend was trying extremely hard not to lose his shit and vomit. But it only got worse from there.

The stench would not leave, and it was coming from my vagina. To try and bring the mood back, I went to the bathroom to try and freshen up. He joined me, perhaps to make me feel less disgusting. Bad idea. With a feeling like an impending queef but somehow *thicker*, my vagina suddenly emptied a massive glob of this filth and it splattered a surprisingly large amount of brown rotted uterine filth all over my poor boyfriend's leg... He practically ran home.
