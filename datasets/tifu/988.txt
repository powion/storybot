This happened about 5 minutes ago. 

So at my school we have a Digital Art class in which we learn how to use Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. Today we were watching a particularly boring video on the big screen and somehow I feel asleep face-down on my desk. This was the FU. When I awoke, the entire room was empty and the lights were off. I was startled and thought that maybe the bell had rung and that everybody left. I walked out of the door and there was the entire class, with the teacher waiting to scare me. Their plan worked perfectly and I nearly pissed myself. So there I was, keyboard imprint on my face, stunned with fear, in-front of the entire class. 

TL;DR
I fell asleep in class and was scared shitless by the entire class.

Edit: Wow, Thanks for the Gold!
