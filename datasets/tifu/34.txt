I was leaving my office when I decided to order Chipotle for the first time using the app. I typed in my credit card information and ordered a burrito bowl. I then got a confirmation email in the name of my girlfriend, but I didn't think anything of it since I knew she uses the app all the time and has used it on my phone before.

When I get there I ask for the order I placed. The lady looked at me suspiciously and asked me for an ID. I told her that it's probably under my girlfriend's name and that I can show her the confirmation email. As I told her this, I get weird stare from a guy in the back on the phone, and a few other employees working the line. The guy came up to me and told me I had to wait there. 

Turns out, I placed an order using my girlfriend's saved credit card which she had lost a few days before. Chipotle called her to tell her that there was no guac available that night, which lead her to think that I, the thief, was using her 'stolen' card. She told them that I had stolen her card and to call the cops and detain me. That's exactly what they were doing until I called her to get things straightened out.

Yup, almost got arrested for ordering a burrito bowl.

[EDIT] Just to make things a little bit clearer since I did not expect for this to blow up: 

1. My gf didn't cancel her card because she was almost certain it was somewhere in the house. She ended up finding it today in the washing machine.

2. Chipotle didn't detain me. They're not allowed to, but they were trying to figure out a way to make me wait. As a matter of fact, they did not know what to do with me before learning that I wasn't a thief. My gf was surprised by the call and her first reaction was that someone actually stole her card, and to hold me accountable for it.

3. I'm alive. No E.coli and no food poisoning. It hasn't been 24 hours yet, so I may start to feel some delayed symptoms. I'll check back in in a few hours. By the way, burrito bowls taste TERRIBLE without guac.
