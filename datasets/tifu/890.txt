Normally, getting laid would not lead to a TIFU post, but today something so terribly fucked up was said that it warrants posting. My girlfriend and I are in the "honeymoon" stage of our relationship, and we have started having sex every night we are together. One thing will lead to another, and before I know it, the condom is on and we're getting it on. She had said several times that she is on birth control because she doesn't want children, so in the wee hours of the morning (after six shots of Crown), it seemed like a good idea to pass on the condom. Things are getting pretty heated and she is riding me cowgirl style. I warn her before I'm about to finish, and she holds me down and finishes me off inside of her. I'm basking in the afterglow, and she leans in real close and asks, "How do you know I'm on birth control?". My eyes widen, and before I can formulate a response, she says, " Happy Father's Day". She assures me that she is really is on birth control, but I can't help but think that TIFU.

Update: 10 hours later, my post has been discovered... Many lawls were had. I think I have a keeper!
