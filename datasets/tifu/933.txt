So like most of these, this happened a few years ago. I was visiting a couple of female friends in a large Canadian city . One of these friends i had been sleeping with on a semi occasional basis, and it was fun but nothing serious. So this particular night we ended up at their friends place. The friends in question were renting a fitted basement in a fairly nice residential area. 
There was a lot of drinking and i had driven over and parked my car out on the street prior to drinking. I began to drink heavily and honestly don't even remember what the reason was (probably i had left smokes in my car) but I invited this girl to come fetch them with me as an excuse to get us alone. Once we got out to the car we started making out and realized there was no obvious place to continue but in the car itself. . . so we did. I put the back seats down and we got to it. . . and i'm talking GOT TO IT, up against the windows, very loud, and it was a small car so it was rocking.
Fast forwards twenty minutes and we had had our fun, composed ourselves and went inside. Upon re-entering we found many glum semi drunk faces. Apparently, five minutes earlier their landlord (who lived in the house above) had burst in and declared that they would be thrown out the next day, having had previous warnings, the couple having loud rampant sex in a car parked out on the street was the last straw.
So basically i got several guys kicked out of their apartment for sleeping with a girl in my car. . . My biggest fuck up to date!
