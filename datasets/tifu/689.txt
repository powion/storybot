I was driving home while on the phone (it's legal here) with Death Sphere Phone Company. I had been on hold with them for 30 minutes, so the thought was to get home and not have to speak with them in the car. I pull up behind another car at a red light and start reading out loud their bumper stickers while the hold music continues.

"I like my husband, but I love my horse." "I &lt;3 horses!" "If you don't love my horse, then you don't love me." Etcetera. I then follow with the next logical statement, not on her stickers, but in my mind, and proudly proclaim, "I fucked my horse!".

I then register that the hold music stopped at the beginning of that sentence.

From the line, a soft feminine voice, "Uh..."

"Uh."

"Um, sir?"

"Uh."

"Sir," *giggling*, "how can I help you today?"

"Uh."

I look over at my wife in the passenger seat, and see her with hand over mouth, face screwed up in a rictus of shaking pain from not laughing audibly.

"I'll call you back."

I hang up and my wife starts laughing at me, as I search my steering wheel for meaning. I still need to call back. Wife is still calling me horse fucker.
