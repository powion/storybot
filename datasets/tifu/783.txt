I was on the treadmill next to these hot chicks, and I didnt want to look like a bitch so I put the speed faster than I usually do. Well it was too fast and I ended up tripping over my feet and landed very hard. It took me a while to recuperate because I had the wind knocked out of me. The girl next to me stopped her workout and started asking me if I was ok. A gym attendant came over to check out the situation. I was extremely embarrassed and felt like a retard so in my most confident voice, I put on a smile and said "youre on camera, it was just a prank.". 

I thought my acting skills alone would sell that and I would be on my way, but this fucking chick started asking me where the camera was. I pointed in a general direction and said my friend is over there filming. The gym attendant looked annoyed and asked me which guy is filming us, so I started stuttering and looked for the most believable guy. I saw some fat guy on the bicep machine looking at me so I pointed straight at him and said that guy. I told them his water bottle is actually a camera. The gym attendant was angry and said we dont have permission to film here and said he wants the footage deleted. I apologized and said my friend will delete it if you ask him to. The gym attendant immediately started walking toward the fat guy on the bicep machine. Thinking of the extremely embarrassing situation that was about to emerge, I literally booked it out the door. Yeah Im never going back there again.
