So, i work as a volunteer in a refugee camp at a danish airport (which is also a train station). Basically what we do is; we hand little bags of food to Syrian refugees on the train heading to Sweden.
Occasionally, you don't make it out of the train in time. So you have to ride the train all the way to Sweden and then back again.


So i was running through a train, when suddenly i see a group of Syrian refugees sitting and talking. Naturally i give them all of the bags i had, and told them in a very slow voice "Here. You take this. Food" and made eating movements with my hands. Of course, it turns out that they weren't refugees at all. They were Danish with an arabic heritage. The silence was so incredibly awkward. The train started moving and i realised that i was going to spend the next half an hour, sitting with a whole bunch of people who thought i was a giant racist.

They were so mad that two of them got out of the train with me, went all the way back to Denmark and complained. I got fired.
