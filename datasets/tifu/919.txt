Ok, so let's start by saying that I don't like popping pimples, because I'm afraid they will leave scars or holes on my face. 
Story time....

So last night, I was at a christmas party, enjoying myself eating good food, opening nice gifts, etc. There was this cute girl there (not a relative for all of you wondering), and we were talking and dancing and having a good time. When the time to leave comes, you give everyone goodbye hugs and cheek kisses, which is really just an awkward cheek bump. When its my turn to say good bye to this girl, we bump cheeks, and I feel a sharp pain on my cheek. Then I remember the pimple, feel for it, and felt the wetness of a popped pimple. I then looked at the girls cheek, and see the puss mixed with blood mixture on there. I, however, am too embarrased to tell her, and just watch her give other people goodbye kisses, spreading the bacteria of my pimple around.

  **TL;DR:** At a xmas party with huge pimple on my cheek, dance with cute girl. Time to leave, cheeck kiss, and my pimple explodes puss all over her. She smudges it on other peoples cheeks.
