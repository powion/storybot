This was over a year ago but I am still reminded of it almost every day. I am a database programmer and one day I was working on a project where our customers can upload a profile picture to their account. So I am going through the existing database stored procedures and I find one called spUploadMemberImage. It takes two parameters; a member id and an image object. Perfect! To humor myself I found a picture of [Oscar Gamble](http://i.imgur.com/Y2M5fPr.jpg) (a baseball player from the 70's and 80's with the greatest afro in history). So I run the stored procedure, it shouldn't take more than a second or two. Well, after about 10 seconds I start getting nervous. Finally, it says "execution successful, 77,000 records updated". OH HOLY SHIT. Every customer picture is now Oscar Gamble. Every button on the restaurants point of sale system is Oscar Gamble. All the buttons that used to be a hot dog, or coke, or whatever is now Oscar Gamble. The thing is, on the POS screen it zoomed in the image so you couldn't see the whole picture, just a close up of his face. Our users start calling our help desk freaking out about an Obama virus. Customers are upset when they login to their account and see a picture that is obviously not theirs. Took me about 2 hours to get everything back to normal and everyone had a good laugh. Pictures and mentions of Oscar Gamble still float around the office pretty frequently.



**Edit:** thanks for the gold! 
Also, my co-worker just sent me a screenshot he took of one of the POS screens that shows the "Obama virus" in action. http://i.imgur.com/WgMMNWw.jpg
