OK, I work behind the bar in a popular bar in Brighton, Normally I wear jeans when working but as the weather has been quite warm I opted to wear a long thin cotton skirt but unless I wore a G-string I had quite a visible panty line so I opted to go commando. The manager went down into the cellar to carry out a stock check, access to the cellar is through a trapdoor behind the bar and I carried on behind the bar. You get used to working around the open trap door and after an hour or so I had more or less forgotten that the manager was down there. I had been stood taking to a customer for a minute or 2 when I heard a discreet cough from below where I was standing. It was only then that I realised I had been stood astride the open trapdoor on full display to my boss.

His face spoke volumes as I looked down to see him grinning up at me with one hand theatrically draped over his eyes saying "Am I clear to come up now that the rainforest has been cleared?"

The only saving grace was that he had left his i-phone by the till and did not have it with him or I suspect I would now be a lot more famous than I ever want to be.

**edit** 


1) I get it, euphemistic  references to trapdoors are now unoriginal.


2) If you are desperate for nudes send me money and I will send you someone else's nudes and we can both be happy.


3) Thank you for the insulting PMs and comments, I will be sure to devote the attention they deserve, the better ones I may borrow for personal use when required (I am a British barmaid and have to deal with pissed chavs frequently).
