I've waited 16 months since marrying my wife to get my US Permanent Residency. I was finally travelling today to finalise everything. I hand him the sealed packet that he has to inspect, he looks it over stoically, silently. All of a sudden he extends his arm towards me, hand up, palm facing me. Without thinking I high five him. His hand is limp. I knew immediately I had done wrong. A look of confusion and anger flashes across his face. Those in the queue behind me fell silent. "Follow me sir". Turns out he was about to demonstrate how I give my fingerprints correctly.

I finished the process in a locked room with a different officer and no doubt a lot more questions than I would have otherwise had to endure.

Edit &amp; Bonus TIFU: So when I had to go to the embassy to present my evidence for them to make a final decision I had another fuck up. I don't know if anyone has been to the US embassy in London but they have a little security room outside the building with an xray and guards etc and big heavy doors. I've just been through the xray and I'm struggling with my belt and my bag and I'm pushing on the heavy door with a single finger and it won't open (obviously) so naturally I start looking for a [door release]( http://www.jwsltd.co.uk/index.asp?function=PRODUCTIMAGEWINDOW&amp;closedelay=20000&amp;SRC=http://www.jwsltd.co.uk/ekmps/shops/timwainer/images/-door-release-exit-switch-525-p[ekm]300x300[ekm].gif) , see a switch on the door frame, press it, and all the lights turn off. Fucking great. I was convinced they would decline my green card on the grounds of stupidity.

Edit: for those wondering, green card and permanent resident are the same thing.

Edit: Please RES tag me as the Inappropriate High Five Guy (or whatever you want) and say hello to me when you see me in other subs! Makes my day when that happens!
