So I was snapchatting with this girl I knew for a while and things were getting a little heated. I get a snapchat from her with her showing her tits. The only reasonable thing to do was to send her a dick pic. So I send her the dick pic with the caption "you like?" and after maybe an hour without a response I text her asking if she didn't like my last snapchat. She says she never got a picture back. So now I'm like fuck fuck fuck who do I send that dick pic to and I go to check my history and the most recent update was the snapchat from the girl showing me her tits. My stomach immidiatly sunk because I knew what I did. I go to check my MyStory and there it was. For those of you who don't know what a MyStory is, you basically post pictures to it and everyone in your SnapChat contacts can see it, which includes about 50 of my friends and family, almost all of which saw my dick.

TL;DR: Sent a picture of my dick to my friends and family.
