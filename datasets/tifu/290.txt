This happened about an hour ago. I had just gotten the kids to bed and was multi-tasking by taking a piss while talking to my wife with the bathroom door open. I was distracted from the conversation when I noticed that there was a spider hanging down directly over the toilet bowl, inching closer and closer to all that I hold sacred. Naturaly, I couldnt just stop mid-stream, so I did the next best thing and tried to knock the little fucker down with my stream of pee. Unfortunately, the spider realized that I had missle lock and started to retreat back up the web, and when I tried to lead the target (that is what your are suppose to do in such situations) I missed and pissed all over the floor/wall/everywhere but in the bowl. Right about this time my wife rounds the corner into the bathroom to inqure as to why I was not responding to her inqueries as to whether or not I paid the cable bill. Of course, from her vantage she couldnt see the spider and thought that I was just pissing all over the walls for the sport of it.
