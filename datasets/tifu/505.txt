Obligatory happened a few years ago. I'd just gotten married, and I had one final semester of college left. My advisor recommended that I take an online course called "Electronic Journalism." It was actually really awesome. We made .xls files and uploaded them to googlemaps and made huge pinpointed charts. 

One assignment required us to match a phony list of 5,000 IP addresses to a phony list of like 10 child pornography IP addresses to see if a certain employee at our company was watching it at work.   

I downloaded the assignment (an excel file with two separate sheets) as "Child Porn IP Addresses." I left it on the desktop and left for work before my wife got home. 

While at work, I get a text telling me that we really need to talk about something as soon as I get home. 

I get home, and my wife has a list that she believes to be 5,000 IP addresses for child porn sights. She'd been very upset the entire night but hadn't actually checked any of the IPs. I explained it and things were okay, but she deeply regretted marrying me for a short time.

Tl;DR: I was trying to get through college to get a degree, but my wife thought I was more interested in going to elementary school.
