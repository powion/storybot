So I lurk a lot here because I'm a pretty antisocial guy. Occasionally I will comment, and even fewer times I will post. But most of my time spent here is just reading. Across many different subs. That being said, one day I noticed that I had opened 4 or 5 threads in a row... And everyone in all of them were just complete jerks. Like unnecessarily mean to people. It really left a bad taste in my mouth. Had the urge to cuss out a few people so I just had to step away for a bit. Came back a few days later and decided to try a different sub. Same thing happens. But I really do like redditing so I decided to just not read any comments since magically, every redditor on the planet had transformed into cruel, cold hearted, tentacled beasts who only wanted to hurt others. Or maybe everyone had always been like that and they just decided to all stop faking being nice at the same time. And so I didn't read comments for probably a week. Even ignored self post comments. Just clicked links and left. Finally, just now, I click the top right of my phone and see: sort comments by: controversial. Wait...you can sort comments?

Tl;dr thought everyone in the world had become jerks for a week because my reddit comments have been sorting by controversial without my knowing
