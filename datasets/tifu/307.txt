Okay so this morning I go into the bathroom to do my morning business.  My nephew is spending the weekend so his mother brought his stool to stand on when he brushes his teeth.  As I am sitting there trying to go, the cramps hit and I am serious pain and need to poop.  I think back about a previous post about raising your feet up off the floor helps you take a dump.  So I drag the stool over and put my feet up.  It is not particularly comfortable and I am not sure how high my feet are supposed to be.  Well mine are about 8-10" off the ground.  All of the sudden the urge hits me and I let loose.  The hard plug followed by a severe poopsplosion.  Well, when you raise your feet that high, you also change the angle of your anus. A large part of the spray escapes the toilet painting my calves as it goes by.  I look up to see it on the floor, shower curtain and all over my legs.  It was the worst cleanup job ever, I am even gagging as I type this.
