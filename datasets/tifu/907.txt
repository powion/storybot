So I had gotten a significant gift card to Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (AF) for Christmas and decided to use it to get some new clothes. Just to be clear, I have NEVER shopped at an Abercrombie store before so I didn't know what to expect. I waltz into an Abercrombie store and go straight to the long sleeve shirts and saw some medium "muscle fit" shirts. Being the wannabe tool-I-work-out-douche-complex-dude, I try on the shirt. Immediately, I get a short ego-boost thinking "damn I'M FUCKING HUGE, this shirt barely fits!" However, as I motion to take off the shirt, I realize that holy fuck I can't even pull it past my shoulders as I begin to wobble around blindly. A kind employee asks if I need help and assists me in removing the tiny shirt.

Now everyone in the store is beginning to glare at me and I don't know why. Being the douchebag I was, I shrugged it off and went on to try some other sweaters and shirts...all with the same outcome as before. Now Instead of helping me, the employees begin to laugh profusely. Then it suddenly dawns on me, I'm trying on fucking KIDS clothing inside a fucking KIDS clothing store. Everyone is staring at me like im a fucking child molester, deriving joy from tight children's clothes. I quickly toss my shit down and go running out of the store. No wonder why there were two separate goddam Abercrombie stores...A&amp;F for adults and Abercrombie for kids.Â
