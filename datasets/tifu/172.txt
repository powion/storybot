My brother is currently 7 and I told him this lie when he was 4. 

It all started when I saw a moth in my room and my brother comes in. He asked me what was it, and brilliant me thought: this is a perfect time to prank him. I start "hyperventilating" and told him to run out of the room. We run out of the room and I told him: That a moth! Moths are like vampires, they suck the blood of people and kill when people they are asleep. He gets scared like any 4 year old would and runs into his room. Each time he sees a moth, he literally run full speed yelling bloody murder to his room and locks the door. His favorite attire is turtlenecks because moths can't get the his neck.

 Fast forward to an hour ago.

My mom gets a call from school asking her if she can pick my brother up because he had a panic attack. Apparently today the schools science teacher brought a ton of butterflies to show kids how caterpillars turn to butterflies. When he saw them, he started running and screaming around the room telling everyone to save themselves because moths suck blood and kill people. The whole class started panicking and started running and screaming. 

I think it's time to tell him that moths don't suck blood or kill people...

Update: Due to popular demand, I won't tell my brother the truth. You sick bastards!
