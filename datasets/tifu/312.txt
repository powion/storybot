I'm sure you have all heard the story about the person yelling "are you fucking sorry". Well.. Today I did something similar. 

5:30pm comes around at work and I'm just chatting with a few people as we are finishing up. I then thought it might be cool if we go for a couple of beers after work. So I turned to my female colleague and went to ask her if she was game. 

However being the excellent clear speaker that I am I stumbled over my words and started saying " do you want a quick one" except halfways through saying quick I changed the word to sneaky. 

I ended up asking her "do you want a quickie".

Luckily she just laughed and told everyone else but I'm not going to live it down for a while.

EDIT: to all those asking a sneaky refers to getting a drink or two when you wouldn't usually have one. 

And I'm Australian so you don't even need to use the word beer or drink in that sentence.
