It's my birthday, so my mum says she is going out to get something for my birthday surprise and will be back in about an hour, so I decide to shower and get ready for my birthday surprise. So I get out of the shower, and I don't have a towel but since I was home alone I walk to the dining room where there is a laundry basket full of clothes and towels, because that's where my mum usually does the ironing. So yeah I skip down stairs naked, singing to Taylor Swift - I knew you were trouble.
So I skip into the dining room, naked, singing. All of a sudden.. "SURPRISE!". ALMOST MY WHOLE CLASS FROM SCHOOL WAS THERE, AND SOME FAMILY MEMBERS, INCLUDING MY GRANDPARENTS, MY MOTHER, COUSINS AND MY AUNTIE AND UNCLE, AND I JUST BASICALLY SKIP IN SINGING MY HEART OUT, LOUDLY THINKING I WAS HOME ALONE, COMPLETELY NAKED, DRIPPING WET. I am now in my room on my own crying my eyes out, my crush was there as well, and they all saw me naked..
