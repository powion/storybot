It was a family reunion at this restaurant/pub thing. We're all eating happily and my neice had some chicken nuggets and lemonade. All of the other adults go out to get some air and ask me to sit with my neice for a little bit, she finishes her drink and is still thirsty. 

I went to the bar and ordered some lemonade for her, but I was kinda drunk (but not absoloutley hammered or anything) and I, without thinking order Smirnoff Voda and Lemonade, the barman, obviously assuming the drink was for me, poured it. I took my neice back to the table (it still hadn't clicked that I'd ordered vodka for her) and all the adults came back in. Later, I looked at the receipt and realised I'd ordered Vodka lemonade, not normal lemonade. My niece had drank the whole glass. Anyway, I freaked the fuck out, told everyone, my neice was took the hospital, she was okay and only at the hospital around an hour, but my sister isn't talking to me.
