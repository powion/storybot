A couple months ago there was this AskReddit post about products you use that are intended for the opposite gender. I read something about these nasal pore strips, and how satisfying it is to see what they remove from your skin. Having never have heard of these strips, I continued reading curiously. It was mentioned that these strips are very expensive, but that you can put glue on your nose, let it dry, and peel it off for the same effect. 

Not really sure why, but I gave it a go. Once it dried, I peeled it off and examined the glue. It appeared as though nothing came out of my pores. I wasn't really disappointed, I just didn't care. The next morning I woke up with a pimple on my nose where the glue had been. I looked like Rudolph. It was the kind of zit that causes a throbbing, distracting pain. With each pulsation I cursed at that damn Reddittor under my breath. 

The next day I woke up and noticed it was even bigger, redder, and more painful. Fed up, I tried to pop it, but to no avail. 

The following day, the redness had spread up my face into my eyes. One was completely swollen shut. So I went to the doctor and they gave me some antibiotics. After a couple days of the medication, I was not getting any better, so I went to urgent care. 

I was diagnosed with MRSA in the face and admitted for a week stay at the hospital for constant IV Antibiotics and 4 incisions in my nose. I was told that if I had come a day later, it would have likely spread to my brain and I would have either died or suffered brain damage. 

I now have a scar on my nose. Fuck you, redditor. 

TLDR followed redditor's advice, got MRSA in the face, almost died.
