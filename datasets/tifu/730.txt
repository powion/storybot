This fuck up happened last night, and in hindsight it is the dumbest string of events I have ever done.
 I was at a friends house, let's call him Steve-O, to celebrate the Bank Holiday we have here in the UK when we all decide, there's five of us in total, to go out into the garden to smoke some weed. We all smoke and drink until we're all nicely stoned, us being seventeen we all live with our parents so it really shouldn't have come as a surprise to us when Steve-O's dad comes out into the garden to see what were up to. Once he figures out what were doing he goes into a fit of rage screaming at the lot of us about how "This shit is illegal, I'm phoning your parents yellowstone9098." and how he'll "make sure were're all arrested for our behavior." After about ten to fifteen minutes of Steve-O's dad screaming in our faces I do the absolute dumbest thing I have ever done to life. I take another drag of the joint, offer it to Steve-O's dad and say- "Toke?"

I've become a legend according to my friends but I'm now grounded from now to end of the summer holiday, and knowing my mum, she is probably going to send me to rehab.

TL;DR Offered my friends dad a joint and now I'm probably going to prison.

Edit: This is my first post on Reddit and I'm really glad to see people either calling me a dumb-ass or a legend. Thanks guys, you've made my bank holiday weekend :)

Edit 2: Reddit Gold?! Now you are the true legend, kind stranger.
