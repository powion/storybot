Today my wife decided that it would be a nice idea to take a shower together. We do it all of the time and it is a nice way to kick start our night together after work. 

It was a typical shower which consists of her using all of the water with me being left in the cold waiting for my turn in the warm water.

After a while she decided to forfeit the water and let me have my turn. I grabbed my body wash off the shelf and proceeded to drop it. This is where I fucked up.

I quickly bent down to grab it. I bent at the knees remembering that it's bad for you to bend down to grab something only using your waist. 

I was soon met with a painful sensation that I had never experienced before. The small push/ pull valve that changes the water from the faucet to the shower head penetrated my virgin ass. 

The pain was unreal. The water changed from the shower head to the faucet. I shot up trying to get away from the metal knob that just violated me. Upon standing up the shower resumed. 

I stood there in shock looking up at my wife. She witnessed the entire thing. She won't stop laughing at me about it. It hurts to sit.

TL;DR: Showered with my wife trying to put something in her. Ended up with something in me.

Edit: Wording. 

It figures that my most successful post to date is about something metal entering my ass.


The Steve Byrne video: I have not seen it, I swear that this is true. I'm going to watch it with my wife tonight because if it is verbatim like some of you say she will get a good laugh from it.
