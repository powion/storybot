This fuck-up actually happened just a couple hours ago...

So as many of you might know McDonalds is doing the promotion of paying with love, I happened to be one of the lucky "winners" of this promotion. It was great a $15 Mckey'D's food binge for free, man I coulnd't believe my luck! They said all I had to do is call a family member and tell them "I love you".

The start of the fuckup is calling my mother who knows that I had a breif history with depression and suicidal thoughs from high school bullies, the second fuckup is starting the call with I love you.

She immediatly started to freak out (mostly because I'm over 1000 miles  away from her and the closest family is about 300 miles away from me) and was pretty scared that I was about to commit suicide. Over the course of the next 15 minuets I was on the phone reassureing her that I indeed wasn't about to kill myself and make sure that she wasn't on the next plane to arrive and come to visit. (Afterwards she also mentioned that it had given her a small asthma attack, but nothing her inhailer couldn't handle)

Overall it wasn't the worst thing that has happened, and the McDucks manager that was helping me thought it was so funny she paied for the other guys meal I was with along with handing me a handful of free sandwich coupons because it was the best laugh she has had at this job.


**TL:DR** :Went to McHeartAttack to get free food and nearly gave mother a heartattack


**Edit** : Thanks to /u/Adamjc53 for fixing the TL:DR and holy shit did this blow up, I'll be doing my best to reply to most if not all of the comments.

Front page as well? Sweet! Posted this about an hour before I went to bed so I wasn't able to reply to everyone's comment, that is going to happen ASAP.

For everyone saying the manager was rude/being an asshole, truthfuly, after the fact I thought it was pretty damn funny myself, not only did it make her night a little more entertaining/interesting I got more free food then I origionaly throught I was going to get.

**EDIT 2** apparently this has made radio stations across America and several websites quote this word for word. I guess everyone was just waiting for it to backfire and it did.

Also thanks to the redditor who gifted gold.
