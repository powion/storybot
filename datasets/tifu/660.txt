I was at the park with my daughters 6&amp;7.  I assumed my usual position at a bench in the middle of the park that give me a view of the whole park.  I usually sit there until I'm called to push, help or just watch.  I pull out my phone and start playing Mortal Combat X.  

My 7 year old comes over about 10 minutes in and says the boys are saying bad words.  I told her to take her sister and go to the other jungle gym.  A few minutes pass and the boys head over to where my girls and a few others are playing.  The boys are probably 9-10 years old.  Now I hear them cursing and its echoing throughout the park because they are in a plastic slide.  I walk over and say "YOU GUYS NEED TO WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE" loud enough for them and any parents to hear.  

Had they been teenagers I would have said a lot worse and probably told them to leave but they were just young kids.  A few seconds later and young lady who I am assuming was one of their mothers comes over and goes apeshit on her kid.  She is yelling and cursing and threatening the kid and his friends/brothers.  The language she was using was 20 times worse than the kids.  

This caused another mother to come over and yell at the yelling mother.  The yelling mother didn't appreciate it and starts going apeshit on the mother too.  Now the father of one lady comes over and starts trying to break it up and the yelling mom goes apeshit on him too.  

Now all of the kids have stopped playing and are watching and all the grown ups are screaming, cursing, threatening each other and threatening to call child services and to call the cops.

Then I got a text that dinner was ready.  I grabbed my girls and walked to the car and they were all still going apeshit.
