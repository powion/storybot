**The plan:** Tell a Starbucks barista that my name is Spartacus.  When my drink order arrives and the barista says "Coffee for Spartacus?", claim boldy that "I'm Spartacus!", then watch and laugh when everyone else joins with cries of "I'm Spartacus!".  We all have a good laugh for a couple of minutes and I'm hailed as a comic genius.

**The reality:** I told a Starbucks barista that my name was Spartacus.  When my drink order arrived the barista said "Coffee for Spartacus?".  I claimed boldy that I was Spartacus.  No-one else joined in with cries of "I'm Spartacus!".  I meekly grabbed my drink and trudged the long, long walk upstairs.  My mother, to whom I had explained the whole plan and who thought the idea was below average, went and sat at a different table.

TL;DR? I am an unfunny man.

**UPDATE** Um, thanks for all the replies.  Having collated them all in great detail in a spreadsheet, it seems that 23% of respondents would have joined in with my crap attempt at a joke, 35% of respondents want my mother's contact details because she's awesome, and 41% of people think I'm autistic and need immediate medical help.  

Have a great day everyone, and thanks to the stranger for the gold.
