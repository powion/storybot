So I was in English class earlier today and the teacher (really laid back guy, jokes around with is and goes off on tangents all the time) was talking about formal vs. informal language. He says: "You wouldn't speak to your parents the same way you, say, text your best friend." Now, I have this kind of running joke with my best friend where he's my "Daddy" (Google Daddy kink if you are uninitiated). So I whisper to my friend sitting next to me (let's call her Anne): "Fuck me harder Daddy" (all my friends know about the "daddy" joke so she knows what I'm talking about).

She completely loses it. She's crying with laughter and everyone looks over to see what she's laughing about. Teacher says: "Anne, what are you laughing about?" Anne says: "Something /u/flyhalfboy said." Teacher says: "/u/flyhalfboy would you like to repeat what you said to Anne?" Through tears of laughter, I refuse. By now the whole class wants to know and everyone's chattering and giggling. Another friend on my table (we'll call him John) asks me what it was. So I tell him, and he loses it aswell.

Teacher asks me to write it up on the whiteboard. Again, I refuse. He insists that, as long as it's not about anyone in the class, I won't get in trouble. This goes on for a while, until John, my knight in shining armour, goes up to the board and writes: "Fuck me harder Daddy". The class erupts into laughter and I worry I will be forever known as the boy who gets fucked by his dad.

TL;DR: told my English class that my Dad fucks me.

EDIT: Holy shit front page this is a new experience for me
