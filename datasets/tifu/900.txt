Earlier today I bought some industrial strength spray bottles to use on the dogs as "punishment". Immediately upon discovering they are accurate past 15 feet a water fight breaks out in the house at 11:00 PM. Between two grown [ass-adults](https://xkcd.com/37/).

In my infinite wisdom, I decide to take the cat hostage because cats hate water and my girlfriend isn't a mean person. Not only did I underestimate how cold-hearted my girlfriend can be, but I did so while holding a cat.

Shirtless.

She nails the cat, the cat shreds me to pieces and here I am laying in bed waiting for the stinging to stop from my peroxide shower.

I have no regrets.

EDIT:  TIFU by making the front page.  Now all my Facebook friends know my reddit name.  God damnit.

EDIT 2: Son of EDIT:  To the folks telling me that I'm an animal abuser and shouldn't have animals (not referring to /u/Qwerty2143 stop down voting him)...We do utilize positive reinforcement. The main issue is that we have a Boxer-Pitt mix that we rescued. Poor guy was pretty much attention starved and largely untrained. He's come a long way in the few months we've had him. But when he gets excited all training goes out the window. The only thing he responds to when he gets over stimulated is yelling or a belt in the hand as that was how his previous owner treated him. I'd prefer not to do that. This is also a huge issue when someone comes to the door and he gets aggressive/protective.  A short blast of water snaps him back to reality and he starts listening again. Then come the treats!  Also, get bent you self-righteous drip babies. (Credit goes to /u/Cephalapodus for introducing me to the term "drip baby")

EDIT 3: The EDIT RETURNS: Still no regrets.
