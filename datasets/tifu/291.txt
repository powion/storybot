So last night at Jimmy John's we get a call from some lady who's online order apparently didn't come through for 45 mins. We get the order as she's calling but she doesn't believe us and is all pissed off. About half an hour later we get a a prank call from some kid who asked if our blowjobs are "freaky fast" - 'cause that's funny, right? My coworker suggested we text the kid just to mess with him so I take her phone, get the number, type and send the message "are your blowjobs freaky fast???!" just to kind of mock him. It wasn't even that funny but we were bored so whatever. Then, maybe 10 minutes later we get a call from the first lady and I realize I typed the wrong number in (it was still up on our first phone screen). Apparently she was so offended even after it was explained to her that she needed to talk to our general manager the next day. I come in the next morning  and find out me, the coworker and manager are all getting fired. And it's completely my fault.
