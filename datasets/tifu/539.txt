My job requires me to wear a name badge, but it's a clip on badge that always leaves holes or marks in my clothes. I noticed that other staff members were clipping badges onto lanyards instead so over the weekend I dug out the lanyard I carried around while in college and took off my old keychain that was looped in it. Clipped on the badge, wore it to work this morning, was very pleased with the lack of holes in my chunky sweater. 

So about 45 minutes ago (this happened today Reddit!) my name badge comes off and as I'm fiddling around with it, I put the end of the lanyard into my mouth to chew on. I'm bored, zoned out, then suddenly my mouth starts to burn. It quickly gets worse and I'm sweating. It's at this point I remember that the keychain I'd had on the lanyard was used to hold my pepper spray. The same pepperspray that had been used drunkenly to see how far it would shoot and if it indeed had uv dye. The same pepper spray that had inevitably gotten on the lanyard itself. 

The nature of my job of course is such that I can't leave my post until my break or another staff member relieves me. So twenty minutes later I -- the girl who sometimes thinks pico de gallo is too spicy -- finally am able to wash this awful burning taste out of my mouth. 

Tl;dr: oral fixation leads to pepper spray consumption.
