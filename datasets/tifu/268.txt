Alright. 10 minutes ago I was doing my mom a favor by taking all personal files from my mom's old computer, to her new one. Nothing special, she has zero clues about technology. 
Thing is, she specifies what she want to send to her new computer. 
She said "movies" so i go onto the movies folder to throw the movies over to the USB. Thing is, it's a very old computer, so i doubletap to go into the folder. Accidentally open the first video, sees my mom in a threeway with her ex boyfriend and another lady friend that I grew up with. All of this while my mom's SO watches right beside me. Quicky closes the computer and I quickly walk out of the living room, with the husband being completely silent and my mom doesn't understand what just happened. I'm currently in my room listening to music.

**TL;DR: Cleaning mom's old computer, accidentally finds a porno with my mom, her ex and a woman I grew up with.**
 
Edit 1: currently on a silent train with my GF on my way to my grandparents. Thank you for all of your texts, you've made me laugh, frustrated and terrified!

Edit 2: I'll be out of town for two days, hence no contact with my mother or her SO. Posts an update on Sunday

Edit 3: mandatory HELLO MOM edit. I'd never have this freaking picture in my head without you!

Edit 4: a lot of people ask why I looked at the file. She had two partitions of the HDD, and I didn't know which one contained files so I had to check for it. Also, RIP inbox.

Edit 5: I just got home and I found a note which said "We're off mushroom-picking. Home in a few hours". I think everything's all right and I'll leave this thread now. Thank you for all the replies, both hate &amp; support :)
