I meant it as a joke but her response was "[sister's name] told you??" 

Edit: I thought she might be joking but when I got home today the whole family was there and she was visibly upset. 

Update: We're going to the doctor this week to confirm it but if she is pregnant it's definitely mine. No I'm not actually a bigfatvirgin, don't take my username so seriously. The reason it was such a surprise is because she has one of those birth control implants in her arm (it's called 
Implanon for those asking).

Update #2: Just finished finals so I finally have time to update you guys. She was due to have the implant switched out because it's been a few years since she had it done. A lot of people are bashing her and it bothers me so let me clear things up. She told her sister first because she needed advice and her sister is older (29) and has had 2 kids already. She didn't know if she was preggo but has been feeling sick so her and her sister went to take a pee stick test and it came back positive. She has an appointment with her doctor in a few hours so hopefully that will clear up the situation more. Whether she chooses to keep it or not I'll support her, we are only 21 but I graduate with my CS degree on Friday and I've already got a steady job lined up.
