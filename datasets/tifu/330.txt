So this happened a few years ago, but after reading the post about the Panera guy that derp yelled in Chipotle, it reminded me of this fuck up.

So in high school I was a lifeguard at a local outside pool club during the summer. I worked long hours between 4-6 days a week and would always leave mentally exhausted because we had a crappy management where you would be staring at the pool in one spot for hours at a time. (In training you learn that you're supposed to switch around every 15-30 minutes just to stay refreshed and aware). Anyway, one particularly long shift some kids are literally just being the worst. Breaking all the rules, running around, horseplay, all the crap you need to tell them to stop doing. As I leave, I get a call from my mom telling me to go to grocery store and pick up a few things. So I decide to just go directly from work to the store in my lifeguard attire. As I'm walking down the produce isle looking at lettuce, I see a flash of movement out of the corner of my eye and turn to see a kid full on running down the isle. My brain suddenly derps and goes back into lifeguard mode and I yell "WALK!!!" in the most commanding, loud voice. The kid stops like a deer in headlights and looks terrified which is pretty much what I looked like after I realized what I did. Then I look over and find the mom absolutely glaring at me exuding the most angry nonverbals I've ever seen. I'm standing there red-faced and dumbfounded and the only thing I could think to say was "I'm a lifeguard". I then put my head down and finished shopping as quickly as possible.

TL;DR Lifeguarded the hell out of a grocery store.

EDIT: My first Front Page post would be a TIFU haha. Thank you all for enjoying my embarrassment.
