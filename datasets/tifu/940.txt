Welp... This happened this morning and as you can expect, I'm waiting for a call into the HR office.

I was busy meeting with a vendor of ours in the conference room talking about some products we need to purchase when our mid-60's super sweet purchasing lady pops her head in the door and asks "Hey Rated-M, do you have a sec when you are done in here to stop and see me?" As I was deep in conversation with this vendor I answered in complete autopilot with my typical shit eating grin "Sure Ann, I'm happy to give you all the secs you need as soon as I finish up here." 

My brain then caught up to what I just said. She had a look of disgust on her face I couldn't describe if I tried as she stomped off back to her office. I turn back to the vendor I was meeting with to find him trying his best to hold back from laughing. Needless to say, the meeting ended there, and I haven't stopped at Ann's office yet.

TL;DR - Apparently I want to have lots of secs with sweet older purchasing lady

Update - So I got called to HR at 4:00pm today to have a discussion. The HR manager totally understood that it was a completely honest mistake, but mentioned that Ann doesn't see it that way. To make Ann happy I am getting sent to a workplace sensitivity training sometime next month. Better than getting fired I guess! (edited a second time to move update to the bottom)
