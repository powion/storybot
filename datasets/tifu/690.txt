This happened like 5 minutes ago. I (male) work with cousin (female) at a family business. We have a water cooler in the office that had just run out. As I got up to leave the office, she shouted "remember you need to fill the water butt up!". I immediately responded with "I'll fill YOUR butt up". I'm hiding in the kitchen and I might have to quit work from embarrassment. Oh god.

EDIT: Morning! Just a few things, for the sake of clarity;
1, at the risk of losing all this precious, precious karma, I don't want to do butt stuff with my cousin, it was just me being "funny" and firing back a reply that I would normally reserve for a friend.
2, by "water butt" I mean "the water bottle", it just sometimes gets called that around the office because it is similar to an actual water butt.
3, no pictures of my cousin ya damn dirty apes.
Anyways, she'll be in work in like 2 hours, so we'll see how it goes!

Edit number 2: It hasn't been mentioned all day. Sweeping it under the rug like nothing ever happened. Dealing with it in the correct, british way.
