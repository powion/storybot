So basically cheque came and I was super happy , so I wanted to tell my mom about it.

Which in hindsight is where is my first fuck up is because my 50+ year old Somali mom thinks that any making money on the internet is secretly a scam to steal all of our personal information (Run by the Jamaicans) .

Realizing that I fucked up by even mentioning money and internet in the same sentence , I attempted calmly walk away before she got curious. 

She got curious. 

I immediately responded with "Hooyo(mom) you are going to misinterpret what I'm going to say and we are gonna have a stupid argument"

She chuckles and responds with "Im not that much of an immigrant"

So I gave her the benefit of the doubt and explained I signed up with a network a few months back and did all the paperwork on my own (since I just turned 18). She was cool with it at first and asked how ad revenue works , I explained its based on how many people watch.

She asked if anyone in our neighbourhood(shitty) could watch it , I just said "Its open for everyone to see and that yeah **someone I know could see it** ". 

Noticing she is getting a bit upset , I tried to end the conversation. 

*Side Note* : My mom kept me inside alot as a kid because she assumed the kids in my area were a bad influence and even at 18 them watching me tell jokes online was a huge nono that could lead to be selling drugs. (actual thing she said)

But again she calmed down and asked about the paperwork when I signed up for my network. Knowing that if I bailed now she'll assume the worst and I'd be fucked , I told he about how filled out a W8 form (cause Im in Canada)  for the IRS using **my SIN ** and some other things along those lines. 

I'm screaming internally waiting for the oncoming storm but she replies with "So is there a limit to how much you make ?" and said "Nope , just depends if enough people watch. **Think of it like Commission** "

Im fucking amazed that my mom is actually believing in me instead of making up the usual batshit insane tinhat theory of crime and identity theft.


But I was wrong , *she just felt a little slow about it today*

#SO

So the the three magic nails in my coffin appear " **someone I know could see it** "  , " **my SIN ** " and the fucking stupidest one " **Think of it like Commission** "

" *I see it now *  The people in our neighbourhood told you could make money online with dumb videos but they really just wanted your SIN so they could steal your identity and make money off your work so they told it was commission so you'd be okay with getting such a low amount."

At this point I've given up hope BUT! We had to pray so that bought me some few moments of peace before what I was expecting to be a beating.

But Nope , no beating instead I came upstairs to my computer/mic/monitor being thrown downstairs all while hearing my Mom wail "YOU RUINED OUR LIVES YOU SOLD ALL OF ID" "YOU SO STUPID HOW COULD YOU NOT SEE IT" "HOW COULD AN IDIOT THAT CAN BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF SO BADLY BE MY SON" and worst part was I knew she was so mad that anything I will be misinterpreted so i took my computer into my room (because mic and monitor are fucked now)
and checked if it worked.

I took our old kind of broken TV from the basement and tried to use it as a monitor to see if the comp worked , I got a black screen at first but then realized that only my GPU broke (RIP my shitty Radeon 7800 ,you served me well :'c ).

So currently in my room with the door locked with a now worse computer and no mic. So also RIP my Youtube channel.

**TL;DR** Immigrant Mom saves child from Gambling Let's Play slave ring by destroying his mic monitor and Graphics card.
