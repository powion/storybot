So this happened last night. I went out for a meal with some friends then went back to drink at theirs. A lot of drinking occurred. At about 2am I realised that I was pretty much unable to focus on what was going on around me so promptly got a taxi home.

Now, the fuck up. I was starving, and my incoherent brain wanted pizza, I vaguely remembered a dominos deal going on so I grab my laptop. I order a large mighty meaty, then change my mind. I change my order to a tandoori hot. Then a pepperoni passion, then a texas BBQ, then a sizzler. This went on for a while. When I finally settled on one, I sat on the sofa and went to sleep.

This morning I wake up to 7 missed calls and texts from an unknown number, and flatmates woken up by knocking at 4am. I missed the order. I'm pretty annoyed but hey its Â£10 right? Wrong. I ordered 8 large pizzas, thinking I was changing it each time. I then slept through the delivery and never saw the delicious pizzas.

This is quite possibly the single worst thing that has ever happened.
