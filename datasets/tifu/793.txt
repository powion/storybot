Obligatory "this didn't happen today, it happened a few months ago".

A little background: I'm from a North-African country (Tunisia, to be more specific). Our mother tongue is Arabic and French is our second language.

During summer, me and two of my very close friends decided to go to a hotel and spend the day drinking and swimming. 
Everything went as planned and we were having a good time. We had a few beers and started hitting on some girls by the pool.

Here's where the FU started. Instead of speaking Arabic the whole time and being who we are, I decided to lie to those hot girls and told them we were French. My friends had to go along with it.
We were having the time of our lives when we heard a huge fucking explosion. "BOOM" followed by 10 seconds of silence and then everyone lost their mind. 

Everyone was running for cover and we didn't know what to do so we got inside the hotel and stayed there waiting for police to come. Our brains didn't realize what happened so we were still speaking French and pretending to be fucking tourists.

Here's where the FU happened. Police arrived at the scene and started talking to everyone in there and making sure no one got hurt. When they spoke to us, we were still speaking French and told them we were tourists (we didn't have IDs or passports with us). No one bought it so they took us in. 

We went to the police station wearing nothing but some shorts and they started interrogating us. We were still drunk at that time and continued to speak French. They couldn't know who we are so they assumed we were trying to blow up the place or giving information about the tourists inside. FML. 

Long story short, even after telling them who we were, they were still trying to find something that would link us to the other suspects. We had to stay in custody for 5 days. And that's how TIFU, reddit. 


TL;DR: Spoke in French, ended up in custody and being mistaken for a terrorist.
