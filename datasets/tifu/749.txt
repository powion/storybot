This happened a few years back as teenagers.

So me and my friend agreed to help his dad at his allotment (a small patch of land where people like to grow fruit and veg and store porn in their sheds)
It was a typical English summers day (cloudy with light drizzle).
After we were done pulling weeds and sweeping leaves and mud away, I look over to see my friend holding on to an electricity pylon with both hands. On a second look I can see him shaking quite violently. 
Panic and adrenalin kick in. I am convinced I am watching my friend die in front of me from an electric shock. I scramble into the shed and find a thick broom. I sprint out with tears in my eyes coming to terms he is already dead. I sprint over with the broom over my head (looking like Gandalf at the end of ROTK) and bring it crashing down on both his arms in an attempt to save him from a crispy death. The crack I hear is not from an electrical discharge but it's both his arms fracturing as he crumples to the floor calling me a cunt.

TL;DR My mate was shaking mud from his boots so I broke both his arms thinking he was receiving an electric shock from a pylon.

EDIT - Front page on my birthday! Thanking you

A few people calling me out on BS? This happened 14 years ago. I'm sure I'm not the first or last to make a similar mistake. I can't do much more to convince you this is genuine

2nd EDIT - Sorry this didn't happen today. 14 years ago I was still using MSN messenger and Facepic. I'm fairly new to the Reddit party (but I brought beer)

Final edit: Cheers for Gold!
