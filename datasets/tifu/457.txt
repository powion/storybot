Ok so today was a pretty normal day. I woke up at 7Am cleaned myself up, collected a kiss from my mum and went to school. Mum was ready for work too. School was fun, beside the never-changing fact, that this fat kid next to me in class just wont FREAKING stop eating and tear my nerves. So schools out, me going to the school bus, the buslady Telling me that i should wait here because my dad later picks me up for what ever reason she didnt know. So i waited. Finally he arrived, tells me to get in and just shut the fuck up. I was shocked didnt know what to say but did what he said. So he obviously was pretty pissed staring at the road didnt say anything at all. I said: dad.. he said:could you  JUST be quiet please...i said: ok...So we arrived at home and then i couldnt believe what i saw. I just  remembered that candlelight i forgot to kill, before going to school. My parents knew i always let the candlelight in my room on. And they knew.. 

The House was half Burned down with the firemen killing the Rest of the fire.

So how was your day?

Sidenote : Actually  the same thing happened to a friend of mine a couple of years ago, two of his turtles and one or so cats caught fire and eventually died. But it wasnt his fault. It was his legless, depressed mum who I think let a cigarette on, and dropped in the kitchen and my friend picked her up, and then the flathome burned down or so.. im not sure though.
