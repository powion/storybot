Last week I went for a walk in the forest. The next day, when I was in bed, my legs started itching. I turned on the light and discovered two tiny little fucking disgusting ticks just chilling there, trying to deprive me of blood that I would prefer to keep myself. I felt a bit panicky, because of Lyme disease. To prevent getting this disease it is important to removes the ticks ASAP, preferably within twenty-four hours. My walk was twenty-six hours ago. I removed the ticks and proceeded to check the rest of my body for ticks. I got a bit paranoid and started to feel an itch in my butt crack. I discovered it is very hard to examine your own butt crack. (LPT: put mirror on laundry basket, squat over it, shine with torch in the area of darkness…) I then saw a black blob about 2 mm in diameter next to my b-hole. Shit, a tick that sucked itself full of blood in an area that I couldn’t quite reach. I proceeded to panic, because I wanted this fucker out of my body. Even though I felt embarrassed to the max, I decided it was essential to wake up my mum so she could help me. An awkward wake-up session later and my grumpy mum is bending over my ass to remove from there: a piece of dried-up poo. 

TL; DR my mom discovered I don’t wipe properly. 

Edit: Peeps are saying it's nonsense that I can't reach my ass. True, I can reach but not with the precision needed to take out a tick. It has to be done in a certain way, so the head is not left behind...

Edit2: Thanks for all the butt wiping tips. Also it seems removing the head matters less then I thought. TIL
