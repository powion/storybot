This happened on Saturday and I still feel like shit from it.

 **Minor spoiler below.**

So Saturday was the anniversary of my fiance's mother's death. It is still really raw so this day is a pretty sad one. We decided to take it easy and relax that night instead of going out. I suggest we watch a movie and what movie do I suggest? Fucking Guardians of the Galaxy. Neither of us have seen it before and had no knowledge of any character's back story. 

For those of you who haven't seen it and don't care about a spoiler, [Spoiler](/s "Chris Pratt's character's mother dies in the first 5 minutes of the movie.")

I didn't think they would just kill her like 30 seconds into the scene on camera. I figured we would just know she died but god damn was I wrong. I just sat there in disbelief that it happened. She gets up, goes into another room, and is obviously upset. Needless to say I have only seen 5 minutes of Guardians of the Galaxy.







God damn it.
