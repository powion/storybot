First off this happened yesterday but I was a bit injured so I couldn't write this. Anyways let's just get right to it. 

So every morning as I get ready for school I shower because personal hygiene is a good thing. This particular morning I was a bit sluggish so I was getting clumsy. I went to take my underwear off and the big toe on my right foot got caught in my underwear and I fell over head first into the door. The next thing I know I am butt ass naked laying in my bathroom with my mom on the phone with 911. She is freaking the fuck out and I quote, "HE IS NAKED ON THE GROUND UNCONSCIOUS! I DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED JUST PLEASE COME!" So the ambulance comes and wind up going to the Emergency Room in just my underwear. Now I am being tested for a concussion. 

TL;DR: My underwear tried to kill me. 

Edit: Holy shit just got back from going out and this blew up. Also there was no injury I was just a bit banged up. 

Edit 2: For clarification, I was not going to school but showering to keep clean. Sorry for confusion. I know yesterday was Saturday, I forgot since my head is jumbled up.
