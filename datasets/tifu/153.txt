Throwaway acct. 

When I was 7, an older cousin informed me that it was common courtesy to, after using a public restroom for #2, leave a one-wipe size amount of toilet paper around the handicap bar so the next person would have one ready when they go.

Now 22, first big boy job, do this every day in the public bathroom. Think all of my coworkers are rude for not leaving me any. Someone sent an email around requesting the courtesy paperer (me) to stop wasting paper. I reply "what about courtesy paper" to emailer, at which point I discover that I was duped for 15 years. 


Also, whenever I spotted courtesy paper, I happily used it for 15 years. 

Say what you will Reddit.
