So this actually happened yesterday. My husband and I were making dinner and started play-fighting. I tried to pinch hus butt, he pinned my arm and started tickling me, and I went to slap him lightly on the cheek. As my hand was approaching his face, I suddenly remembered I've been growing my nails, and they're long enough to do some damage. I didn't want to hurt him! So did i stop my hand? Of course not...it was too close to stop the contact, so I did what any sane person would do. I curled my fingers in so they wouldn't scratch him....into a fist...

and punched my husband in the face.
