Just did this. In a waiting room with limited seats and other patrons randomly disbursed. A mom and her son walk in. I have an empty seat on their side of me, so I slide over so they can sit next to eachother. She gives me an odd look and says, "thank you, but we will sit over here." So I look at the seat I just offered to her child... it's not a seat... it's a trash can. 

TL;DR I politely offered for a child to be thrown away.
