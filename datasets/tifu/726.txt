I meant to post this yesterday!

--------------------------------------------------------
  I am a high schooler and we have a weekly test in geometry. The person with the highest score on this test gets to bring in a board game of his/her choice to play with whomever they like during class on a day chosen by the teacher.

 Anyways, it was my day. I have always been a HUGE fan of the game 'Jenga!' The game of falling towers. So, I chose to bring this game to school on my designated day.

9-10-12
 My teacher tells me my day will be tomorrow due to her being absent Wednesday. I thank her and finish my work.

9-11-12
 Without thinking I walk into the classroom, with 'Jenga!', on 9/11...
 I'm muslim.
