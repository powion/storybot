I often play a game with my son where we have a martial arts duel with various fruits and vegetables. For example, i'd be throwing grapes as if they were ninja stars, and he'd be defending with a cucumber samurai sword. It's just one of those strange family traditions I guess. 

Anyway, last night I was preparing dinner and enjoying a few glasses of wine. I felt in my element chopping potatoes when suddenly I was struck in the side of my face by a celery stick. I jumped around in battle mode while letting out a war cry. Unfortunately I didn't put my knife down before this flailing maneuver and ended up slicing my son's hand open. He screamed, I screamed. The doctor reported me to child services. 

EDIT: I'm his mother for goodness' sake.
