Now, this may cause some transatlantic confusion, but Faggots is the name of a popular dish where I'm from - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faggot_(food)

Anyway, last week I bought a pack of Mr Brain's Frozen Pork Faggots (along with some marrowfat peas, of course), and as I have Thursday (today at the time of writing) completely off from Uni, I was going to have them as a little treat. Here's a picture - http://uk-img1.ciao.com/iuk/images/products/normal/376/product-5303376.jpg

Unfortunately they take a good while to cook in the oven, so I preheat it for 10 minutes and then put them in for 45 (as per the cooking instructions). I live in a three storey house (not that big, it's actually quite narrow) with some other students, and was upstairs in my bedroom as my food was cooking.

I had heard good things about Bob's Burgers, so I was watching the first few episodes when the smell started to waft from my dreams and into my nostrils. I ran downstairs and, thinking I was alone in the house, shouted "Mmm-mmm! It sure smells like Faggots in here!"

My housemate was sitting on the sofa.

His Spanish boyfriend was in the kitchen.

Now, I have nothing against homosexuality. If two consenting adults want to do the moist macarena, then I don't really care about the configuration.

My housemate (from that London), although initially horrified, understood the misunderstanding. The Spaniard, however, went ballistic. They are a fast talking people when relaxed, so you can imagine the speed at which he was undoubtedly spreading half-truths about my mother. One of the few Spanish words I know is 'puta', so I understood, like, 30% of what he was all up in my face about. Eventually, my housemate managed to calm him down, but the Spanish Stink-Eye is a terrifying thing to suffer.


Edit: I was robbed of fuck up of the week. ROBBED!!! http://i.imgur.com/ys1OVpa.gif
