I still feel like a huge jerk

I'm 34 years old and I teach Grade 10/11 History. School here started last week and obviously the first weekend just finished. I was in last period with my Grade 10 advanced class, and I asked them how their first weekend of the new school year was. No one raised their hand so I randomly chose a boy in the back of the class. "It was awful" he replied. I decided to say in a joking voice "Well anything is better than being at school, right?" He went silent for a few seconds and said in a low voice, "Well, my dog passed away on saturday and my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer, but I guess that's better than school, right?" The room went dead silent, and I had to leave the room for a few minutes.
