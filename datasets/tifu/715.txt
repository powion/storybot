So, I work for IRD, the equivalent of IRS in the United States, and I have 30 sick days a year. I haven't taken any sick days in the past 2 years of me working there. I thought, "Hey, why not?" So I decided to have a day off. 
I had a great sleep in, and I thought it would be a nice idea to smoke some pot. I smoked multiple bongs and got a strange call, from my fucking boss. 
She asked my why I wasn't at work, and out of quick &amp; stoned thinking. I came up with the conclusion that I should say I have bronchitis. 

But instead, the words that came out of my mouth were, "I'm in bed, I have brontosaurus." 

I now have to attend a disciplinary meeting, this Wednesday.

TLDR: I took a day off and now I'm in a disciplinary meeting.
