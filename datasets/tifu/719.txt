Took out my sim card because my phone was having problems with some updates, so I figured I'd take it out and put it back in and maybe then the updates would start. Well, I did all of this in the kitchen and in between taking it out and putting it back in I spotted some Larry the cable guy chips. Now if you've ever had them you know those shits are delicious(and very bad for you), I needed some right then. Sim card is in one hand, reach in for the chips with the other, my mind is no longer on the sim and I then transfer the chips to my simcard hand without thinking about it,toss them into my mouth and eat them. Soon after when getting back to my update  the sim card was missing..no..i didn't just..i just ate my fucking sim card. Goddamn you larry. Goddamn you. I don't know what to do now. I had phone numbers on there. 

*edit. found most of my numbers backed up in my google contacts so I've got that going for me which is nice
