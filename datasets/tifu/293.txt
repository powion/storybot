I met a guy online, and we have been talking/snapping/texting for about two weeks. Our first date was supposed to be Friday, but he really wanted to meet me, so I agreed to meet him at his house once I got off work (at midnight.) I pull up to his house, and his mother (I wasn't aware that he lived with her) came out and told me that I shouldn't be showing up at her house to fornicate with her son in the middle of the night. As I was turning to leave, he comes out and apologizes for her behavior, and tells me that she's just looking out for him. He then says that they had had quite a few drinks. As he was explaining that she acts insane when she's drunk, not to mind her, he suddenly throws up all over me. I had to drive home covered in puke.   


EDIT: Wow, front page. I didn't realize my massive fuck up was that massive. Also, I have learned my lesson. No, I did not go to his house with even the intention of going inside. It was supposed to be talking for a bit, and then I go home. Thanks for all the concern, but I do understand how stupid of a move I made. The vomit taught me a lesson.

EDIT: Gold?! Thanks! Good to know my awful experience has made a lot of you laugh. I am laughing with you. :)
