So unlike most TIFUs this actually happened today, though I wish it hadn't.
Things were getting pretty hot and heavy in the bedroom, when I decided it was his turn to be taken care of. I started giving him a blowjob, that's when he decided he wanted things to be rougher tonight. He shoved my head down forcefully onto his dick once, gag reflex protested so I pulled my head away. Gave it a second and started going at it again, and he does the same thing. Now I don't mind if that's what he wants, I'm all about pleasing him in the bedroom, but we had just eaten not long before that and something about a dick being jammed down my throat doesn't make my stomach sit well. And protest my stomach did. I threw up. Right out of my nose, not a whole lot, but enough. I look up to see he noticed anything, nothing, just slack jawed "gettin my dick sucked" bliss on his face. I decide I can't ruin this, and more than anything I can't tell him... How exactly do I fix this?!
My mind is racing when I come up with an idea. A terrible terrible idea. I ate it, Reddit. I ate my puke off of his stomach to avoid having to tell him I threw up on him. I fucking ate it. I will never have any self respect again.
