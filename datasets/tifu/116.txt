A few days ago, I read a joke on Reddit. The way I interpreted it (completely literally), it was slightly inappropriate, but still amusing. 

In a rare attempt to be the "cool mom", I decided to share it with my kids (14 and 10) on the way to school. 

Me: Hey kids, I have a funny, but slightly inappropriate joke. Think you can handle it? Haha. 

Both rolled their eyes since my jokes are generally of the benign Dad variety. 

Me: Why did Barbie never have kids? 

Blank stares. 

Me: Because Ken came in *(my brain: oh shit, I get it now, punch out,  punch out, PUNCH OUT!)* a different... (mumble) box... 

Cue shocked, disgusted look from the 14 year old and utter confusion from the 10 year old. I tried to play it off,   without success. 

I think I'll stick with the silly dad puns from now on.
