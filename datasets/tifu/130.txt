This is a repost. I posted it in the thread about tinder dates and I was a bit late. It has stopped gaining points but I am getting a dozen messages a day from people encouraging me to post it here. I hope that's okay :-) 

*disclaimer; this did not happen today.


--------------------------------------------------

okay... this is gonna be strange.


I use a wheel-chair, as a result of a car accident. I'm paralyzed from the waist down. I can't really "feel" anything below my nipples. I can move my hands/arms just fine.



I went on Tinder and made sure my pictures showed the wheel-chair. I've had bad experiences with online dating and rude/mean remarks regarding my wheelchair, during a date. So I always make sure they know upfront.


Well. One day. I get a message and this chic is really into my profile, the movies and shows I listed, the music I listed, and digs my pictures. She says she's a nurse and doesn't judge people by their "abilities"

...CHA-CHING



I pretty much do everything in my power to keep talking to this woman. Let's call her Jizzanthapuss. I talk to her everyday for a week. We say good morning and good night and talk throughout the day. It gets down-right obsessive, on both of our parts. On my part, mainly because I wanted some booty and it had been a while. I was willing to work for it.

**yada yada yada**

I meet Jizzanthapuss for our first date and it goes well. Very well. I think I might have found "the one" -- I tell my mother during our weekly long distance phone calls.

**yada yada yada**

a month has gone by, we've went on a couple of dates, and we talk every day -- practically every minute. I might be in love with Jizzanthapuss.

**Yada yada yada**
She asks why not come over to watch a movie?
I agree, and when I get there, I quickly discover her room-mate has left for the weekend. Yes, thank you sweet sexy baby jesus. I am alone with her. In her apartment. Watching a movie.

I stay in my wheelchair and just get close to the couch and put my arm around her shoulder, slightly squeezing every now and then.

I notice she is getting fidgety, looking around, and sneaking glances at me. I realize she wants me to make a move.

So I tell her to move over and I hop off my chair and onto the couch.


**TIME ELAPSES**

The appropriate time has elapsed, she is still close to me and reacting favorably to the advances. It is now time for me to grab a boob. I slide my hand which was on her shoulder -- down a bit, and grab a titty. I smile.


Now. Let me tell you. I'm in my mid-20's, I've had plenty of sexual experience before. but never like this.

She quickly flicked my arm away from her boob, in a violent manner, which almost worried me because I thought she was offended...

but before I could finish the thought, she aggressively grabs me and begins to make-out. All aggressive-like, did I mention that? It's pretty hot, I kind of like her taking control. Yes! Jizzanthapuss, you're in charge now!


Now, at this point, she says my wheel-chair is in the way and wheels it to the opposite side of the room, then comes back and sits on my lap-facing me, slips off her bra with one quick professionally graceful flick. Her bewbs flop out and I forget how to math and read.


She then slips off my pants, and begins to ride me as she pinches my nipples. Technically I'm not suppose to feel my nipples, but boy did my nipples hurt from all the tugging.


**Here's where things take a turn for strange-land**

 Now, let me explain. I can't feel anything below my nipples, but, my body does give me signs. For example, if I were to sit on sharp toothpick facing upwards, or if a rock got into my shoe -- I wouldn't be able to tell what/where exactly it is that there is pain. But my body gives me a sign (for example; a unique type of tingling) which I've come to understand and associate as the new feeling my body has improvised to inform me of pain. I've come to understand the new feelings I get; for pain, for going to the bathroom, for being uncomfortable, for needing to get off my butt from too much sitting. Etc etc. And when I get these feelings, I need to do something about it ASAP.



So, back to the apartment where I have b00bz flopping in my face, this tall chic riding me, and I'm practically in heaven. She asks me to bite her, and I do. Harder, she demands, and I comply.


Then, I notice a surge of numbness and tingling. It then turns into the kind of feeling which I've come to associate with pain. Very bad pain.


But fuck this, I'm getting some ass. And titties are all up in my face as I bite and suck her nipples.

Let me die here! I'll ignore the pain. Fuck it! fuck it! Fuck me Jizzanthapuss!


then, I can't ignore it anymore. It soon turns into the kind of sensation where I know I need to do something ASAP. Its too painful.

Furthermore, another tell-tale sign, I begin to sweat profusely on my left side. It's like a water-fountain, it begins dripping.


All the mean-while, Jizzanthapuss is really into it, moaning and being louder than anyone I've ever been with.


Eventually, I simply can't take it anymore, the discomfort is too much. And try to push her away gently (both hands on shoulders, slight push backwards) so as to see if maybe her weight on my lap is what's causing the pain.


But she resists my push, she's like a solid rock. I can't get her to budge.


She grabs a hold of my hair and yanks it back while riding me and tugging on my nipples.

Now.. I have a lot of neuropathic pain. I don't like pain. I live with it 24/7. I understand some people have "different" sexual appetites and desires and kinks. However, you need to communicate. You can't just start introducing pain and hope it'll be cool.


I giggle nervously and tell her to "take it easy, a bit"
She then slaps me so hard, and out of nowhere. I did not expect it, at all, not even a little bit. You know that feeling? when you're blind-sided and someone just knocks you in the head? 


Her open-handed slap reached my forehead and everything went white for a second.

Now I'm more pissed than confused.

The pain is still there.

I scream at her. "What the fuck!?" and shove her off me and she plops down next to me on the couch.


Now that she's off me, I can see my left thigh is completely covered in blood. My first thought was she might have perioded'ed all over me. But why would I be in pain, then?


I look over at her and she's holding a black push-pin which is covered in blood.


I quickly put two and two together and conclude that those surges of pain had been from when she was stabbing my thigh with the pin.


She then gets up and sits on my wheelchair (which is at the other side of the room now)

I watch her for another minute (or 20?) and say "what the fuck was that? I mean, I'm into kinky shit, but what the fucken fuck? and why would you stab me with a fucking pin? you're fucking sick, why wouldn't you communicate with me about that first?"


she casually says "I dunna" and starts playing with her legs, as she sits nude, on my wheelchair. Stretching them, pointing her toes at me, like a baby who just discovered her legs. Was she mocking me?

Finally, having had enough, and having soaked in the situation and concluded it wasn't a dream...

I tell her I'd like to leave. And to please bring my wheel-chair. I'm in pain and would like to tend to my wound and go home.
She looks at me and says, dead serious "beg me for it"
for what, I ask?


She asks me to beg for the wheel-chair.


At this point I begin to truly get scared. I've known this chic for a month, and here I am; alone, naked, scared, and bleeding in her apartment on her couch. As she sits 15 feet away from me, nude, on my wheel-chair, and mocking me. Why didn't I tell anyone about her? why didn't I tell anyone I was here? am I gonna die?


I then shove my ego up my ass, and beg her to bring my wheelchair closer. Each round of begging, she brings the chair a bit closer. Until finally I was able to quickly lean forward and grab onto the leg part of the frame.

She hops off and goes into the bedroom, leaving the door open, and seductively looking back at me with an invitation sexy smirk.

I quickly ponder whether or not I should go to the bedroom and let her have her way with me. Sure this is wierd, strange, scary, and uncalled for; but she's got a vagina that I have an invitation to play with.


I decide, against my brain's many protests, that I should leave right away.

I pull up my pants, hop on my wheel-chair, and just wheel the fuck right out of there.


This incident... It kind of ruined sex for me. Because now I need to be dominated, verbally humiliated, and have my nipples clamped -- before I can even think about maybe cumming.

**TL;DR** Met a girl on Tinder, Chatted her up, went on a few dates, all is splendid. Then I go to her house to watch a movie and have some sexy time. Sexy time ensues and I discover she's a freak who enjoys pain, domination, and blood. 


**Edit#1** 
I don't consider this to be a rape. The sex was consensual, and save for the first time I tried to move her away and her not budging -- the next time I shoved her off she did move and the sex did stop. The first time I didn't shove her off it was more of a "can u plz move" request/push which she kindly shot down.


I'd classify it more as an assault.



**Edit#2**
Due to popular request from this thread. I decided to go report this at the police station. I brought a camera with me and recorded how it went.

**Edit#3**
srsly, though. I've decided to make an report to the ONA (ontario nurses association) just to warn them about her character and to recommend they look into whether she is abusing patients as she may be preying upon the disabled.


**Edit#4**
thanks to everyone for the kind words about my writing style. I really  consider myself a writer but have had writer's block for the longest time. It's lame but getting the compliments has reinforced my belief that I ought to continue my writing no matter what. Perhaps I'll turn this into a misery-esque "based on a true story" short novel.
