Literally happened 10 minutes ago. 

I was watching the video that's currently at the top of r/videos entitled "A black man's view that goes against the grain of pop culture. Logic versus racism."

I was also texting my brother. My palms sometimes get sweaty (will become relevant).

The guy in the video was making some amazing points, a wonderful reprieve from the circlejerk of ignorance on Facebook. 

At certain points in the video I would say "YES! good point!" 

My excitement built up into a crescendo when I finally gestured with both hands towards the screen and said "THANK YOU FOR-"

And then my phone slipped from my hands, hit the screen of my laptop, and busted it. I sat in awe of my own idiocy, and then made this post.

Edit: I am not a smart man, but y'all are some equally hilarious motherfuckers. Thanks so much to all who have been giving me info on how to replace my screen!!
