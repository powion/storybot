On the train on my daily morning commute I met my former teacher who was currently chatting with another middle aged woman I'd never seen before, but I just sat down with them and casually joined the conversation. At some point stranger asks my former teacher: "BTW did you know that X and Y are getting married?" â€“ both X and Y being former classmates of mine. And without further reflection I articulate what's been word on the street for a while: "ah yeah, that's because X is pregnant heh." Silence. Dumbfounded and sort of sore, stranger turns to me: "Oh good that **I** get to know that too!" Turns out stranger is X's mother -.-
