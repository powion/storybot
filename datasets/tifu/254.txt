So this happened around a month ago, but I only just gained enough confidence to post it here. I'm a 6'3 18 year old from Sydney, and my 5 year old cousin and I like to take walks along the boardwalk at Darling Harbour. During these walks he likes to drop behind me a bit, and then run up to me. When I hear him coming, I spin around and grab him, spinning my cousin through the air and back down in front of me. Anyway, I heard my little cousin running up behind me, so I turned around and swung him up into the air... Only to hear (mid-swing), a raspy voice exclaim: "Put me down you giant fuck!"
I saw the little person. Everything went into slow motion, and at the arc of the swing, I let go, causing him to eat the boardwalk. Needless to say he wasn't very happy and I had an angry crowd demanding I explain myself.

Tl;dr - mistook a little person for my 5 year old cousin, swung and accidentally threw him much to his distaste.

Edit: Holy shit, I did not expect this to blow up overnight, thank you all! And whoever the amazing soul was that gifted me gold, please contact me so I can thank you properly.
Also, thank you for letting me come home and laugh my arse off at these comments/puns. I love you, people of Reddit.
