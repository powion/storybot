This is not a fucking joke or a god damn game.  I ate 3 boxes of "Fiber one bars" as my exclusive food due to extreme laziness in the last 2 days and I cannot even understand how much I am fucking farting.  This is beyond insanity, and I am NOT exaggerating.  I am farting at least 2 loud boisterous farts out of my ass per 1 minute.  I have been farting incessantly for the last 18 hours.  I want to die, it's like I'm inhaling through my mouth and exhaling through my ASS.  Continuous loud yelling moans are destroying my asshole.

I know this is a bold claim, but if you don't believe it, try it yourself - you will regret.  This is worse than the time I ate an entire box of sugar free cookies.
