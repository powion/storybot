So 4 years ago i bought the Star Wars mmo called something along the lines of The Old Republic. Shortly after the release it turned free to play but you were still able to subscribe at a monthly cost, which would grant you something called cartel coins. I was absolutely certain that i had turned off my subscription (i was 13 at the time) but as it turns out my older brother wanted to play the game today for some reason, he then burst out laughing telling me that ive got around 29.000 Cartel coins (The real money currency) just for the sake of scale 5000 Cartel coins cost around 55 dollars. 
TL:DR i wasted around 320 dollars on a game subscription that i did not even know that i had acquired 

Edit- you were supposed to make me feel good about myself not make me sad
