When I was in high school years ago, my girlfriend and I would often fool around on the couch in her parents living room. Her parents would always go upstairs to watch TV in the evening, so this worked out perfectly for us. During this one particular evening, we both ended up falling asleep with half our clothes off (unintentionally) and slept right through until the morning. I was shocked to wake up the next morning to the sound of her Dad's footsteps upstairs. I threw my clothes on in record time and tried to run out of the house but that plan did not succeed. I did make it as far as the front door just as her Dad was coming down the stairs. Her Dad is clearly surprised to see me. He slowly says to me: "Oh, hello Kangar, what are you doing here?" OK, it was 5:30 in the morning, so this is what comes out of my mouth. I say: "Oh, hi Mr. Jones, I'm just going out fishing for the day, and thought I would come say hello to Susan first." To my great astonishment, HE BUYS THIS EXPLANATION. He smiles, wishes me good luck fishing, and goes to read the morning paper. Susan told me that years later she told her Mom this story, and the two of them still laugh at her Dad for falling for this.

Edit: To all those who continue to send me hate mail about how my TIFU post wasn't actually today: Take 30 seconds of your life and actually go and read the subreddit's rules and regulations. Particularly Rule 1a.  Jesus.
