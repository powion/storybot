This was about [ten years ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/2iodmt/user_takes_the_title_of_today_i_fucked_up/), first proper job out of college working for a 60 person company that fixed and resold servers. I had just got my own workstation alongside the guy who trained me in. He was a nice and super strait laced old dude, the wildest thing he did was eat a chocolate bar around 3pm every day. 

Knocking off time for him was 4:30 and I'd finish around 5. One day around 4:15 I look over and he's nodding off at his desk. Personally I have no issue with a quick nap at work so I keep an eye out for the boss and let him at it. By 4:30 he's fast asleep, but it's his home time so I go to wake him up and he's mad groggy, looking at me almost like he's drunk saying "what's the problem?". I decide to let him sleep it off for another little while. 

About twenty minutes later, when I'm not looking, the boss comes over and tries to wake him up. Then he goes and gets the first aid guy. They half walk half carry him to the canteen and get him to eat his chocolate bar (apparently he was busy and missed his 3pm sugar fix for his hypoglycemia) while they call his wife to come pick him up.

So yeah, that was the day I covered for someone as they started to fall into a diabetic coma at their desk.

EDIT: Added a link for anyone complaining about the fuck up being ten years ago (read rule 1).
