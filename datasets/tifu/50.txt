I downloaded it for him and put it on a USB so he could watch it when he had some downtime. So he watched it tonight and when I got back in, I asked him what he thought. 

"Really good, but quite confusing at times though, took quite a bit of effort to understand the direction but it wasn't impossible"

I knew something wasn't quite right. My dad is an intelligent man - he should be understanding this film with no problems whatsoever. I projected my disbelief to him - 

"The plot is good, it's a good film! I don't know how that wasn't apparent to you?!"

He replied: "It was just quite unclear at times with the dialogue, the script was definitely lacking, which was a shame because it could have been really good!"

I was still heavily confused - most people who have seen this film would agree it's engaging and exciting. I could not see what the problem was. 

I took the USB stick back and plugged it into my laptop and I decided to watch it again for the hell of it. 

Then I realised.

The download didn't have hardcoded subtitles. 

**The man literally sat there watching apes grunt at eachother for the best part of 2 hours without a fucking clue what they were saying.** 

Sorry Dad!
