I bought a cuckoo clock for my wife as a housewarming present.  We moved in, placed the furniture, hung some pictures and all was right with the world.  I hung the cuckoo clock on a short wall beside the window in the living room.  It looked great and she loved it.

The next day, we went off to work.  Around 4 that afternoon, I get a call from the police.  They said they had to “track me down” because I hadn’t answered the number on file with the security company (I immediately checked my cell and it was dead).  There was a problem at the house, and I was told the police were waiting for me.   I asked what the problem was, and the response was, “Can I let them know you’re on your way?”  After I said yes, that was the end of the call.

I get home to find two police cars in the driveway.  I got out of the car and walked over to them and asked what was going on.  The first cop said, “Wait for it….” Then put up his index finger.  A few seconds later, the house alarm starts blaring.  “It’s been doing this all day”, they told me, even after the alarm company shut it down.  The house was secure, but the police went in first to clear it while I was on the phone with the alarm company getting instructions on how unplug the box and take out the battery.  

I was issued a ticket with a pretty hefty fine for repeated calls to a false alarm.  

The security company came in the next day to inspect the system.  I was mad and snippy.  He couldn’t answer for why the system did not remotely shut down, only saying that they reset themselves.  Still not sure about that.  Either way, I was all set to name them in a suit for the fines and court costs until the guy said, “Here’s your problem”.  He showed me that I had hung the cuckoo clock next to a motion sensor.   

I brought pictures with me to court and the judge had a good laugh.  He reduced the fine, but basically called me an idiot.  I can’t argue.

Tl/dr: Don’t hang a cuckoo clock beside a motion sensor.
