Obligatory "this didnt happen today"

A few years ago I, being the dumb horny virgin I had been, was trying to find something to help me relieve myself, but having become bored of watching porn all the time I wanted to find a real chick. So I set out upon the many chat sites of the internet, found a girl on omegle and we immediately kicked it off. We seemed to have the same problem and decided we should move off omegle to skype. As soon as we were connected I started getting undressed and the girl on the cam started to as well and was asking for close ups of my dick. Obviously, I obliged and about five minutes later her cam changes to show me handling my junk. 

Confused, I ask what's going on and they tell me if I don't pay them a couple hundred bucks this recording was going to all my friends and family(my full name was on my skype), and being broke as I was I started freaking out and trying to convince them of my being penniless but they wouldn't have it and started a countdown. Freaking out even more, I summoned all the courage I had and told my dad what had happened, and he tells me to call the police about it. So I call the cops and a couple minutes later one is in our living room taking down what had happened. 

Oh yeah, I told the scammer I called the cops after being told to do so by my dad and they promptly stopped the countdown and disappeared, but with a policeman there I had to explain why he had been sent to my house. Praise be to this man that he did not laugh at the stupid thing I had done. He told me I should call the FBI as the skype account they used had an address on it and apparently this was quite common, but they never found out who it was so I didnt have to go to court to testify or anything.

I havent used omegle once in those years and dont plan on doing so for sexual reasons again, if at all. 

tl;dr got horny so I skyped a stranger, got blackmailed and had to contact the FBI and police department
