I really fucked up, reddit - and this one might just get me sent straight to hell. 

A little over a year ago now, I spent a couple months working as a volunteer in an orphanage in Northern Tanzania - and I had an amazing time doing it. The kids were all nothing short of fantastic, simply ecstatic to be alive each morning. While I was working there, my daily duties included some English teaching, and helping with the cooking and cleaning. I'd go back in a heartbeat if I could. 

For some background: In the first season of South Park, there's an episode called "Starvin' Marvin," in which an Ethiopian orphan is sent to South Park. [Here's how he appeared in the show.](http://imgur.com/5TiBspD) My friends and I are all long time fans of the show, and  we would say we're "Starvin' Marvin" whenever we were hungry, and it kind of caught on after a while. 

As I was handing out lunch to the kids at the orphanage, one of them said to me "thank you, I'm really hungry today." This particular boy was especially skinny. He was healthy otherwise, but he had arrived at the orphanage incredibly weak and stunted. 

So I responded, out of simple habit and without thinking: "Oh so you're Starvin' Marvin, hey?"

As soon as I said it, I realized what I had done. I immediately said "Oh my God, I'm so sorry!" Thankfully, he just kind of looked at me, a little confused. I don't think him or any of the other kids nearby knew what "Starvin" meant. But right after, the girl standing beside him pointed at him and said "Starvin' Marvin!" 

And it stuck. For the rest of the time I was there, the other kids called him "Starvin' Marvin." The few local teachers didn't know where it came from, and tried to put a stop to it, but it spread though the entire orphanage within a matter of hours. I never told them it was me. 

So what was the legacy I left behind in Africa? I gave an orphaned, hungry child the nickname "Starvin' Marvin."
