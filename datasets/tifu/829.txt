This JUST happened--agh I'm so embarrassed!

Ok, so my back has been stiff recently. I work at a desk. After sitting with clients all morning, my back was really hurting, and I needed somewhere to stretch it out. I first tried to do it standing up in the bathroom, but those stretches didn't reach the right muscles, so I knew I needed to lie down to do it. Clients are always coming in and out of my office, so I knew I had to find a place that was out-of-view. I decided to do it underneath this big conference table because no matter where you walk, you can't see underneath it, unless you're bending down.

My break was an hour long, so as soon as it started, I got under the table and stretched. It was awesome; after a few minutes, my muscles finally relaxed, which felt amazing. I still had like 45 minutes left, and no one had bothered me, so I thought "what the hell," and decided to close my eyes [edit] and sleep [/edit] for a bit. 

When my alarm vibrated in my pocket, signaling the end of the hour, I opened my eyes to see a bunch of legs sitting around the table--THERE WAS A CONFERENCE GOING ON!!

I had a client at the top of the hour, so I knew I had to leave, and in my head I'm like *nononononono how am I going to explain this*, but I couldn't wait for them to finish--it was clear that they were in the middle of it and weren't ending anytime soon.

Very slowly, I pushed one of the empty chairs out from the table. Everyone above stopped speaking--I could tell they were looking at the chair, seemingly moving of its own volition. I stood up from the floor to a group of aghast-looking businesspeople, and said "there was no way to do this without it being awkward, so... my back was really hurting... sorry to interrupt."

There was dead silence as I walked out of the room.

**TL;DR** Took a nap under a conference table, woke up to a conference going on above me. Was forced to interrupt the conference to go back to work.
