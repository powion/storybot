This actually happened about an hour ago, so it really is *Today* I Fucked Up!

In life, there are many things which perhaps cross our minds, but which we decide not to explore, perhaps because of social pressure, or perhaps just because we don't go down that avenue. 
One of the things which I'd always been interested in was shaving my...nether regions.

Now, I appreciate it's not the weekend, and so I shan't go into any detail, but after 20 minutes of careful trimming and a sharp razor, I was smooth and comfortable. The sense of freedom was liberating, and it felt *amazing*. 

Where's the fuck-up? I hear you cry! 

Well, I woke up today, I started to feel a little uncomfortable, just a slight itchy scratchiness. (You know what it's like if you've gone to the barber, and you have hair stuck in your collar? it was kinda like that) but no matter, I thought, I'll just put some moisturiser on. When I've shaved my beard before, I'd used it to reduce razor-burn with great success. So, quickly, I squirted some stuff into my hands and \*ahem* applied it. The cooling feeling was great!

However, within about 5 seconds this cool freshness was replaced with a warming sensation, and then a *really* warm feeling, and the temperature kept rising, and rising, until it was **excruciatingly** painful. Like, "Oh my god my balls are literally on fire and everything is burning!" It was as if someone had thrown a Scotch Bonnet chilli into a volcano, mixed it with bleach and applied this paste to my sausage and eggs.
 
It was only at this point that I looked at what I'd squirted in my hand. I could see the bottle of moisturiser on my shelf, and next to it, a bottle of "Deep Heat" cramp relief. 
I'd been suffering from leg cramps after a run yesterday and had left it out, and in my haste didn't check which bottle I'd used.


I am still in pain.

**TL;DR:** I tried to make myself to look hot for my lady, ended up too hot and fried my eggs.


EDIT: A lot of you guys seem to doubt this happens, saying that it's an urban legend - but even more of you have messaged me expressing sympathy - it goes to show that really, a lot of us fuck up in the same ways!
Thank you to those of you who suggested remedies - I'm much cooler now, and I feel better!

Finally though, to whichever poor sod gilded me, thankyou!
