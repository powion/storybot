Most front page TIFU I see involve sex. /r/circlejerk makes allusions to this with "TIFU by putting my PENIS into my GIRLFRIEND's VAGINA"

More and more I see TIFU which just seem to be people either wanting to say they've had sex, or making completely fake stories with plot holes in their own stories.

I get the weekend rule, which is fantastic, but what happened to this subreddit? Before I had this account it was my first subreddit to browse, and now it just seems to be kids acting like my example below.

But since this is TIFU, I must provide a TIFU:

ex.

TIFU by being so *fucking* better than you. I also had sex. With a girl. In her vagina. The upper one. She came. Then her sister heard us having sex and insisted she join because im so good. Then my already 12 inch penis grew 4 more inches, before I became president of the world.

TL;DR - Im better than you.
