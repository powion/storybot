My son is at that age where he spends a lot of time in the bathroom with the door locked. My daughter has made some remarks about it and I felt it was time that I addressed it. Here's how it went down:

I told my son to go have a shower before bed and as per usual he said he had to use the toilet first. He locked himself in the loo and was in there for 45 mins. In that time I had a shower (this is important later) and as he came out the bathroom I said 'Hey kids, I want to talk to you both. I just want to tell you that it's normal and natural to masturbate. It's nothing to be embarrassed about because you should be comfortable with yourself and your body. At this point my daughter burst out laughing and asked why I'm doing this now. I asked her what she meant and she said that her brother has been in the loo for 45 minutes so clearly I am talking about him.  My son was standing there blushing and I didn't want him to be embarrassed so I had to think of something quick and went with: Well you see, while I was in the shower, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and thought 'I would totally do me' and I just thought I would share that with you both because it's ok and totally normal. 

I walked away because we were all to embarrassed to be in the same room at that point.
