Last night I started my NYE celebrations at a mates house. We were drinking beers and I had downed about 5 in an hour and a half. So I was a little drunk walking down to the carnival. Now my body build is very lean and skinny. I am considered a bit of a light weight. I had packed 6 beers for myself and a liter of Jack Daniels straight. When walking down to the carnival and where there was live music. Once I walked down there, I started drinking the Jack straight from the bottle. Which was like rocket fuel compared to the beer I was drinking. After 2 hours I drank half of my Jack and I couldn't stand up and I was vomiting everywhere. Someone called the Police so I was taken back to the cells where I was spewing and passed out. I had no charges laid against me. Once my parents picked me up. I was as white as a sheet of paper and I was frothing at the mouth. My Grandpa who was with my parents said I needed to go to hospital. Where I got my stomach pumped and had to be assisted breathing for 2 hours. My blood pressure was 84/45 and my heart was beating at double what it should be. I was so close to total organ failure. 
I woke up this morning in my own bed wondering where I was and my friend who was staying over was relieved I woke up. Now I am being asked all these questions and lectures about responsible drinking while dealing with the biggest hangover of my life. Last night I fucked up.

Edit: thank you all for the hangover advice and to clarify I am 18 and living in Australia. Happy new year to all as well everyone stay safe over this festive season
