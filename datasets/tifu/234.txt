So this happened yesterday at lunch. I am an intern at a big engineering company in another country this summer. I am an incredibly difficult person to embarrass, but 24 hours later and I am still blushing at this situation.

I (female) emailed the Director of Engineering (male) and I asked if he wanted to grab lunch one day before I leave this summer. We proceed to exchange some brief emails about when (it happened yesterday, same day as the emailing started - all very quickly). The emails were in Spanish. I am not bilingual, but I am learning. This is a critical detail.

So we finish emailing and we meet at 11:30 to go out to a restaurant and we have a nice lunch, we talk the entire time in Spanish (slowly) and it was very fun and interesting. Then, as we are right about to reenter the work building on our way back from lunch, he stops me and speaks in English (weird, considering the past 1.5 hours were in Spanish, so I felt immediately like he wanted to make sure I understood his next words clearly).

He says "You know, you said something really funny in our emails... " And he flips through his phone and shows me my last email to him. "I know it's not what you meant to say, and I appreciate you are trying to learn the language, but this does not mean what you think it does..." And he points to the last line of my last email to him, which reads: *Estoy emocionada para almorzarnos*.

I meant to say "I am excited for us to eat lunch together". Apparently, as he described to me, that actually means: ***I am excited for us to eat each other out (sexually) for lunch***. 

I told the director of engineering at a global engineering company this. Wow. 

Well we clarified things and had a chuckle, and I think we diffused the situation pretty well... But.. Needless to say I am still astronomically embarrassed.

**TL;DR Translated Spanish incorrectly and offered to have oral sex for lunch with the director of engineering of the company where I intern.**
