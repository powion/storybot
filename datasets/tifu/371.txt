So, like most TIFUs, this was not actually today. About two weeks ago, I picked out a small local sushi place in Ginza to go get a bite while I was there on vacation. Unfortunately, it was closing as I arrived, so I Googled 'sushi near me' and picked from the list at random. I landed on a place nearby, about 5 mins, called 'Sushiko Honten'. It took a while to find - it was a small recessed door with no sign, somewhat shady - but once I entered it was lovely.

After eating some of the best sushi I've ever had, I noticed there were no prices on the menu. I'd had about 8 plates of sushi at this point, and started to panick a little. I quickly Googled the restaurant and blanched at what I found. The restaurant was 120 years old and had one Michelin star. As quickly as I could, I asked for the bill.

Â¥20 000 ($150) later, I decided to thoroughly research any future restaurants I visited on a whim. And not to use data in Japan. That was another 50 USD.

Edit: To clarify why this was so expensive, there were 2 pieces of nigiri sushi per plate, no rolls.
