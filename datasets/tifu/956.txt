This is my throwaway account for obviously reasons. Today I had the biggest presentation of the semester (college) in my Cancer Biology class... I'm a big fan of going the extra mile so I decided to make a Prezi instead of the typical PowerPoint. Big Mistake. I hook my computer up to the projector and I'm online loading my Prezi. Right before I started I noticed I had some extra tabs open. One happened to be my Reddit NSFW gifs tab. I go to click the god forsaken microscopic 'X' by the tab but I clicked the tab body by accident. Simultaneously my teacher remotely switches the projector and the entire lecture hall (80+ students) gets a nice freeze frame of a huge Gianna Micheals facial. Not only was this the most embarrassing event of my life but the head of the biology department was there doing a teacher assessment. Goodbye letter of recommendation. Cancer Sucks. 

*Update 1: Wow so much response! Sorry everyone I did realize that it was not deepthroating but actually tittyfucking... I bet you guys still won't be disappointed ;) The link was http://www.reddit.com/r/nsfw_gifs/search?q=gianna+micheals&amp;count=26&amp;before=t3_qgt2t

*Update 2: Thanks for all the positive reviews. I actually nailed the presentation after the incident! The initial laughing was silenced by some good old biology 


**Update 3: I would like to formally thank Gianna Michaels, because I know all you dirty birds clicked the link for her! Gianna if you're reading this, email me hahhahah
