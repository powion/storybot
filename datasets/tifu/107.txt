So I took the time to prepare a romantic, candle-lit place. It was beautiful, with heart-shaped balloons, red and white roses everywhere, candles everywhere, made her favorite meal, made a mixtape with our favorite songs...anything a girl wants in a relationship right? (even though not all girls - hold on) 



It was soo romantic, spent half of my paycheck to rent the place and prep everything. I was so excited to see her reaction and my heart was going wild. It is my first time ever doing this, so I did my best, but it was all damn beautiful!



So she gets led to the place by her sister, she lied to her that there was bday party of another friend of her. She arrived, read the card I prepared and she had misty eyes. Then the door opened, she saw me in the candle lit room with my tux - romantic as fuck - music was playing, I invited her for a dance. She was really happy!



Everything went as planned...dinner, dance, music... she was excited and happy, didn't know what to say etc. Then I proposed and she said YES!



BUT WAIT, THERE'S OBVIOUSLY MORE! SINCE YOU KNOW SHE IS A WOMEN AND COMES FROM ANOTHER PLANET!



The next day she said she was not happy with the way I proposed, a romantic night with each other is what she apparently didn't want! She wanted me to call her friends and surprise her with them! We argued a lot, she appreciated my efforts but didn't like it all. And I said that she apparently loves her friends more than me, she said that it isn't true, but it came out like that! She said I was being selfish by doing it "my way" and not how she imagined it! 



TL;DR: Apparently you should propose the way the girl wants it :(

Edit: I took the night off to consider stuff. Feeling heartbroken atm... Didnt sleep at all and gotta go to work. Feeling shitty atm. Oh and this girl is someone i knew a long time, same neighborhood etc. She was a good girl.with.whom we hung out a lot. This reaction of her was a complete other side of her eventhough we knew each other very good... Apparently not. Most of our common friends took my side...

Update: She isnt a redditor but apparentl she got linked this thread and said she didnt know she hurt my feelings. Like... Seriously... Being a man doesnt come with feelings? Gotta rethink all of this... Thanks for support guys and girls :( the reality checkers are right. I am gonna talk about this with her. 


Update2: She sent me my favorite pizza to my work. I am in a lunchbreak atm. I will eat the pizza but wont return her calls/messages...


Update3: A girlfriend of hers called me and said she wanted to be surprised in front of her friends. Apparently a few friends of her got a proposal akin to that... And my gf wanted the same.... And no she didn't mention it once that she wanted one like that, and she knows i am more a romantic guy that likes to be alone with her because of intimacy... She said it wasn't a proposal she dreamt of and that I don't respect her dreams and/or wishes and that I am selfish...

Well this is from her friend... I'm gonna leave work in a couple of hours... I will talk about this with her, no need to run away (atm tho)


**UPDATE4: SHE JUST COUNTER-PROPOSED TO ME, HOLY SHIT! Shge was waiting for me at home and she made it all romantic and shit, she cried when I arrived, apologized and said if I wanted to marry her!!!**

**I am feeling strange things atm**

**I SAID NO, I AM NOT READY YET, I NEED TIME TO TRULY UNDERSTAND YOU**

she said "ok" and went to bed.

Hold me reddit, i'm on a strange roller coaster 


Update5: We had a serious conversation. Instead of hurting each other we had a good breakfast talk. She said it was the first time someone proposed to her... It was mmy first time too. Sshe acknowledges it was a surpirsa and a shock for her. I told her I was the one that got hurt a lot. We are still together. We are trying to fix things our way....
