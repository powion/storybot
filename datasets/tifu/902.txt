It didn't happen today, but it happened a couple days ago. 

I was on a nature hike for a few days and came back into town. I logged onto facebook shortly after arriving home. I logged onto my facebook, scrolled down my page and noticed almost every single one of my friends had a filter with the French flag.

I remembered when my friends put the LGBT flag as a filter to celebrate gay marriage becoming legal nationwide a while back. I assumed something equally positive or proud was happening in France.

I then posted: "Congrats on the events in France. It must have been a glorious day."

I go out grocery shopping, come back to facebook, and I find eight people defriended me. 25+ livid comments on my support of terrorists. 3+ messages by people who know me well -enough that I don't condone terrorism- asking if my account has been hacked. 

I explained my mistake and everyone seems chill right now. Although, I wouldn't be surprised if I was on some watch list right now.
