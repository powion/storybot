Kids are sponges. Our little angel has been eagerly soaking up all the naughty words we say and happily shouting them back at us. Not only does he love saying "Shit!" but if we ever say "shit" he'll follow up with a hearty "Fuck!"

So we have a brainstorm -- we would use a different word. Something innocuous. Innocent. We go with "Pudding!" After a few tries at this he gets it, but now whenever we say "Pudding!" he responds by shouting "Fuck!" Not exactly what we were going for, but at least we tried, right?

But that wasn't the TIFU. This was: today is his 2 year birthday. His preschool allows us to bring in a special treat for the class and then they all sing him "Happy Birthday." But given the general freak out about nuts and peanuts, you can't bring in cakes or cupcakes. So I bought some treats. Pudding cups. Turns out the teachers were not amused at his response when they told the class "Hey everybody! Guess what we have for a birthday treat -- Pudding!"
