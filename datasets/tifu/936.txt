I was at my girlfriends family home for the first time and no one was home, after a while of hanging out things starting getting a bit frisky between us, eventually i started finger bangin' her. This is where things got interesting. Half way through we hear someone coming up the stairs, so quickly I pull out of her while she slips her skirt back down . In walks her brother within a few seconds, her brother who i've never met to this point, he introduces himself and extends his hand to shake mine.

Rewind 3 months and i had a motocross accident, broke my arm and collarbone, both on the same side, my arms in a cast and a sling as well.

Fast forward. Im trapped, I had no option except to attempt to wipe his sisters juices off on my shorts before shaking his hand. After an awkward delay of a hand shake, with minimal juice extraction, I go for it, i shake his hand.

The most awkward moment of all our lives ensured. 

He felt it, looked at me like what the fuck, looked at his sister who was bright red.He knew, he definitely knew.


TLDR: Fingered dudes sister, shakes his hand with sticky fingers due to other arm being in a sling.
