So I was taking a leisurely dip in the water, it was quite calm, not much of a swell. Things were great, the sun was shining and not too many people in the water.
After a while I needed to go to the toilet, I'm not sure really what I was thinking, it probably was the combination between "I've peed in the water heaps" and "It's nearly a 10min walk to the restrooms" when I decided that I would snap a log in the water. 
I mean what could go wrong? It would sink, no one would be any the wiser.

I waded away from everyone and did my business. To my surprise however the sonna'va bitch floated. Shits don't float do they? I'm pretty sure whenever I've looked in the bowl after laying a turd it hasn't floated.

Well I am not sure exactly what was happening, but I had just given birth to two floating torpedo's, hastily making their way straight for the nearest beach patrons.
Immediately I swam after them, I'm no Michael Phelps, but I quickly caught up with them. I grabbed one in each hand. Now I don't know if any of you have held your shit before, but let me assure you, isn't not pleasant.

At that moment I was struck with fear, I was within 5 meters of people and had two slippery brown trouts to dispose of. Simple decision, I'll bury them under the sand. So I dove down and quickly pushed them deep into the sand, pushing more sand over them.

I surfaced just in time to see my GF swimming up to me. No quicker had I buried them, then they had escaped their salty grave and popped to the surface once more.

My GF looked at them, looked at me, looked at them and screamed.

For the past 5 hours I have been dubbed the Pooptanic.
