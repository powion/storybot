About 2 months ago I starting having what I described as "heart flutters".  I saw a doctor and he said it was probably an arrhythmia and probably nothing to be concerned about.  I'm 34, fit, eat healthy, and this just happens occasionally.  He said that he had had them himself recently (from drinking too much according to him :))

Anyway, today I'm in Bali.  I wake up this morning, go to yoga, eat breakfast, and then start cycling to Ubud.  As I normally do when cycling in an unknown place, I put my phone on voice guided directions and stick it in my shirt pocket upside-down so that I can actually hear the directions.  Very quickly I notice that there's this new "feature" (or perhaps I accidentally turned it on somehow, but I can't find a setting for it now) -- Whenever you're supposed to turn, it vibrates at the same time: "Turn left &lt;bzzzz bzzzz&gt;".  I immediately thought it was annoying, primarily because of how I was holding the phone.

So I'm cycling, it's fairly hot out (~27C/80F), I'm in direct sunshine, going up somewhat steep hills, and have a maybe 12kg backpack on (that's also strapped fairly tight across my chest).  I approach an intersection and my phone gets confused as it sometimes does: "Turn left.  Turn right.  Turn left.  Turn right."  With each of these instructions now comes a "bzzzz bzzzz".  My phone starts vibrating for at least 5 seconds non-stop, right above my heart.  I feel my heart flutter and then nothing.

And that's how I died today, in the middle of the road, in Bali.

##### Epilogue

I'm obviously not dead.  I got insanely lucky -- Just behind me, on a scooter, was an Australian doctor.  She performed CPR and later told me what happened.  She said she thought my heart stopped for about a minute.  She helped me to the side of the road, and I had about 10 locals around me giving me water, and candy.  One of them was a taxi driver who very kindly drove me the rest of the way to Ubud for free.

I think I'm okay now, though I'm going to a clinic shortly (I've just been sitting in a Starbucks for the last hour because they have A/C unlike everywhere else).

And I have a date tomorrow night with a really cute doctor :)

__tl;dr__ -- heat + cycling + hills + backpack + arrhythmia + phone vibrating like crazy just above my heart = me dead
