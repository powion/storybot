Here's my original post:

And here's what it said:

I was emailing with my dad about a road trip we're about to take together across Utah next month, and went to send him a link to a desert quad biking company. But instead of copying the url from the quad biking site I accidentally copied the url from a vimeo video I had open in another tab, which was of a very funny but very twisted short film about father/son incest. So yeah, now my dad thinks I want to suck his dick.

Here's the film I sent him by accident.

And here's my UPDATE:

Well I met with my dad for dinner and to be honest things didn’t quite go according to plan. I immediately explained to him how I’d mistakenly sent him the link to the incest comedy rather than the quad bike company, and that my “we should do this” comment was about quad biking and NOT sucking each other’s dicks. He seemed to believe me and we laughed about it. So far so awkward. But then, drunk on the relief of how I’d managed to resolve the whole thing I went and made a fatal error. I told him about my reddit post, and about how I’d told half the internet about our little misunderstanding. I even showed him a bunch of all your comments on my phone. My dad did NOT like that I’d gone public with this. He did not like it ONE BIT. In fact, he got very fucking pissed and walked out the restaurant saying I was a stupid kid, a creep etc etc. I’m THIRTY FUCKING ONE, BY THE WAY. Anyway, I’m sure he’ll get over it, but right now I’d say my chances of getting a blowjob from him any time soon are virtually nil.


****UPDATE TO THE UPDATE****

A number of people asked me to post an additional update on the situation with my dad. So like before, here it is a fresh post (as requested).
