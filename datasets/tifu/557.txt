So it wasn't today but last week. My son is 6 years old and has recently become obsessed with cars and robots, so being an idiot I thought it would be great to show him the transformers movie. Now I have not seen the movie in a few years. And I don't know if you remember but in the movie 'Sam' the main character is in his room with the door locked. His parents come up and try to get in and can't. His mother them asked him if he is masturbating. My son being curious asked what that means and I panicked and decided to tell him it just means playing with toys. He accepts this definition and I hope he forgets about it. 

The next day comes and my wife calls him down to dinner. She asked what he was doing up in his room and he says (wanting to be cool like to movie) that he was masturbating, I start laughing and she yells "What!" He replies that he was just masturbating with the new toys I bought him. I at this point cannot stop laughing and she asks him where he learned that word. After we figure everything out we explain only grow-ups can use that word. 

Sorry for poor English and grammar. English is not my first language 

Edit: I'm on the first page! Wow! Thanks everyone!
Also I have taken some of your advice and talked to my son to clarify some issues. I basically told him
"Masturbating is what grown ups do on their own in their rooms." And to ask me again when he turns 10 to learn more I hope this will clarify previously stated issues some of you had about my parenting. Thank you for all the feedback I shall read every single comment you leave. Thank you.

Edit: Thank you for the gold stranger! I have never had gold before. I'm happy you enjoyed my post! Thank!
