Around three months ago I applied to be an extra in the new Star Wars film. They are shooting in the UK this summer fairly close to where I am based and had put out a casting call for 'Salty Sea Dogs' (http://collider.com/star-wars-episode-7-casting-call/).

Having spent the last 6 months allowing my beard to grow out, I thought it would be a great opportunity to put my 'young Captain Birdseye' look to some actual use. So I fluffed up the facial hair, sent off some pictures of my heavily bearded face, and waited for a call from the casting agency.

Three months later and I hadn't heard anything back. By that point I thought it was fair to assume I hadn't got it. After all, every bearded man in the country had probably applied. 

So I finally got round to shaving. 

To be exact, I shaved at 1.50pm today. 

Exactly seventeen minutes later I got a text from the casting agency, specifying that I more or less had a part so long as I 'still have a good beard'.

The photos below were originally just the obligatory before/after beard selfie for Facebook. Instead they just documented one of the most badly timed shaves in history:

Warning to all my bearded comrades: don't ever get rid of it! The universe will get you back for it.

No Star Wars for me. And I look about 15 now.

So... I replied with 'available' and received an email this morning that laid out specifically the look they were going for (long beards/long hair). The email finished with:

*"If your hair is currently similar to this and you are generally free for filming in August on a major new feature film as an extra please email me back a 'selfie' of your current hair by the end of Friday 4th July"*

Disaster.

As much as I would have loved to send them another pre-shave photo, the honest side of me resisted the dark side and sent back an email explaining my predicament and with a photo of how the beard will look in around 6 weeks time (http://i.imgur.com/puMK7hM.jpg).

If they want me they will reply. So now I wait. And as soon as I hear back I will let you guys know.

ps - To the conspiracy theorists suggesting it's impossible for me to have shaved and showered in 8 minutes, there's this great new invention called an electric razor. You just run it over your face and the beard is gone. It's like magic!


EDIT: **Update** 11th July, 17.51pm (GMT)

As much as I wish I could deliver great news at this point, I still haven't heard back. I will send a quick followup email now, but from here it looks unlikely I will get it. Not 'salty' enough, clearly.

On the bright(ish?) side, and as some of you have pointed out, it seems that the original casting call which did the rounds online (http://collider.com/star-wars-episode-7-casting-call/) could have been mistaken about 'Salty Sea Dogs' being for Star Wars. Instead it could well be for the next Peter Pan film (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3332064/), which is shooting in Shepperton around the same time. Sadly I can't verify this as I was given very little information in my contact with them (as you'd expect).

Of course if I hear back I will post here immediately... but sorry to let you down!
