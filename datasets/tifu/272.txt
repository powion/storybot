This was back in high school where the setup for desks was in rows and columns, less spread out.

I have a bad habit of cracking my neck like someone would crack their knuckles. I know it probably isn't good for me but it helps relieve some tightness for a little while so I do it anyway. 

Over a week I began cracking my neck much to the dismay of the girl who sat behind me who cringed every time I would do it. One day I thought it would be funny to crack my neck, then slump over as if I had just done one of those movie "snap their neck and they die" kind of things.

One day my neck was feeling particularly stiff, so as I go to crack my neck I turn around to look at her, turn my head sharply to the right and lots of loud pops echo out into the classroom, then I slump over and fall to the floor. The girl who sat behind me screamed bloody murder and freaks out the rest of the class. 

My teacher told me to stop cracking my neck after that.

TL;DR Cracked my neck, hit the deck.
