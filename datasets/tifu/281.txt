This has actually been happening for 8+ years. 

Since i was a kid, my mom would always tell me how  healthy tea was for you, and how much antioxidants it had in it.

Well, i took that **too** literally. In order to get all them goodnesses, i would rip open the tea pack and pour in all of the spices and drink them. This would result in me coughing out my lungs and a dry throat. I thought "oh well, its worth it for all those goodnesses." Until today, when i was drinking tea at my girlfriends house and both her and her parents saw me and proceeded to laugh their assses off. They then took a couple pictures of me, had them processed and hung. My mom now wants some prints of those pictures as well. We're driving to Walmart right now to pick them up.

TL;DR: TL;DR Been teabagging incorrectly for 8+ years


**EDIT**: we got the pictures. I look like a fool, they took several and had them specially made so that you could see my FU unfold.
