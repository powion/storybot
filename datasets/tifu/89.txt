So I had my first car couple months ago and been driving like an idiot sometimes. This morning whilst giving my brother a lift to school I stop at these traffic lights, next to me comes a black bmw and 2 men dressed in polos, for fun I revved my engine and so did they, when the light turned green I put my foot down, just when I passed 30mph their blue lights come on and they stop me. I almost shit myself, shaking I open the window and one cop comes up and says 'if we'd put our foot down we'd smoke you' and starts laughing whilst walking away. NEVER GOING TO DRIVE LIKE AN IDIOT AGAIN, I PROMISE
