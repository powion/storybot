So for those of you who don't know, there is a Google Survey app for android you can download where you get to take surveys. After completing the surveys, you receive anywhere from $0.10 to $2.00 for doing a survey to use on the Google Play Store. 

Now with these surveys I have always lied. The more I'd fabricate these answers, the more "valuable" it makes my opinion. The more valuable my opinion is, the more surveys I get which means more play store credit. If I had been honest, I would not have gotten any surveys much like when I told my friend about the app and never got a survey after his first one. So far, I've received about $35 in Play Store Credit by doing these surveys. 

So this morning, I got a Google Survey on my tablet. It was a 3 question survey. The survey asked if I had ever been to a water park called Kelp Water Parks. I said yes. Then it asked what my favorite slide was. I just chose a random name of a ride and proceeded to the next question.

Only then did I find out it wasn't a survey, but it was designed to fish out people like me. People who lie on their surveys. It told me that the Kelp Water Park didn't exist. Google then proceeded to scold me saying lying is a bad thing and it will most likely not consider me for future surveys. Google caught me lying and left me feeling like I lied to my own father. 

TLDR: Lied to Google. Received a virtual spanking over their survey app.
