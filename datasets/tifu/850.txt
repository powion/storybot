Theres this young lady, around 24 years old, who comes in the gym where I work pretty often with her 4 year old son.
Yesterday, she didnt have her son with her. We joke around a lot and were talking for a while, so I asked "Where's your kiddo at? Doing meth with the neighbors again?" In a VERY jokingly way (since like I said we mess with each other all the time). Well she got a real bad look on her face and walked away.
Turns out she's in Celebrate Recovery because of her former meth addiction. And her son was with her neighbors.
