This didnt happen today happened about 2 weeks ago. I'm a teenager living in Wales, I have brown skin because my family descent is Indian, so I don't really look very Welsh, instead I look different, I'm a pretty laid back individual who don't care about racism or discrimination, instead I find racist jokes quite funny.

It was 11.9.15, so, for "a bit of banter" I decided to go into school pretending to be all depressed. A group of my mates, asked me if I was alright, I said "no". They then proceeded to ask what was the matter. I told them that my uncle died 14 years today. They were all pretty shocked. One said "are you alright". I told them not to worry becuase he took 2000 other people down with him.

That is how I got suspended for a week. I'm a dick.

Tldr: Don't be racist to yourself and make jokes about 911.

EDIT: Wow I'm glad everyone liked my fuck up. Last night I had 10 upvotes on this post, I woke up and I have 2000. Before this I had 50 comment karma xD

EDIT2: Just checked my inbox, rip

EDIT3: Just came back from school, 3000 up votes and been given gold for taking this piss out of the colour of my skin, thanks btw and wow.

EDIT4: Wow, top of r/tifu yesterday xD Let me just get something straight, I never said I didn't deserve the consequences for my actions, instead I've said how much of a dick I am and how I fucked up big.
