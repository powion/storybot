I was on my way to my boyfriends house and he had mentioned that I should bring along some of our toys, so I chucked my vibrator into a bag along with clothes and stuff, ready to spend the night there. My dad had offered to give me a lift on his way to work as my car is in the garage, I happily agreed and we set off on the half hour car drive to my boyfriend's house. Now, I should probably mention that my dad is the kind of dad who refuses to accept that I didn't just stop getting older at the age of 7, it took him about a week to get over the fact that I had a boyfriend, and even now he refuses to accept that we would dare go past hand holding... So anyway, about five minutes into the car journey I heard a weird kind of buzzing noise, it took me a few seconds to realise what it was, and I had that "OHHH SHIITT" realisation when my bag started vibrating. It didn't help that the vibrator was pressed up against a can of deodorant amplifying the sound painfully. My dad looked over at me, he said "What's that sound, is it the car? That sort of vibra....." his face then dropped as he saw the kill me now look in my eyes and realised it was coming from my bag....he immediately turned back to the road and we sat in almost silence (I couldn't exactly pull out my vibrator and turn it off at this point) for what was the longest, most painfully awkward half hour of my life. Consider our innocent father daughter relationship, official over.

edit: To answer some questions, I am 19 and awkward as shit... my current boyfriend is the first guy I have ahem, "done stuff" with.. he brought me the vibrator along with some other things for my birthday, and I am not any kind of all knowing vibe genie, but I know that the constant vibration of a rabbit sounds very different to a phone, but that's irrelevant, I am not a smart girl. :(
