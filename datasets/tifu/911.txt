Reddit I fucked up. I was sitting in my office and I kept getting a faint smell of ass. It kept coming and going and it was bothering me. So I get up my chair and the smell multiplied by ten. My office was supper hot and my leather chair was making my ass sweat like a pig. WTF. So I grabbed some hand sanitizer and wiped my chair and then headed to the bathroom. I wiped my ass of all the sweat and went back to my office. 


Around 10 the smell is back with a vengeance. I grab the hand sanitizer and lock myself in the bathroom and start cleaning my asshole with hand sanitizer and wiping with toilet paper. Did it til I almost ran out of sanitizer. Put the rest into a piece of folded toilet paper and put it between my butt cheeks. Finally the awful smell was gone and I went to my office.


I could feel a tingly burning sensation coming from my anus but it went away. I kept working and didn't pay attention to it as it didn't bother me. The office was still hot but I no longer smell the ass scent. It's around noon now and the smell is back faintly. No problem I just go the bathroom and repeat my little trick of hand sanitizer on toilet paper. 

So its about 3:00 pm I've changed that shit about three times and now and I feel a little buzzed. My boss told me to go home because I look a little off today. Im sitting in my car right now typing this in a Wal-Mart parking lot. Im going to take a nap hopefully I'll get sober enough to drive home.

**TL;DR** **Drank 12 oz of hand sanitizer through my butthole and now am too dizzy to go home**

Edit: Made it home. I'm taking a shower and going to sleep. Bought a Gatorade on the way home and I feel a little better. WTF was I thinking.

Edit 2: Just so you guys don't get the wrong idea I'm a very clean person. I shower every morning before work. Today I was running late and I didn't. I have baby wipes at home to wipe my ass but I ran out so I just used regular toilet paper and headed out the door. I automatically assumed the odor was coming from me since I didn't follow my usual routine. I freaked out I wanted to make it go away in any way posible. I think I got some mild alcohol poisoning from doing something clearly stupid. I really want to blame the chair but who knows maybe it was really me. 

**Final Edit**: The chair smells like ass. I took a good whiff and got out of there gagging with tears in my eyes.  So I can picture it now. My assistant manager sits in my chair all day when I'm off playing boss. While I don't mind that I'm pretty sure there is someone wrong with his ass. He stank my chair over a period of 6 months. Now that the weather is getting hotter the stench is coming out. Im sitting in a metal foldaway and my new chair should get here in a couple of days. It was 62% Ethyl Alcohol in case you were curious. Thank you guys.

**TL;DR Blamed ass for stank im my office and got mild alcohol poisoning trying to cleaning it. It was a my leather chair infused with my assistant body odors and brought to life with the heat in the office**
