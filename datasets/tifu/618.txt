On the train, a girl about 2 feet from me has her fly open. I tell her about it and then she says "Why are you looking there?" She closes it thereafter.

Everyone on the train gives me a mild death stare.

Disappointing when I was only trying to help. I guess people were angry at me for telling her as now they wouldn't be able to look there anymore.
