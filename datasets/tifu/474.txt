Nothing too serious but I felt pretty stupid.

I decided to pick up some McDonald's after class today. I get there during the lunch hour so of course there is a long line of cars ahead of me. I decide to kill some time by opening up the Reddit app on my phone. Before I know it I'm pulling up to the first window. It's right then that I realize something. *I never stopped to order my food*. So I look at the cashier and obviously I just drive off instead of having to explain to the her that I forgot to order my food like an idiot.
