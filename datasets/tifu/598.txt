This occurred a few months ago, but I just discovered this Subreddit, so I figured it would still be relevant. 

For my English class, we were assigned one of ten projects about the book To Kill a Mockingbird. We were allowed to pick a partner and, without question, locked eyes with the girl who was at the time my best friend. We decided to make the project entitled "Make a Board Game". Needless to say, we were going to make a board game. 

I, who had never had an interaction with a girl outside of school, we wondering how to compose myself; should I just be myself? Sure, what could go wrong? We met at the library and got working on our project making sufficient progress and having fun all the while. She slides her chair close to me. Really close to me. She starts resting her arm on mine and being a little *too* cozy. 

Eventually she wraps her arms around me and gives me a hug, squeezing me quite a lot. I decide to do what she's doing and hug her, squeezing just as hard. Little did I know, I can squeeze a lot harder than a girl who's 5'2" and 110 lbs. 

*CRACK* she jumps as if someone scared her. She complains that her side hurt and she is convinced she broke her rib, however, she shakes it off and keeps working. we finish, I go home and she texts me later saying "So you actually broke my rib." And later showed me the X-ray. She didn't hold it against me and actually we ended up dating, and still are to this day. And don't worry, neither if us have broken anything else.

TL;DR I was too awkward to know how to hug so I broke my friends rib. Now we're dating. Love hurts.
