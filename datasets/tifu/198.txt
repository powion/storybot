My friend was complaining how bad Fallout 4 looked on her PS4. I jokingly told her that she should plug her **Galaxy S6** to upgrade the graphics and I even showed her a video how the PS4 can use the hardware of a smartphone to improve performance/graphics. She believed it and told me she'll try it soon.  

I was internally laughing about the silliness of the situation, on my way out I told her "don't forget to charge your phone in the Microwave first for 1 minute before plugging it in your PS4, google it if you don't believe me!". I left while having a laugh, thinking that she'd figure out its all BS, I mean the microwave your **iphone** thing... everyone knows that!  

4 hours later (about 30 minutes ago), I got a phone call from her brother telling me the said friend "cooked" her phone and she is yelling like a banshee that she will murder me.  

I switched off my phone, I logged out of everything on my PC...  

Guys... I am terrified...
