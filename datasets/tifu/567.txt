I was at Wegmans and was picking up some yogurt.

Most people know that there are usually people behind the yogurt and dairy sections of supermarkets. When the displays get empty, they load more in from the back.

Well there was a guy working behind the yogurts while I was picking them out. And it was extremely dark in that back space. And the guy working was black.

So while I was reaching for the yogurts in the back, I feel something smooth that doesn't feel like a wall. I've accidentally touched the guy's face. 

I don't think I've sprinted away from anywhere faster than that. Luckily there weren't many people around to see me.
