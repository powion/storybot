My fiancé, a guy, and I, a girl, wanted to go see Fifty Shades of Grey on Valentine's Day with another couple, good friends of ours who told us a few days ago that they might want to go see it with us.  Anyway, this morning I texted the girl, who is listed in my phone as Ashley R., "Do you want to go see Fifty Shades of Grey on Valentine's Day?" in order to figure out our plans.  The response: "I'm going to [city across the state] to visit my mom for her birthday."  ...Ashley's mom's birthday is not this weekend.  

I looked at the contact name I had texted--Adam R.--and realized that I had just asked my boss to go with me to see Fifty Shades of Grey on Valentine's Day.

Edit: Update--As soon as I realized what had happened, I ran over to my boss's office (thankfully the office next to mine) and apologized profusely for sending him the text, and even showed him the text conversation between my fiancé and I about asking our friends to the movies.  He just laughed and said no worries.  But still.  I was so fucking embarrassed before I explained the situation, and still am quite a bit.

Edit 2: Clarification.

Edit 3: Fiancé.

Edit 4: A lot of you guys are being really negative with your comments.  All I wanted to do was share a funny story with you.  I'm sorry for misspelling "fiancé" and wanting to see the movie.
