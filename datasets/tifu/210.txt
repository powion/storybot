This happened just now,

A long time ago I installed my Cloud To Butt Chrome extension, which replaces the word cloud with butt, and I totally forgot about it.

I've been on the look out for a second hand iPhone for the past few days, and was wondering why so many people were talking about the new iButt storage feature. Every time I asked about it on Trademe they were rather confused and sometimes thought I was just fucking with them.
Eventually I got sick of it after finding nothing about this iButt online and decided to contact Apple.

The help desk didn't take me seriously at all and of course every time they asked if I meant iCloud all I saw was iButt, confusing me even more. I left the heated discussion with the poor lady when it suddenly dawned on my how much of an idiot I am.

Edit: Wow this blew up over night, All these inboxes are a pain in the cloud.
