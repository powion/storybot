I was driving home on a small residential street and noticed some cheerleaders practicing right off the side of the road. They were straight ahead and I had to make a left turn. I was still kind of glancing back at them while making the turn and didn't see caution sandwich board thing construction workers use to mark their work area. I ended hitting the sign and sinking my front left tire into a pothole full of hot blacktop. I'm thinking I'm going to get my ass kicked by some construction workers when one of them approaches me asking me if me and my car are ok. I told him I was fine and very sorry. He said don't worry about it. We were watching them too.
