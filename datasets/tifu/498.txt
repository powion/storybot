This happened about 90 minutes ago... and yeah.


So my mom has been redoing her backyard and my wife and I have been helping out. Well we're wrapping up for the evening and my mom asks me to move this big black rolled up plastic whatever it is that is basically a big black tube. So I pick it up by one end and this **giant** fucking spider is underneath and proceeds to dash toward me. Naturally, like any grown man, I dropped the tube and screamed like a little girl. And se√±or face eater thought it would be a good idea to take up residence inside the giant tube.


Well, like all spiders, this bastard needed to die. Being the genius I am, I grabbed a can of mosquito repellent and a lighter. I proceeded to flamethrower the inside of the tube. Well... it didn't work as intended. Not only did the plastic tube thingie catch fire, but a giant pissed off spider that is covered in flames darted out of the tube toward my face. I proceeded to run and scream like a little girl as a flaming spider chased me like some bad horror movie.


My wife thought it was hilarious, my mom was annoyed I destroyed her plastic thing, and I never found the dead spider. So... somewhere out there is a pissed off, horribly disfigured, giant spider with a grudge. I may have created a super villain.

Edit:

Well this got bigger than expected. I guess I will answer some stuff up here.

The spider was a large brown spider, maybe and inch or so big. So giant. Also that fucker was fast.

The plastic tube was some rolled up garden mesh stuff.

Yes I sprayed fire at plastic... I never claimed to be intelligent. My genius comment was sarcasm.

I dunno if the spider was ever actually on fire. But everything else was, it darted right towards me, I dropped everything and ran like a true man.

Yes I really screamed like a little girl. Spiders suck.

No, I am not in Australia.
