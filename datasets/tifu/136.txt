Well, I work on the 4th floor of a building, while our secretaries are on the 1st. So the routine is, when I take a smoke break, I stop on the 1st, just open the secretaries' door to say "I'm going to smoke" so they know I can't take calls for the next 5 minutes or so.

So that day, while in the stairs, I let my thoughts wander and come to the conclusion that I can't wait to finish work so I can take a shit. Because, you know, there is no place like home for that kind of things.

Anyway, my brain being in auto pilot mode from the routine, I open the secretaries' door, squeeze my head and say "I'm going to take a shit". It is just when I close the door and hear everyone laugh inside that I realize what I've done...

Happened 3 or 4 months ago, and they still have that little smile when I say I'm going to smoke.


Edit : Wow, thanks everyone, glad you enjoyed it !
So yeah, no harm done here, everyone had a good laugh, myself included. I just thought that the HUGE embarrassment was worth a TIFU and a share :)
