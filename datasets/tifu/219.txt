This actually happened about two weeks ago.  My sister recently died at the age of 32.  We were very close.  Her funeral was held at the Lutheran church she was married in.  Right before they started the service (after the viewing), I went to give my sister a kiss one last time.  When I went to stand up, I tripped over the altar they put out to kneel on.  Falling forward, I put my hands out to brace myself which happen to be on the inside of the casket, on the ledge next to the hinge of the lid.  It pushed the casket backwards. Luckily, no major harm was done.  The men put it back upright, fixed her hair, and placed her gifts next to her again. I swear if she were here, she would laugh so loudly.  My mom was so upset she was hysterical, and my step dad held back a chuckle. This is my life.

EDIT:  Wow!  Thank you all so much for your show of support.  It means a lot that you shared your experiences and laughs.  It was a funny moment for me, and I still get teased that I 'knocked 'em dead'.  Just FYI, she died of complications from Vasculitis.  In the end, her heart just wasn't strong enough to keep going.  Once again, I appreciate all the well wishes!
