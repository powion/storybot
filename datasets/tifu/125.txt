So this happened last night... I live in a dorm in college where the bathrooms are shared by both genders in groups of 10. There are 2 showers and 3 toilets, so multiple people (either gender), can be in the bathroom at the same time. After my shower, I was shaving my face in the mirror with my towel wrapped around my waist. While looking in the mirror everyday, I've notice myself getting a little chunkier and chunkier in the tummy area as the semesters gone on. 

Then as I'm standing there shaving, one of the cuter girls I share the bathroom with enters. Before we even make eye contact or say hello to each other, I somehow instinctively sucked my tummy in to look a little skinnier and then it happened. My towel (it must have been folded loosely enough) just unravels from the front and the towel just falls to the ground. Sadly, I wasn't fast enough to snag it before it got to my genitalia... There I am just standing there with my 3-inch post-shower pinch and hairy ass.

She was nice enough to act like she didn't see it though and she casually got in the shower like nothing happened. But she saw it. I know she saw it all.

A few lessons have been learned from this experience...
