It actually happened a year ago. 

My friend, a lady from and old italian family who works for theaters in Milan posts the following status on fb: 'there is an entire population in my head and I don't know who I shall listen to'.

I comment below 'listen to the old skank, she'll always tell you the truth' and go to bed.

Apparently her very aristocratic mother had commented seconds before me suggesting a selected genocide of the people in her head.

My comment appeared like I was inviting my friend toÂ listen to her mother, an old skank who always tells the truth.

The mother wasn't amused.
