TIRFU! 

I had to go, I mean REALLY GO... Explosive gases churning in the colon, so time was of the essence. 

The seat was up, so I threw it down with my foot while getting the belt and trousers open, relief is seconds away and the panic of possibly shitting my pants is almost gone. 

I spin around and drop on the seat. 

I didn't count on the slow closing seat... you know, the kind that makes the seat and lid not slam down on the porcelain when you drop it? 

Sat too fast, scrotum got caught between the seat and the bowl, causing me to SCREAM and instinctively try to jump up, which caused all of the waiting terror to release immediately. It did so as I was standing up, which painted the back of the top of the toilet tank with a Jackson Pollock masterpiece. 

Oh and I bruised my grundle in the process. 

Fml today...
