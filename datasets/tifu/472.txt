This actually occurred about a year ago, when I was 29.  I was at my grandfather's wake.  He had wished that all of his grandkids (8 in total) would serve as the pallbearers.  My uncle (that had married into the family, and did NOT share the same last name as my grandfather) asked me to check the list of the names that he was going to give to the funeral organizer.  So I did, and the list looked like this:

John Smith (kids of the aforementioned uncle)

Jill Smith

Mary Smith

Dewey Delucio (me, sharing my grandfather's last name)

Amy Delucio

Ben Delucio

Samantha Delucio

Jane Delucio

The names looked fine, except for the fact that our last name is actually spelled with a capital L, meaning it was "DeLucio".  I gave a lighthearted, "Well, I mean it's WAY off, they forgot the Capital L!"

My uncle gave a lighthearted laugh back, but then paused and looked confused.

Uncle: What do you mean?

Me: The "l".  It's not capitalized.  But we don't really care.

Uncle: What do you mean it's capitalized?  No it's not.

Me:... um... yes... I'm pretty sure I know how to spell my own last name.  You don't share our last name but I assure you, it's a capital "L".

It was at this point my uncle swore up and down that my grandfather spelled it with a lowercase "l".  We went to my grandmother, standing by my father, and asked her about which it was.  She looked confused, but stated that it was indeed a lowercase "l".  But my father suddenly started acting strange. 

It was then that my dad confessed to a 50 year old secret:  He said that our name was actually "Delucio", but that when he was in 3rd or 4th grade he decided he wanted to look cool, and capitalized the "l" on his own.  He never got caught, legal agencies apparently didn't notice/care, and the name stuck.

tl;dr: I've been living my father's lie for 30 years.
