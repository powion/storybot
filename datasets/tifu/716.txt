Yes this actually happened today. A little backstory i been working for a electronics store and i recently switched positions for a pay raise. After switching i found i was actually getting paid less than what they said. After i reported they said they'd get back with me. So eventually they told me they sent a "email", its been over a month and i texted my boss fuming about my pay and he's like " Oh OP i was going to tell you you were being bumped up but with a attitude like that wait 90 days. "   

Edit: So I went in to work apologized to my other manager and he told me the higher up still hasn't replied to the email. So you guys are right my manager is a liar and a scumbag. I can't afford to quit but I am now looking for another job. If you guys want to see what I sent this morning to my manager I'll post it. Btw my first real post on reddit and I'm on iPhone sorry for typos. Thanks for all the advice guys. I want to marry all of you ;)
