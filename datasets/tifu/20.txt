My mom got me some chocolate covered pretzel bits for Christmas and they literally looked like shit.  I told my parents and they said they look like pretzels and told me to stop being ungrateful.  After everyone went to bed, I put a few of my chocolate pretzels outside of the cat litter box to make it look like the cat got shit everywhere.  The next morning I come downstairs and my family is complaining about the cat shit, so I decide to be funny and pick one up and take a bite out of it and laugh at everybody because I was right about the pretzels looking like shit.  I take a bite.  It's soft.  It's not a chocolate pretzel, it's fucking shit.  My family is howling with laughter as I run to the bathroom.  They knew what I had done and replaced my pretzels with actual cat shit.  I don't think I can ever show my face around my family again.  They keep telling me I can clean the litter box if I get hungry.

EDIT 2:  Thanks for the gold!  At least I got something out of eating cat shit.

EDIT 3: I'm glad so many enjoy my suffering.  I went to the doctor a few weeks ago and I am toxoplasmosis free.  Thanks for all of the concern!  My family still teases me every so often.  I am dreading a family get together next month.
