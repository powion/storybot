So I had a super shitty day at work today (and I usually love my work). It dragged on and on and on... finally after 15 hours of stuff I hate to do I crawled home. One thing that kept me somewhat cheerful is the thought of my girlfriend making dinner for me. She is an amazing cook so I was really looking forward to it. 

I get home and make my last call for today while she whips up dinner. She calls me, I sit down, pretty dead by that point, and she shoves a pot of something in front of me. I take a fork and eat it. 

Wow-omg, it's spicy noodles submerged in some sort of delicious soup! I had one sandwhich this entire day, and the noodles taste unbelievably fucking incredible to me. I devour them and with all but tears in my eyes tell my girlfriend this is the best thing she ever made, I am absolutely amazed, she should make this every week. Then I notice she's just sorta... staring at me. 

At this point I look down and realize what I am eating. It's fucking instant noodles from a dollar store, still in that freaking plastic bowl they come in. 

Apparently, I was braindead enough to: 

* crave instant noodles;
* wander into 24 hour store, buy instant noodles;
* thrust them into my gf's hands and inform her I don't want any of the steak and salsa she was planning to make, but in fact I want instant noodles
* having no recollection of the above, eat instant noodles and act like it's a god's gift to earth. 

Kids, don't let this become your life

**EDIT**: since this is still getting replies, might as well clear some stuff up. 

I actually got some sleep (since, you know, this post is 20 hours old). Not as much as I would have liked to but what can you do. 

My girlfriend did not, in fact, dump me on the spot, or banish me to the couch. She is a lovely and very understanding woman. 

I did not drive home. 

I eat my steak rare with no condiments, save occasional red wine sauce. Salsa makes for a mad side dish tho. 

My working hours are usually somewhat shorter (~12) and comprised mostly of stuff that I love to do. So no thanks, I don't need a new job. ~~I do however need more money~~

Also, people from the top thread, I meant reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/all/new/, but fuck if I know what actually happened to /r/new

Also, I am female, but didn't feel like correcting every single lovely person in the comments for making the standard reddit assumption

**TL:DR**: I live to eat ~~instant noodles~~ steak another day
