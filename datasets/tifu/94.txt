My wife and I have a 3 year old son who we love dearly. We often talk about how cool it would be if he were a twin. Then we could have two of them! So I offhandedly told her that in a parallel universe, it’s likely we have died and our son is alive. If we could just figure out a way to get him from his universe to ours, everyone wins. She’s been crying for two hours now over our parent-less son in another universe. And I haven’t even told her yet that swans can be gay.

EDIT: Alright, alright! I get it. I need to watch Fringe.
