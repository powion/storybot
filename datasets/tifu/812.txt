So I met a girl on tinder and she seemed really nice and pretty, so after a week or so of talking we decided to meet up, before I even met her at the bar I get a text that says you better not be in this for the sex... I didn't even bother answering, I get there and she is 50lbs heavier than in her pictures and later find out they were from 4 years ago... She eventually starts talking about how she isn't happy with her size. I am a bigger guy myself so I told her why don't you do what I do, I go to the gym and diet and I'm down 20lbs so far, she called me an inconsiderate asshole... So then later we started talking about snowboarding and I showed her pictures of my Vermont trip and she saw one of me and my close friend who happens to be a girl, well apparently she didn't like the fact that I had a close platonic friend because all she did was question me about her for an hour, I eventually said I'm sorry I have to go and left her with the bill for my two beers. As I'm on my way home I get a text that said look what you are missing out on, it was a nude picture of herself and two videos of her masturbating and the last text said she would have played with my g spot... It was not a pretty sight and I  just blocked her number... So yes that was my crazy date 

Edit: Plutonic to Platonic
