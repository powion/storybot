Pretty straight forward. About thirty minutes into a job interview of very mundane questions, I start to zone out. I used to work in childcare on cruise ships but my last role was in an office, similar to the new job I had applied for. Interviewer asks: "How did you find the transition from childcare to an office?" I respond with "Yeah it was great, really nice to get up and you know, wear pants to work." Cue  'oh shit' face. I start to sweat profusely, and proceed to make it worse. "Just to clarify, I wore pants when playing with the children. I always had pants on." Interviewers continue to stare deadpan. "I just meant it was nice to dress up and go to a more professional environment." Interviewers look at one another uncomfortably and proceed to end the interview shortly after. 
Edit: Guys. There's two spellings: pedophile and paedophile. I apparently chose neither.
Edit 2: TIL I'm really bad at spelling.
