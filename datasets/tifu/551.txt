So this really happened yesterday but it's still bad. So I was out shopping with my GF at a popular sporting goods store. She generally doesn't like going with me because I take my sweet ass time looking at anything I find appealing. Kinda like she does to me when she shops. It's a good way to get back at her for her shopping expeditions. Anyway, the entire time she was following me and she kept running into me. So I asked her, "Why do you keep bumping into me?" She replied, "Inertia..." Without thinking I said, "Well maybe if you didn't have so much mass..." Her jaw dropped so fucking fast she probably has lock jaw. 

Update 1: So I told her about the post and told her about what yall were saying. She found the post. Now I owe her something shiny and a margarita.
