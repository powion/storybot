I'm an 18 year old guy, and big surprise, I watch porn. However, today when I opened a downloaded video on my laptop whilst in my room, the screen was black with a flatscreen TV icon on the middle. So I skipped to about halfway through the clip to see if this would make it work, but then I heard fucking noises (literally) coming from the living room where my family, including my 10 year old brother, were previously watching Horton Hears a Who (fantastic family movie I know). Unfortunately however, this Dr Seuss flick was interrupted by a hardcore threesome porn clip, which my laptop was playing via the apple TV...
 
Safe to say my brother has been scarred for life, and my mum had a fantastic mother's day :)

**UPDATE**: for those of you curious of the outcome; my wireless has been banned, my parents think I'm a sex fiend, and my little brother is far more curious than scarred (which makes me equally proud and concerned). Oh, and a shout out to "the squad" who's going to be lending me their internet for the foreseeable future ;)
