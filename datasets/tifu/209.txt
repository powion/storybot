Holy fuck, reddit, this might be my biggest fuck up of all time... There's this girl I'm friends with that I've known for maybe 8 months or so who I've grown really close to.


 The thing is though that I live in Sweden and she lives in America so our communication is limited to snapchat and kik (don't judge, we're 15) so emotions are hard to recognize through text. 


Now ever since we started talking she would many times mention that she was going to the oncologist and having a session. Now for those of you who don't know; an oncologist is basically a cancer doctor, but since I'm not a native speaker I mixedthis word up with orthodontist. This was supported by the fact that she had braces.


There were several hints that proved that an oncologist wasn't infact a dentist. She once said she had cancer but I assumed she was joking because we had joked about dieseases before this. She brought up the cost of her medical visits to the oncologist as extremely much.Like several hundred thousand much, but I knew health care in america was expensive as shit so I just assumed that this girl went to a reaaaaalllyyyy expensive dentist (her parents are **loaded**). Ofcourse a normal person would realize she had cancer, but me? Nah, I'm retarded. 


Fast forward to 3 hours ago.


We had been talking for a bit and she sent me a picture of her smiling (with braces) telling me she was at the oncologist/doctor and that she'd be back in 2,5 hours. I told her good luck and watched a movie until she texted me "I only have 5 months left." I assumed she meant that her braces were coming off and I said "Congratulations, finally! :D" This is ofcourse bad enough but the fuck up doesn't end there... "..." She said and me thinking it was a joke about her dying said "r.i.p, [girl]. I bet you will go to hellxD" (bad joke regardless) she just said "fuck you, [lgoku], I thought you were my friend..." Then she blocked me. Me not realizing what just happened was kinda laughing to myself thinking she was pretending to be angry (we often did this). My friend asked what was funny so I showed him the convo and he just looked at me like I had killed someone. 

"Dude... You realize an oncologist is a cancer doctor, right?" That's when I realized I had fucked up.

TL;DR Told a terminally ill girl that she would go to hell.
