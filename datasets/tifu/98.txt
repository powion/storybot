I am a travel RN.  I just started my new shift at a hospital in Texas.  In the nurses station, there is this grey button on the wall that kind of resembles a garage door opener.  I asked a few nurses what the button was for, and no one seemed to know.  Naturally, I pushed it.  Nothing happened.  No lights came off or on, no secret doors opened up. I pushed it a couple of times really fast, thinking something might happen, still nothing.  So I go and sit down to continue charting.  Within a minute, four security guards came running, one from each entrance.  They were all sweaty and out of breath- with panicked expressions on their faces.  Turns out, that is the button you push when someone has a gun or bomb.  You'd think they would've  mentioned this in orientation.
