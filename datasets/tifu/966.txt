My daughter recently went to the the ER when she ate Valentines Day candy that was processed in a factory with nuts. Since she is very allergic, her mouth, tongue, and throat started to swell up. It was by far her worst reaction ever. She is fine now but I started making double sure we had an epi-pen with her at all times. We have three at home so I figured all is good.  

Cut to today, I was looking for something in the "junk drawer" and score! I found two more! I opened one, it was the test/training pen that doesn't have a needle. I opened the 2nd to find the expiration date - 2011! Dang it! About this time my daughter walked up and asked what I was doing. We talked for a minute about the expired pen, I could see in her face she was getting worried again after going to the ER last week. To reassure her I said - "Look how easy it is!" Flipped the top and stabbed myself in the leg.   

Why I thought I had the tester in my hand, I don't know. But I very quickly realized that it was not the training pen but the real thing. I pulled my pants down and yep, I definitely stabbed myself. Luckily I didn't hold it in for the required 10 seconds so perhaps I got a small expired dose. It's been about an hour and my heart is still racing a bit. I just did laundry and started the dishwasher. I can't sit still. I am guessing I won't sleep much tonight.  

On the plus side, my daughter was thoroughly entertained and I can now honestly say it doesn't hurt at all. Like a pin prick and that's it.   

If anyone has any epi-pen questions I will be up for at least 3 more hours. -___-  

TLDR; If you have and expired epi-pen in your house stab it in a piece of fruit to get rid of the meds and throw it away! Save yourself!
