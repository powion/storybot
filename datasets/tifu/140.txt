I walked into work today at 7am after ruining a $300k piece of art last Wednesday. I had a meeting with my curator that reassured me that I wouldn't lose me job. He told me that next time I was sick, I should tell him. I asked him what about Linda. He told me not to worry about her. I carried on with my day, anxiously waiting for the weekly work meeting that Linda usually heads. It usually starts at noon, but the curator started it early cause some big shipment was coming in. Long story short, he told us Linda resigned, and will be going on to 'bigger and better things' and we should all keep her in our thoughts. Now the curator is in charge of everyones schedule/requests for time off and he has his favorites, which I'm one of. Now half of my co-workers hate me, and I can't walk into a room without getting dirty looks.

TL;DR - RIP Linda and me
