There's a couple of things you have to know about me for any of this to make sense. Firstly, I went to a small rural high school where everyday knows everybody and there's very little protocol for anything out of the ordinary. Secondly, I had recently had some heart problems, so I had been wearing a heart monitor that alerted me when my heart was beating irregularly. Thirdly, I'm a classic good girl who had never broken a rule in my life. In fact, until that fateful day I didn't even know where the principal's office was. 

So here's what happened. For my physics class, I had to complete a project called "The Egg Drop Project". I'm pretty sure this is a common assignment for basic physics classes, but in case any of you don't know what it is allow me to explain. Basically the idea is to drop an egg onto the ground from 20 feet up without the egg breaking. Some people built complicated contraptions while some people just wrap the egg in bubble wrap and let that sucker fall. I decided to put my egg into a small box, fill the box with cotton balls, and close the box with duct tape. Now, my physics class was my last class of the day, so I decided to just set it inside the class room, put my name on it, and come back for it later. I thought that would be fine because I left projects in random classrooms all the time and no one ever messed with any of them. However, this time was different. Someone found my project and thought it would be funny to open up the classroom window and set it outside. I guess they thought that I would walk into the classroom, freak out because I couldn't find it, and then we'd all have a good old laugh about it. Wrong. So wrong. Apparently a student was arriving late to school and noticed a small, cardboard box just chillin' outside of the building and decided to go tell the main office about it. 

So there I was, minding my own business, sitting in my 4th hour class, when a rushed, slightly panicked announcement came over the loud speaker. They called my name and asked me to come to the office. Immediately. I was already freaked out because I had never been called to the office before. But honestly I just assumed I had forgotten something at home that my mom was dropping off. When I got to the main office all of the secretaries were just staring at me. They all looked oddly pale, and they were not saying anything at all. I asked them if I had a package or something, and one of them just pointed to the principal's office and told me that they were expecting me. Okay. Weird. I was getting really nervous, but I didn't want to ask questions so I just went in anyway. I entered the room and there was my principal, my vice principal, and my egg drop project just sitting on the desk. I sat down across from them and I honestly didn't know what to think. The feeling in the room was so tense. No one said anything for so long and just when I couldn't take it anymore the principal said, "This was found by a student outside of the physics classroom. It has your name on it. We have called the police and they're on their way. We need you to tell us right now... is this a bomb? Do you have a detonator on your person? And if it is, in fact, a bomb I need you to tell us how to disarm it." I was shocked. I honestly didn't know if I should laugh or scream. Looking back on it now, it is absolutely ridiculous that a box containing an egg and bag of cotton balls could cause so much drama. But at the time I was scared out of my mind. I was getting ready to explain everything and apologize when the worst possible thing that could have ever happened actually happened. *beep* *beep*. My heart monitor. It had registered my nervousness and increased heart rate. It was dead silent in that room except for the sound of that beeping. All three of us just stared at each other, not moving, not even breathing. It started slowly and quietly, every second getting louder and faster until it actually sounded like a full-out action movie explosion countdown. The two grown men in front of me began to panic. One of them grabbed the intercom system and screamed "**EVERYBODY GET DOWN, WE'VE GOT A BOMB IN THE BUILDING!**" The other one grabbed the box and kind of just ran around the room with it. Meanwhile, I was yelling at them trying to explain that it wasn't a bomb and the beeping wasn't me trying to set it off. The whole thing probably only lasted 10 seconds, maybe less. But the panic in the room mixed with the screams from the secrataries outside made it feel like everything was in slow motion. When I got my wits about me I grabbed my monitor and pulled it off of my body. The beeping stopped, and they finally calmed down enough to hear me say, "IT'S NOT A BOMB IT'S AN EGG IN A CARDBOARD BOX AND I HAVE FUCKING HEART PROBLEMS." 

Eventually, I explained everything. We didn't exactly laugh about it, but I got to go home for the rest of the day. So that was cool. Also everyone at school knew me as the girl who brought a bomb to school, and I made it into the graduation speech. So at least I have that going for me. 

**TL;DR: Having heart problems is, in fact, NOT da bomb.**

**Edit: Okay. Quite a few of you are wondering why they would bring the box into the building if they thought it was a bomb. And honestly I wondered the same thing. The only thing I can come up with is that because my school was so small and they knew I was a good kid they didn't actually believe it was a bomb. If that's the case then they probably just planned on bringing me in so I could confirm that it was just a harmless egg in a box. They did end up changing their entire policy after this incident, and they added a bomb threat drill.**

**Edit 2: Reading through the comments (especially the ones who so kindly and respectful shared their opinion that this post is 'bullshit') has really shown me that people have no idea what's going in small towns like mine. It's not uncommon for people to bring weapons into the school. People have pocket knives attached to their backpacks and rifles in their vehicles. That's just the way it is. I don't actually care if people beleive my story or not, but the point is this shit happens all the time. It's not super unusual.*


Edit 3: Sorry I'm editing so much, but I want to answer the most common questions! 

1. The egg DID survive, but the police took the box away. So I had to remake it. I eventually got all the points on my project. :)

2. Pretty much it was common knowledge who put the box outside, but he didn't get in trouble. I think everyone involved was just embarrassed and they wanted to put the whole thing behind them. 

3. I appriciate all the concern about my heart! I'm alive and well. I have neurocardiogenic syncope, and I'm taking medicine that pretty much allows me to live normally!
