Last Wednesday, the girl of my dreams asked me to go to prom with her.  I readily accepted, and that was that.   The only problem?  I'm a girl as well.  My parents thought that I was straight, so I decided to tell them that I was bi that day to get it over with.

So, I go to my mom, and tell her that I need to get a prom dress this year.  Where I go to school, only seniors can go to prom unless you are asked by one.  As a junior, my mom automatically wanted to know which hot guy asked me.  When I told her who it was (let's call her Stephanie) my mom had an..... Interesting reaction.   

She told me that it wasn't funny to make fun of lesbians.  They are people too, and deserve respect.  She doesn't care if I go to prom or not, but I have to be respectful of others.

This led to a mildly awkward mother-daughter conversation in which I tried to convince her that I was, in fact, a bisexual

**TL;DR I forgot it was April Fool's day 

EDIT: Wow, I left for school, came back and this blew up! Thanks for the gold and the support :) 

For those wondering,  yes Stephanie was serious.  She wanted 'April Fool's' to be her response  if I turned out to be straight.
