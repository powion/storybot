After class the other day, I went to pick up my younger sister at the middle school. When I got there, I was shocked to see her getting beaten on by an older girl, with a few others looking on. She wasn't even fighting back. She was just curled up, covering her face.

I broke into a run and yelled for them to leave her alone. The girl who was hitting her just sort of looked at me, probably thinking I was some aftercare worker coming to shoo her away. "She started it!" the bully lied. Bullshit. I shoved her out of the way and checked up on my sister. She had some scrapes, but otherwise seemed okay, just shaken.

I've never seen her so scared, though. Tears were just pouring down her face. The bully girl didn't give a fuck, tried to pin the fight on her, and grabbed a fistful of her hair. Well, shit, I kinda lost control, and decked her upside the head. Her friends started screaming, and they all scampered off. I took my sister inside to get cleaned up by the nurse. She promised to let the principal know about our scuffle.

That night, our parents got a phone call. Apparently, I punched that girl so hard that her jaw dislocated, and her dad was shitting himself with rage. My parents think I did the right thing, but we could potentially be in some legal trouble. We know the bully's family has no case (multiple witnesses could identify her as the aggressor and my sister has a black eye), but they could buy a good lawyer, which is much more powerful. We'll just have to see where this goes.


TL;DR Punched a kid who was attacking my sister, may get sued
