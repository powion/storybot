I'm a cashier at a grocery store. One of my friends is a regular and we joke around a lot, usually it starts by me refusing to ring up her groceries and we have a few laughs from there. 

Yesterday was a fairly busy day. I see her get in my line behind the customer I was ringing up. I finish the transaction, so my friend is next. I'm still putting money in my drawer, so without looking up I loudly say "Ma'am, we don't serve your kind here." Usually at this point my friend laughs and makes a remark right back at me, but this time there was only silence. I look up and see not my friend, but a black woman with a shocked look on her face. My heart drops into my feet and I start to apologize but she puts her basket on the floor and walks away.

The front end manager was running the next register over and saw the whole thing. I was fired on the spot. I tried to explain the situation but she just said "Punch out and leave right now."

I later found out that my friend had forgotten something and had to get out of my line. The black woman took her place. If I had looked up I would have seen.

Unemployment hearing is next Thursday.

EDIT: Gold on a throwaway account???
