Warning: NSFL

I'm currently remodeling alot of my house and last night I started sanding and pulling nails in our stairwell. So as a nude sleeper I hear my wife screaming at 6:00am and being the good husband I am I fly out from under the blanket on my bed and start making my way down the stairs only to trip over the hammer my lazy ass left out. At this point I'm in full somersault mode and after falling for what felt like 15 seconds I came to a crashing halt but I could feel this overwhelming pain and started calling for help. When I started checking myself I realized what had happened my ballsack had caught a loose nail and torn completely open , I had a perfect window into them and when I stood up one of my balls were falling out of the sack. Here is the kicker,  On the way to the hospital I asked her why she screamed "oh....I saw a spider". I just left the ER with 18 stitches.

Edit: added nsfl tag

Edit #2: thank you for gold and thank you for the kind words the pain killers are working great and I get to take a week off work so don't feel to bad for me.
