 normally we 're supposed to send it up in a stack with other computers but i was curious to see if the hard drive had also gotten an <unk> treatment 
 i plugged in our <unk> to usb <unk> cable 
 nothing 
 no drive spinning no being recognized by <unk> nothing 
 adding to the total repair costs in my head this made it about $ 1500 including a new hard drive 
 i walked back downstairs to deliver the news 
 & gt & gt slowa : your hard drive and all your data is gone 
 & gt & gt fluser : oh 
 that 's ... oh 
 & gt & gt slowa : ... yeah 
 if you 're interested in new computers i can recommend a few cheap ones that are pretty <unk> 
 & gt & gt fluser : are they macs 
 & gt & gt slowa : ... no 
 & gt & gt fluser : oh ... i have to talk to someone about this before seeing what i can do 
 i gave her the now sealed macbook pro <unk> hard drive which was sitting on top in a bag 
 & gt slowa : okay we 're here <unk> if you 'd like advice 
 & gt & gt fluser : thanks have a good day 
 & gt & gt slowa : you too 
 hope it gets better than this news 
 fluser left i immediately told my co-workers i needed to go wash my hands as soon as she walked out the door 
 fluser never came back which means that she probably bought another $ <unk> facebook machine 
 i work part time in a university library at a 24 hour computer lab 
 i do basic it support and other maintenance tasks 
 last night at around <unk> a student comes up to my desk in a hurry saying her computer is acting up 
 we walk over to where she was working and she sits down to reproduce the problem 
 she let 's call her <unk> is a <unk> student writing an <unk> in ms word 
 & gt <unk> : look when i type it does all this weird stuff 
 i 'm afraid to touch anything & lt starts hitting a few keys & gt text suddenly <unk> search box opens 
 & gt me : <unk> i see 
 i think it 's just <unk> i lean towards the desk tap the top of the monitor a couple of times and say & gt me : hey computer 
 stop that 
 while i subtly remove her <unk> from the <unk> key 
 & gt me : okay try now 
 she has a look on her face which i 'm sure you do n't need me to describe 
 slowly she begins typing and it magically works again 
 & gt <unk> : what the ... 
 how did you do that 
 & gt me : some times they just need a talking to 
 and the book 
 *a <unk> approach to situation <unk> -- - <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> i <unk> the bus which would take us to board the plane 
 a lady was storing her phone in her purse 
 i noticed she was calling someone 
 she did not notice that 
 now i had a terrible <unk> <unk> fight 
 should i tell her 
 will she ask me why i was <unk> her phone 
 but being an it sort of guy i think : <unk> whatever let 's tell her 
 she might lose lots of money if the other side does not cut the call '' <unk> it seems you 're calling someone 
 i do n't know if you intended to do that 
 <unk> 
 oh 
 thanks 
 she hastily grabbed the phone obviously to end the call 
 but ... the phone was calling and her finger was just on the light sensor 
 so the screen would n't turn on and she would n't be able to end the call 
 ok am surely she 'll move the finger any second '' she <unk> <unk> the power button <unk> <unk> 
 oh god ... she wo n't '' she <unk> a bit more 
 holds the power button for a few seconds 
 <unk> 
 tap 
 ok i hope i do n't sound like a <unk> '' <unk> ... your finger is on the ... she hastily moves her finger and the screen <unk> 
 she seems annoyed at the device but then smiles at me 
 <unk> she checks there was n't anyone at the other side of the call 
 and hangs and stores the phone 
 yay 
 i can go back to my <unk> used to work weekend <unk> support for a tech company that provides software where the user base is supposedly technically inclined 
 the story starts with a phone call as many do 
 & amp nbsp me : thank you for contacting x sup '' <unk> whistle <unk> my <unk> port ... is that a train '' 
 customer : yeah sorry about that we are at a train station '' me : well that would explain that '' 
 <unk> enough info to start a ticket** 
 the customer 's company is a train company which means train <unk> going off in the background at various points 
 & amp nbsp the issue is that our software is n't able to communicate with other computers running of our software 
 the customer mentions several times how he the network admin and the cio could n't figure out what was going on while i gathered info to create the ticket 
 they had a call with their ceo <unk> in all three of them calling us while still in a conference call 
 & amp nbsp admin : <unk> the error message which is something similar to 'no connection could be made because the target machine actively refused <unk> me : ok so it looks like the issue is network connectivity 
 can you ping computer x '' 
 admin : lem me check 
 nope 
 ca n't ping '' 
 me : well it sounds like you need to find out why the computer itself is n't responding '' admin : <unk> to go off on why this is an unacceptable answer when cio <unk> cio : wait so would it help if that computer was on '' 
 & amp nbsp now you would think that years of working help desk would prepare you for questions like this -- but when three people two of whom are it and paid more than you fail to realize that something has to be powered on to work you get stunned 
 this <unk> meant a few seconds of silence on my end while i tried to figure out exactly how much more they were paid 
 & amp nbsp me : ... yes 
 yes it would '' edit : i can google how to format reddit posts 
 ltl ftp i 've wanted to write up this story for a while now and since it 's the end of the year and things are looking a bit slow now might be the right time 
 for the record : i 'm a web developer 
 which means i develop websites and web applications for a wide <unk> of customers ... when i first came to work at a company with my freshly printed <unk> degree one of the customers had let build a website that was rolled out into multiple countries with multiple <unk> and multiple languages 
 because the static content was the same for every version of the website we used <unk> files for <unk> which is still standard procedure <unk> 
 one of the first tasks i got was to sit and think with a senior developer about the chinese version of this website 
 as it turned out a certain form on the website gave a <unk> error whenever a user tried to fill in an address 
 the weird thing was that this only occurred on the chinese production environment and not on development testing or acceptance <unk> 
 this made the entire issue a lot more complicated since we had no easy way to <unk> the error 
 after a couple of weeks of thinking <unk> trying consulting and failing we still were n't getting any results 
 to the great frustration of our <unk> customer of course 
 now let me remind you that this was back in the day that browser did not have built in language detection or <unk> 
 after all this time my fine colleague decided to translate the production website 
 he discovered that the fields of address '' and <unk> '' seemed to be switched around on the chinese production environment and only that environment 
 using this lead he was able to finally track down the problem 
 as it turned out the chinese <unk> of the site wanted the address '' and zip code '' fields switched around 
 because we do n't understand a single chinese character they had access to the <unk> files we use for <unk> 
 so instead of asking us to switch around the fields they switched around the labels on the form 
 this resulted in the zip code field being labeled as address '' and vice <unk> which resulted in users filling in their address in the zip code field which obviously resulted in the <unk> error ... -- - this is the <unk> story i can remember from my career thus far 
 maybe i 'll come back to write up another story in a while 
 for <unk> now i wish you a happy <unk> 
 edit : fixed <unk> edit 2 : as pointed out by <unk> i probably mean <unk> code '' rather than zip code '' <unk> <unk> just sent me this she works as a csr at a cellphone repair shop 
 gut laugh ensued 
 **customer : ** so yeah this is the 3rd time we have brought this phone in and it 's still not charging 
 <unk> : ** sir there 's <unk> in your charging port 
 previous work was crazy 
 too many things to get done not enough people to do them 
 i sat at my computer <unk> working with a <unk> outlook 
 a knock at the door saved me from having to deal with more .pst files 
 i looked up with a smile hoping the knock at the door would lead me away from outlook 
 & gt headhr : hey airz 
 i’ve been <unk> uh oh 
 & gt headhr : the kids are coming soon and this <unk> head of hr <unk> her arm over the doorway <unk> 
 & gt headhr : well its a little dull isn’t it 
 i looked around at the department 
 looked functional 
 perfect 
 & gt me : i think its fine 
 i really should be getting back <unk> i didn’t really want to get back to outlook but its better then <unk> design 
 & gt headhr : no don’t get offended 
 i just mean some small changes make it look a <unk> you know… & gt me : right now it looks like a work place 
 i want to give those kids an <unk> experience 
 my smile at head of hr held until i turned back to outlook 
 headhr didn’t seem to find that as a cue to leave however instead she walked further into my office 
 & gt headhr : well earlier today i was talking to grey 
 you may not know him 
 lovely older man down in … 
 & gt me : yes yes i know him 
 i really wanted to rush this along 
 it work was piling up 
 & gt headhr : he asked me what kids liked 
 he said i was good with children i helped him pick a background <unk> <unk> really 
 i thought as i tried to work and listen at the same time 
 & gt headhr : anyway that got me thinking since i’m meant to be helping you… maybe we should make this place a little more <unk> 
 head of hr had paused for a reply 
 i however was too busy actually working 
 eventually she continued 
 & gt headhr : so i got these it related posters 
 headhr bent down to her bag i hadn’t realised she was carrying 
 she <unk> the first poster 
 <unk> in black 2** & gt me : errr… i didn’t know what to say 
 it wasn’t the worst poster she could have <unk> i guess 
 & gt headhr : i know its a little old but… we could only get older posters 
 nice helped me pick these it related posters actually 
 she said she might come help you with the children too 
 & gt me : these posters are it related 
 headhr was busy <unk> the second poster 
 **the <unk> - <unk> & gt headhr : the <unk> is all about computers and stuff right 
 i guess i couldn’t argue with <unk> 
 head of hr then <unk> the third poster 
 & gt headhr : this ones my favorite 
 <unk> in the <unk> & gt me : where did you… 
 & gt headhr : personal collection 
 i slowly took in the whole third poster 
 it was completely japanese 
 & gt me : its got a semi naked lady on it 
 & gt headhr : you’re getting <unk> boys 
 they’ll like it trust me 
 i tried to continue working ignoring headhr but she was smiling at me 
 waiting 
 & gt me : i don’t think <unk> appropriate 
 to put up posters at work 
 & gt headhr : ive got them in my office 
 headhr seemed offended 
 i tried to correct my stance 
 & gt me : posters are fine for a personal space but i can’t put them up on shared walls 
 plus i don’t even know what that last one is… & gt headhr : it’s nice though right 
 don’t worry 
 i’ll put them up 
 nothing to do with you 
 headhr smiled at me 
 i decided to just get back to outlook 
 no point arguing just block out all sounds 
 just <unk> 
 i looked back at my screen outlook going fine 
 i looked out my door again 
 head of hr had put up posters around the department 
 i couldn’t see the ghost in the shell poster 
 & gt me : must have changed her mind about it 
 i said to myself as i got up to close the door 
 sitting back down on my chair i tried to relax before continuing work 
 i stared into space 
 then i noticed it 
 ghost in the shell poster 
 stuck to the wall of my office 
 next so this started off as a reply to another story and turned into a full blown if short tale in its own right 
 it is kind of a <unk> but ... oh well 
 if you do n't like it <unk> it 
 a while back i was working a weekend shift when a lady called in with a vpn issue 
 specifically she needed vpn and the two factor <unk> app installed registered and tested 
 this takes about twenty minutes start to finish and goes faster when i just remote into the computer and do most of the setup myself 
 which is what i did 
 now the place i work uses a rdp app that causes the <unk> to disappear as soon as i arrive in the pc 
 usually people kinda freak out when this happens 
 this lady 's response was completely different 
 & gt **her : ** hey 
 my <unk> has disappeared 
 & gt **me : ** do n't worry your <unk> will return ... & gt **her : ** no 
 i like the solid black 
 is there anyway i can keep it 
 & gt **me : ** seriously 
 you want to keep it 
 & gt **her : ** absolutely 
 it is <unk> much easier to read 
 & gt **me : ** okay then 
 let me show you to do this 
 turns out she has a <unk> issue that made it hard for her to read the names of icons against the normal default <unk> 
 something to do with contrast 
 anyway when explained this to me i introduced her to the high contrast <unk> that windows has available for this purpose 
 then i set her up to use vpn 
 -- -- edit : more of my stories can be found here in the same vein as my other pilot story i thought i 'd share a more cringe worthy one 
 our <unk> was being repaired so all of the <unk> where operating out of a local <unk> <unk> field 
 for about 3 weeks everything was going good 
 that was until the best damn pilot ever '' needed to log some hours 
 we <unk> him out and he immediately goes the wrong way 
 we call the tower and tower radios for the pilot to stop because there is no room to turn around 
 the pilot proceeds to not listen and goes nose off into the field around the <unk> 
 this is where it gets good 
 there was <unk> where they ended up running off the way <unk> 
 instead of listening to the tower who told them to cut the engines while we get the two vehicle to pull them out 
 they proceed to <unk> full reverse this was a <unk> 
 i then heard the <unk> sound of 2 of the engine <unk> <unk> and <unk> out completely 
 they then shut the other engine down 
 the pilot and rest of the crew go to leave when our colonel shows up and asks them where they were going 
 the pilot who made the call to reverse told the colonel that since the <unk> was <unk> he was going home 
 i have never seen a colonel lose his <unk> before but it was the most hilarious and <unk> thing i ever saw 
 the next day the best damn pilot ever '' was out with use helping change the engines while the colonel stood there making sure he was doing the <unk> afternoon i looked down at the paper in my hand 
 i was pissed 
 earlier in the week i had given the entire phone roll out to youngsec i should have payed more attention 
 youngsec had given out all the phones successfully but on friday he came into the office 
 & gt youngsec : boss i’ve given out all the phones but i’ve run out of <unk> 
 & gt me : sorry <unk> 
 & gt youngsec : <unk> <unk> for phone credit 
 he passed me some papers showing our business account 
 i saw red 
 had the vp really gotten <unk> 
 and a months worth of credit for the entire company charged to the it account 
 & gt me : leave it with me 
 i got ta go see the vp 
 as i marched upstairs to the vp’s office i dreamt about a world where work was actually done in an office 
 it was weird 
 when i arrived at the office the vp wasn’t around his secretary informed me of the 5 minute wait till he returned 
 i decided to get coffee from the executive tea room 
 the coffee machine i had been led to believe was broken but it didn’t look broken 
 darn secretary was just keeping me from my coffee evil <unk> 
 i got a cup pushed down the <unk> and <unk> on the machine 
 *** <unk> *** *** snap *** *** <unk> *** it sounded pretty darn broken 
 i looked over at the secretary she didn’t seem to care 
 she was so lovely 
 i picked up my company mobile and called the sales manager who was still head building maintenance 
 & gt me : hey sales i’m calling in that favor 
 & gt sales : what is it 
 she sounded suspicious 
 so <unk> 
 & gt me : can you get maintenance to fix the coffee machine in the executives office 
 & gt sales : that all 
 & gt me : yep 
 that 's it 
 & gt sales : ill do it 
 but… why 
 it’s been broken for months 
 & gt me : maybe with coffee this place will start working properly 
 the vp arrived at his office i walked over to his office from the break room with a water 
 & gt vp : airz 
 i hear the phones are going down a treat 
 congratulations on a successful roll out 
 & gt me : they’re all <unk> 
 & gt vp : yep 
 i talked to the guy from the phone company he said <unk> paid means we can keep track of spending the easiest 
 i took a sip of water for strength 
 it was see through 
 & gt me : you said you’d cover the cost of the phones 
 why is all the ongoing costs being put on it budget 
 & gt vp : no 
 no 
 remember i said i’d cover the cost of the phones 
 not the credit 
 the water was urging me to calm down 
 be fluid go with the flow it was telling me 
 no i thought 
 water was wrong and stupid 
 & gt me : no 
 i’m not covering these costs 
 no chance in hell you can dump this on me 
 & gt vp : look its about better communication for an in increase information flow and its a new technology for the company 
 so basically its an information technology or it 
 i picked up the glass and drank the entire thing 
 hoping the <unk> go with the flow attitude of water would transfer over 
 it didn’t 
 & gt me : ring the boss 
 & gt vp : i don’t think… & gt me : now i almost shouted 
 it was close 
 my rage was being held in check by a string and it was <unk> 
 & gt boss : hey vp & gt vp : boss ive got airz here… 
 the boss was always fast 
 & gt boss : and he’s wondering about the phone credit situation 
 & gt vp : yes 
 i was just telling him how it’s an it expense 
 & gt boss : airz he’s not wrong 
 the vp got a huge smile on his face 
 it was the same face i’d have if the vp got hung upside down 
 & gt boss : but you shouldn’t have to offer new services without an increase in budget 
 that wouldn’t be logical 
 the vp hung up 
 looked like in anger 
 he wasn’t smiling anymore 
 & gt vp : fine 
 you’ll get a $ 10 per month budget increase for every phone 
 & gt me : but people are burning through that sort of credit in a <unk> & gt vp : well… you’ll just have to stop them 
 the evil smile was back 
 with a <unk> 
 i walked away 
 i hate the vp 
 and with $ 10 a month phone credit i could <unk> him that once a day ... for 2 whole days 
 : next older vp to budget 
 check 
 previous heads of department meeting i sat down with a heavy heart everyone was chatting they all had a pda 
 i nervously watched as the other heads of department showed <unk> different capabilities of the pda 's 
 nothing good can come of this my mind screamed 
 & gt saleshead : hey airz i 've er ... saleshead dropped her pda in front of me the screen was broken 
 & gt me : seriously 
 what the ... & gt saleshead : can you just get me the forms and fix it 
 lets skip the incredulity 
 the vp walked into the room at that moment he smiled at all the pda 's being displayed 
 he walked like he was <unk> 
 & gt me : it 's your fourth 
 four 
 in a week 
 what are you doing with these pda 's 
 a throwing competition 
 & gt vp : hey do n't stress airz 
 it 's just a screen no use ruining a lovely day over it 
 i watched closely as the vp took his seat 
 he wore a smile his tie was loose 
 it looked odd 
 & gt me : she 's broken four screens in a week 
 i think perhaps we should revoke ... & gt saleshead : revoke 
 no 
 i need my pda 
 vp ... saleshead looked pleadingly over at the vp who was leaning <unk> back on his chair 
 & gt vp : ahh no 
 do n't worry i wont revoke any pda ... err.. privileges 
 airz will just have to fix it 
 & gt me : vp it 's been four screens now 
 the cost of keeping her with a working pda is just to high 
 & gt saleshead : it does n't even cost you ... the vp smiled at both of us 
 he held up his hands to stop us from talking 
 & gt vp : you both look stressed relax a little 
 airz luckily you wont have to cover the costs of replacing the screen that 'll continue come from my <unk> budget 
 okay 
 & gt me : it 's not just the price it 's the time 
 saleshead looked furious 
 she almost screamed 
 & gt saleshead : they only take 20 minutes to replace 
 & gt me : per screen 
 you 've had four in a <unk> 
 i looked down towards the vp waiting for him to just assign the job to me 
 however he lent forward and put his hands together 
 & gt vp : i 'll do it 
 & gt <unk> : ... 
 & gt vp : i 'll fix the screens from now on 
 & gt me : do you even know ... i remembered just in time who i was talking to 
 i shut my mouth 
 i looked <unk> over at the vp however his face was back to smiling 
 & gt vp : i know what you were about to say and do n't worry it 's my project 
 out of your hands now 
 & gt me : i 'm not sure if this is ... the vp cut me off 
 & gt vp : all this <unk> of your coworkers airz 
 it 's a good thing i 've <unk> a three day team work exercise 
 looks of confusion spread about the room 
 the vp however was relaxed and smiling 
 & gt saleshead : it is going on a team building exercise 
 why not sales ... & gt vp : no not it all the heads of department 
 a hand from the other end of the table <unk> slowly upwards 
 & gt vp : yes before you ask acchead 
 it is mandatory 
 acchead 's hand fell down with a <unk> his head <unk> dejectedly 
 darn 
 double darn 
 next this story takes place when i a student <unk> <unk> <unk> they needed that day for $ <unk> working in the financial <unk> office 
 my users were all office workers who despite working on computers all day every day managed to learn as little as they could about them 
 it was a day like any other day when i receive an e-mail from upstairs with the subject i <unk> <unk> '' and no body 
 *well this is <unk> 
 i head upstairs and find $ <unk> desk 
 & gt $ me : so what seems to be the trouble 
 & gt $ <unk> : i just bought this new <unk> keyboard last week but today whenever i put my mouse into word or outlook it just starts typing the letter k over and over 
 & gt $ me : huh ... do you know where your old keyboard is just so you can have something to work with while i investigate this one 
 *oh god i know nothing about hardware 
 i hope there 's nothing wrong with this <unk> & gt $ <unk> : yeah it 's right down here 
 *points at the tower under her desk* so apparently instead of <unk> her old keyboard $ <unk> had just found an empty usb port plugged in the new one and moved the old keyboard to the nearest flat surface off of the desk 
 and there 's nothing wrong with this and everything was working fine but that morning $ <unk> had moved a book off of her desk and on top of the old still plugged in keyboard 
 i pick up the book 
 & gt $ me : ok try putting your cursor in word now ... <unk> into <unk> and no stream of k 's 
 & gt $ <unk> : <unk> of <unk> do n't tell anybody about this ... edit : formatting and <unk> originally posted this to tales from retail but it never got approved so ... hopefully it 's <unk> technical enough for here 
 * this is an ... interesting tale 
 it happened mostly a few years ago and i decided to keep it to myself because i did n't want to expose anything 
 as the tale will tell though i do n't believe i need to hold back any more 
 my current job is somewhat retail related 
 i do mostly pro av system design and sales 
 while we have a small store front with some display cases most of our clients are big corporate education and government 
 the store front is for all <unk> my office 
 the flip side of this company is production services 
 we do a lot of <unk> <unk> av <unk> and <unk> events in our area 
 wireless <unk> are the <unk> at most of these events and the <unk> ones we use all take a <unk> battery 
 we will always change batteries during breaks or after an act to make sure things do n't drop out 
 we often wind up with trays of <unk> <unk> 's for recycling after a show 
 as a courtesy to some customers we will give out some of these <unk> 's 
 they 're still mostly good and they will run small things like a radio or a <unk> pedal for a few hours 
 so if asked we 're usually pretty generous with them 
 one day about two years ago a guy pulls up in a rather expensive car not naming brand because it might narrow things down and asks if we have any used <unk> batteries kicking around 
 sure i say and grab the beer flat they 're sitting in out of our repair bay 
 the guy grabs a dozen or so and heads on his way 
 a couple days later he shows up again this time with a <unk> in hand 
 he explains to me in a clearly not satisfied tone that some of the batteries were completely dead and they did n't work so he was going to test them this time 
 a bit irritated about being <unk> for the free batteries he was n't happy with i grabbed the box and let him have at it 
 as he picked through them getting a little bit upset about how many were dead i asked what he was using them for 
 oh i 'm the landlord in an apartment complex 
 i replace all the smoke detector batteries with these ones 
 at this point i took my tray back and told him to get out 
 we were n't going to be a party to him being a <unk> for not spending a couple bucks on <unk> batteries 
 no incident he just left 
 what makes me tell this story is what happened today however 
 i see the distinctive car pull into the parking lot which i remember because it 's rare around here and one of my dream cars 
 c : hey 
 you guys used to have used <unk> batteries here 
 can i have some 
 me : no sorry 
 we do n't give those out anymore 
 c : oh 
 i used to work at a <unk> and we 'd come get them from you all the time 
 me : yeah 
 some <unk> was using the dead ones in his <unk> smoke alarms so we had to stop 
 i looked him dead in the eyes 
 he knew i knew who he was 
 he just nodded and left at that point 
 dude do n't cheap out on the safety of people under your roof 
 i 'm not going to be a party to it and now you 've forced me to tell this online 
 tldr : <unk> landlord goes up in <unk> you all know in the eyes of the dreaded end user being it <unk> means that you have an <unk> for fixing anything with a screen on it 
 i thought this one took the biscuit though 
 & gt **me** : <unk> typing away pretending to be <unk> & gt <unk> <unk> : there you are 
 i had n't moved all day & gt <unk> <unk> : got a bit of an it issue in reception 
 can you have a look for me 
 & gt **me** : what kind of issue 
 & gt <unk> <unk> : well it was working fine earlier but now it 's not 
 descriptive as ever 
 i assume it 's the usual label printer crap i always get from her and head to reception 
 i start walking towards her pc and get stopped short 
 & gt <unk> <unk> : no over here 
 *points at coffee <unk> & gt **me** : <unk> ... what 
 & gt <unk> <unk> : so i was putting the tray back in and accidentally broke the ... & gt **me** : can i just stop you there 
 this is n't an it issue 
 i would n't know where to even start with this 
 you need a ... coffee machine engineer or something from the supplier sorry 
 <unk> <unk> & gt <unk> <unk> : well this one is so <unk> i just thought it 'd be practically the same as the other computers 
 what do you look after then 
 & gt **me** : hardware and software supplied by it 
 so stuff like your desktop pc your label printer and a few programs 
 *long silence* & gt <unk> <unk> : what about the radio 
 because that 's broken <unk> was a guest at a big <unk> park i ca n't remember which one at the moment 
 coming off one of their <unk> roller <unk> the exit led you right through a little <unk> with about eight <unk> <unk> where you could view and order overpriced prints of yourself looking <unk> at <unk> points on the ride 
 there was one young lady <unk> among the <unk> helping guests with any questions one <unk> was powered on but with an out of order sign displaying a message like connection to server lost '' on the screen 
 waiting for my <unk> who wanted to ride again leaning against the wall by the offline <unk> i noticed the ethernet plug was not fully seated in the network jack on the wall 
 actually that 's an <unk> - it was just barely inserted at all held in place by <unk> and happy memories and <unk> nothing else 
 & gt me : excuse me miss 
 this <unk> that 's offline i noticed it is n't plugged in to the network and that would explain the error on the screen 
 & gt <unk> <unk> : oh i really do n't know anything about computers or networks or anything ... & gt me : i 'm an engineer at $ <unk> and while i do n't know your system here i can tell you with 100 % <unk> that this network plug is not inserted correctly and could very well explain this error message 
 it really ca n't hurt to go ahead and plug it in 
 & gt <unk> : i do n't think i 'm allowed to touch those 
 i do n't want to get in trouble 
 & gt me : ok. just so we 're clear you did *not* give me permission to do this 
 and i plugged the cable in 
 the error message went away 
 & gt me : hey look it fixed itself 
 <unk> & gt <unk> : i ... but ... you ca n't just ... uh i mean thank you 
 & gt me : for what 
 it fixed itself remember 
 - so i was fresh faced in my first real it guy '' job 
 the day i started i found out after 2 weeks with the current it guy i 'd be on my own as he was moving to another position 
 we <unk> around a bit in the morning waiting for something to do and then bill called 
 bill started with the company about 30 years ago 
 he installed air <unk> and now he 's been at the company longer than just about anybody 
 a lifetime of <unk> loads up <unk> had ruined his knees so he 'd been parked in the office scheduling jobs for those younger than him still out in the field 
 after my <unk> hung up the phone he warned me 
 bill is a pc <unk> 
 he is the definition of <unk> 's law 
 get used to it you 'll see a lot of him '' 
 and he was right 
 for the first two months i worked here i saw bill more than any other employee 
 it was <unk> 
 why did n't he just stop fiddling with settings 
 the issues were never big there was just so many of them 
 no one else gave me these issues 
 so i just asked him 
 i 'm a <unk> '' 
 bill said 
 i guess after all the years of finding ways to install the air <unk> i get a bit bored with the day-to-day in the office '' 
 i thought this over and it made sense so i started to take a different approach with bill 
 when he had an issue instead of giving him the fix and sending him back to work i started showing him how to fix it himself 
 if i did n't know i showed him how to google a solution 
 over time bills calls dropped from 3 a week from bill to 2 then to 1. i 'll never forget leaving work one friday and bill grinned ear to ear at me 
 he had n't called me once that week 
 so now we fast forward to a month ago 
 the company had grown a lot since i started and recently changed ownership 
 my workload was getting a bit big to handle on my own 
 the new owners were all about efficiency 
 of course their first order of business was to remove users internet access 
 they were kind enough to let me put a pc in the break room for employees on lunch 
 and what happens when you let 50 people have access to 1 pc that none of them need to do their job 
 it gets treated like dirt 
 at this point someone told me the <unk> wanted money to unlock the internet computer '' 
 i put my head between my hands and <unk> 
 i had so much to do this could wait until tomorrow 
 come the next morning i check the computer and it boots just fine 
 i asked the girl from bills team who had reported it to me 
 yeah bill fixed it last night 
 he 's so good with computers '' 
 i was gobsmacked 
 the constant problem that was bill had googled a solution and fixed it for me 
 turns out he 'd been the first point of call for his whole team before they came to me for a few months now 
 then we come to 2 weeks ago 
 as the newly named head of it '' though for now it was still just me i was sitting in on my first management meeting 
 we were discussing a new it hire 
 i was given approval to <unk> out someone to be my assistant 
 and that is how bill came to work it it 
 this guy in his early <unk> has a <unk> to learn that most people half his age lack 
 he 's big enough to admit to a mistake and is willing to take on any challenge 
 this morning during a quiet period he proudly showed me a website he had built in <unk> for his nephew 
 all self taught 
 he never <unk> to <unk> me 
 goes to show that some users are idiots others are just untrained it staff 
 i do desktop support for a k-12 private school and do freelance work on the side 
 due to the nature of my job many of my clients are <unk> from users at my day job -- usually their home computers or mobile devices or kids computers or the like 
 a couple of months ago i got a call from a recently retired staff member who used to be the administrative assistant for the <unk> department 
 surprisingly for her age she is actually <unk> tech savvy but still at a user level 
 she figured out that she had accidentally gotten a virus and wanted me to make a house call 
 so i get there right after work <unk> her development is about 500 feet maximum from the school -- yeah she worked there a while 
 i jumped on her computer and took a look 
 everything looked fine except for a file in her downloads folder 
 it was n't an executable though 
 it was a <unk> file 
 & gt me : well that 's funny 
 it looks like the virus is written in java 
 i 'm sure it 's <unk> 
 i 'll make sure it 's no longer running and you 'll be good to go 
 i did a <unk> check and it seemed like it was running from the downloads folder so i deleted the <unk> and went on my way thinking that was that 
 no such luck 
 a week later i got a call from her at work 
 & gt <unk> : i think there 's a big problem with my computer 
 my bank account was hacked and the hackers transferred $ <unk> from my <unk> account to my checking account and tried to do a transfer out of the account 
 luckily i caught it in time and the bank is monitoring but i need to get this fixed 
 normally i do n't do freelance on the clock '' but given the urgency of the situation i decided to make an exception 
 i had her fire up teamviewer and remoted in 
 & gt me : okay let 's take a look here 
 that 's weird java is running 
 the <unk> had of course copied itself to the <unk> folder 
 cursing my <unk> rookie mistake i went into <unk> mode 
 i took a look around the <unk> folder and found a text file that looked a bit weird 
 i opened it 
 & gt me : <unk> this is not good 
 there 's a bunch of stuff in here that looks like usernames and passwords 
 yep 
 that <unk> java virus was actually a <unk> 
 they stole the password to her bank account that way 
 i did a significantly better job of cleaning her computer this time and a week later i managed to verify that i actually had cleaned it properly 
 but i am getting ahead of myself here 
 two days later around 9am i received an email from her sent over one of our distribution lists 
 & gt from : <unk> & gt to : all faculty and staff & gt subject : important & gt please refer to the attachment carefully & gt thank you & gt attachment : <unk> yep that 's right a <unk> file 
 the people who were using the <unk> to steal passwords had stolen the password to her school email account and sent out the virus to everyone in her address book 
 we suspended her email account but the damage was already done 
 as the <unk> department administrative assistant she had previously sent email to all the faculty and staff 
 she had sent email to parents and to <unk> employees at other schools 
 she had also sent email to the lost and found list to which everyone at the school with an email account was <unk> 
 this included all faculty and staff plus all students <unk> <unk> of course users being users many of them opened the attachment 
 the rest of the morning was spent in <unk> <unk> <unk> damage control mode 
 most of the students who clicked on it had macs that did not allow the <unk> to open because it was n't from an identified developer or chromebooks which do not have java 
 a few people tried to open it on mobile devices which also did n't work 
 but about two dozen <unk> tried to open it on <unk> desktops or laptops and about half of those people got infected 
 we did a lot of <unk> that day 
 i also took her computer home at the end of that day to <unk> windows but ended up figuring out that i had properly cleaned it the second time after seeing this virus on a dozen computers i got pretty good at seeing the symptoms 
 tl dr : do n't judge a book virus by its <unk> time poster with a short one for you : years ago i was the <unk> <unk> tech support for a small company 
 we had a fairly new $ manager to handle <unk> with the banks 
 he tells me that he hates his windows pc and needs a macbook because everyone says that macbooks are easy to use <unk> 
 i order his macbook and get to work making sure everything is ready to go for him the next morning 
 printers shared folders email accounts all set up 
 i set it up on his desk hook it up to the external monitor and other accessories and give the whole set up my nod of approval 
 an hour and a half into the day i had become suspicious at the lack of questions about his brand new setup when $ manager appeared suddenly at my doorway 
 & gt $ manager : i have a problem 
 he <unk> for me and without saying a word i pursue him to his office 
 he walks to his laptop calmly sitting on the desktop 
 he points <unk> and says : & gt $ manager : ... how do you open the damn thing 
 i honestly had a lack of words 
 my mouth opened but i was speechless 
 i <unk> my composure leaned forward and with a single finger lifted the lid of the macbook 
 & gt $ me : like ... this 
 & gt $ manager : <unk> * <unk> head * we ca n't even look at each other after that 
 i force something out along the lines of you let me know if you have any other questions '' but we both know there will be more questions 
 a lot <unk> 'm not a professional tech support but since im a programmer i do it sometimes for my family or friends and their families 
 someone has <unk> me to their friend so i got another <unk> 
 as soon as i got to the place i follow the mother to the room with a pc 
 it seems that this was a normal <unk> family with a <unk> son and two rich parents who got him a giant gaming pc 
 while the machine was booting up after i pushed the power button the mother said that <unk> they bought the pc for their son on his <unk> he sits more in his locked room '' 
 so the windows booted up she points the <unk> tools '' icon on the desktop 
 she 's sure that this is <unk> program and it keeps her son there 
 i hardly resisted to facepalm 
 the next 30 mins i spent explaining this that it 's not devil 's software and this program is needed for cd to work 
 i did n't want to explain her what is <unk> and why it 's needed 
 good thing <unk> her son came back and with his help i explained her that this is not evil 
 well i knew that most people in <unk> are very religious but i have n't met someone so <unk> 
 no <unk> *edit : i know what 's a <unk> 
 i 've been using linux for 12 years now 
 somehow she <unk> that it 's <unk> <unk> previous as arrived back down in it not even the crowd of begging users could dull my mood 
 i grabbed a coffee and headed straight for my office 
 with a smile on my face i was met with redcheer who oddly hadn’t left my office 
 & gt redcheer : airz 
 back so soon 
 & gt me : everything is sorted 
 i smiled and took a victory sip of sweet coffee 
 & gt redcheer : so quickly 
 but how did you… wait where is defiant 
 & gt me : <unk> of battle i’m afraid 
 don’t worry he’s in a better place now 
 i couldn’t help but joke around 
 i’d won 
 redcheer looked at me oddly but took it as a sign to leave 
 i decided to get some real work done 
 email time 
 i read the first email it was from the vp 
 **new email** to all heads of department recently it’s come to my attention that it has older pda’s it is handing out to staff 
 these pda’s are mostly for <unk> and as a diary 
 however i’ve personally looked into the market and found newer models with wifi and emailing <unk> 
 i believe these would greatly help heads of department day to day 
 therefore i’m <unk> a meeting this afternoon to decide which pda would be best for all heads 
 <unk> vp 
 & gt me : oh god 
 the phone on my desk started to ring 
 the coffee in my hand told me not to pick it up but i had too 
 & gt vp : airz 
 it’s the vp 
 & gt me : oh ... & gt vp : got ta make this quick but can you make a presentation on the different pda choices for the meeting this afternoon 
 & gt me : wha… & gt vp : great thanks 
 got ta dash 
 bye 
 the vp had hung up 
 as i sipped my coffee i realized this wasn’t the coffee of victory 
 it was the coffee of defeat 
 i pushed it away with disgust 
 i went to get another coffee 
 a planning coffee 
 ***** upon arrival at the meeting i was jumped by an eager looking vp 
 & gt vp : thanks for this by the way 
 he proceeded introduce me to room 
 & gt me : ahem 
 okay… first off i’d like to ask if anyone has any pending concerns about <unk> i was staring directly at headhr who was trying her best to avoid eye contact 
 <unk> the head of security had his hand up 
 & gt headsec : does this presentation come with a slide show 
 my head fell in defeat as i realized headhr wasn’t going to honor our initial agreement 
 luckily i had <unk> the <unk> of <unk> help now the vp wanted pda’s 
 & gt me : yes 
 headsec bounced off his chair and eagerly collected the <unk> i held 
 he was <unk> attached to <unk> 
 i smiled at the audience and prepared myself to start plan b : <unk> everyone to death with useless information and make the choice of pda murky and delayed and hopefully never happen 
 * ***** & gt me : <unk> that’s why the dell <unk> with it’s video card will have <unk> performance for some applications 
 i took a sip of water and looked around 
 i’d just finished a 45 minute speech on the difference between 4 almost identical pda’s 
 half the room had tuned out however the other half was still wrapped in attention 
 & gt vp : i see 
 well thank for for that <unk> talk airz 
 i’ll open it up to the floor for discussion which device do you think would be best 
 talk of <unk> or <unk> filled the room 
 accounts seemed <unk> with the dell <unk> 
 it was <unk> no one could agree i heard headmarketing fighting with <unk> about the <unk> as a brand over palm 
 the <unk> of fighting seemed to make the vp angry 
 however the louder the room <unk> the bigger my smile 
 & gt vp : everyone 
 <unk> the room eventually <unk> down 
 & gt me : vp can i make a suggestion 
 if we waited just a little we could see the newer models come <unk> they’d have even <unk> features 
 i smiled <unk> to the crowd 
 nod were seen throughout the room 
 the vp however was not nodding 
 & gt vp : no no 
 i think we can all agree that windows for desktop is easy to <unk> therefore windows for mobile should be easy to <unk> to ... uh huh 
 next thursday afternoon : ok mr. teacher i 'm going to upgrade your computer 
 i 'm going to move all of these files you have saved on your desktop up to your home drive on the server for <unk> ok '' 
 sure thing mr 
 <unk> '' 
 friday morning 5 minutes after school starts : mr 
 <unk> 
 where are all of my files '' 
 good morning mr. teacher 
 i put them in your f : drive on the server 
 remember '' 
 oh 
 yeah 
 thanks '' 
 10 minutes later : whoa mr. <unk> what did you do to mr. teacher 's computer '' 
 good morning ms. teacher -- i upgraded it 
 what 's up '' 
 all the kids are saying you lost all of mr. teacher 's files '' 
 thanks mr. teacher 
 i really appreciate all the kids telling everyone i 'm incompetent because you do n't listen 
 i do have to admit i 'm pretty impressed with how quickly you managed to spread that nonsense <unk> the <unk> 90s i worked for a small firm that did software <unk> and hardware repair for local businesses here in the uk 
 a customer firm had an issue with one of their users 
 whenever she typed she would get <unk> characters appearing in documents <unk> mainly i think 
 the characters were generally space characters but others could appear too 
 the customer it dept had tried replacing the keyboard hardware drivers performed virus checks and all the usual stuff and were at a loss as to how it was happening 
 also - they could n't duplicate the issue either when they tried using her machine 
 it only happened to her 
 so anyway - my company 's tech guy got called in 
 he was a <unk> <unk> man whose english was n't perfect but by <unk> he knew his stuff 
 he visited the user and as per the previous attempts he could n't duplicate the issue nor find anything wrong 
 a little perplexed he asked the lady to do her usual work while he observed and thought about it 
 the problem started happening again almost immediately and he could tell why 
 the lady was middle-aged very short very round and very <unk> in the <unk> <unk> department 
 this poor man 
 this <unk> <unk> man 
 this man with a less than perfect grasp on the english language had to explain to the lady that the cause of her problem was her great big <unk> bouncing on the keyboard as she typed 
 problem solved 
 she required a different kind of <unk> 'll be fair to this lady and tell you up front that her native tongue is <unk> 
 that <unk> i get a helpdesk ticket that basically says that she 's been working on a project for her class she 's a teacher and she 's lost the files she was working on in a specific folder 
 so i log into the school system and have a look 
 to be honest i ca n't even find the folder she 's talking about so i email her back asking if she 's sure that 's where the files are that she 's lost 
 i literally do nothing except to look for that folder 
 about an hour later i get an email back : i have n't lost any files i just lost the colour blue in the files 
 but the problem is fixed now thanks for taking care of that for me '' 
 totally confused i consider trying to figure out what had gone wrong think better of it and send her back a nice no problem '' email 
 i 'm doing tech support at a little computer store in the mid 2000 's one day i 'm asked to meet with a few lawyers who want to start their own firm and need someone to set them up with all their it needs 
 they 're starting with nothing 
 i spend about 45 minutes talking to them 
 i work harder than i should to come up with a fairly <unk> approach - to save them money but also in the hopes that i can ask them for work once i finish law school 
 my pick list is fairly short : * 8 new imacs or <unk> for the 7 lawyers and 1 <unk> * 1 cheap <unk> for file storage * 8 microsoft office licenses * a monthly fee for <unk> hosting * 2 <unk> * various <unk> like cabling switching and the like 
 somehow they get sticker shock 
 i walk on over to talk to them about it 
 <unk> is the most tech savvy while gary is finance <unk> 
 gary : '' which of these can we do without '' 
 me : '' well not much unless you have some existing hardware or licenses '' 
 <unk> : '' nope 
 we 're all making a clean break from our firms so we wo n't have anything '' gary : '' what about this line 
 why am i being charged a <unk> fee '' 
 me : '' it 's a component that you store files on '' 
 gary : '' ca n't i store files on my laptop '' 
 me : '' what if you want to share it with someone else 
 what if your laptop breaks or is left in your car '' 
 gary : '' that 's not my problem '' me : '' ok. what if <unk> asks you to cover a hearing for him and you do n't know what it 's about 
 you could just grab it from the file share on the <unk> and bingo you 're ready for the hearing '' gary : '' we 'd have to do a lot of <unk> to pay off that <unk> thing '' <unk> : '' why do i need to buy email hosting '' 
 me : '' well i 'd imagine you 'd want your own domain name '' 
 <unk> : '' but my mac has mail already '' me : '' right but it would be cheaper to use a mail host than give everybody <unk> accounts 
 it 'd look more professional too '' <unk> turning his laptop around to show the mail application : '' no my mac has mail already '' me : '' right 
 i thought you 'd want separate email addresses so you can keep work separate from personal email 
 privilege and all that '' gary : '' whatever 
 why do we need so many office licenses '' 
 me : '' well law practices tend to be word and excel heavy 
 makes sense to give everybody access to that tool '' <unk> : '' but office comes with macs '' here 's where i screw up 
 me : '' well if you have a cheaper source for office licenses have at it '' 
 we go back and forth some more even to the point of <unk> about the <unk> of cat5 cable to string everything together 
 eventually we come up with a proposal without the office licenses 
 we set up the macs in their new office configure shares on the <unk> and leave them be 
 until 90 days later when their demo licenses of office expired 
 i never mentioned that i was a law student 
 i realized that i 'd rather work at a retail computer shop than work with these lawyers 
 another day taking escalation calls at my telco when question marks pop up in the eyes of my closest colleague 
 & gt frank : you wo n't <unk> the call i just put on hold 
 somebody called frontline asking us to seed a torrent on about a dozen different <unk> for their own movie '' 
 ... & gt bytewave : why '' 
 & gt frank : something about it 's going to be there anyway so let 's make the top result be a quality <unk> copy with <unk> <unk> 
 they want it to go up simultaneously with a hundred <unk> per tracker '' 
 & gt bytewave : well i can respect that 
 it 's not like i do n't have multiple <unk> full of <unk> movies and tv shows at home 
 well <unk> <unk> are actually a pretty great way to advertise 
 and if they want to pay we might be able to do it '' 
 & gt frank : no way 
 what department would ... '' & gt bytewave : unusual requests 
 four man team that just sits around all day waiting for this kind of thing to come up '' 
 & gt frank : never heard of it '' 
 i reach for my most powerful tool - the contact numbers - and dial 
 & gt <unk> : commercial services unusual requests division <unk> speaking '' 
 i patch him to frank 
 this may be the most useless department in the whole telco on a good day they get two calls 
 they 're there to offer creative solutions to any commercial client who wants something unusual vaguely related to us 
 i very much doubt that such requests even pays their union <unk> but at least we can say we have it 
 a couple months later ... bored on a slow night 
 we happen to be both working <unk> 
 & gt bytewave : so that movie <unk> tonight normally if they went through with it the <unk> ought to go up soon right '' 
 i never downloaded a professionally <unk> torrent before worth a try for fun 
 & gt frank : yeah it 's freshly up on <unk> at least 
 listing <unk> <unk> '' 
 & gt bytewave : i want to know what we 're <unk> it with 
 let 's try with the new <unk> link in our lab '' 
 in theory we <unk> to eventually <unk> 1gbps connections with that technology though it 'll only be possible in certain <unk> areas 
 the telco wants it ready <unk> so maybe this decade 
 & gt frank : okay it 's on 
 hah look all the <unk> have ips that can be <unk> right back to us with one look at <unk> 
 this ip class is for corporate use only '' 
 & gt bytewave : hah 
 but it hardly matters since we have the authorization of the <unk> holder 
 what speed do you have '' 
 & gt frank : hmm i 'm very far from the <unk> limit 
 we suck at <unk> '' 
 & gt bytewave : there 's only 6 <unk> we ca n't suck that bad '' 
 we run other tests and get similar figures 
 frank looks at the router i look at the cables 
 & gt bytewave : oh ffs who put <unk> <unk> behind the router we 're supposed to use to test a 1gbps link '' 
 whoever set it up failed to realize these ethernet cables rated for <unk> were n't meant for this 
 we swapped it for cat6 and immediately got 1gbps 
 at the senior staff meeting later that week frank told this story and we decided to send out a memo to all locations saying to replace all remaining <unk> <unk> from our labs 
 not too bad given this started over testing a torrent 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 short and sweet 
 anyone who has worked help <unk> desk has had a customer '' employee who is old and is used to their old methods and ca n't grasp the concept that the old way is not going to work anymore 
 my job has it posted on the internal homepage that to view your paychecks you must click this link 
 it 's a very detailed section explaining why you must click this link and why the new software <unk> the old software basically new software works <unk> directory so it <unk> me time from having to reset weird credentials once a paycheck 
 lady called asking for the old software credentials to be reset 
 i told her 5 times we do n't use that software anymore to view paychecks 
 told her we use blank now 
 she never asked how to view them ... <unk> kept <unk> she needed her old software credentials reset 
 i remoted in for fun reset it for her and watched her try to view her paycheck ... .. where 's the paycheck '' 
 i then had to direct her to the homepage give her a brief reading of what the homepage clearly stated <unk> big ol link click the link let it <unk> herself in and then get her to the link that said view paycheck '' 
 i then closed my connection as i was sure she 'd open it in front of me 
 yes she almost did as the page was loading as i was closing it 
 i 'm glad i <unk> my phone when on reddit while at work and use my own laptop as i 'm sure the network admin would read these posts and crack up laughing <unk> ... *cue iphone <unk> i reach over and grab the phone 
 it 's <unk> and the number staring back at me is listed as & lt - contractor - & gt noc '' 
 we 're cutting back on resources so we recently brought in a company that will handle help desk all of our alerts and after-hours call 
 that way we can free up resources 
 they will handle all tier 1 and 2 stuff we only get involved after they ca n't fix it or if it 's a serious problem with one of our 4 <unk> 
 i 'm the network lead 
 i gave very specific instructions to these guys on when we should be contacted on things and on top of that i 'm not the engineer on call so i 'm the absolute last line of defense 
 my phone ringing from these guys so early in the morning can only mean one thing it 's the end of my network as we know it 
 about the only thing that could have snapped me out of a deep sleep faster was a phone call that something bad had happened to my daughter or wife 
 & gt '' this is <unk> what 's going on '' 
 & gt * '' hi <unk> 
 this is <unk> in the & lt - contractor - & gt noc 
 we 're having a bit of a problem over here ... * '' great 
 i knew it 
 the sky is falling 
 the only time i 'm supposed to be contacted like this especially when i 'm not on call is when all hell has broken loose 
 the main datacenter just blew up or something ... i just know it 
 has there been a <unk> attack 
 <unk> 
 oh dear <unk> this is n't going to be pretty 
 did that giant <unk> i was reading about the other day hit the earth 
 i start rushing to my laptop ... & gt '' what 's going on <unk> 
 be very specific here what exactly are you seeing '' 
 & gt * '' the retail store in 13 miles south of <unk> nowhere is n't responding to <unk> and when we tried to login to the device we could n't 
 it appears that the password on our support account has expired 
 can you reset it for us 
 * & gt '' wait what '' 
 & gt * '' the password to our support account is n't working 
 i was wondering if you could reset it for me 
 * '' i stopped so fast that my feet actually came out from under me and i landed on my ass on the stairs 
 & gt '' <unk> did you just call and wake up the absolute last number on your phone list to reset your f # <unk> & amp ing password so you can troubleshoot an <unk> issue on a store that does n't open for another 5 hours 
 i 'm sure he could hear me contemplating his death on the other end of the line 
 & gt * '' should i have called someone else 
 * i do n't blame <unk> i blame the people that trained <unk> 
 i 've never spoken to <unk> i 've never met <unk> i 've never even heard of <unk> until this very moment 
 that does n't mean <unk> got off easy 
 after a quick tongue <unk> and telling him to have their project manager call me as soon as he gets to the office i explain that i am not a domain admin 
 i do not have the ability to reset his password 
 also are n't you guys our help desk 
 why do n't you reset your own password 
 & gt * '' yeah i think that 's a different department here 
 we ca n't do that 
 * & gt '' well call the fucking department that can 
 { breathe } better yet call & lt - server lead that does n't like me very much and who 's visiting family on the west coast this week but it 's a working vacation and he 's a dick anyway - & gt and get him to reset it '' 
 & gt * '' ok we 'll do that '' 
 click 
 * i calmly try to lower my heart rate as i walk back to my bed 
 i work from home so i do n't have to actually be awake for another hour and a half 
 i throw my phone on the night stand and <unk> back up under the covers 
 a couple minutes later my phone lights up and makes the text message sound 
 i reach over grab the phone 
 it 's from the server guy 
 & gt *i 'm going to kill you 
 this means war 
 * i smiled to myself and closed my eyes hoping to get a little bit more sleep before i have to get this day started 
 after all it is monday and i have a war to fight 
 whilst working at $ <unk> i discovered many deals and <unk> had been called in due to the <unk> <unk> of the $ <unk> 
 one of which took up an entire day 
 $ <unk> 's friend $ <unk> decided to shut his business to become a home <unk> 
 $ <unk> thought that over 40 clients would n't be any trouble and promised to look after his <unk> for free 
 he basically acted as the <unk> between the customer and domain name hosting companies 
 our problems started when $ <unk> began domain server <unk> so many customers had incorrect <unk> records and other hosting <unk> 
 calls like this carried on throughout the day from 8am to 2pm 
 most calls went like this : $ <unk> : hi how can i help you 
 $ customer : my website is down and it 's your fault $ <unk> : ok we are acting on behalf of $ <unk> 
 we were not aware of these changes and apologise for inconvenience 
 $ customer : well you should be aware i 've lost so much business 
 if you do n't sort this out i will leave your service 
 the above conversation continued for around 40 minutes with an angry $ <unk> who used her website to give her email address and phone number only basically a business card 
 she was <unk> to personal attacks and denying us to help her 
 eventually $ <unk> interjected thoroughly annoyed at $ <unk> for not informing us of changes turns out $ <unk> was informed this would happen 
 after the $ <unk> not listening and generally being insulting my $ <unk> took the phone from me and said : $ <unk> : i can understand why you are upset but after listening to this call you are offending my staff and being entirely unreasonable 
 we do not accept personal attacks or using bad language toward support staff when they are trying to help you 
 if you had listened you 'd know we are not being paid for this service to you and we do n't wish to hear from you again 
 please find a new provider 
 while most clients were reasonable and most had issues <unk> this could 've been avoided if $ <unk> did n't offer to pick up slack for free 
 to this day the clients website is still down because she would n't let us help 
 tldr : do n't do anyone free <unk> in it unless you want to waste an entire <unk> was more of a dog then an auditor 
 she followed everything i did practically walking in the <unk> with me 
 thank goodness for workplace laws preventing <unk> <unk> 
 getting back to my computer i picked up my coffee 
 i took a sip 
 tasted <unk> 
 the screen flashed red 
 huh that never happens 
 i took another sip of coffee 
 it never reached my mouth 
 the server room was reading critical temperature 
 i ran 
 when i arrived i looked down at our server room half the equipment had hit temperature warnings the other half wasn’t responding 
 & gt screechy : <unk> it so hot in here 
 & gt me : i don’t know 
 the air conditioner isn’t working 
 we went outside and found the problem a bar was sticking out through the silver fan of the air-conditioner 
 & gt screechy : i’ve never seen an air conditioner self <unk> before 
 i examined the air conditioner situation a large metal bar was placed between the <unk> on the fan of the air conditioner 
 & gt me : that 's not self destruction 
 that 's sabotage 
 & gt screechy : who’d destroy a air-conditioner 
 i looked at my hands i was still holding my coffee 
 i hadn’t split a drop and i’d been <unk> 
 good 
 i took a sip 
 it was a good question 
 next older i 'm not it for our company but i help a lot of the people in our office on basic things <unk> rights stuff 
 i share an office with our sales guy who struggles to write an email on a good day 
 he has an iphone <unk> that is tied to our company 's <unk> program and secured with mobile iron 
 this means that the lock code has to be 6 digits and changed every 6 months 
 & gt $ sales on monday : hey so i had to change the pin on my phone on friday then forgot it and tried too many times and now its asking for this <unk> password 
 & gt & gt $ me : let me look 
 oh you locked it and tripped the <unk> lock 
 you just need to put in your icloud password and it will <unk> 
 & gt & gt $ sales : i do n't have an icloud though 
 i never made one 
 & gt $ me : you do and this phone is a brick until you remember the password for it 
 i open up the icloud website and try to reset the password on there but he ca n't remember the answers to the security questions and the e-mail me '' link did n't work 
 & gt $ sales : f % # & amp 
 i do n't know what to do 
 all my clients call me on my cell 
 & gt $ me : lets try calling apple maybe they can help 
 we call apple on speaker so i can talk for him and they patch us to account security and he somehow <unk> their needs 
 & gt $ apple : we will email you a reset link to the new address you gave us in 24 hours 
 thank you 
 we wait 24 hours and he gets the link 
 clicks on it and it takes him to the page to create a new password 
 $ sales think very hard about a good password and carefully types it in one by one 
 enters it again 
 studies the <unk> and clicks ok. & gt $ <unk> : you must choose a password that you have not used previously 
 <unk> tale took place yesterday now i 'd like to <unk> this with i 've been with my current <unk> based company for under six months 
 i have n't once had an out there '' tale until yesterday and i nearly lost my job because of it 
 we had just hired ten new service specialists it was my job to ensure all of their personalized computers were running our custom bios <unk> a supported version of windows xp the company relies on programs designed in the <unk> 
 they refuse to hire anybody to update them 
 all of our service specialists are <unk> dual monitors for ease of access the goal of this new team is to speak to <unk> firms where the company make their big bucks everything needs to go smoothly otherwise they may take business elsewhere 
 then it happened 
 one uneventful saturday afternoon my phone rang 
 it was <unk> 
 i knew if i took this i would miss my bus but alas i 'm paid to do a job 
 so it <unk> & gt **me : ** hi it department what 's the -- -- & gt <unk> director sd : ** it 's sd on the phone get up to service now 
 *now usually i would just open a ticket from my nice perched seat and have the issue sorted out before five or <unk> it for the next working day 
 this was different this was the guy who pays my wages and the guy who could just as easily take them <unk> & gt **me : ** of course i 'll be there in two <unk> running to my bosses bank in the customer service office i knew i could n't forget my <unk> 
 stuffed with everything from <unk> of <unk> ethernet cable to plug and play usb fans 
 * & gt **me : ** hi sd what 's the problem 
 your pc seems to be on and in working order & gt <unk> : ** please tell me what i pay you for 
 if you ca n't see the issue i do n't think you deserve to work under my wing & gt **me : ** sorry do you mind telling me what is wrong 
 if i could have a picture i could work to diagnose the issue for you & gt <unk> : ** look at the two computers 
 & gt **me : ** * <unk> was i going insane 
 * sorry sd i do n't see two computers there is only one computer on this entire bank of desks for the new service team leader as you requested & gt <unk> : ** * turning a monitor in a fit of rage pulling out a power cord in the process * look 
 this says dell 
 get it 
 <unk> the other is hp 
 you <unk> 
 <unk> 
 fix it now 
 *he really thinks you ca n't just use a dell and a hp monitor on the same system 
 now i knew what was wrong how do i possibly word it without sounding patronizing 
 * & gt **me : ** well usually we would order dell monitors as they 're cheaper but supplier was out we took a batch of refurbished hp monitors to stay within budget 
 & gt <unk> : ** but that does n't fix my issue 
 & gt **me : ** there is no issue 
 you were using your pc perfectly fine until you found out you had two <unk> branded monitors there is just no issue 
 it 's fine 
 & gt <unk> : ** b -- but i was told by <unk> that it ca n't be done 
 something about pins or <unk> <unk> hold your <unk> my boss thinks a monitor is a processor 
 for context <unk> is my boss unfortunately 
 not all it service guys know and/or care for their job 
 i was told once she tried to convince one of my late peers left for a better pay that cleaning a pc is best done while it 's one as the fans will <unk> the air and dust for you 
 * & gt **me** you 're thinking of a processor that 's more behind the scenes stuff different brand monitors is just fine is there anything else i can help you with 
 & gt <unk> : ** * muttering * no thanks 
 i 'll call you if i need any more help i raised a resolved ticket as soon as i got back down to my building managed to troubleshoot one final problem <unk> the best thing i still caught the bus 
 <unk> - my <unk> + by <unk> short tale from days long past 
 only partially related to the actual tech support part forgive me : a few years back i was working for a travel agency in the it department and we had an issue with our airport desk 
 tldr : router hardware failure so the desk computers were n't able to connect to our network and they could n't easily verify flight <unk> <unk> as you can probably imagine a huge issue so off i went to restore the connection 
 now of course i was it 
 no uniform : i was wearing blue jeans and a <unk> t-shirt 
 since the network equipment was at the front desk i took a seat there and got to work with the two ladies actually working there standing at the next desk maybe five <unk> away from me 
 and to make things extra clear the sign on top read <unk> closed 
 try to picture it : two desks for the same company one <unk> by ladies in uniform waiting to help people the other for all <unk> and purposes closed with someone sitting there not wearing any kind of uniform or looking up at all 
 i was n't sitting there for five minutes when the first people came to *me* to ask for assistance even though i was <unk> ignoring everyone 
 as best i can tell it was simply because i am a man ... eventually as i had to spend several hours there until i had everything up and working again i made a little sign out of paper simply saying <unk> desk with an arrow to the correct desk and placed it in front of me 
 and *still* some people came to me first 
 <unk> with some <unk> to <unk> company recently fired their it staff and outsourced it to my company as a <unk> 
 the cfo of the company is very paranoid that the old it staff still has access to their network and computers despite reimaging their machines and locking down the firewall 
 earlier this week the cfo came storming into our room where we were at 
 they 're hacking my computer 
 right now '' 
 i asked what 's the issue '' 
 she responds every time i try to highlight a word the entire page gets highlighted 
 they 're highlighting everything on me 
 they have to be moving things around '' 
 i turn my head back to my computer and say i 'll be up in a second '' 
 looking at her desk she has a <unk> stack of papers all over the place 
 on the corner of her laptop sits the biggest stack of papers right on the <unk> 
 i move the stack of papers and all of the text highlighting goes away 
 we joke that we need to bring <unk> <unk> into the office when we 're here but some days i feel i truly need one ... this happens more frequently then i 'd like to admit : & gt me : that you for calling tech support can i have the phone number for your account please '' 
 & gt cx customer : my what 
 & gt me : your phone number please & gt cx : my phone number 
 obvious confusion in voice you mean for my account 
 & gt me : yes please & gt cx : is it on my bill 
 & gt me : it should be yes & gt cx : ok <unk> to self while reading <unk> phone number phone number is it <unk> digit account <unk> & gt me : <unk> to self and bringing account <unk> ... <unk> <unk> ... how do these people who call in not know what a phone number '' is i can understand if you do n't remember your own number because who ever calls <unk> but seriously these people give the impression of not even know what a phone is let alone how the buttons on the front of it work 
 <unk> alternative ending : & gt me : can you have your number please & gt cx : <unk> 7 digit <unk> & gt me : and the area code <unk> please 
 & gt cx : <unk> mailing <unk> & gt me : no the area code for your phone number & gt cx : is n't it <unk> <unk> & gt me : no like <unk> most common 3 digit phone area <unk> & gt cx : oh 
 it 's <unk> get the idea if you 've read this <unk> tl : dr <unk> will not help you relate with your customers better no matter how many times you <unk> your brain with it 
 edit : spelling is n't important it 's a phone conversation it all sounds <unk> anyway aka : i fixed stuff hi everyone 
 i work tech support for my local internet provider and although i get many calls a day regarding issues that are eye <unk> easy to fix this one really takes the cake 
 let me start off by saying i am no expert i was trained and have been working with the company for over a year now though and in terms of fixing the internet over the phone i know my shit 
 i get a call today a new customer who 's just received his router and stuff in the post 
 the first thing he says indicates exactly the type of person he is and i know it 's going to be an <unk> call 
 customer : hi i got your gear today and it 's not working already i knew i should n't have signed up to you guys it 's absolutely atrocious 
 me : okay sir i apologise for any inconvenience you 've experienced what 's the name of the router you 've received 
 - it 's worth noting that whilst i ask these questions i 'm pulling up their account and line on the computer my side he 's right the router has n't signed up to us yet and the line is showing as <unk> - we also send out a few different kinds of routers depending on what the customer wants and usually asking them is quicker than bringing it all up this side customer : <unk> <unk> it 's not working 
 me : i can see on this side the router has n't come online as of <unk> customer : exactly its absolutely ridiculous the service im on the <unk> of <unk> ive only just bought the damn thing 
 - the engineers have noted that it all should be up and running so i carry on despite him shouting now thirty seconds into the call me : right okay and what lights can you currently see on the router 
 - there 's a long pause where i almost think he 's put the phone down but no he 's still there 
 customer : well none 
 me : so not even the power light 
 customer : no i ca n't see anything on there 
 me : are you near your router right now 
 customer : yes it 's still in the wrapping it 's brand new 
 - here i actually pause for a good few seconds 
 he said its in the wrapping so has he <unk> it at all so far 
 me : so the router is still in its original <unk> 
 customer : yes 
 - so by this point after listening to countless insults not included here because it 's too long to type out it got me a little irate so i was a bit <unk> with the customer 
 me : so how do you know it is n't working 
 customer : well i just assumed i 've heard <unk> me : so you assumed your internet was n't working instead of trying it out yourself 
 customer : i was right though 
 - i want to <unk> my head on the desk at this point 
 me : how do you know you 're right 
 customer : <unk> it 's not on 
 me : sir that 's because you have n't tried to even plug it in yet 
 that 's like buying a car and never driving it because you just assume it wo n't work 
 customer : oh well i 'll try it and plug it in 
 me : okay sir once you have see if it works if you have any more trouble give us a call back 
 i put the phone down keeping his line up 
 i check his line five minutes later and magically he 's online 
 it 's amazing what happens when you actually plug in your shit before assuming it 's all broken 
 i honestly thought this was a <unk> call but the guy was being <unk> serious 
 a few years back i used to work for a computer repairs company and i was the one receiving calls and assigning techs to jobs 
 one of the things i learned early on in the job was to ask customers exactly what the fuck nothing works '' means generally by asking them to boot up their machine and talk me through what they 're seeing 
 this was because nothing works '' most times means this software i 'm trying to use does n't work the way i want it to '' 
 one morning i got this call : <unk> : my mac wo n't work 
 **me** : ok sir what do you mean 
 <unk> : what do you think i mean 
 i turn it on and nothing happens 
 **me** : can you please go to your computer and turn it on 
 walk me through what you 're seeing or what 's happening exactly 
 *now i hear the guy walk through a few rooms and sit down on a chair* <unk> : it 's loading 
 **me** : ok & amp <unk> <unk> : there 's the windows flag on the screen now 
 **me** : wait what 
 <unk> : the windows loading screen thing 
 i 'm not sure why you 're having me do this 
 i already told you what 's the problem 
 **me** : sir i thought you said you had a mac 
 <unk> : yes 
 this is my wife 's pc 
 **me** : i asked you to boot up *your* computer 
 <unk> : but mine 's not a computer it 's a mac 
 <unk> meet desk 
 *so i work for a major isp and at the time i was doing residential internet support which entails basic ethernet and wifi connectivity 
 to <unk> this customer who we will call <unk> had called in multiple times prior to speaking to me that day 
 me : thanks for calling isp this is <unk> speaking how can i help you today 
 <unk> : yeah i have been speaking with you stupid <unk> % & amp # $ f* # * $ @ # for the past 7 hours trying to get my s @ * $ hooked up and none of you idiots can seem to figure it out 
 me : okay ma'am can i please get your insert verification requirements <unk> : swears for 4 minutes about verifying information before providing me : thanks <unk> now from notes i see that you are trying to connect a few tablets an <unk> and a laptop is that correct 
 <unk> : i do n't know what the f* # this all is its all my <unk> <unk> % & amp and he told me to call you idiots to get it hooked up you all suck by the way 
 *at this point i 'm guessing i am going to have to walk her through a direct connect to retrieve the wifi password from the router so time to find the <unk> me : okay <unk> do you know where your router is and can you tell me if it is plugged in 
 <unk> : i 've told you f & amp $ * % # s it 's this thing hanging on the wall with all the <unk> lights me : okay thank you for verifying that now can you see if the little <unk> are lit up so i know if you have any devices plugged in over ethernet 
 <unk> : all the stupid numbers are lit up <unk> $ hole me : thanks for checking that so 1 2 3 and 4 are lit up so you have 4 devices plugged in are any of those computers available 
 <unk> : there aint <unk> plugged in to it a & amp $ hole unless you want me to rip it off the wall and look at the back me : so there are no ethernet cords or power cords plugged into it that you can see ... <unk> : did n't i just tell you that idiot 
 me : but the little 1 2 3 and 4 lights are lit up ... <unk> : i told you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 0 are all lit up you stupid f $ * and if you ask again im going to loose my f % # % temper wit you *our routers are 4 port standard routers the wtf could clearly be seen on my <unk> me : ... where on the wall is this router located <unk> 
 <unk> : right next to the f # * $ % & amp heater thing where your f # * $ * % guy put it why the f # * does that matter 
 me : so there are numbers 0 through 9 on the router they are lit up the router is mounted on the wall and there are no cables that you can see ... <unk> : <unk> into a <unk> of high pitched <unk> and swear <unk> *suddenly <unk> me : does this box have buttons that say police or fire 
 or maybe little pictures of a cross or a <unk> on them 
 <unk> : yeah why you <unk> i got ta press these and get <unk> police to come fix my internet 
 me : no no no no no no do n't press anything 
 that is your alarm system not your router <unk> : you <unk> to tell me this not my internet box 
 are you high mother f* $ % # *my head is in my hands staring <unk> down at my keyboard 
 also at this point <unk> starts <unk> crying and <unk> and she either tossed the phone down and walked away or threw it across the room ... either way she became background noise 
 but then i hear a <unk> voice getting closer child : <unk> did you get <unk> <unk> working 
 <unk> 's <unk> crying in the background and the child picks up the phone* child : hello 
 me : yes i 'm here did your mom not want to me to help her anymore 
 child : i <unk> shes in the <unk> yelling about you ... me : whats your name miss 
 child : <unk> mister 
 can you make my <unk> <unk> work so i can play it 
 me : do you know how to use the computer <unk> 
 <unk> : yes mister i use it to play games and sometimes for homework 
 i 'm only in the 3rd grade though so not so much for homework me : okay lets see if we can find your router ... the rest of the interaction with <unk> was just as adorable 
 basically i walked this ranting <unk> 8 year old daughter through hard wiring to the router logging into the <unk> resetting the password and wifi name and getting the <unk> both tablets and the laptop connected 
 it took us a little over 20 minutes for everything start to finish 
 i wish it was n't so insulting to just ask for someone under the age of 20 to troubleshoot customer issues : me : retail i.t 
 support 
 how can i help you 
 store manager : yeah so our receipt printer was printing really slow 
 and a customer got so mad because it was printing his receipt printer so slow that he started grabbing the receipt printer and slamming it down on the <unk> me : what the… are you serious 
 store manager : yeah he got really <unk> and started calling me names and threatening to break stuff in the store 
 me : <unk> you <unk> called security 
 store manager : well we’re in <unk> 
 i’m just glad i didn’t get <unk> 
 me : hey thats not funny 
 you have that guy’s name right 
 you should call security 
 thats not cool 
 store manager : yeah maybe i should 
 but stuff like that happens all the time 
 customers <unk> 
 <unk> over clothing racks 
 threatening to come back and break the glass 
 me : are you kidding me 
 we need to report this guy 
 so the printer is busted now 
 its going to take a couple days to send another one… store manager : well… actually… 
 after he did that to the printer its been working really fast now 
 me : oh… 
 store manager : yeah… i think his <unk> fixed it 
 should i still report him 
 me : hmmm 
 maybe he can come back and fix the rest of the issues at that <unk> reading my tales knows i work as a senior tech for a unionized telco but one topic i 've not written about yet is that i 've also done quite a bit of it for the union itself 
 it was many years ago 
 i can live with <unk> <unk> corporate secrets more easily than our union 's 
 but still there are a few tales worth telling safely by now including how it all began 
 one morning at work many years ago while i was pushing tickets in my cubicle there was a bit of a commotion 
 a rare <unk> had just been spotted below my <unk> the union vice-president for call centers <unk> by a few stewards and a <unk> <unk> 
 since most it personnel in north america is non-union it may seem weird but here we say your manager is the boss you hate and this guy is the boss you love 
 always had our backs always the guy in the way if management wants to fire someone without extremely serious cause 
 if he shows up people drop any work just to get in line to shake his hand 
 he shook many but eventually came to my desk 
 i hit the hard switch on both my phone and my wireless headset 
 he nodded at one of the stewards with him and asked me quietly to meet with the guy downstairs over the break 
 i was already known to have the union 's interests at heart but that was the day when i learned they trusted me back 
 downstairs soon after ... & gt steward : got ta be brief 
 we think the union offices might be bugged 
 we need someone from tsss tech support 's senior staff to go over everything and say if there 's any chance the company are using their network to spy on us and if so to offer to the executive the best options to ensure this is no longer possible 
 people on the council <unk> for you but it 's going to be <unk> <unk> 
 in or out '' 
 that meant despite the union 's ability to formally order the release of any union employee from work hours with full pay i 'd be doing it on my own time because it was too sensitive for the company to know i 'd even be over there 
 i was <unk> but i was definitely not a <unk> for bugs guy 
 & gt bytewave : in 
 but i 'm not sure you want me 
 it should be handled by one of our union rf <unk> guys if you think our offices are bugged '' 
 there is a huge union team dedicated to rf <unk> working closely with regular road techs previously wrote a story about the kind of work they do here ... even <unk> uses equipment they 'd be familiar with as our rf <unk> team 's <unk> gear is entirely able to deal with <unk> too 
 & gt steward : well uh just come around <unk> it 's not a rf issue '' 
 and so i did 
 i 've never been too <unk> to admit my primary <unk> is to my union over my corporation and the mere thought the <unk> might be <unk> had me torn between being angry at the <unk> and being disappointed that the union were actually using the telco 's network at all - weak move whether there 's foul play or not 
 later that evening at the union 's headquarters downtown after going through the <unk> and the security door while - sadly - there was a perfectly normal door without any <unk> in the back i was greeted <unk> by the executive 
 it 's not uncommon they work till 10pm 
 the steward from earlier led me to 'the evidence 
 poured me a whiskey like we 're in a movie just as he powered up the computer i was meant to look at ... & gt steward : so we 've had this series of <unk> since last friday 
 dozens of them 
 it 's from some weird email address but has the telco 's business domain name 
 this means they 're trying to spy on us but screwed up somewhere right '' 
 it just took a single long glance before i groaned 
 just because you work for a telco does n't mean you have any technical expertise 
 there are dozens of departments here with zero tech knowledge whatsoever 
 in fact <unk> few union people are working technical jobs 
 from sales to recoveries to dozens of others many routinely call in-house it because rebooting is hard 
 i 'm still not sure how they made the leap from <unk> to <unk> though 
 & gt bytewave : ... yes it 's a <unk> no it does n't mean the telco hired <unk> bond to screw us over '' 
 i took out my phone and sent an email to the same address instantly got the same <unk> 
 & gt bytewave : they have an email that we 're constantly mailing to that is simply no long valid on their domain '' 
 the <unk> email address was simply the default for corporate replies and the hr person the union was communicating with had <unk> under <unk> circumstances without notice - meaning a disabled corporate email within the day 
 because this guy used to be a <unk> with the union he was automatically copied on several <unk> emails - just as the union was on several of hr 's 
 everytime the union automatically mailed something to the <unk> address on their domain they obviously got a <unk> 
 i explained that this whole thing was about a low-level hr <unk> quitting 
 and then i started <unk> 
 & gt bytewave : over the last dozen years we 've had *more than <unk> evidence the corporation is n't playing fair 
 i 'm not here to fix stuff anymore i 'm here as a <unk> member expecting reasonable representation from my labour union under the labour code and the union <unk> 
 i want to know who the hell ok 'd that the union headquarters use the only network where we can be <unk> spied on without any shred of trace or evidence - nor any involvement by the <unk> - by the company which repeatedly suggested everything would be better if there was no union at all - and played dirty at every chance '' 
 those who read all my tales will understand that i was n't kidding about the company not always playing fair ... union execs soon wanted to hear my point of view and thanked me with free chicken before taking me to the basement after dinner 
 at union hq sensitive conversations are held in the basement because nobody is physically allowed down there unless they are completely trusted 
 no computer or smartphone ever made it down those stairs 
 as <unk> as it may be you can still smoke down there and nobody cares 
 that 's where they asked me to be the union 's tech support 
 days later i got a <unk> card 
 simple name - but they 're offered only to union execs stewards and critical <unk> staff 
 they only work up to just about a dozen thousand hours a year as per the work contract afterwards the union has to pay the <unk> costs 
 therefore the union ca n't give them to just anyone and it 's a bit of an honor to get one without being <unk> to union office 
 it meant that i could afterwards just walk away from my job - fully paid and without notice - on union business at my own <unk> 
 from that moment on for about a couple years - on top of my normal job as senior tech support staff at my telco - i was also my union 's tech support and there 's a few tales i 'll write about that 
 & gt tldr : my union confused legitimate <unk> for <unk> then hired me as their formal it guy 
 it meant privileges including being able to <unk> my work at any time because they were impressed i figured out their <unk> in six seconds 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 so this is not a tale of networking <unk> nor is it tale of inept users 
 instead it is a wonderful combination of <unk> that i think you all will get a kick out of 
 so i work for a small company only 20 or 30 users and i do pretty much all the tech work including maintaining our servers 
 we recently added four more into our rack for another company that we work closely with who is also in our building 
 so the other company 's tech guy and i are working in the server room <unk> some network issues he is having with his new servers 
 i am at the back of the rack pulling wires while he is working on the machines <unk> with network settings 
 i hear a small <unk> and then smell a horrible foul smell 
 the other tech has decided to rip a massive <unk> in the tiny server room which was immediately pulled in by all seven of our servers warmed up to a lovely hundred degrees or so and then blown directly in my face by about 20 exhaust fans 
 and old lady extremely <unk> illiterate called to ask how to keep people from <unk> her monitor 
 upon further <unk> i discovered she was upset because the icons on her desktop were reset neatly to the left side every time she logged in 
 she had called previously and the agent she got on the phone told her the icons were <unk> to that side because her monitor was getting <unk> to the left wife : while i 'm at the store can you fix the vacuum cleaner 
 me : i do n't know anything about vacuum cleaners 
 wife : just do what you do half the time at work act like you know what 's going on google the correct answer play on reddit for an hour then go fix it 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- she works in the mental health field wife : every time i talk to you about the hours you work how much you make it always makes me question my career choice 
 i have to stop and remind myself that i <unk> to help my clients and am not supposed to worry about money 
 you do n't actually want to help your <unk> is a short story from about <unk> years ago in my days as isp support 
 i was speaking with this woman who was having issues connecting online does n't really know how to use a computer but we were making slow but <unk> progress 
 i go to give her a new dsl password since she forgot her old one 
 ok so i have just provided you with a password 
 can you please repeat it to me to make sure you have it 
 her : sure it 's a as in <unk> b as in boy c as in <unk> me : mam it 's actually a as in alpha not e as in <unk> her : that 's what i said <unk> 
 me : mam it 's actually a not e her : but <unk> starts with a 
 me : yes mam you have the right password 
 her : i thought so 
 thanks 
 all went well after that 
 she connected even though there was an <unk> in the room 
 tl dr : <unk> get it right 
 edit : seems like once i brew an <unk> i found myself a proper name 
 question is what kind of <unk> i should brew ... maybe something heavy 
 <unk> guys 
 <unk> apologies on the big delay in between we had an urgent installation due on a ship that was n't due for a few days come in today and i had to sprint a good <unk> 's to get there and fix it before they <unk> again 
 anyhow the <unk> of our meeting shall be revealed 
 going to give more info than originally intended because you 'll see : <unk> and 4 of us are outside one of our meeting rooms waiting for mr. boss 
 myself derp receptionist and <unk> husband henceforth known as <unk> * mr. boss : come in take a seat 
 <unk> shuffle to the table sit down 
 we are all nervous as <unk> is kind of intimidating in formal situations 
 after reading a few papers <unk> prepared for him meeting <unk> 
 * <unk> : it has been brought to my attention that there has been some breach or attempted breach of <unk> in this office - receptionist : sir no there - <unk> : - and further reports of harassment and lies being spread throughout the workplace - receptionist : - no that 's not true i just - <unk> : - and countless ... will you please stop interrupting me receptionist 
 it would do you good to listen 
 receptionist : sorry ... <unk> : derp has spoken to me about an incident which occured earlier today regarding <unk> permissions could you please explain <unk> x : uhm sure 
 the short story is that i was asked by receptionist to provide access to her husbands payroll file via <unk> 
 i refused to do so and explained why and she got irritated and told me to just <unk> my job which in my opinion is what i was trying to do 
 <unk> : really 
 <unk> receptionist i show you my slip every month 
 receptionist : no that is not true x is just making that up to make me look bad 
 derp : so this conversation never happened 
 receptionist : no it did n't 
 derp : and even though i was there speaking to you two about it together you are saying it did n't happen 
 receptionist : no well sort of

 x : but i <unk> you what the file was and why you could n't access it and you told me to do it anyway 
 <unk> silence 
 * receptionist : i only wanted to see what was in there because - mr. boss : that 's it i 've heard enough

 mr. boss : receptionist is it true you told <unk> random name her <unk> should have had an <unk> 
 reception : well ... she was only 17 i mean - <unk> : - i have never been as ashamed of having a person with that attitude working in my office 
 x how would you suggest we resolve this issue with the privacy and such on the computer networks just in case 
 x : well she only really needs office 2010 for emails and word maybe excel 
 she does n't even need to be hooked up to the net - receptionist : - but internet 
 *boss just gives her the death stare 
 * x : technically we can give her a <unk> that will give her internet access and no network access which is not needed 
 <unk> : perfect 
 set this up as soon as this meeting is concluded 
 x : sure no problem 
 <unk> : do you want an apology from receptionist 
 x : no thanks 
 i do n't really want to speak with her if i can avoid it 
 <unk> : i understand 
 receptionist x will do what he does with your computer and you will live with it

 *as we are about 5 feet away from the door closed and made of <unk> derp starts talking about how he is finally glad that she will be gone when we hear : * receptionist : fuck you you fucking asshole i know you fucked <unk> and i know that 's why you wo n't give me your password 
 you 've been buying her shit for the past two months 
 that 's why you wo n't show me your paycheck 
 <unk> : first of all what is wrong with you woman 
 i ca n't believe you just accused me of that in my workplace and are stupid enough to think that my outside purchases would appear on my fucking <unk> 
 *at this point i just ran away from the door just about pissing myself laughing while derp was just standing in awe 
 i felt bad about what had happened to her in a sense but my god is she one <unk> bitch 
 * what made her comment all the more <unk> about <unk> fake name is that <unk> is <unk> <unk> 
 from what i understand receptionist was escorted from the building by security i am still working on her laptop tomorrow as i have no <unk> word otherwise and <unk> has been given some time of for <unk> matters 
 i do n't know if i should feel sadness win or epic fuck yeah about this but one thing i do know is this : that <unk> bitch had to go and i 'm gon na love my job *that* much more

 thanks to the others that have posted them in the meantime very much appreciated previous tale here *** i 'd like to thank the three kind <unk> who have gilded this post 
 i am opening an account for <unk> named : college and studies <unk> aka <unk> 
 he has a future now thanks to you guys 
 *** <unk> i 'm looking after my <unk> yesterday and today and probably <unk> too because of no school and his parents work 
 we played video games <unk> on pizza all the fun stuff you do to spoil a kid 
 due to the on-call nature of my two jobs condo building general hardware it stuff and <unk> for <unk> i brought him along on my calls 
 most of them were pretty basic and not worth tales here but here are the tales that he solved 
 *** <unk> <unk> : my <unk> the hero of these stories 
 <unk> information like a <unk> 
 my pfy of these stories 
 named thus because his mother <unk> two of my fingers in the delivery room 
 i was there due to fate kicking me down and then stomping me repeatedly afterwards 
 coincidentally his hair is <unk> too 
 eight years old 
 <unk> : client i 'm <unk> for 
 seen in a previous tale 
 guilty of repeating previous issues 
 <unk> : <unk> to <unk> seen in previous tale 
 ** $ <unk> : head of security at the condo complex 
 takes his job seriously 
 listens to instructions only calls when necessary all the <unk> of a good user 
 <unk> : desk drone from hell 
 will complain about any and everything she can think of 
 *** <unk> are really <unk> yesterday 4pm 
 get a call from $ <unk> a security camera is down 
 this was an important one too 
 it pointed directly at the <unk> 
 it was mostly a redundant camera but it has a closer <unk> view of the <unk> in case anything happens <unk> on <unk> 
 it 's had a troubled history and usually goes out when it <unk> 
 so we head out to the security office 
 make <unk> exchange pleasantries drink an obscene amount of coffee 
 check the security monitors 
 yep it 's down 
 switch ports still no go 
 so we decide to go check it out 
 it 's <unk> pretty good out : a nice freezing rain 
 check out the camera through my cell phone camera 
 nope no ir light so in my infinite wisdom i decide that the camera is broken 
 i leave <unk> with $ <unk> and go fetch a replacement and a ladder 
 i return to see <unk> on his hands and knees looking at something on the ground with $ <unk> <unk> next to him 
 & gt <unk> : what do you think it is 
 & gt $ <unk> : looks like a <unk> 
 a <unk> eh 
 i come up to check it out too not wanting to be the guy left out of things 
 & gt me : looks like one of the <unk> for the <unk> box that holds the camera <unk> ... ... crap 
 so i head back to the storage room for a <unk> and an <unk> 
 and head over to the security office to <unk> the camera 
 i return get up the ladder open the <unk> and <unk> the <unk> box cover while water is just <unk> out onto my hands 
 good thing i <unk> that cable <unk> is a joke but it feels annoying 
 take off the cover and <unk> everything dry it out and hook up the new <unk> and reattach the cover with the <unk> 
 have $ <unk> go back to the office and hook the power cord labeled <unk> into the socket # <unk> he gets it right 
 on the first time 
 with nothing catching on fire 
 he radios me to tell me the camera is up 
 i climb down the ladder and confirm with my cellphone camera yep there 's the ir light showing up 
 take the ladder down hand <unk> the camera and we head back to put everything back 
 i call both the building it guy and $ <unk> and have them schedule a meeting to talk about better camera systems as we are currently using analog signal to <unk> and while not quite bad but not as advanced as the owner would like he wants everything digital redundant systems blah blah blah i 'm rich do it in this case i agree with him 
 me and <unk> go back to the condo for <unk> and <unk> coffee his was heavily <unk> down with milk and sugar but hey it 's a start 
 i email maintenance to report about the <unk> and to find out who lost it because it sure was n't me 
 *** <unk> sure is <unk> today 8am 
 this morning i did not feel like cooking breakfast for us 
 so i brought us over to <unk> place to <unk> i mean ... see if everything is alright yeah let 's go with that one 
 naturally <unk> is making breakfast and offers us some 
 i help her out with setting the table and whatnot while <unk> is watching tv in the office 
 all the while i can hear grunts of frustration from the office 
 just as i 'm about to go over to see what 's wrong i hear : & gt <unk> : what 's wrong 
 & gt <unk> : ca n't access company x files 
 if you have read my last tale you can see where this is going 
 & gt <unk> : <unk> out <unk> company y computer '' what does that mean 
 **my signs worked 
 ** yes he was being sarcastic 
 sure enough i hear the chair <unk> <unk> across the floor some typing and a relieved <unk> thanks kid '' 
 <unk> and i are trying to laugh as quietly as possible 
 those <unk> tasted like victory 
 as we are heading back to our condo : & gt <unk> : are they all like that 
 & gt me : who 
 & gt <unk> : everyone you help 
 & gt me : no he 's <unk> at best but he 's not the worst i can get 
 <unk> my <unk> come on let 's go enjoy ourselves for a bit we have one of the worst ones up later 
 a pfy is born 
 *** <unk> is the key to dealing with <unk> today <unk> after a good <unk> of minecraft pizza and <unk> soda we head down to the it room for the thin client deployment that i have to do for someone that could n't come in due to car trouble for the condo office 
 on our way down i explain what i do know about thin clients to <unk> and what we have to do 
 <unk> is excited this is something he can finally help with in his mind anyway he was tons of help in other places 
 we get the cart of eight thin clients and go to the desks 
 i <unk> the old thin client and hook up the new one 
 i give <unk> a <unk> with the security cable key on it and threatened him about what should happen if he loses it 
 he puts it on and says he wo n't lose it 
 i watch him set up one to make sure he sets it up the right way four cables and a security lock <unk> 
 would you believe that he plugged in every usb cable on the first try every time 
 i make a mental note to <unk> him for <unk> <unk> him <unk> ask for his secrets later 
 i finish my half and am on the phone with the head of it when <unk> comes back 
 & gt me : can you cancel luser 's rdp it 's lunch break anyway session 
 i 'm not going near her you know how she is 
 he agreed and did it and while luser let out a cry of <unk> and ran off me and <unk> got to work 
 we almost made it 
 of course if we did make it i would n't be posting this in here typing in all caps is <unk> and wrong 
 just imagine her <unk> and the text is in caps 
 & gt luser : what are you doing 
 & gt me : upgrading your thin client it has more -- & gt luser : why 
 i liked my old one better ... & gt me : i 'm just doing what i 'm told and this one has more -- & gt luser : what about my files 
 i swear to god if you lost my files i will end you 
 please note that i am dating the owner 's <unk> and i am probably as <unk> as you can get 
 well as long as i do n't break anything important set anything on fire etc 
 & gt me : these thin clients do n't work that way everything is server based 
 & gt luser : no it does n't 
 you ruined my files 
 <unk> walks up to the windows 
 & gt <unk> : actually thin clients are like this window 
 <unk> the <unk> see you are logged out 
 <unk> <unk> now you are logged in 
 see that tree 
 that 's your files 
 <unk> <unk> and walks to the window next to that one and closes those <unk> this is another thin client it is logged out 
 <unk> <unk> to that <unk> see the tree is still there 
 i am shocked i 'm standing there with my mouth open 
 that was pretty accurate and it ... worked 
 luser just sat down and stared at her monitor until we left 
 we 're back in the office of it head and <unk> is explaining thin clients again 
 the it head 's reaction was the same as mine 
 he began <unk> taking notes 
 & gt <unk> : can we head back now i think our <unk> are finished <unk> 
 the moment is ruined and we went back to our minecraft server 
 *** i 've been showing him the <unk> of a computer since then and he even put one together <unk> processor under my <unk> 
 he has drank the it <unk> 
 this kid is eight and better than most users 
 i just found out school is cancelled tomorrow too so i might be back with more then 
 *** edit : clarification on computer building 
 edit 2 : spelling <unk> in december 2010 when <unk> got hacked and their <unk> million passwords leaked i was following the breach and downloaded the file with all the passwords just to verify that mine was n't part of the ones released 
 mine was safe however i found around 10 or 20 email addresses <unk> to my university with cracked passwords and usernames 
 i decided that i 'd shoot off a quick email to the users involved hoping that they might at least pay attention to me if only because of the fact that the email would come from a university address 
 i typed up the below message and sent it out not expecting to hear anything back but felt good that i might have prevented at least one or two people from having a major security issue 
 & gt hey guys & gt & gt i do n't know any of you personally but your name is on the list of compromised <unk> passwords 
 if you have n't already heard the story go read one of the articles here : or here : long story short these guys got into <unk> and took <unk> million usernames & amp passwords 
 & gt & gt thought i 'd pass this on from on university student to another 
 stay safe out there 
 i got a few scattered emails throughout the next week or so from people thanking me for the heads up and i figured that was the end of it 
 fast forward a few weeks - i get an email from the campus post office telling me i have a package to pick up 
 i know i have n't ordered anything recently so i have no idea why i 'd have a package to pick up 
 i decided to <unk> over and see what it was - when i got there they handed me a small box with an amazon label on it 
 now even more confused i open up the box to find a white <unk> and a gift label with the following message : & gt hey there 
 & gt & gt i looked your address up on the campus directory - i wanted to give you a little something as thanks for letting me know about the <unk> password leak 
 here 's a white hat for a white hat 
 happy holidays 
 **tl dr : random guy gives me a white hat for telling him his password got leaked 
 <unk> lurking in the shadows first time posting 
 i work at an it help desk for a large company serving as front line it support 
 i just had this call about an hour ago : & gt **me : ** thank you for calling $ company it service desk this is <unk> 
 how can i help you 
 & gt **customer : ** hi i 'm having an issue with my account 
 sometimes it works and sometimes it does n't 
 & gt **me : ** alright let me take a look at your account 
 one moment please 
 from the caller id i notice he 's calling from one of our <unk> we have in public areas 
 these computers are for production floor employees who typically do n't have their own computers to access their personal benefits and other information 
 generally speaking they 're not the most tech savvy of the callers that we get so it 's usually a good idea to remote onto the machine and see <unk> <unk> they 're having an issue with 
 with his permission i remote on and see that he is in fact logged into the system 
 there are no errors and nothing seems out of the ordinary 
 & gt **me : ** so what exactly are you having trouble with 
 from what i can see everything appears to be fine 
 & gt **customer : ** well sometimes it works and sometimes it does n't 
 & gt **me : ** what exactly does n't work 
 i see that you 're signed in and i did n't see any issues with your account when i checked earlier 
 & gt **customer : ** i have to get back to work now 
 <unk> ... 
 okay 
 * & gt **me : ** okay no problem 
 would you like to give us a call back later when you have some time 
 i 'm still not sure what problem you were having 
 & gt **customer : ** i do n't know sometimes it does n't work 
 i have to go back to work now 
 bye 
 i know it 's friday but it feels like a monday ... my company does actually hire new employees at times 
 we have an <unk> rule : *all* work gets saved to the network drives 
 all computers get everything deleted every two weeks unless you 've saved it to a network drive 
 all new employees are handed a packet of information that they <unk> read through and initial after every <unk> that they 've read and understood it 
 this packet is then taken and stored in their personnel file 
 the information about all work having to be saved on the network drives is one of the things they must read and confirm by <unk> that they understand 
 call comes in yesterday 
 & gt '' this is <unk> <unk> how may i help you '' 
 & gt '' this is <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 i was just hired about two weeks ago 
 some of my work is gone '' 
 & gt '' that should n't happen 
 did you save it to the network drive '' 
 & gt '' no ... i saved it only to my local computer '' 
 & gt '' there 's your issue 
 you have to save it to the network drive or it gets deleted after two weeks 
 just like it says in the new employee packet that you read and <unk> to confirm you understood everything in it '' 
 & gt '' no one reads that 
 it 's all just <unk> '' 
 & gt '' all the other new employees whose work was all saved to the network drives would disagree 
 please save all your work to the network drives 
 goodbye '' 
 i do n't think <unk> is going to <unk> first day on the job : my interaction with <unk> here : missed deadlines : should not have sent that email : all good things must come to an end 
 did i mention <unk> had a cell phone 
 no 
 well to be fair up until now it was n't really relevant 
 it 's relevant now 
 we basically have 3 different options when it comes to cell phones 
 <unk> : we issue a new number on <unk> plan number is owned by company <unk> : you can use personal phone number we 'll <unk> monthly provided you fill out the forms you own the number <unk> : we agree to assume financial responsibility of your personal cell number and put it on our corporate account and provided we part ways <unk> we 'll release the number back to you this is done by those that to us to pay for the number but do n't want to hassle with <unk> requests 
 she went with option 3 signed the <unk> policy regarding this 
 it 's <unk> 's last day and she is finishing up doing whatever it is she does and the cfo stops by : cfo : at 5pm today can you please terminate <unk> 's access to all systems however we 've made an arrangement with her to keep her cell number on our <unk> account until she is able to get switched over she has 2 weeks to complete this 
 during this time she 's agreed to answer any questions we may have about anything she was working on '' me : okay '' i get her personal account information formally release the number 
 all she has to do at this point is contact <unk> and the number is hers 
 i set my calendar 
 fast forward 2 weeks i come into the office fire off the email to <unk> : please cancel <unk> <unk> '' if <unk> did what she was supposed to i 'll get an email back stating this number is n't on my account and the request can not be completed 
 <unk> : your request has been processed '' 
 - oh crap 
 here we go 
 about 2 hours later recep : <unk> <unk> is on the phone do you want to talk to her '' me : yup '' <unk> from her husband 's cell : my phone is n't working 
 i 'm <unk> and i need it '' me : it 's been 2 weeks i was told send the <unk> request 
 the number has been cancelled '' i hear her take a deep breath i think she 's <unk> the situation 
 <unk> : what 
 you cancelled it you ca n't do that you need to get the number back 
 i need my phone '' 
 me : sorry the request was already processed the number is likely gone '' <unk> <unk> : oh no 
 i will request the transfer today i did n't realize it had been so long i 'm so sorry can you get it back '' now anyone who has to deal with <unk> enterprise knows that the consumer <unk> dept and enterprise <unk> dept do n't exactly play well together 
 while i could probably get her number <unk> <unk> the transfer and she could get it it would require some additional effort if not that number goes back into the pool 
 so i shoot the cfo an im 
 me : <unk> never transferred her number and i cancelled it this morning now she is requesting we reactivate so she can get it back 
 are we under any <unk> to do so '' 
 cfo : no '' 
 me : <unk> yeah i 'm sorry it 's already been processed not much i can do you can try to call them and see what they say '' <unk> : this ca n't be is there <unk> '' <unk> is now standing at my desk 
 me : '' hang on <unk> '' <unk> phone <unk> : i ca n't login into <unk> when you 're done with your call can you help '' 
 me : sure give me a sec '' <unk> phone 
 me : sorry <unk> network 's down 
 i got ta go '' 
 - click edit : <unk> it was slow last night post 4th <unk> or something 
 most of the calls were <unk> we 're doing server updates your internet will be up by morning '' 
 that kind of stuff 
 then i got this one call ... this impatient <unk> man 
 he had an attitude from the get go 
 after getting what minimal information he would give me i tried to get his os from him just in case 
 he refused 
 wanted a supervisor because i asked for it so i dropped it 
 turns out he ca n't get online 
 ok he 's not in the area with the updates 
 damn it 
 run a scan no issues with our network 
 shit 
 this is going to suck 
 so i start asking him what his symptoms are 
 he ca n't ping out or get to the router 
 ok. let 's <unk> 's no ethernet connection according to the router information i can pull 
 i verify it 's plugged in to both ends then ask him to do a <unk> for me 
 he <unk> complies <unk> the whole time and complaining it 's not my computer '' 
 <unk> lan ports light up and flash 
 i tell him that shows us the router and ethernet cables are working and at this time i need to know his os because we need to check something 
 he throws a fit tells me i 'm being rude and i have a shitty attitude but complies a little more 
 i can say right now i was being as nice as <unk> possible to him since he was being so rude ... kill them with <unk> right 
 i have him check his device manager 
 he wo n't give me any information 
 i ask him to run ipconfig 
 wo n't give me anything 
 i am trying to explain what we 're trying to accomplish and he asks screams for a tech 
 i tell him sure but i need to get approval for one to come out from a supervisor and he needs to accept possible charges because we 're unable to finish troubleshooting and if it 's not our equipment causing the issue router <unk> then there 's a possible charge quote price '' .. <unk> he flips out tells me i have no idea what i 'm doing he needs someone else who does n't have an attitude and is a ... male ... <unk> that 's his issue 
 i have a <unk> 
 well i tell him i 'm just as qualified to help him as anyone else here if not more tenure and past positions and i 'm sorry i ca n't transfer you to anyone else 
 so he wants a male supervisor 
 not an issue because the only overnight female supervisor is on vacation 
 but my friend who i went through training with is a supervisor on duty tonight and he loves these kind of calls 
 he takes my headset 
 repeats everything i did step by step 
 he makes the guy reset his router just because then <unk> it 's still not working and no i 'm not sending a tech unless we 're sure it 's our equipment 
 he gets to where i left off and has the guy do an ipconfig release and renew 
 hmm 
 what do you know ... it 's working 
 my friend says it *was* your computer '' 
 the guy apologized to my friend for giving him a hard time but refused to acknowledge i had been on the right track 
 tldr : guy ca n't connect thinks it our services wo n't work with me admits it 's because i 'm a female 
 supervisor takes over call does exactly what i did plus what i was about to do fixes <unk> it was the customers computer at fault 
 edit : sorry for missing words and stuff i 'm on my phone 
 edit2 : you guys are awesome 
 the support on here is great 
 i did n't expect much by posting this i just wanted to complain about an asshole 
 also thanks <unk> for my first month of reddit gold 
 a client comes in buddy of mine older gentleman 
 says he ca n't remember his password 
 ok no biggie let 's go through the password reset steps 
 first question last 4 digits of your social 
 no problem he puts that in 
 second question <unk> number got it 
 3rd and last question what is the color of your first car 
 he types in black and white '' 
 black and white '' 
 i say ... <unk> 
 then ask him why would n't you just put down one color so it 's easier to remember 
 he just shrugs and laughs 
 i said ok try just black '' does n't work 
 try just white '' nope 
 just try random colors '' i suggest green '' 
 now it 's his turn to look at me puzzled 
 green '' 
 he says totally flabbergasted 
 i was like yea or blue just try typical colors of cars '' 
 car 
 i thought it said cat '' 
 he <unk> and <unk> his face up to the monitor 
 shit i need glasses '' 
 at this point i 'm <unk> why would it ask you the color of your first cat '' 
 he laughs too i do n't know 
 that 's why i said black and white and then was confused when you said green '' 
 ah good times he finally got the color right but that point his account was locked out from trying too many times 
 we put in a ticket with the system and got it unlocked 
 i see him almost every day and i 'm not going to let him live this one down 
 a quick tale while i 'm on my lunch break 
 so i host a minecraft server that me and my friends play on 
 while i 'm not the primary administrator of this server i do step in when i 'm needed 
 we recently encountered a problem where the server was <unk> a core on the host at 100 % usage and nobody could connect 
 long story short i was able to use a java <unk> to find the block type causing the issue but we could n't connect to remove it 
 we spent a few hours trying to fix the issue including loading the world in an external <unk> <unk> to remove the block 
 nothing worked 
 then one of our <unk> savvy users <unk> up 
 umm do n't you guys have a backup '' 
 cue every tech person in the chat room <unk> 
 between the five of us nobody had thought to restore from a backup 
 i mean this is exactly the reason we have backups is n't it 
 yet nobody thought to use them 
 so we restored from a backup and all was good 
 the next day i get a message from one of the users 
 note that the user could not have known the block they were using was bugged 
 & gt **user : ** i promise i will try not to fuck up the server again 
 but i also want to thank you for your hard work last night 
 & gt **me : ** heh not that i did anything useful 
 & gt **me : ** no worries 
 then this happened 
 & gt **user : ** being in it is often a thankless job 
 just wanted to make sure you knew how much i appreciate that someone was in a position to help 
 & gt **user : ** and do n't say you did n't do much 
 you put serious effort in and made <unk> of progress 
 much more than i did just throwing ideas around 
 this ... this user gets it 
 and now the world is all blurry 
 edit : me fail english 
 that 's <unk> 
 although i work in a retail store my actual job is tech support so i felt like this would be the proper place for this story 
 i work for a cell phone provider as an <unk> technician 
 a customer came in today because he could n't get into his gmail account 
 this was his 3rd visit to a store for this issue 
 i have reset hundreds maybe even a thousand gmail passwords in the last 5 years doing this job 
 i find out that he has 2 step verification enabled on his gmail account and that he was n't getting the text message verification code from google 
 i suggest that we try to login to the account on a desktop computer instead 
 i swing my monitor and keyboard around for him and tell him to sign in 
 i guess he expected that i was just going to do it for him because he makes a big show about how hard it is to use a keyboard 
 he says this is all foreign to me i 'm used to typing on my phone '' 
 he goes on to ask me how to make a 1 '' 
 you hit the button with a 1 on it ... he was also using caps lock to capitalize letters 
 after several attempts he finally gets the password entered correctly 
 next step is to enter his cell phone number to send the verification code 
 this is where it gets tricky 
 it turns out that whoever set up his gmail account for him not only enabled the 2 step verification but also typed his phone number wrong which is why he is n't getting the verification code 
 he asks me to call google '' and fix it for him 
 at this point i 'm starting to get frustrated with him and i inform him that no i ca n't call google for him '' 
 a reasonable person would n't expect their cell phone service provider to call google for them because they are locked out of their personal email account 
 i explained multiple times that i was not going to call google but did offer to physically dial the number for him so he could talk to them 
 apparently that was n't enough because he left in a huff because i just did n't want to help him '' 
 if he had n't been so lazy in the first place and set up his gmail account himself he probably would n't have been in this mess today 
 and i do not have sympathy for people who are not willing to do things themselves 
 i 've been reading tfts for a while so i thought i 'd give back 
 i 'm not in tech support but i was always better at resolving issues than most <unk> so i was made a power user for my department - not quite helpdesk but the first line of <unk> before their first line 
 you can imagine what a wonderful job that was 
 so i worked in a government department that dealt with property taxes and employed about <unk> people 
 given my elevated status i was often given the more complicated accounts to manage 
 this job also required me to run certain <unk> reports 
 normally these were fine except for a set of around 50 accounts 
 these accounts were for large <unk> that rented out property and each account contained several thousand properties to manage under one account 
 i had to run a report on one of these larger accounts and after sitting there for a while the report <unk> out 
 this never normally happened so i called one of the more helpful members of our helpdesk and told them about the <unk> issue 
 they were pretty surprised too 
 they said that it should n't happen and that i should try and run it a few more times until it worked 
 a little alarm bell began ringing in my head 
 i felt like a user that has a problem with a print job and was <unk> told to hit print another 50 times ... so i dutifully <unk> the report as instructed <unk> it every <unk> minutes each time it <unk> out 
 while i was waiting for the report to run i was doing some other paperwork blissfully ignorant of the chatter around me 
 slowly ever slowly i began to hear more <unk> of it 's not working again '' 
 or is it running slow for anyone else 
 that alarm bell began ringing a little louder 
 but the alarm bell was <unk> by the friendly <unk> of my outlook delivering a priority 1 message to all staff informing them that our system was down 
 we could n't take calls from customers could n't access accounts ... those alarm bells were getting pretty loud 
 i was just about to lift the <unk> to call up my friendly tech when i see someone standing in front of my desk 
 you also know it 's not good when you look up to see that it 's the head of it ... and not just the head of the helpdesk but the <unk> of it 
 & gt what did you do and how did you do it ... the <unk> <unk> nervousness that one experiences when you have a clearly <unk> executive in front of you is not pleasant 
 what none of our helpdesk knew was that despite the report timing out on a users machine it still does n't kill the process running on the servers 
 so each time i <unk> the report it created a duplicate job running simultaneously 
 so half a dozen reports <unk> <unk> of thousands of properties in total trying to pull back around at best guess around 5 million transaction records ... oops 
 it 's no wonder i managed to crash the servers 
 in the end a reboot and my <unk> of an addition to the report about only allowing accounts with up to 200 properties to be run in real time sorted the problem 
 head of it was actually pleased that i 'd managed to find this issue and help resolve it 
 now that he knew my name it actually worked out pretty well and we <unk> on a few projects from then on 
 my colleagues were pretty pleased they 'd managed to get an impromptu 30 minute break too 
 they were a little disappointed that the helpdesk patched the hole so they could n't intentionally crash it again 
 i was able to <unk> how we could still do it again and work around the new addition to the report but i thought it best not to arm the <unk> with such a dangerous piece of knowledge ... working in a government department it seems that they <unk> a higher standard of luser 
 there 's a few more stories of my time there which i can share if there 's any <unk> again tfts 
 necessary background : i work at an isp that handles a lot of traffic from rural america 
 & gt thank you for calling isp this is uwbw how can i help you today 
 yeah uh my modem is broken 
 i need a new one '' 
 hmm 
 99 % of these calls are actually issues with the outside line not the modem itself 
 i 'm already prepared to completely <unk> what the customer is going to be telling me for the next 2 minutes as it usually amounts to my internet is broken because my modem is broken because internet because reasons '' 
 instead ... when i plug your modem in my mouse starts moving on its own '' 
 <unk> 
 the mouse just sort of <unk> all over my screen randomly i ca n't control it 
 i turned the modem off and it stopped '' 
 & gt that 's ... interesting 
 have you tried turning it back on 
 the customer says that they have been too <unk> out to power the modem back up so i tell them to do it for me while we 're on call 
 hey would you look at that 
 no problems anymore 
 i can control my mouse again '' 
 & gt that 's great 
 i guess 
 hey and now that the box is back on my internet works again too 
 i was going to ask you about that next '' 
 <unk> & gt <unk> : what did you say 
 <unk> another night at company x and this time the problem was <unk> 
 & gt **me** : turn it off 
 then back on 
 & gt <unk> : you want me to turn it off and back on 
 & gt **me** : yes 
 & gt <unk> : okay 
 30 seconds later & gt <unk> : that worked 
 thanks 
 that was one problem solved 
 the other problem was a bit more <unk> 
 & gt **me** : anytime 
 call back if anything else happens 
 & gt <unk> : you know i will 
 yep she would 
 <unk> is one of my more frequent fliers 
 she was also growing ever more hard of hearing 
 every so often i could <unk> the local support people into buying someone a new computer 
 too bad i could n't do the same for <unk> 's phone 
 or could i 
 <unk> is an employee of site beta 
 i 'm on good terms with the techs there 
 perhaps this would be <unk> after all 
 so i <unk> a quick email to the site manager there 
 hey rob how 's it going 
 so i just got off the phone with <unk> and i ca n't help but notice that she <unk> by the day 
 would it be possible to get her an <unk> phone 
 hearing issues do n't generally resolve themselves and it would make it a lot easier for me to help her with her computer 
 right now i 'm having to shout at her like a drill <unk> 
 <unk> a few days later i received a response 
 <unk> sim yeah <unk> is definitely turning the corner on stone deaf 
 some <unk> have been made for her but that has n't been one of them yet 
 do you know where we could get an <unk> phone 
 it has to be compatible with the new voip system 
 if you can find a compatible part i 'll pitch it to her boss 
 so i did a bit of googling and found ... <unk> 
 checked amazon 
 still nothing 
 then inspiration struck and i called the vendor 
 & gt <unk> : <unk> voip support this is <unk> how may i help you 
 & gt **me** : hi <unk> <unk> here 
 look this is n't strictly tech support but maybe you could help anyway ... <unk> <unk> any ideas 
 & gt <unk> : * sounding <unk> more awake * hmmm ... let me do some research on this and i 'll get back to you 
 i may have to <unk> one of the engineers in and they 've gone home 
 can i have a <unk> number 
 a couple days later i get a call back 
 & gt **me** : internal it this is <unk> how may i help you 
 & gt <unk> <unk> : yeah this is tim with voip support 
 <unk> said you wanted a special phone 
 & gt **me** : not for me 
 one of the people here though 
 <unk> <unk> 
 & gt <unk> : that 's the problem with these phones 
 they were n't build with this in mind 
 but i think i 've come across this situation before 
 let me do some research and i 'll send you some suggestions 
 a day later i get a short email 
 my <unk> is <unk> <unk> for voip phone 
 part number <unk> 
 -- tim i forwarded the <unk> to rob 
 one week later yeah we do things slow here i get cc 'd on a part request order 
 guess which part 
 this was quickly followed by a note from rob 
 turns out her boss has been trying to get something like this from hr for ages 
 thanks for your help 
 -- rob 
 -- -- -- -- -- - tl dr courtesy of <unk> fixed phone issue when requests for phone sets for the hard of hearing fell on deaf ears at hr 
 edit : added tldr 2nd edit : thanks for the gold 
 3rd edit : finally fixed <unk> is a personal story <unk> from my brilliant aunt who is a want to be technical genius 
 first some background : my cousin 19 <unk> old and her have the same cell phone the <unk> 
 they are up for contract renewal at the end of <unk> of january so they will be getting new phones at that point 
 now the story : aunt sits down beside me : <unk> can you <unk> that cousin has used up 75 % of his data already 
 me : okay so what 
 i use around that amount 
 it resets on a monthly basis so do n't worry too much as your new billing date is today 
 aunt : no 
 that 's not how my plan works 
 i have x amount of data she could n't remember how much for the entire 2 year <unk> of my plan 
 can you believe he managed to use 75 % of it 
 i 've never used that much and i 'm always on facebook and twitter 
 me : no that 's not how they set up plans and if that 's how yours is you 've been screwed 
 check your phone bill next month and you 'll likely see everything is fine 
 her : well whatever this is stupid 
 i ca n't wait to get us new phones in a couple of months so this does n't happen again 
 me : um this could happen again on your new phone <unk> ... it works the same on the data plan that your current phone does 
 her : no 
 because then he 'll have more space on his phone and we wo n't reach 75 % again 
 at this point i ask to see my cousins phone navigate into the phones storage settings and see that he 's reached 80 % of his internal capacity 
 my aunt is still convinced she 's going to get charged <unk> 
 **tl dr - <unk> aunt thinks my cousin has used 75 % of his data he 's used 80 % of his internal <unk> edit : technical <unk> <unk> first time poster long time lurker etc 
 some background : i work as an it manager for a large private jet <unk> company as well as head tech for my high school i 'm a senior in <unk> so i often have to leave class to answer tickets briefly 
 anyway this tale comes from the <unk> company 
 to <unk> this even further all of the computers at the company have been custom built 
 they 're not anything crazy with graphics cards or anything like that but they 're certainly a step up from the hp computers from best buy or something 
 anyway so my day is just getting started and i receive a ticket that says ram fell out computer wo n't turn on '' 
 immediately red flags go off for various reasons 
 i walk over and this is how the conversation goes : $ skull : & gt so the ram fell out 
 what were you possibly doing 
 $ <unk> : & gt i decided to try and upgrade this work station so i bought my own ram to replace the stuff in here 
 i look to see multiple sticks of ram laid out on the desk and the computer turned on its side with the side cover off 
 i <unk> the replacement ram tell him that the ones we have in the pcs are fine and why did he do this 
 $ <unk> : & gt my station was having issues and i determined it to be the ram after reading <unk> online so i tried to replace it as i did n't want to bother the it department 
 so after hearing this i replace the ram in the machine and boot it up 
 before the os loads i spam the the delete '' key to enter the bios to make sure this tech savvy user did n't try to screw around with any settings 
 after realising what key i was pressing and he grabs my hand and pulls it away from the computer and says : $ <unk> : & gt what are you doing 
 quit trying to delete my computer i have important files on there 
 edit : for <unk> some have and fairly so i certainly do n't mind answering questions <unk> the <unk> of several <unk> of this situation so let me clear those up 
 i 've responded to several comments but i 'm putting it here for <unk> 
 on the subject of a work schedule i only go to class 1 hour a day as i only need one more credit to graduate <unk> 
 i applied to this company to start as just a regular in the department and after the previous manager quit i had been working just over a year and a half and could <unk> more time to my job 
 that and combined with having past degrees of leadership in the past <unk> band 
 i was given the position of manager 
 i used the term <unk> rather poorly and for that i apologise 
 i was trying to <unk> that i removed the user brought in ram from the picture 
 i gave it back to him a he did technically own it but i of course told him not to try and put it in any work computer again 
 a while before i started working the company <unk> very heavily in a server <unk> and 70 % of that money went to it but our rather tech knowledgeable boss approached the previous it manager and asked for a sort of bulk '' parts list for computers to replace the older dell machines that were previously in use 
 the department ordered parts for 50 of these new <unk> '' pcs as those were all that were needed at the time 
 the company has since grown to about <unk> and the machines are mixed between the older dell machines the previously ordered pcs and varied other off the shelf computers that had to be hastily bought to <unk> employees 
 we <unk> up the computers by basically having highly essential jobs operate on the better computers 
 in this specific case i was dealing with an ordered pc 
 to address previous question posting : i will admit that they are basic but they come from several places 
 some of them are for my personal use at home some are just legitimately lack of knowledge as in the business it 's my belief that it 's not necessarily the info you know but more so how to obtain the information 
 sometimes questions are asked because i want to verify the process of doing something or making sure it is an actual issue 
 lastly i 'm not on some crazy fixed salary as a senior i 'm still technically paid by the hour 
 some background : cellular internet devices do n't have unlimited data usage in canada me : hello your on the phone with <unk> from tech how can you help me waste my life today cust : i just saw my bill and there is no way i have used <unk> gigs 
 me : i understand 
 let 's see if we can figure this out 
 do you mind telling me what devices you have connected to modem 
 cust i do n't know a black cable 
 a yellow cable 
 what does that matter 
 <unk> i found a <unk> 
 better proceed with caution <unk> this will test <unk> me : no ma'am what i mean by devices are things like laptops iphone 
 things of that nature 
 cust : i have an old laptop my son and i both use for email 
 me : okay do you two also use it for facebook youtube streaming or other media 
 cust : i do n't know to use that stuff 
 i just click email and that 's it 
 do you need me to turn it on 
 me : yes please 
 i want to check your program list cust : one moment i 'll get my son 
 <unk> not real name come turn on the computer <unk> no mom my team needs me 
 i 'm 2 <unk> away from <unk> cust : sorry he is playing his game can you help me 
 <unk> you bastard i know your the cause of this 
 i know this is your fault <unk> me : sure 
 do you see a power button 
 go ahead and turn it on 
 it was more complicated then that but i do n't want to bore you guys with how the customer went full <unk> is not responding '' cust : okay the windows me screen on 
 now what 
 do i open my internet <unk> icon to check my programs 
 <unk> windows me 
 i did a double take on my <unk> to make sure it 's past the year <unk> <unk> : <unk> get off the internet your <unk> down my game 
 i 'm no <unk> me : <unk> ... internet <unk> down game ... i knew it** me : ma'am does your son play online games 
 cust : he does play with his friends on <unk> 
 but it 's free he is n't connecting to the internet 
 just wifi me : ma'am 
 connecting to the wifi of your router is still an internet connection 
 cust : i do n't understand 
 i 'll put <unk> on me : <unk> please no ... <unk> <unk> <unk> : do you even game <unk> 
 why are you two <unk> me when i 'm playing online me : it seems there is a misunderstanding about you connecting to wifi is your the internet connection and racking up your mom 's bill <unk> : haha 
 are you dumb 
 wifi is n't internet 
 mom he is a moron 
 i bet you he is like 40 living in his mom 's basement 
 he probably is into my little <unk> and does n't have a gf 
 he is so dumb 
 i probably make more money then he does 
 mr tech guy do you have a gf 
 i do and your <unk> is interrupting our game date 
 bye mr smart 
 here is my mom <unk> is using all system <unk> cust : i 'm sorry 
 he 's so <unk> 
 so what can we do about this internet issue 
 me : well ma'am 
 i think your issue is with wireless internet access using all the data 
 let 's disable it cust : okay after 20 min of <unk> her into the <unk> of the router we disabled the wifi me : okay ma'am 
 please monitor your usage over the next months and you will see a <unk> in usage cust : thank you <unk> : where did you <unk> 
 <unk> 
 i 'm offline 
 wtf wtf wtf 
 <unk> 
 me : bye cust : wait 
 ... click ... ... .. edit : <unk> what sets our production house apart from the other ones in the area is that we have drone cameras 
 lots of them 
 and a pretty damn cool guy certified to fly them 
 now every time he gets a new toy everybody stops work to come see him fly it 
 these <unk> range from a simple <unk> setup with a <unk> underneath to large expensive <unk> with gps image tracking and <unk> cameras 
 and they all have <unk> of course 
 his latest <unk> was one of the latter - super expensive super sleek and capable of flying up to insane <unk> 
 we all <unk> and <unk> as he made it circle above our heads and track our movements as we ran ahead of it 
 however when we were heading back in drone pilot <unk> pulled me aside 
 & gt <unk> : <unk> you live at & lt address & gt yeah 
 just up the hill 
 & gt me : uh yeah 
 why planning to break in 
 & gt <unk> : nope but i need your help with something 
 when you go home for lunch put on your & lt company & gt shirt and go onto your <unk> okay 
 & gt me : alright but if what you 're doing turns out to be illegal i 'm blaming you for everything 
 two <unk> things to note here - i lived a very short walk away from the company in a tall apartment building and our <unk> shirts were bright orange 
 so when i returned home on my lunch break i put on my shirt and went to stand on the <unk> as requested 
 after five minutes of staring at the building across from mine trying to determine if the lady on the <unk> floor really had painted her walls that <unk> of <unk> i was startled by a loud <unk> and looked down almost in time to get smacked in the face by <unk> 's newest drone 
 & gt me : what the hell 
 a beep from my phone signaled a text from <unk> 
 & gt <unk> : via text walk from one end of the <unk> to the other 
 as i did so the drone continued to hover just beyond the <unk> tracking the bright orange of my company shirt 
 & gt <unk> : via text now go onto the roof 
 i <unk> back inside and <unk> the stairs to our buildings roof a good 15 stories above the ground 
 as i <unk> i was once again greeted by the <unk> of the drone bouncing through the air before me like an excited and noisy white <unk> 
 & gt <unk> : via text now run around again 
 i want to see what range i can get 
 lets see if we can draw a <unk> with the gps 
 for the rest of the afternoon i got to run around my building 's roof and parking lot making patterns chasing the drone and generally having a <unk> good time testing '' the new drone with <unk> 
 upon returning <unk> to my apartment i was startled by a <unk> on my <unk> window and opened it to find the drone hovering before me with a note taped to it 's front : & gt my new <unk> is & lt my real first name & gt 
 thank you for playing with me today 
 **tl dr : <unk> <unk> wants to play 
 ** <unk> **edit : for those wondering about battery life yes we did take breaks to swap out and charge batteries it was n't one <unk> flight 
 <unk> i have gotten a new job as a technician 
 about a few days into the job i had a situation where a guy brings in his laptop because it blue screens on startup 
 its no big deal since his data was backed up and a reimage did n't take that long 
 while i was documenting the incident my <unk> was there watching me making sure i did everything right 
 i was typing in <unk> on startup '' when i was stopped 
 <unk> : you ca n't put that in '' me : what do you mean 
 it was a <unk> '' 
 <unk> : i know but you have to use <unk> '' me : ok thats kinda odd 
 is <unk> used for something else '' <unk> : no thats not the case 
 even though <unk> is a standard industry term some manager over at the west cost was offended at the words <unk> death 
 so it became company policy to use the term <unk> '' 
 me : you are kidding me '' <unk> : no i agree its the dumbest fucking thing ever '' <unk> : <unk> stands for blue screen 
 its <unk> without the death <unk> : i am keeping my job 
 one little thing like <unk> is not going to ruin it 
 ltl ftp and all that 
 i 'm also new to posting to reddit 
 as many others here i do n't actually work in tech support i just help with family and friends 
 this happened a few days ago 
 my family just moved in a new house and we do n't yet have internet service 
 coincidentally my brother accidentally deleted all the music on his phone 
 i will be $ me and my brother will be $ brother 
 & gt ** $ <unk> : hey my music 's gone 
 & gt ** $ me** : let me take a look 
 <unk> 's music is gone need to <unk> 
 but as i said before we have no internet at home 
 * & gt ** $ me** : ok. your music 's gone when we get internet i 'll turn on wifi from my computer and you can download the music 
 & gt ** $ <unk> : ok *that <unk> & gt ** $ <unk> : hey can you turn on your wifi thing so i can download my music & gt ** $ me** : sorry no can do 
 remember we still do n't have internet 
 & gt ** $ <unk> : oh you need internet for that 
 *facepalm* previous i sat staring down at the screen assembly that the vp was slowly <unk> onto the pda in front of him 
 & gt vp : so the orientation is this way up correct 
 & gt me : yep 
 you could just let me handle this 
 my back was <unk> from leaning forward to watch the vp trying to repair pda’s for over an hour 
 & gt vp : no i want to learn 
 it’s my project after all i should know the <unk> 
 the vp smiled away as he slowly tried to push the parts together every slight <unk> he would stop and <unk> 
 it was taking forever 
 & gt me : would you like me to show you again 
 i held my <unk> pda in hand pressing the pieces together firmly and ignoring the snaps of plastic that indicated it was firmly in place 
 & gt vp : no no 
 thanks but maybe just watch you’ve years of training behind you 
 you know you’re not going to break it 
 & gt me : you won’t break it 
 it just needs a little more force to clip in 
 & gt vp : my problem is i don’t have your years of experience yet so i have to take it a little slow 
 gentle 
 & gt me : it won’t ever go in unless you just press down 
 i reached out to grasp his screen assembly and push it down firmly however the vp pulled it away <unk> 
 & gt vp : see airz 
 this is why we need a team building weekend 
 we need to learn to trust each other 
 let me go at my own pace 
 i sighed heavily and sat back in my chair as the vp continued to <unk> press upon the screen never <unk> to an actual press 
 & gt vp : speaking of are you excited 
 a whole three days off work 
 & gt me : oh … yes 
 you mean the team building exercise 
 & gt vp : it should be fun everyone <unk> out together with activities and delicious food 
 & gt me : wait… what 
 <unk> 
 the vp smiled and looked up 
 he <unk> held his half assembled pda in hand 
 i was tempted to reach out in fix it myself 
 & gt vp : don’t worry 
 we’re in <unk> not <unk> 
 & gt me : i thought it was just a day thing 
 & gt vp : no no 
 we’re going to place far away 
 & gt me : executive is going on a camp 
 an actual stay out of <unk> camp 
 the vp nodded his head <unk> 
 i tried to swallow my rising panic 
 the vp gave the screen a slightly stronger tap a small snap could be heard as a connector clicked into place 
 & gt vp : ahhh 
 & gt me : it’s okay 
 that s the sound its meant to make 
 after a few screws in the back and face <unk> <unk> the vp held <unk> his <unk> pda 
 i smiled as he powered it on grateful at the chance to finally leave 
 unfortunately the screen did not display the manufactures logo as expected in its place was a giant crack across the screen 
 & gt vp : oh darn 
 i think i put the broken screen back in 
 i must have got <unk> 
 & gt me : that’s okay its exactly the same process with a broken or <unk> screen 
 do you think you’ve got it 
 vp nodded 
 i got up from my chair happy to finally be able to leave 
 & gt vp : no no 
 don’t go 
 i haven’t even fixed <unk> yet 
 i watched as the vp started <unk> <unk> the pda 
 he reached for the screwdriver & gt vp : like you told me before… <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 which left was it again 
 my mind <unk> <unk> trying to learn he’s trying to learn he’s trying to <unk> it became my mantra to keep me sane 
 next so back when i was working first line support i got lots and lots of fun calls 
 one of them went like this 
 & gt me : welcome to the service desk this is <unk> speaking 
 & gt $ <unk> : hi i ca n't connect to the servers 
 & gt me : oh okay does it give you an error message or something 
 & gt $ <unk> : no it just does n't connect 
 & gt me : okay 
 have you checked that your pc is properly connected to the network 
 & gt $ <unk> : yes yes everything is plugged in 
 & gt me : okay 
 is it only you with this problem or is anyone else affected 
 & gt $ <unk> : no it 's just me i think 
 so i start doing some tests and find i ca n't ping his workstation 
 i ask him again to check his cables but he says they appear to be properly connected 
 suddenly his machine starts responding to pings again 
 & gt me : hey it seems i can reach your machine now 
 did anything happen 
 & gt $ <unk> : yeah the power came back on 
 & gt me : <unk> myself with the headset <unk> edit : headset do n't make music 
 edit2 : for clarification he was using a laptop in a docking station so his computer was running 
 nothing else was though 
 one of the first rules of consulting is that you <unk> give free advice 
 even if you know the answer you make the potential client wait until they’ve signed a contract 
 one of the rules of being a decent human being is that you never let a fellow techie spin around <unk> 
 sometimes these rules come into conflict 
 usually <unk> wins over human <unk> but this is a story about going the other way 
 <unk> is a fellow techie at big <unk> organization <unk> 
 <unk> has a reputation for being a good place for techies to make their <unk> but it has a reputation for a <unk> <unk> technical debt and legacy stuff going back years 
 i’m supposed to meet <unk> and hang out for a few hours but she’s stuck in a dilemma 
 she’s stuck between a few different policy requirements : 1. data must be classified according to its <unk> 
 2. sensitive data must be encrypted if it leaves <unk> control 
 3. if the data doesn’t have a <unk> it’s to be treated as sensitive until determined otherwise 
 4. data older than the document retention policy must be securely destroyed 
 5. obsolete and <unk> it components are to <unk> to a specific recycling company that makes no guarantees about security 
 <unk> wants to clean out a pc <unk> in a basement 
 a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in compliance issued an <unk> to comply with the rules above : <unk> will mount each drive encrypt the contents and ship them to the <unk> where they may be destroyed or <unk> 
 of course once mr. <unk> <unk> has made their <unk> they are routing phone calls to voice mail and email to /dev/null 
 so <unk> can not enjoy coffee with me 
 instead she’s got to <unk> every <unk> & gt usb adapter and go through a wall of systems 
 i bring two <unk> of coffee and meet her in the basement 
 she’s <unk> by a <unk> amount of <unk> work but the great compliance has spoken or at least mumbled <unk> 
 i see an obvious solution 
 me : <unk> has to be be the dumbest shit i’ve heard this <unk> <unk> : ”i know 
 i’m going to be catching up for <unk> me : <unk> 
 no 
 i need three things and this problem is solved : we need an intern a <unk> and a <unk> <unk> <unk> : ” if compliance thought we could just destroy the hard drives don’t you think they would have mentioned it ” me : <unk> course not 
 if a <unk> has a choice between them doing work considering the problem or you doing work fixing a problem they’ll pick you every <unk> <unk> looking at me sideways like she knows i’m going to say something crazy : <unk> we can’t just recycle the <unk> me : <unk> going to <unk> the problem 
 hard drives containing data must be encrypted before they go to the outside vendor 
 but <unk> scrap well is just <unk> scrap 
 it doesn’t contain data 
 <unk> is looking at me with a worried look as i rummage around and pull out two <unk> <unk> desktop pcs which i place on the ground about 3 inches apart from one another 
 me : <unk> trust me 
 clients of mine with tons of <unk> data have approved this 
 if you get <unk> i’ll represent you 
 we can do it ourselves but this is really a learning experience for an <unk> <unk> : <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> leaves me alone in this basement 
 i look around and find an <unk> screwdriver that looks like its only purpose has been to open and <unk> cans of <unk> <unk> paint 
 i also find a fist sized <unk> of <unk> with a very nice <unk> 
 <unk> returns with <unk> an eager young it intern 
 she’s found him a white lab coat safety <unk> and a <unk> screwdriver 
 me : <unk> do you know why you’re here ” <unk> : ”i think <unk> me : <unk> the task at hand and there’s some stuff to learn 
 follow this procedure exactly 
 first place the drive between the two <unk> <unk> : <unk> me putting the big ugly screwdriver on the casing of the hard drive : <unk> place the tool halfway between the <unk> and the edge of the <unk> <unk> : <unk> i raise the <unk> of <unk> above my head 
 i wait a second then <unk> : <unk> 
 <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> ” then drive the screwdriver through the hard drive 
 <unk> looks annoyed with me and <unk> seems startled 
 i pull the drive off the screwdriver and shake the drive 
 the platters are clearly shattered 
 me : <unk> there are a three <unk> you should learn from this exercise if you want to be an it professional 
 <unk> there are rules for a reason 
 <unk> knowing when to bend the letter of the rules to follow the reason behind the rules is the mark of a <unk> <unk> : ” and the third ” me : <unk> you can have fun doing it” <unk> and i left <unk> to his work 
 as we walked back to her work area she asks one question : <unk> : <unk> you have to do that ” me : ”i figured a <unk> might be <unk> i asked an old coworker if he remembered any good stories from our time as small network admins so i could share with reddit 
 he said remember that time you came back to the shop bleeding and <unk> and said you did n't want to talk about it 
 it 's time to talk about it '' 
 it began innocently enough 
 i received a call from one of the sales team about a new client who needed an initial assessment of their network and pcs 
 this was a new ish japanese restaurant in a declining part of town 
 this restaurant was the only business still <unk> in a much larger building that once held a movie theater and some sort of shipping warehouse 
 i walked in introduced myself to the nice <unk> couple who owned the place and got to it 
 as i got down to business i was informed all the previous tech work was done by the next door neighbor 's son 
 i took this to mean we 're used to paying $ 10 and a plate of chicken and rice for tech support '' 
 i was not surprised to find a lot of work to do but nothing out of the ordinary 
 the first complaint was the point of sale machine 
 it was <unk> slow even considering the <unk> hardware 
 i could not bring it down as they were still checking out the last of the lunch rush '' 
 so i brought up <unk> and decided to see what i could disable and turn off 
 i remember going to the startup tab and thinking wow what a bunch of crap '' 
 <unk> down ... holy <unk> '' 
 <unk> down ... ok we 're turning everything off and instead looking for what needs to be turned back on 
 after this it was working better but still needed some deep cleaning or a <unk> 
 for some reason the internet was still dodgy 
 i pulled up a command prompt and did a continuous ping to <unk> and let that run for a few minutes 
 when i came back i found high latency and lost of lost packets 
 no big deal we 'll try to reboot the router and modem and see if that helps 
 so i asked what i considered a simple question where is your router and modem '' 
 to which i received in answer a puzzled smile 
 they were not sure what i was talking about as they had only recently moved from dial up 
 ok time to switch gears 
 who is your isp '' 
 no idea 
 who do you pay for internet access '' 
 nobody 
 apparently they used to pay for internet access but the teenager set them up with free internet 
 big red flag was raised 
 this just got slightly interesting 
 i tried following the network cable but it disappeared into a hole in the floor 
 similar story in the back office with the accounting machine 
 so i tried to log into the router and at least get an idea of what i was looking for 
 i encountered the <unk> password prompt 
 that 's cool 
 i prefer <unk> myself but we 've got a <unk> 
 a <unk> who thinks it 's a good idea to change the default password for lan access why 
 i point out the network cable to the owner and ask him if he knows where it goes 
 as he looked at me the room grew dark and <unk> 
 it got <unk> colder 
 the <unk> 
 i 'm not sure what that cable goes but he took a whole box of cable into the <unk> and then we had internet '' 
 ok can i call him '' 
 i asked 
 no he 's gone off to college 
 that 's why we hired you '' 
 a second later i 'm standing in front of an open trap door in the floor behind the stock room shining my flashlight into a dark void 
 there is a dirt floor and it smells 
 an old <unk> is there but i do n't trust it and just jump in with tools and laptop case in hand 
 my first thought was surprise at how big it was 
 my flashlight did n't reach the far two walls 
 it was a forest of concrete <unk> and <unk> supports 
 there was a lot of power <unk> and water <unk> to <unk> under but for the most part you had about 6 feet to stand up 
 it <unk> like death and <unk> 
 i found the two network cables and an extension cord and start off on my <unk> 
 do you remember the <unk> movie i forget which one where the guy is following <unk> in the dark <unk> and there are <unk> <unk> him 
 this is what it felt like 
 i tell myself that it ca n't be that far because extension cords are only so long 
 at the end of the cord is another plugged into it then another plugged into that one 
 ok well at least they ca n't run cat5 cable longer than 300 feet 
 it 's quiet and <unk> worse all the time 
 i keep thinking i hear something or multiple <unk> moving around 
 eventually i see green leds ahead of me and find a small network switch 
 the two network cables from the pcs plug into the switch which is powered by the extension cord and another cable continues <unk> 
 my only hope of a 300 feet max was <unk> 
 i had always thought i was the type to keep a cool head in an emergency 
 i did n't think i was the type to panic 
 well i learned something new about myself a few score feet beyond that switch 
 as i continued to recall every scary movie i had ever seen i shone my light ahead and saw two glowing yellow eyes looking back perhaps 30 feet away 
 a <unk> ran up my <unk> and the <unk> on my arms stood up 
 something in my head snapped and an ancient <unk> part of me took over 
 for reasons i still do n't understand i <unk> over and screamed into the silent <unk> an <unk> '' 
 and just like that it became real in my mind 
 a 20 foot <unk> with long teeth faced me 
 like a <unk> <unk> <unk> i grabbed my screwdrivers punch tool and wire <unk> and threw them at the eyes 
 and then i ran screaming like a little girl 
 i must have hit my head in my <unk> <unk> because i ended up with a small cut and blood in my hair 
 i got back to the <unk> and found they had closed the door 
 what kind of monster would close somebody into a pit of <unk> like that 
 i threw it open and jumped out in a single leap 
 i found myself face to face with the <unk> who screamed 
 i screamed back at her 
 the owner rushed in and looked me over with great concern 
 i managed to <unk> myself and said she startled me 
 i think i bumped my head may i use your restroom '' 
 i <unk> cold water in my face and was ashamed of myself 
 an <unk> 
 really 
 here where we have more snow days than warm ones 
 it was likely a <unk> cat and i might have just killed it 
 so i am back in the hole <unk> my steps 
 i keep telling myself i 'm not afraid but i still wish i had my 22 target pistol in hand 
 i get to the switch and then beyond it my tools scattered over a large area 
 the slot head screwdriver had blood on it which frankly amazed me that i actually hit the poor creature in my panic 
 so with the bloody screwdriver in one hand and a flashlight in the other i continued my search for that modem 
 at the far wall i found the router 
 standard <unk> blue box zip tied to something holding it up 
 and nothing else no modem 
 how in the heck were they getting internet 
 i plugged in and tried again to guess the password without luck 
 then remembering some of the features of <unk> i checked for open wireless signals of which there were two from <unk> on the other side of the road 
 so my best guess is the teenager had <unk> the router to one of those open wireless connections and thus provided free internet for the restaurant 
 i power <unk> the device which did n't help at all and went back 
 i must have been a sight 
 the owner quickly agreed with my suggestions and promised to call the local cable company come install their own internet tomorrow 
 i was ushered out the back door without even a glass of water 
 we kept that contract but the restaurant owner requested a different tech be assigned as he was not sure about me 
 i did not complain 
 <unk> he must have heard me screaming and crying under his restaurant and then screaming at his cute <unk> i really did n't want to face him <unk> i tell the tale of a user in <unk> an emergency indeed if we are not careful they phoned me up in a panic indeed i deleted all my pictures the wrong button i have keyed '' further questioning revealed the recycle bin was empty this might or could actually be an issue maybe 
 do n't worry '' i cried ready to man action stations i 'll pop down in a <unk> and we 'll sort this situation '' down i hurried thinking to myself in <unk> did the user confirm a permanent <unk> 
 in i went to see the user in a panic i sat down at the desk ready to get at it of course i immediately see the fix and solve it with a mere two clicks but how '' 
 he asks <unk> <unk> i 'm sure it was gone i even clicked around '' as i left the room i paused turned and said you deleted the library the thing that points at it '' so my readers when issues happen and it gets in your head just remember users always lie even if they do n't know it 
 **** edit : <unk> in a medical office we 're required to wipe all data off of a hard disk before we can <unk> of it 
 even though we access all our information through rdp so nothing is stored locally 
 but whatever if i have to do it i may as well have some fun 
 this is how i do it 
 to explain for <unk> people 
 yes that 's an <unk> machine 
 yes the disks are practically <unk> on a single corner 
 no the <unk> tank is not <unk> as it 's designed to be used inside an <unk> room 
 no i did not take my camera into the room but <unk> in from the doorway which explains the crappy quality 
 yes the windows behind the machine are still <unk> so there is no <unk> this happened quite some time ago so all of this is well behind me but it was quite <unk> at the time 
 i was 18 and had taken a low-level tech support job at a local branch of $ <unk> for the summer before university 
 my responsibilities were primarily for <unk> data files but i also helped out with basic software support for people that did n't want to bother raising a proper it support ticket 
 word got around that i was a useful <unk> and eventually i 'd get calls about hardware issues as well - usually just turn thing off and turn it back on again 
 one day i get a call from $ alice from $ department 
 i 'd never met $ alice or even heard of $ department before i do n't even have access to that floor but my number had somehow made it to her 
 $ alice was an accountant a few floors above me but she had a frantic issue with one of the printers 
 i start going through my usual troubleshooting spiel but she cuts me off and explains that it have been there and replaced the printer twice before and ca n't find any electrical fault 
 she explains that she 's getting electric <unk> when she <unk> this printer and it happened with the previous two printers as well and it people must have wired it wrong and she ca n't go back to them and she ca n't use the printer and wants me to come fix it 
 she seems very worked up 
 i begin to suspect i know what 's happening but i want to be sure so i ask her <unk> i ask what sort of shoes are you currently wearing * 
 $ alice replies <unk> ... what 
 ** and i repeat <unk> sort of <unk> but she just hangs up 
 bit odd but i get back to my data files and quickly forget about it 
 about two weeks later my boss comes to me <unk> and tells me i have to attend a disciplinary meeting the next day and that i ought to spend the rest of the day packing up my stuff not that i had any and getting my files in order 
 going into this meeting i have absolutely **no** idea what this is about 
 i know that my data work was kinda slow but i did n't think it was that <unk> i 'm 18 and this is first <unk> job and i 'm <unk> 
 my boss is there my boss boss $ bob is there and the head of hr 
 $ bob goes through a long speech about how at $ <unk> they take <unk> harassment in the workplace <unk> seriously and that hr is going to interview all of my colleagues about me and that they expect me to fully comply with whatever action they deem necessary and how this might affect my university applications and future career 
 i nervously <unk> out that i have no idea what they 're talking about and the head of hr explains that this is about a <unk> phonecall 
 i *still* have no idea and my boss <unk> out <unk> 're saying you 've never called $ department 
 * i then finally remember $ alice and then explain that she called me about an issue with the printer 
 hr asks if i recall making <unk> <unk> i say that i do n't but i explain that i was asking about her shoes because i suspected that she was building up static charge <unk> by her shoes if they had rubber <unk> or some such and she was <unk> when she touched the printer - and experiencing an <unk> shock 
 my boss asks why she 'd called me rather than it and i explain the whole thing about how i help out with tech support sometimes 
 they ask me to leave and talk amongst themselves 
 i do n't hear anything more about this for days i 've not been told that i 've been fired and i 'm still being paid so i nervously turn up to work every day 
 eventually i see a <unk> e-mail about 'it support policies <unk> all employees that it support issues must be raised by the ticketing systems and that <unk> support will no longer be <unk> 
 i 'm only there for a few more weeks after and my boss acts as if nothing had ever happened and i never hear about it ever again 
 edit : i 've had many years now to think about this it kinda shook me up for a long time afterwards even after i graduated i was worried that there was some sort of <unk> file that 'd <unk> up when i was <unk> for jobs and i have n't really told anyone about this 
 i maybe should have said it <unk> explained why i was asking about her shoes before i did or something 
 i was never really angry with $ alice for the misunderstanding but i am kinda angry that there was n't anyone in the meeting 'on my side 
 i now work for a small company and i 'm quite <unk> of layers of corporate <unk> 
 me again 
 2nd post now and proud 
 i work for an appliance manufacturer booking engineers for <unk> appliances and providing tech support for customers and today i got a pretty <unk> customer on the phone 
 for reference we 're uk based 
 it went a bit like this : & gt me : good afternoon your through to helpful person what can i do for you today 
 & gt cust : hello i 've been passed around a lot and now i just want to get this sorted 
 & gt me : okay i 'm sorry about the inconvenience what exactly is the issue you 've been having 
 & gt cust : i 've got an appliance at a holiday home in <unk> that 's broken and i need to get it repaired but no one seems to know what they 're doing with this 
 & gt me : okay unfortunately i think there 's been some sort of mix up we do n't deal with appliances outside of the uk you 'd have to speak to our engineering company in <unk> to get the problem sorted 
 & gt cust : this is what i keep being told but the fact is that you produce the machine and should get this resolved 
 & gt me : i can certainly agree that we need to sort it however we do n't send out our engineers to outside the uk nor can we book any of the engineers in <unk> because the systems are not <unk> 
 you need to speak to the call centre in <unk> to get this resolved 
 & gt cust : now quite <unk> but they do n't speak english 
 you should be booking this repair because i 'm and english speaking customer 
 this is awful customer service i 'm going to post this all over facebook about how bad your company is and why no one should buy your appliances 
 *click* tl dr : customer think we give awful customer service because <unk> do n't all speak <unk> do n't know you do n't have a computer 
 <unk> sold a monitor keyboard + mouse and speakers to a guy 
 figured he would go home and hook it up to his computer no <unk> get a call this morning <unk> <unk> guy is telling me he ca n't hook up the mouse or keyboard to anything 
 i tell him keep looking usb is a universal application and there will be a port 
 he insists there is nothing so i end up going to his house to see what the problem is 
 i look at the stuff i sold him look for the computer to hook it up to and soon realize what the problem is ... ... <unk> guy does n't have a computer 
 anyways explained it to him in the most <unk> manner possible and ended up selling him a dirt cheap desktop 
 gave him a really good deal because <unk> felt a little bad 
 <unk> 1 <unk> <unk> : <unk> wanted for : sabotage of end-user equipment history of terrible work and stupid questions 
 <unk> : terminate before end of shift 
 time left : <unk> minutes 
 * with the mission <unk> clearly defined i get to work 
 first step is to call the subcontractor 's <unk> i could end this in minutes if i got <unk> of the floor manager there and explain the situation 
 of course nobody answers because it ca n't be that easy 
 check his boss schedule been gone for well over an hour 
 i <unk> just send an email and let them sort it out tomorrow but that would fall short of the mission <unk> 
 sure there 's the angry customer but mostly if you want to be an epic waste of my time i <unk> the <unk> 
 & gt systems : systems '' 
 & gt /u/bytewave : hey again systems 
 i got the info i needed this time i have a login for you <unk> 
 this subcontractor has voluntarily and repeatedly compromised the service of a end-user and it 's ongoing as you 'll see if you look at the logs you sent me 
 ca n't reach their floor 
 given a customer is affected by this right now can you shut down his station and disable his system and <unk> logins '' 
 & gt systems : well yeah but i need a manager 's authorization '' 
 & gt /u/bytewave : yeah well mine left 
 i can fetch an <unk> suit & amp tie if we must but this is <unk> and you 're the guy who sent me the evidence 
 6 hours <unk> 25 manual resets per hour 
 i listened to their call it was <unk> and he purposely avoided logging it in <unk> before starting his <unk> 
 this moron is done '' 
 & gt systems : hey all you got ta say is that your manager <unk> and i 'll do it 
 i just need a name to put in the file '' 
 i was grateful but also a bit disappointed 
 just need a name really 
 no written authorization 
 with systems this <unk> any <unk> social engineer could have the building <unk> <unk> on us in ten minutes if not the network 
 & gt systems : alright this <unk> is locked out 
 how does this play out now if you did n't reach anyone over there '' 
 & gt /u/bytewave : seems their management ca n't pick up their phone but i have other options all good ... hey systems '' 
 & gt systems : <unk> charlie '' 
 & gt /u/bytewave : what 's your name '' 
 & gt systems : gregory '' 
 & gt /u/bytewave : thanks for your help gregory 
 i 'm adding you to my in-house instant <unk> if you need something from the tech senior line do n't <unk> '' 
 was a good deal 
 we need them more often than they need us 
 numbers and contact <unk> are one of the most <unk> weapons in my <unk> 
 everyone has a list of phone numbers 
 every department they 're <unk> to interact with emergency contacts stuff like that 
 i like to go deeper 
 cellphone numbers of executives i have no reason to interact with directly just in case 
 okay plenty of people like to collect that 
 the number of every single security desk in every building we own or that works for us 
 now that 's not anywhere on the intranet 
 & gt /u/bytewave : bytewave senior staff at isp 
 this is a <unk> call 
 given we were unable to reach managers systems has just disabled access of one of your company 's employees <unk> 
 we have hard evidence that <unk> was repeatedly <unk> a end-user 's equipment 
 his ability to damage the network has already been contained on our end 
 he <unk> be fired in short order but for now it 's critical that you ensure no physical ... '' & gt <unk> <unk> security i get it 
 going in now 
 crap <unk> move '' 
 never quite understood that that 's military <unk> for <unk> british <unk> extremely weird to hear that from an hired gun in canada but whatever works i guess ... and again grateful for <unk> <unk> but what the fuck 
 teach the guards *something* about social engineering 
 *i was n't even id 'd a random john <unk> with the number could have called this in 
 * within a minute their security was all over <unk> 
 i 'm told he was calling systems from the lab to figure out what was wrong with his computer and that some security kid actually drew a <unk> on him - thankfully did n't fire - for zero reasons 
 <unk> why not some guy we do n't know told the boss he was a bad guy 
 ... he was then <unk> taken to a secure room 
 almost like they were all <unk> their <unk> to apply for city police 
 after this went down the floor manager was suddenly a lot more interested in answering the <unk> 
 & gt floor manager : but that ca n't be done without telling us first '' 
 & gt /u/bytewave : when you do n't answer your <unk> and a customer 's service is being actively <unk> 
 looks like it can be done 
 i 'll cc you on the report i 'll be sending to his manager mine and our subcontractor quality director 
 it 'd be nice if we had a reply confirming termination before the latter sees it '' 
 ah the <unk> 
 this guy is <unk> to his blackberry he 'll know all about this before everyone else 
 given his title and his job his <unk> <unk> is <unk> 
 because his title and his entire job description is an <unk> and also <unk> with his first name 
 the floor manager was immediately <unk> after he merely heard the title 
 as usual 
 it 's practically cheating 
 almost done but i still had a guy on hold 
 & gt /u/bytewave : hey <unk> you enjoyed your half hour break '' 
 & gt <unk> : huh has it been that long '' 
 & gt /u/bytewave : yep but that 's alright 
 problem was caused by the previous guy ... subcontractor was resetting the modem 
 i 'd say it was an half hour well spent he 's being terminated 
 we ca n't tell the customer that - explain the 2 minutes resets issue is solved with minimal details and schedule a service call for saturday am for the rf issue '' 
 & gt <unk> : hah seriously 
 he was doing it like on purpose '' 
 & gt /u/bytewave : yep i know right 
 *you got to have absolutely zero professional ethics to work like that ... '' * & gt <unk> : heh heh yeah that 's fucked up 
 alright i got the rest thanks for the assist 
 see you man '' 
 the story of the subcontractor who reset a modem 150 times in 6 hours and how he was ultimately effectively fired in a secure room before his manager even knew about it eventually became public knowledge within the company but thankfully the few who knew all the details never revealed my name 
 i did n't want that kind of <unk> - <unk> figures ca n't get anything done 
 ultimately just a bucket of water in the sea but we take what victories we can get 
 <unk> complete 
 * all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 i was relatively new as a union representative at my telco 
 i was sitting in a room where i was certain a union employee was getting fired 
 the department director his manager a new manager the union vp the employee and myself were there 
 the employee 's official sin was using <unk> time to improve the intranet 
 they had been on his ass for awhile because he did not meet their performance <unk> 
 but it was n't ill intent or <unk> the guy just had a hard time to strictly adhere to procedure and statistics if he believed he had a better way to do things 
 and he did 
 he spent a few hours <unk> code for the company 's intranet and shared his results with many of his colleagues essentially creating a better <unk> intranet 
 union staff loved his work it was a clear step up over the crappy intranet we used back then 
 but for his direct manager it was a great opportunity to pull the plug on a guy who did n't make the <unk> <unk> something they ca n't fire anybody for under our work contract by <unk> he had spent employment time doing something not ordered to by management 
 something they can fire you for 
 & gt director : so we have <unk> evidence of <unk> of company time - the facts are not even in question as per the logs 
 we are terminating employment on time theft grounds effective immediately 
 as per the work contract the union is now free to voice <unk> if they believe there is cause to do so '' 
 usually this is only something they say because they have to 
 but that day the new manager in the room - <unk> - was the first to speak 
 he had nothing to do with the union and he was a relatively new corporate hire did n't even have his <unk> papers in canada yet a fresh <unk> from <unk> <unk> 
 he was hired by the corporation due to extensive experience both as a system administrator and a manager back in <unk> but nobody truly noticed him until that day 
 <unk> was quiet and effective 
 nobody had any problems with him back then 
 management saw him as useful the union saw him as balanced and <unk> 
 & gt <unk> : before we get to that we have to look at the improvements to the intranet 
 three people on my team came out to say they made their work easier and more efficient and i agree 
 i do n't know why we 'd <unk> this employee for improving the ... '' & gt director : come with me <unk> let 's speak outside for a moment '' 
 we never knew for sure what they spoke of outside but it 's pretty obvious 
 if you do n't <unk> the line and you are non-union staff the hammer will fall down almost instantly 
 the next day we knew he was <unk> to pursue new <unk> - aka politely fired 
 i was having lunch with the same union vp when our cellphones beeped with confirmation this was happening 
 & gt bytewave : it 's not the first time he stood up for union staff 
 he successfully argued before in front of the whole management team that multiple of their policies ensured workers could not reach the upper <unk> of <unk> 's <unk> clearly he had spent quite a bit of time studying the concept and cared about it deeply 
 some union staff <unk> <unk> as <unk> ever since '' 
 the union vp was curious and so i explained at length 
 <unk> correctly believed the company was overly focused on productivity and that it <unk> employees ability to have a balanced life and that it in turn damaged productivity 
 that 's extremely unusual for any manager to say aloud they typically always <unk> the line 
 our conversation over lunch infuriated the union vp - he wanted to save this guy 's job but he could n't 
 <unk> 's <unk> was already effective 
 but with an important twist - despite essentially firing the manager they agreed to give the employee who improved the intranet <unk> last chance over his <unk> 
 years later this employee is still with us thanks to the fact this manager spoke out 
 but even without hindsight the union just could n't let someone who lost their job over one of our own out in the cold 
 the union immediately tried to get <unk> a union job somehow 
 but it 's not easy - management <unk> the right to hire 
 for a few days it seemed unlikely we could get him a job because hr would block moves through proper channels 
 but the union does n't always go through proper channels 
 i suggested a few <unk> possibilities and one stuck 
 a few days later we came up with a potential solution 
 & gt vp : are you sure they wo n't be able to tell '' 
 & gt bytewave : no i ca n't 
 he still has the same name 
 just because we 'd be putting his <unk> <unk> straight on top of hr 's <unk> does n't mean they wo n't figure out he was a manager a week ago 
 but we 're not tied to it and he has nothing to lose and we know for a fact they do n't do proper background checks right '' 
 ... and they still do n't 
 <unk> 's <unk> and <unk> <unk> was picked up by the company huge hr department and they gave him an interview for a union sysadmin position - as opposed to his previous non-union management position 
 given his new union sysadmin job was in an entirely different city nobody immediately figured out the scheme 
 after his extensive mandatory trial period was over and he had full union protection the story got around and everybody laughed their <unk> out 
 <unk> is currently one of the better sysadmins we have over at networks and the top contact my department - technical support 's senior <unk> has over there 
 union staff learned the story and he has had a <unk> ever since - <unk> 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 quick little <unk> here 
 i work part time as an independent field tech for a small consulting company 
 we have a bunch of contracts with mostly local medical practices to <unk> most of their networking and hardware needs 
 and by local i mean anything in the 5 <unk> of new <unk> city ... this was from the winter time : december <unk> i 'm sitting at home playing some games because both my main <unk> job and this <unk> job have me off 
 suddenly i get a call from my boss 
 & gt me : hey $ boss what 's going on '' 
 & gt boss : hey i just got a call from the downtown center this contract was with <unk> org that had several locations around the city 
 one of the social workers says her computer is dead and she has critical patient data on her hard drive that she needs <unk> asap 
 could you check it out '' 
 & gt me : sure thing so much for a day off i 'll be there in a half hour '' 
 fast forward through one annoying train ride 
 i arrive at the center head upstairs find the office say hello and begin <unk> my kit 
 because they described it as a full failure and because no one had thought to remotely check the machine i was prepped for data <unk> surgery 
 <unk> adapters power adapters laptop the works 
 and then i actually walk over to the machine 
 and i ask the lady about what i see 
 & gt me : so did it start saying 'no input 
 check signal cable after it died 
 did you smell any smoke or anything burning '' 
 & gt sw : no it just said that and the mouse and keyboard do n't do anything 
 or when i press the power button on the computer '' 
 i do n't like where this is going ... & gt me : hmm 
 bear with me then 
 *plugs the loose vga cable into the monitor and screws it <unk> '' & gt sw : oh my god how did you do that 
 what was wrong with it '' 
 & gt me : usually if it says check the cable you should check the cable before calling us 
 now if that 's all i 'm going to head out 
 hopefully your administrator does n't mind the service call because we bill you guys hourly even if it 's just a 5 minute cable plugging issue 
 have a nice day 
 user says a piece of software they call contact management '' does n't work 
 i log in and make settings <unk> then open the software 
 contact management in big letters now on screen 
 **me : ** could you please log in here '' 
 <unk> : ** log in as myself '' 
 **me : ** 
 <unk> '' 
 <unk> logging in and <unk> i remind her the username is usually numbers 
 i do n't know what log in this is 
 is this the log in for contact management 
 i thought i was just logging into my computer '' 
 <unk> previous line about contact management in big letters across the <unk> she has to text someone to get her username 
 <unk> username for software that she now says she has n't ever tried to use but reported it did n't work 
 **me : ** ok well just call me back if you still have issues after you get your username '' 
 <unk> : ** what do you mean '' 
 **me : ** call me back if it still does n't work '' 
 <unk> : ** i do n't know '' 
 **me : ** what '' 
 <unk> : ** what do you want me to do '' 
 **me : ** get your username 
 try logging in 
 call me if the software still does n't work '' 
 <unk> : ** uhh

 i 'm the it manager for my company 
 system administrator 
 well i 'm the sole it guy for my company and i 'm responsible for pretty much everything that plugs into an outlet or runs on battery 
 needless to say i 'm busy 
 several days ago i had one of our head <unk> approach me regarding one of an in-house program we hand out to customers that essentially <unk> out assembly specs for different things we make and sell 
 it 's not too complicated but it was written by one of the previous it guys about 6 years ago so there is no support for it 
 this program needed to be updated to include new parts and specs for existing parts but <unk> was password locked by the <unk> 
 apparently this has been a growing concern for months but nobody bothered to tell me about it until friday afternoon 
 at this point it was top priority and required me to put other projects on the back burner 
 sales : hey zero we have this program and it 's password locked 
 can you get into it 
 me : i can physically open the program yes 
 i do n't know what the password is though and there 's no documentation of it anywhere 
 sales : ca n't you like do some <unk> shit with a password <unk> program from the internet or something 
 me : no but i 'll see what i can do 
 as i started looking into it i realized i had no idea how this application was written 
 aside from the .exe basically every other file extension was some obscure file type i was n't familiar with 
 it ended up being written with <unk> after 2 days of intermittently trying to figure out how to get past the password lock i finally posted the application and my issue in <unk> 
 after cross <unk> to the guys in <unk> it only took 3 hours before someone had successfully modified the application to allow me past the password screen 
 i know it was something simple but i do n't code in c so it was beyond me 
 told the boss that i called in a favor with some people i know which made me look great and earned me some <unk> points 
 sales was happy boss was happy and i was happy 
 that 's how reddit helped me do my job 
 thanks guys i owe you a <unk> morning from weekend support tfts 
 here 's a <unk> from awhile ago ... of course i 'm still doing support for $ <unk> and the weekends are somewhat of an <unk> around here 
 half are <unk> calls the other half are usually people just helping someone out and do n't know a thing about computers 
 this call falls into the second part 
 <unk> : hello this is punk at $ <unk> tech support 
 how can i help you 
 ** *customer : yes i 'm having trouble getting online 
 * <unk> : alright ... <unk> & gt modem online and pinging 
 <unk> : ma'am what is the error message you 're receiving 
 ** *customer : internet explorer has stopped working 
 * <unk> : okay that is an error with the program itself 
 do you have chrome or firefox 
 ** *customer : firefox 
 * <unk> : try to get online with that 
 ** & gt long pause and <unk> mumbling ... .. *customer : okay i can get to <unk> news but that does n't help me with internet explorer 
 * <unk> : again that is an error with the program itself and i do not support that 
 you are able to get online 
 ** *customer : but it 's an error and i want you to fix it 
 i use explorer for everything 
 * & gt <unk> ... why me 
 <unk> : you will need to call the tech support of the program which would be microsoft or you can contact tech support of your laptop 's manufacturer 
 ** *customer : you just do n't want to fucking help me 
 * <unk> : do n't swear at me ma'am 
 i support your internet as your isp 
 this is not our issue 
 ** *customer : the hell it is n't 
 fix this or i 'm reporting you 
 * <unk> : is there anything else i can assist you with 
 ** *customer : yes i want you to do your fucking job 
 ** <unk> : this is no longer a productive call 
 thank you for calling and have a good day 
 ** *customer : fuck you i want you <unk> & gt click **tl : dr : <unk> - i wondered how hard it was to hire a security manager 
 takes months apparently 
 i sat down for the start of another endless heads of department meeting 
 the secretary walked in 
 & gt sec : coffee anyone 
 & gt me : yep one for me hows the machine working 
 & gt sec : after it was fixed the vp decided we needed a new one 
 & gt me : why get a new one after a repair 
 & gt sec : no idea 
 actually i don’t know how to use the new one yet 
 tea instead 
 & gt me : coffee 
 & gt sec : mmm maybe next time 
 she walked straight out of the room 
 i was coffee-less again 
 the vp walked in the room he didn’t look too happy 
 as if fate where smiling down on me 
 & gt vp : okay 
 lets make this quick 
 firstly i’ve been getting a lot of emails about the new phone system 
 can i get all the managers to inform employee’s they should direct <unk> concerns to airz 
 & gt headhr : all <unk> concerns 
 & gt vp : no 
 of course not all <unk> concerns 
 people keep sending “we need more then $ <unk> to me 
 just those sort of phone related things should go to airz 
 head of accounting was looking thoughtful 
 he had an idea 
 must be a first 
 & gt headac : why is airz running the phone budget 
 surely its a job for accounts 
 & gt me : yes 
 accounts have a central location makes it easy to pick up <unk> 
 the vp didn’t look well 
 he seemed weak 
 & gt vp : airz you’re <unk> 
 the vp seemed to remember something 
 & gt vp : your accounts are under review 
 & gt airz : speaking of i haven’t seen the auditor for ages 
 if coffee was around it would have told me saying that was a mistake 
 but it wasn’t around 
 as if rising from the dead the vp’s eyes started to <unk> 
 he was looking much much better 
 & gt vp : seeing as the first auditor has <unk> it’ll have to find you another 
 & gt headac : i could send one of my <unk> & gt vp : no 
 for something as important as it 
 we’ll need someone external 
 someone <unk> <unk> as i got back to my office auditor was standing near my desk 
 & gt me : what are you ….. & gt audit : haha missed me 
 i’ve been pretty <unk> don’t worry nothing contagious 
 <unk> monday morning a skinny lady with a screechy voice arrived at the office 
 & gt screechy : i’m here to audit this office 
 & gt me : sorry we’ve actually already got an <unk> 
 and that 's how i ended up with two auditors 
 lets hope the numbers all add up 
 freaking <unk> 
 next older this tale reminded me of something similar that happened at my last job 
 it too involved shared files 
 it too involved failure to understand the word <unk> 
 surprisingly it also involved people using the shared drive like they were supposed to 
 seriously though most people there were reasonably competent most of the time 
 you only hear about it when they were n't 
 one day one of our <unk> servers had to go down for some reason 
 whatever reason that was also meant it had to go down in the middle of the work day which was highly unusual systems guy was usually much better about that sort of thing 
 so here 's how it went down : & gt <unk> <unk> one <unk> <unk> of emails between everyone in tech confirming that this has to happen this way 
 <unk> <unk> three <unk> email warning goes out to everyone affected and then some 
 email follows our normal downtime notice template which goes something like : & gt scheduled downtime 
 the <unk> in the <unk> office will be down on $ date from $ time to $ time for scheduled maintenance 
 this change means that the $ <unk> drive will be <unk> 
 this change will affect larry <unk> and <unk> teams because the $ bar $ <unk> $ <unk> folders will be <unk> 
 $ <unk> $ <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> three days -- the <unk> <unk> bomb <unk> in all its glory 
 everything you could possibly expect from a <unk> bomb happened 
 the responses come in fast and furious for several hours then slow to a trickle which continues until ... <unk> plus 10 minutes** tickets begin flowing in from people complaining that the files are down '' 
 tl dr we all know that i acknowledge i have read and agree to ... '' does n't mean shit 
 <unk> : added detail for additional <unk> again 
 since working at a hospital tier 2 support desk last summer i 've moved on to a saturday job at a small computer repair place 
 even though it 's not paid very well i enjoy working there 
 i get along with my colleague pretty well my expertise is appreciated there and most of the time it 's pretty quiet 
 my boss is a bit of an odd character though 
 often <unk> our services or being <unk> honest to get a sale 
 yes your computer is definitely dead but i can give you an offer on a replacement '' 
 after coming in yesterday and <unk> their internet outage that had been ongoing for two days in under an hour they had replaced their router while the fault lied at an <unk> switch which had been connected to itself because of poor cable management my boss pointed me in the direction of a <unk> 
 & gt me : uhm ... what do you want me to do with this 
 i 'm not a printer tech in shape or form i 'm a <unk> guy mainly 
 & gt boss : the heads need to be cleaned it 's printing bad 
 & gt me : surely you ca n't expect us to put hours of work in a cheap retail printer 
 & gt boss : it 's easy 
 just <unk> it 
 * and so i did 
 i found a video for <unk> a similar but not quite identical printer 
 after about half an hour of <unk> ribbon cables i had managed to disassemble the head and i had the offending part in my hands 
 using a combination of a <unk> <unk> water and a general sense of confusion about the whole ordeal i cleaned the part while making a very <unk> ink pattern on the walls of the kitchen area and my shirt 
 there it was done 
 or so i thought 
 <unk> the printer proved to be much more difficult since some of the ribbon cables i pulled some <unk> proved very difficult if not impossible to <unk> and also very flimsy 
 after <unk> some plastic parts with some pliers and hiding the plastic <unk> to gain access at the connectors i had a sense of relief 
 the printer was in one part 
 and then i pressed the power button 
 the printer screamed at me like an <unk> from hell and had a very <unk> error message on it 's screen prompting me <unk> it which did n't help 
 after pulling all the ribbon cables and reconnecting them with the same result i was at a loss 
 & gt boss : well you 'll have to <unk> it again 
 & gt me : i just did that 
 & gt boss : no matter 
 shortly after that my boss left the shop so i promptly made a <unk> in the air with my thumb to <unk> it dead and put it back on the <unk> where i found it 
 i 'm glad i do n't have to break the news to the customer 
 then again it was probably time for a new one anyways 
 tl dr : was told to fix a printer 
 i am not a printer tech 
 the printer is now <unk> work in i.t and volunteer once a week at a <unk> home teaching basic computer skills but mostly troubleshoot their problems 
 there 's a woman that has been coming down for almost a year 
 she knows what i call the <unk> basics '' 
 google search youtube and email 
 one day she comes to me and tells me i accidentally deleted <unk> '' 
 i laugh slightly and tell her oh do n't worry you probably just deleted the shortcut i left on your desktop '' 
 she goes no no i deleted it from the <unk> programs list '' 
 now at this point there was both fury and joy in my eyes 
 i scream out who the hell taught you how to delete programs 
 it sure as hell was n't me 
 i am both mad and impressed <unk> 
 she is <unk> <unk> old 
 she always has dinner ready for me when i get there 
 if your helpdesk job is mundane volunteer with <unk> and teach them 
 it 'll change your <unk> ... some back story here 
 i am a <unk> 
 specifically i build custom semi trucks for work and custom <unk> for fun 
 i have a <unk> <unk> that has only a reddit app and a smart tv that does everything i need it to 
 i had a home computer 
 i had a laptop 
 i had a tablet 
 all these are gone now thanks to me being what all it people refer to as *user* 
 i do n't know what a server <unk> office or any of the other <unk> you use is 
 i know this ... i 'm that guy 
 i know this because of my neighbors 
 i live in a nice neighborhood of homes with my wife and son 
 my neighbor across the street is an upper level it tech at one of the big 3 his son is a tech at <unk> cable company next door <unk> a couple who are also some tier something level something it techs at another foreign car company 
 all of them work from home most of the time remotely or the office occasionally 
 remember when i said i had all that equipment '' 
 they took it all away from me because i killed all of it in one way or another 
 dont know how ... i just did 
 i dont have any idea what i 'm doing 
 i can <unk> an engine in a day <unk> anything in any direction and double click everything 
 i called my neighbors constantly trying to explain what went wrong 
 i called them to look at this or that 
 set up my printer 
 fix my printer 
 burn movies for me 
 show me how to make my tv play said movies 
 borrow cables power <unk> <unk> that go on your keychain that hold lots of pics the occasional <unk> <unk> game which both only have a <unk> and pc games and everything else computer related 
 i do <unk> the <unk> though 
 i <unk> their <unk> fix <unk> repair their cars <unk> windows and anything else they need done that <unk> require a computer 
 until finding this subreddit i had no idea the suffering the went through on a daily basis 
 i thought i had it bad when i got burned broke a finger or two or cut myself this happens daily 
 then on top of it dealing with a neighbor like me that is basically making them work overtime 
 i figured they just sat at home in their <unk> 's all day talking on the phone while playing video games not knowing the difference between a <unk> and a <unk> saw 
 i have a new found respect for them and your profession 
 i wrote all of this on my smart phone because its the only device my neighbors said i ca n't break 
 thanks for the internet by the way 
 it works great 
 keep it up 
 tl dr & lt -- -- i have no idea what this <unk> boss is not tech-savvy 
 he knows how to send an email i explained how a <unk> works and if he remembers to plug in his printer he can print something out 
 <unk> technology 
 he asks me to do research and submit the results in <unk> form 
 i do sending it to him as a pdf since pdf will print from pretty much any printer 
 printout works fine we discuss the results and he requests that i send the data to him in word '' 
 no big deal sending him the word file 
 next morning i wake up to this 
 dear <unk> that 's not exactly what i meant - i meant not in <unk> form but in words like you know how i always do my lists '' 
 i am still <unk> 
 he meant word '' in the most literal sense ever 
 not <unk> form a <unk> list in well words 
 a word file 
 literally 
 i do n't even 
 tl dr : til what a word file really is 
 edit : holy <unk> 
 you guys are the shit 
 also my boss is apparently a <unk> <unk> tech-illiterate girlfriend is taking a <unk> class and she has to submit these photos online for class 
 she calls me on skype and says i ca n't submit these photos because it says they 're over the 50mb limit '' 
 of course this <unk> me as no <unk> sized <unk> should be over 50mb 
 so i ask her what the <unk> are of her <unk> 
 she says 800 <unk> by <unk> height '' 
 then her macbook pro starts <unk> really bad 
 she ca n't open up any other programs and her computer is just slow as all hell 
 i 'm trying to figure out on my end why this file is <unk> mb when it 's just a picture of two boots 
 so she <unk> the <unk> to google drive and sends it to me and i see nothing wrong with the <unk> but as soon as i open it my ram starts climbing 
 <unk> ... <unk> ... <unk> ... pretty soon it 's <unk> out and the program i 'm using to open the <unk> crashes 
 so i open the properties of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> are <unk> 
 so she opens the <unk> in photoshop again and she says it 's 800 by <unk> '' 
 then i hear it 's supposed to be in inches right '' 
 800 inches is <unk> <unk> other day i had a gram come in with a gps it went like this 
 <unk> walks in* & gt gram : my cable wo n't work in my gps 
 i look at the cable look at the port 
 & gt me : this is the wrong cable 
 & gt gram : no i 've been using this cable since i bought it it came with it 
 <unk> to self ok still not the right cable 
 * i look at the port on the gps look at the usb end 
 two different <unk> 
 i walk to my desk grab a cable and show her 
 & gt me : the cable you have is n't the proper size 
 if you look here at my cable usb <unk> it fits right in 
 if you look at your cable usb mini it does n't fit 
 you supplied a usb mini but the cable needs to be usb <unk> 
 she looks at me as if i 'm full of crap 
 i show her my cable slide in and out where as hers wo n't fit 
 & gt me : you can go to <unk> retail <unk> and buy a proper cable 
 still do n't know why she did n't look and see the obvious size <unk> ftp yadda yadda 
 this is a short story from a friend of mine who was a cable tech 
 i asked him if i could share it and he said go for it '' 
 here it goes 
 so $ client called $ <unk> or $ <unk> 
 here 's how it went : $ <unk> : thank you for calling & lt cable company & gt 
 how can i help 
 $ client : my son unplugged the coax good sign she knows what coax is because the tv was n't working and he got an electric shock 
 i think the electricity may have gotten into the tv 
 can you send someone over 
 $ <unk> : oh no terribly sorry 
 i 'll send $ friend to come check it out tomorrow 
 is that ok 
 $ client : no can it be the day after 
 i wo n't be home 
 $ <unk> : no problem 
 have a nice day <unk> etc 
 etc 
 *so 2 days later $ friend goes over to the client location to check it out 
 he greets $ client 
 * $ client : so glad you 're here 
 i turned the mains power off just in case 
 $ friend : so you 've been without electricity for 2 days 
 $ client : yeah had to throw away everything in the freezer too 
 does n't matter as long as my son is safe from the electricity in the tv 
 $ friend : sorry to hear that 
 i 'll go check it out 
 can you show me where the box is please 
 $ client : right here 
 so $ friend checks it out and sees a <unk> wire from the coax <unk> poking out 
 he does some tests to be sure <unk> the wire etc 
 and turns the power back on 
 son goes over to touch it again and <unk> his finger with the same wire 
 $ friend <unk> the terminator and leaves 
 woman yells at her son for wasting so much food the african kids could have <unk> '' 
 **tldr : son ca n't tell the difference between electricity and a <unk> wire and mother destroys hundreds worth of food to save him from a <unk> edit : <unk> husband and i have a computer support business that serves very small businesses and home users 
 <unk> year old <unk> customer : “is there pornography on my computer ” me : “no there is no pornography on your <unk> <unk> : “but how do you get it on your computer ” me : <unk> people get it by accident by clicking on infected links and other people download it on <unk> <unk> : “but where would you find it 
 i wouldn’t know where to <unk> me : <unk> can find it just type a <unk> word into a search <unk> <unk> : <unk> a search engine ” me : “you use <unk> <unk> : “but what word would i type ” me : “oh anything like <unk> maybe ” <unk> : “i was thinking of typing <unk> i haven’t seen one in 45 <unk> <unk> on laughter i quickly change the <unk> 
 after about 5 <unk> 
 <unk> : <unk> your husband also go out on calls ” me : “yes we both <unk> <unk> : “is he a nice looking man ” me : “oh yes he is a very attractive <unk> <unk> : “do you let him go out on calls to single women ” me : “well i’m not letting him come here – i hear you are a wild woman who hasn’t seen a <unk> in 45 years ” i think we made each <unk> day 
 another monday at work checking the ticket cue picking out the good ones because i 'm not in a <unk> today 
 found this rather unique request by $ electrician & gt $ electrician : hi we have to replace our old mobile workstation - it is still running windows nt and now that it is 18 <unk> old we 'd like to get a new one 
 requested hardware needs to be no bigger than <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> desktop <unk> so it can fit on the old trolley and has to have a small screen set on top of it 
 we 'd also like to have a bigger cable drum so we 'll be able to use in our <unk> blow <unk> wich does n't have any free socket outlets below <unk> voltage 
 picking up the phone with a big grin i think i came up with a suitable solution for this request & gt $ <unk> : hi $ electrician 
 thank you for your hardware request 
 i <unk> and <unk> the given information and think you might be happy to use a laptop instead 
 i swear you can still hear the <unk> of his huge facepalm in the phone line for the weeks to come 
 & gt $ electrician : damn ... a laptop would indeed solve some problems we had with this mobile computing trolley over the years 
 got ta get that laptop ready for them 
 he 's a really nice guy and all but i wonder why they did n't even bother to find a better solution for this <unk> <unk> tldr if you 're tired of dragging 50 <unk> of hardware around for your daily work consider using a <unk> at my current job i am discovering that one employee is going to be something of a <unk> <unk> 
 she claims to have come from another company where she used to work in the it department and loves to question my every action 
 here are a few short stories from the past couple of weeks 
 ticket : he <unk> my printer has n't been working this morning can you come take a look 
 i walk over to the office to find her there with the person who has a problem 
 me : so a printer is n't working 
 her : i already looked at it for you 
 you need to order a new one for her 
 me : interesting i spend a minute or two checking all the connections to make sure nothing is loose her : i already checked that 
 i <unk> down under her desk and see the breaker on the <unk> under the desk has been tripped 
 i flip it off and back on and then the printer starts up fine 
 i smile and go back to my office 
 a few days later and another printer is making really horrible noises and not printing 
 she is waiting there again 
 her : when are you going to replace these printers 
 me : when they need to be replaced 
 i open the tray to see some paper caught in the rollers 
 clear the jam a little <unk> and the printer works fine her : this would n't be a problem in my old office 
 they listened to me and replaced all the old equipment 
 me : i think these old girls still have some life in them 
 about an hour ago i get a ticket from her saying that the company programs have stopped working 
 me : what seems to be the problem 
 her : these crappy dells you buy ca n't run our systems 
 me : alright can i see your mouse for a moment 
 i sit down and immediately notice something is wrong 
 me : is this windows 8 
 her : yeah 
 7 is out of date and i decided to update my computer since you wont do it 
 me : i see 
 you do know that our tools are developed internally and they only work on <unk> yes 
 her : win 7 is out of date 
 you need to update the office 
 i know i used to do your job at my old office 
 i ended up taking her computer and am currently letting it do a slow format while i drink my afternoon coffee 
 she has been in a private meeting with the gm who was rather upset about the situation when i told him what happened after i walked past his office with a pc tower under my arm 
 edit for formatting update : for all the people saying i need to lock down her computer <unk> 
 do n't worry i have plans update of the update : alright sorry it took so long but i got stuck on the phone with a certain cellphone provider for 4 hours 
 you know because that 's how long it takes to transfer the number from an old cell phone to a new one 
 the <unk> of crappy hold music also left me in something of a <unk> mood 
 so after i finished placing our image onto the troublemaker pc i locked her out of booting from anything other than the hard drive from the bios and then password locked the bios to keep her out of it 
 i also changed her access level on the company web filter 
 normally neither i nor the office managers care if people are on facebook ebay amazon twitter <unk> so long as they get their work done but technically it policy says they should n't be able to unless they are managers i 'm currently working on a script that will run on start up that will pop up a message with a copy pasted text of the company ip policy concerning <unk> of equipment without the consent of it 
 think of it like the <unk> notice at the beginning of home movies 
 for those surprised to find out she is n't fired 
 the gm decided to give her a second chance but if she screws up again he is going to boot her out 
 i do n't want one bad apple to give a bad impression of the office 
 everyone else here is great and easy to work with 
 worked for a hosting company back in the day 
 tier 1 techs took front line calls tier 2 helped tier 1 with front line calls on occasion but mostly handled escalations and more technical cases beyond tier 1 capabilities and tier 3 were like baby admins with root access helping <unk> 1 & amp 2. i was a tier 1 tech getting assistance from a few tier 2 and 3 friends to start learning some more advanced stuff so i could apply for a tier 2 position 
 while talking to a tier 3 tech about something new to me i think we were talking about raid but i do n't remember some <unk> tier 2 guy keeps <unk> with stuff trying to help '' me learn 
 i looked to tier 3 <unk> who discreetly shook his head no '' <unk> : <unk> just ignore him '' 
 <unk> : is he wrong '' 
 <unk> : he is literally the last person you should ever ask for help from '' 
 <unk> : really 
 he 's a tier 2 though so he should know more than i do ... '' <unk> : he only got that position through <unk> 
 he 's completely <unk> 
 <unk> actually wanted to <unk> him straight to tier 3 but the admins would n't allow him anywhere near a server and give him root access '' 
 <unk> : that bad huh '' 
 <unk> : yeah '' 
 <unk> : what did he do to get on their bad side '' 
 <unk> : oh lots of stupid things 
 like one time a server was running slow **so he told them to <unk> <unk> because it was <unk> resources 
 ** he was totally serious 
 so he 's <unk> from being promoted anywhere 
 he 's stuck where he is forever '' 
 edit for the web hosting <unk> : telling a sysadmin to kill <unk> '' for taking up lots of resources is like telling a mechanic to remove a car 's engine because it 's <unk> gas 
 without the engine it wo n't go 
 and people pay lots of money for it to go fast 
 back in the days of big iron a <unk> sized computer was the size of 2 <unk> the <unk> cabinet was another 2 <unk> and each disk in the <unk> was the size of a small washing machine 
 they were large and there were a lot of parts lots and lots of parts 
 boards and cables and more cables and all sorts of bits and pieces 
 here is a pic for your <unk> pleasure 
 the it department and back then the term it had not been <unk> it was the computer department bought one of these <unk> sized <unk> 
 now this was a major purchase and had to approved by several people including the vice president of engineering better known as “the mad <unk> 
 now <unk> was the type of guy who added value to the organization by cutting costs as opposed to generating new revenue 
 he was a <unk> counter <unk> 
 this purchase was no exception 
 when purchasing one of these <unk> the manufacturer would send you a quote listing out all the components and the price of each component 
 <unk> carefully <unk> many pages of the quote and started crossing out items he considered non-critical such as the console terminal and keyboard hey we can reuse one in house right 
 and he crossed out cables to connect the cpu cabinet to the peripherals cabinet cables to connect the peripherals cabinet to the disk drives cables to connect everything else together 
 i mean they’re just cables we can have our hardware techs make our own cables right 
 of course we can we’re engineers we can do anything 
 and wow look i saved $ <unk> on a $ <unk> order 
 i am a financial genius 
 so without having the computer department do one final check on the items being ordered and really why would you have technical people review technical decisions made by a guy who isn’t technical the order goes out 
 and the manufacturer <unk> the equipment exactly as specified on the hacked up quote 
 and the equipment arrives and is placed in the computer room 
 and field service comes on site to do the installation 
 but then field service starts asking questions like where are the data cables for the disk drives 
 where are the bus cables from the cpu to the peripherals 
 on and on all these <unk> little missing cables 
 <unk> cables 
 someone <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 ok so everything will be delayed for another month or two while a new purchase order gets generated and approved to order the cables 
 or so they think 
 you see these cables are not normally sold separately they are sold as part of a package a package that includes a $ <unk> computer 
 there are no ordering numbers for these cables 
 there is no way to tell manufacturing hey just send us a few parts 
 no one can figure out how to sell us these parts and just these parts 
 and no doing a mirror of the quote with all the delivered parts crossed out is n't going to work 
 so the computer sat in the computer room <unk> for 6 months while this <unk> was <unk> 
 if we look at this in terms of engineering man hours lost : 6 months is 26 weeks one week is 40 hours there were about 25 engineers who were going to use the machine and figure that back then one engineering man hour was worth about $ 50 
 so about $ <unk> lost man hours 
 plus a $ <unk> <unk> 
 maybe i should have called this cables 
 we do n't need no stinking cables '' 
 <unk> : user is an <unk> elderly woman 
 she had her pc upgraded recently 
 company uses <unk> on a daily basis 
 it 's being installed while making an image for new pc 's sooo it 's everywhere 
 <unk> <unk> & gt $ me : hello it 
 & gt $ user : i ca n't seem to find <unk> on my pc 
 & gt $ me : i am sure it is there 
 & gt $ user : it 's not on my desktop 
 how do i find it than 
 & gt $ me : you need to search for it in the start menu 
 <unk> press the start button and type <unk> '' 
 & gt $ user : ok. start ... and ... oops 
 i <unk> down the pc 
 i 'm gon na call you back 
 click it has been 3 hours ago 
 i guess her new pc is just really <unk> morning 
 i walk into the office in a better mood then i had left it 
 the horrors of the missing switch now firmly in the back of my mind 
 an it colleague runs up to me 
 he’s wearing a green shirt it doesn’t work with the red pants 
 & gt colorblind : airz 
 level three wants you <unk> 
 & gt me : <unk> 
 is this a hospital now 
 & gt colorblind : if so does that make me a nurse 
 & gt me : oh are you saying im a doctor 
 … 
 wait i don’t have time for this 
 as i rush to level three i dream of being a doctor a less stressful life 
 i open the <unk> doors to level three and look straight down the hall 
 at the end of the <unk> a half height rack filled with switches 
 it was home 
 standing next to the rack someone was trying every key on their chain to get into the comms room 
 the lock i had installed on the door was holding firm 
 as i thought about how good of a maintenance man i could be i walked down the hall towards the obvious culprit 
 & gt me : you 
 he turned around 
 i smiled 
 time for someone to be fired 
 as i was dragging youngsec towards hr for stealing a rack i thought about the <unk> games i had watched all weekend 
 <unk> seems so dull 
 why did i watch it 
 probably a lack of coffee 
 & gt me : this is a termination interview 
 i announced as i sat down in head of hr’s office 
 & gt youngsec : but why 
 & gt me : you stole a rack of switches 
 & gt youngsec : but the <unk> as if summoned like the devil the vp showed up 
 & gt vp : sorry this is all a misunderstanding 
 & gt me : no 
 youngsec stole the rack 
 stealing someone <unk> sandwich out of the fridge is grounds for termination 
 so stealing a <unk> 
 as his manager i’m letting him go 
 & gt vp : actually if you recall he isn’t on your payroll 
 you ca n't fire him 
 i had forgotten that the vp kept this pawn off my books 
 & gt vp : you can stay 
 & gt me : he <unk> 
 the vp cut me off 
 & gt vp : no 
 actually what happened was on friday my mouse ran out of batteries 
 i went searching for some and found my way to the third floor comms room 
 whilst inside i accidentally kicked the rack 
 it stopped flashing 
 & gt me : so you… & gt vp : so i found youngsec 
 i knew he was good with these things 
 he took a look at it and told me he could fix the damage 
 i was so pleased i went to grab him a drink but when i got back the rack was gone 
 youngsec finally found his voice 
 the pawn finally spoke 
 & gt youngsec : yes 
 sorry 
 i took the rack home to fix it 
 & gt me : why 
 its a switch 
 & gt vp : doesn’t matter 
 what matters is he tried to fix it 
 & gt me : i don’t care what he tried to do 
 he would have taken level three offline for two days 
 & gt youngsec : this place is open 
 on the weekends 
 & gt me : no s*** <unk> 
 it looked like the pawn was going to escape my trap 
 i gave chase 
 & gt me : i can’t have him as a security now 
 who knows what else he’ll just <unk> <unk> to <unk> 
 & gt vp : mmmm maybe just give him no keys 
 & gt me : a security guard 
 with no keys 
 that 's a <unk> <unk> 
 i was so close to getting this pawn off the board 
 i could feel it 
 & gt vp : that is a good point 
 the head of hr who had sat quietly through the entire conversation decided to throw in her two <unk> 
 & gt headhr : you could always <unk> him over to it 
 he does seem interested in it 
 & gt youngsec : and i did fix that rack 
 & gt me : no 
 & gt vp : yes 
 i looked over at the vp’s pawn 
 he’d just hit the end of the board and become a queen 
 f*** as the first battle ended i walked out the door and looked back 
 the vp was smiling 
 youngsec looked happy 
 head of hr seemed delighted 
 everybody wins 
 next older i work as the sole it guy at a resort 
 i just got a call from someone in our restaurant 
 & gt user : we are having trouble with $ software 
 when we try to post a check it tells use there is not enough disk space 
 & gt me : can you read the exact error message to me word for word 
 & gt user : no 
 it just says unable to post file not enough disk space 
 call $ vendor '' 
 & gt me : is that what it said word for word 
 & gt user : yes 
 ... ok i guess i will call $ vendor and give them that error <unk> short one here 
 was helping a client <unk> their wireless printer to their network as they 'd replaced their router with a combo modem new ip <unk> etc 
 connected and this <unk> document prints out as part of the printer queue shared family computer 
 title of the document is the title of this tfts 
 turns out the husband who had contracted me had no idea 
 things got real silent after he said honey 
 did you print this 
 i quietly sat there until he wrote my check and then nope 'd out of there 
 tl dr : the next pages <unk> out of that printer are the divorce <unk> e-mail that just came in : & gt hello could we have laptops with <unk> ram and new <unk> <unk> build on them <unk> for noon today 
 sorry for the <unk> request 
 it is currently <unk> 
 <unk> **edit : my team leader kindly told him to fuck off and use a vm instead ... hours later way past noon 
 **i work at a university it call center that provides <unk> general computer assistance to students faculty and staff 
 we also handle account access for these individuals 
 we are required to have all access requests documented and kept for at least <unk> days 
 to get access especially for new hires a supervisor must <unk> on the form listing required access and then it is turned in either physically or electronically 
 with how many forms we get it takes on average <unk> hours from submission to completion so we tell people to always submit them as soon as possible 
 this is a call i got just a few minutes ago 
 & gt <unk> : it support this is <unk> 
 & gt pebkac : i need to know why my new employee does n't have access to anything yet 
 she started nearly two weeks ago and still ca n't get in to anything 
 & gt <unk> : well ma'am what is the employee 's name and have you submitted an access request 
 & gt pebkac : what 
 what is that what do you mean access request '' 
 *note : this woman has worked here for years and should know what it <unk> & gt <unk> : well if you have n't submitted an access request that would explain why she does n't have access 
 we ca n't give her access to anything if nobody actually requests that access 
 once you get that request in it takes about <unk> hours and then the employee will have whatever access you asked for on the form 
 & gt pebkac : what 
 this is ridiculous 
 she 's already gone ten days without anything 
 i need this done now 
 & gt <unk> : well sounds like you really need to get that form in 
 have a nice day 
 & gt *click* i 'm so done with this woman this is n't the first time she 's done something like this 
 edit : <unk> called with some rather strange logic today 
 & gt i 've been getting a fan error for the past couple of days but my temporary fix no longer works and my computer does n't turn on anymore 
 i ask the user what he has done to his computer to fix the issue assuming that he has been using compressed air to blow out his laptop or something <unk> 
 & gt well since heat is a good thing for computers i decided to use my <unk> old hair <unk> to help the fan error 
 i used that <unk> <unk> work tape and attached the hair <unk> to the laptop so it wouldnt burn my fingers but it would blow the nice hot air into the computer and provide good dust <unk> 
 while attempting to not be a condescending jerk to this guy i calmly explain that he needs to remove the hair <unk> and tape and this should not be done in the future as heat can greatly reduce the life of electronics 
 then explain to him that i will assign a ticket to his deskside group to come pick up the laptop so they can assess the laptop 
 next time dude just call tech support 
 you probably ruined that computer 
 thanks <unk> 
 this even got me baffled so worth the share i think : call from a user : & gt user : hi <unk> 
 for some reason i am unable to <unk> e-mails into my archives anymore 
 & gt <unk> : that 's pretty odd let me take over your computer for a sec 
 i suspected a faulty mouse or something but to my surprise i was n't even able to do it remotely 
 & gt <unk> : ok what 's going on here 
 let me do another test and try to drag an icon across your desktop '' 
 to my surprise we were unable to drag any icon anywhere 
 & gt <unk> : well user i 'm flabbergasted 
 let me google that real quick ... ok try the following : click and hold any icon on your desktop and while doing so press escape '' 
 & gt user : hey it works again 
 thanks <unk> '' 
 dear diary til click hold and escape is a shortcut to disable the drag function ... **edit : the system was a windows 7 <unk> enterprise 
 two of my colleagues tested it and it '' worked '' with only one of them 
 worked on me as well 
 also his escape was n't stuck 
 google drag not working windows 7 '' and you will find multiple people with this issue on microsoft forums and the suggested fix 
 <unk> tfts first time poster 
 i work in software development 
 while not specifically it it does land me in doing it related things because i know computers '' 
 this sadly is n't one of those times 
 this story starts a few years ago 
 i was in charge of an app for a certain client 
 this app was installed on scanner devices to allow our client to keep track of their stock 
 basically every box bag drum <unk> and basket in their <unk> had a sticker with a bar code on it 
 you scan it into our app and it <unk> the relevant data from the database <unk> it was produced how much of it is there is it reserved etc 
 and allows a few basic operations from the app mostly marking stuff in the database 
 it 's around june and our client puts in a request to <unk> our app so they can do their <unk> inventory with it 
 this involved allowing the <unk> regular worker <unk> to directly mess with the data concerning <unk> of stock - something we strictly control and is otherwise almost entirely automated 
 good times 
 fast forward to those awful few days between christmas break and new year 's 
 the app has long since been updated and the <unk> were finishing up their jobs 
 i was investigating a bug with the way we <unk> this particular data and i run across something strange 
 the bad kind of strange 
 a few hours of juggling e-mails while digging through the database and logs the following sequence of events becomes clear : & gt <unk> p scans the identification sticker of a box and it <unk> it as box # <unk> 
 & gt p is then prompted to enter how many packets of nails are in box # <unk> 
 & gt p scans the sticker again and to his <unk> nothing happens 
 & gt p calls over senior <unk> <unk> for help and explains the scanner is n't working 
 & gt <unk> tells p to manually enter the box code if the scanning device ca n't read it 
 & gt p enters <unk> into the packets of nails '' field and clicks ok. & gt p sees a warning popup the developer <unk> put in to prevent this <unk> begging the user to double-check their input before <unk> 
 & gt p is fresh out of # $ % & amp s to give and clicks accept '' 
 & gt system now thinks box # <unk> has <unk> packets of nails instead of the actually accurate 200 
 & gt p continues on his merry way repeating the process for the next 45 minutes <unk> screwing up 12 months worth of records 
 & gt <unk> developer <unk> onto this mess completely by accident and now has to spend 2 days cleaning it up 
 tl dr there 's a reason access to data is limited 
 edit : to the people pointing out this should have been a <unk> process i agree completely 
 unfortunately management deemed that notion too disruptive to the workflow '' # # # a little background first : i am a manager at a security company we basically install security cameras in <unk> or small businesses and if they so desire and are willing to pay keep a remote database of their video footage for them 
 all our software is home made and we need technicians to maintain the code networks hardware etc 
 two months ago we hired an * $ <unk> at the company he had a lot of trouble finding his way around the code and maintaining it so we tried him out in customer service instead 
 thing is when you are in customer service you become for a lack of a better term the face of the company you work at other than your <unk> no one knows you work at <unk> <unk> if you do only background work 
 # # # the first contact : one day * $ <unk> <unk> his * $ <unk> on the phone while he was shopping for a security system 
 * $ <unk> decides it would be a great idea to tell * $ <unk> 's * $ <unk> about the fact that her nephew * $ <unk> is working at a tech support '' company which we are not 
 the next day * $ <unk> shows up at our front desk 
 thing is internship at the company is n't a small deal for us since we 're a small business interns do n't do <unk> a single job 
 we try to make them do a bit of everything until they find what they 're good at and/or enjoy doing and take a full time job 
 * $ <unk> was mostly busy learning how to maintain the software at the time he was n't doing customer support all day 
 a = * $ <unk> m = * $ me* & gt a : hi i 'd like to see my nephew i believe he can help me fix my tablet 
 & gt m : $ intern is busy working he 's not doing customer service at the moment 
 & gt a : well i 'd like to see him anyways he 's certainly not chained in the basement is he 
 & gt m : i 'll go get your nephew just for this time but please be quick he 's very busy at the moment 
 * $ <unk> proceeds to explain the multiple problems she has with her tablet to * $ <unk> while i go back to work 
 # # # feed a man a fish ... : * $ <unk> came back 2 or 3 days later but now for a computer problem 
 i have no idea why but because we were good with computers '' she thought she was entitled to free tech support 
 since her nephew was n't there i think one of * $ <unk> decided to step in and help her out of <unk> 
 big mistake 
 this reinforced her <unk> that we would always help her out nephew or not 
 i was n't too concerned at the time i thought this was most likely be a one time thing 
 she comes we help her we never see her again 
 except it was n't the case she came back maybe one or two weeks later with a problem with her printer if i recall correctly 
 since it was around the last days of * $ <unk> 's internship a bit redundant eh 
 he decided to help her out one last time out of <unk> 
 <unk> thing but huge mistake here again 
 he plugs the printer finds the issue in minutes says goodbye and goes back to his job 
 a few days time later the internship ends and since * $ <unk> is still in trade school he 's not going to be taking a full time job any time soon 
 # # # is n't it my personal tech support 
 : a few weeks later * $ <unk> comes back for more tech support 
 while i try to politely <unk> since you know her nephew does n't work here anymore she asks to see * $ <unk> the employee that helped her with her computer problems when * $ <unk> was n't there 
 while i agree this might be my fault for agreeing to this but believe me i did n't think this would become what it became i tried to convince * $ <unk> that he should n't feed the <unk> and let her be he insisted to help her 
 i try not to worry too much and let it pass once again 
 * $ <unk> comes back the next day to complain about * $ <unk> 's help : a = * $ <unk> g = * $ <unk> & gt a : * $ <unk> helped me with my tablet yesterday he did n't fix the problem it 's still happening it would n't have happened if my nephew fixed it 
 & gt g : i 'll try to find the issue and fix it but i ca n't guarantee anything 
 & gt a : you see this is the thing you do n't <unk> to help me you just want to get rid of me 
 & gt g : not at all i <unk> left my break to come and help you 
 & gt a : no you did not you left your <unk> job that 's what you did 
 you could see * $ <unk> was really starting to get pissed but did n't do anything because you know he 's a * $ <unk> 
 after a few minutes finds the issue fixes it gives back the tablet to * $ <unk> and she goes away angrily 
 later that day * $ <unk> comes back with her husband * $ <unk> our <unk> customer : a = * $ <unk> u = * $ <unk> m = * $ me* & gt u : my wife told me you did n't treat her accordingly & gt m : sir have my most <unk> apologies but we can only supply tech support for things related to our product anything else is n't in our contract nor valuable of our time to deal with 
 & gt a : you see this is the problem right here * $ <unk> actually enjoys his job enough to take the time and help me while your employees just do it to get rid of me 
 & gt m : that 's exactly it ma'am no one here enjoys helping someone they do n't know and waste the company 's time absolutely for free 
 & gt a : but my nephew enjoyed helping me why is n't he here 
 & gt m : your nephew does n't work here anymore ma'am he .. & gt a : why did you fire him 
 & gt m : we did <unk> & gt a : why did you fire my nephew 
 he is a hard worker he is the best in the domain and he is willing to do everything to fix my problems which your employees are obviously not competent at 
 you just fired what would 've been your best employee 
 & gt u : <unk> his wife 's <unk> if you fire my nephew you lose me as a customer no nephew no business 
 & gt a : if you do not call him immediately to hire him back you 'll lose us as customers 
 & gt m : ma'am this is not possible to hire him <unk> & gt u : well that 's too bad you just lost some very <unk> customers 
 they both left and never came back 
 i never got the chance to explain why their nephew was n't fired but actually <unk> since he signed a contract with us that we would grant him a job as soon as he finishes studying as long as he <unk> a good average with his <unk> 
 oh well ca n't say i 'm too sad about losing '' them both 
 edit : <unk> for any formatting errors 
 i am a long time lurker and had to create an account to share this with you 
 second day of work and was receiving an error message 
 for this story it is important to note our i.t 
 guys are in the same office and their <unk> '' is about 10 feet away from my desk 
 me : hey paul i.t 
 <unk> i 'm receiving this error message 
 i tried to restart my computer and got the same message 
 i tried googling it but still do n't understand what its asking me 
 how do i enter a ticket for your queue '' 
 paul : if you 've done both of those things you do n't enter a ticket into the queue 
 i will work on it right now 
 by the way i think i like you '' 
 off to a good relationship i think 
 i was enjoying my morning it was a quiet one i was going over backups and running quick random file <unk> 
 everything was going great until ... & gt help ticket : & gt & gt my computer ate my <unk> and i ca n't leave to go to lunch until i get it back or replaced 
 this was a rather confusing help ticket since we do n't have <unk> and her computer should n't have been able to eat something that does n't exist 
 i decide to go see what she has lost in her computer i head up to her office 
 & gt me : <unk> lady what exactly did you computer do your help ticket did n't make a lot of sense to me 
 what do you mean it ate your <unk> 
 & gt lady : what do you mean thats what happened i showed my computer the <unk> the computer took it and now it wo n't give it back 
 & gt me : i 'm not aware of any <unk> what are you talking about 
 how did your computer eat it 
 she looks at me like i 'm an idiot and to be honest i felt a little dumb for not knowing what she was talking about 
 then she pointed at my id badge 
 & gt lady : there you 're wearing a <unk> that 's what the computer took ... i look at where my id badge is hanging off a <unk> <unk> and look back up at her even more confused 
 & gt me : this is an id badge it 's got nothing to do with keys 
 how did you give it to your computer 
 how did your computer eat your id badge 
 she <unk> at me and <unk> up her arms then <unk> something about me being <unk> 
 the she points under her desk at something i lean over and see her computer 
 & gt lady : just like every morning i come in and turn on my computer i eject the badge reader and i put in my <unk> so i can log in to the computer without setting off any alarms 
 i ask her to show me the <unk> reader she reaches down and pushes the eject button on the dvd-rom drive 
 the tray slides out a little bit then hangs and goes back into the computer 
 & gt me : oh ok i see what happened let me get to the computer 
 i reach down and eject the dvd-rom drive and grab it as it opens it <unk> and tries to close but i do n't let it 
 i lean over and see a flat <unk> card in the drive 
 i slide in a letter <unk> and the card pops down then the tray comes completely out of the drive 
 she <unk> and does a little happy hop then holds out her hand for her <unk> 
 i close then reopen the drive a few times and it seems to be ok i 'll have to send someone around to test it before she actually needs it 
 i get up and i start to let her know it 's not a <unk> but i decide i do n't want to try that fight and go a different route 
 & gt me : you do n't have to put it in the computer every morning anymore just lay it on top of the computer or hang it on the side of the monitor ok 
 & gt lady : wow really 
 when did it change 
 & gt me : it 's always worked like that i just think someone forgot to inform you we have n't had to put them in the computer for years 
 i shake my head then head to my office and close the ticket 
 a few minutes later i get another one from her about removing the <unk> reader i close it out with ... & gt & gt <unk> readers have been converted to audio cd players but you have to get approval from your manager to listen to music at your desk 
 about an hour later her manager comes around asking where his <unk> is and if his reader plays audio cds too 
 so this story happened a few years ago but i recently remembered it and felt like sharing 
 i was working for an <unk> tech support service at the time 
 for the most part we were supposed to try a quick troubleshoot at the counter and then check in the unit for further repairs 
 however that being said our prices were n't that great not that i could change that so it was n't easy for everyone to put up the money for repairs 
 depending on how nice a person was we might sometimes give them some more time and maybe some service at the counter if it was simple enough fix 
 one day a nice older lady came in with a <unk> old laptop <unk> with a couple minor issues 
 i do n't really remember the extent of it but one the final issues was a bit harder and we ended up getting about 3 of us working together to get it fixed 
 when it finally worked she starting getting sad and asked me how much she owed me and i declined saying it was no charge heck we probably gained more from learning how to fix the issue for future times it occurs 
 she was very thankful and got all our names so she could let our manager know 
 overall it was a great experience 
 now for the good part 
 the next day i 'm working again and i see her walking in again but this time with a big bag full of something 
 i get worried that maybe the issue had come back or she was bringing in more stuff for us to fix 
 nope 
 turns out she was bringing us <unk> pulled <unk> thank god for <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 she told us to have at it and she 'd be back in a few days for the dishes 
 we all thanked her and dove in during our lunch breaks 
 man it was good 
 the best part was a manager from another part of the store came back and saw we had this and tried to say we were not supposed to accept that 
 another co-worker said it was fine and not to worry 
 she responded back but what if it was <unk> '' 
 at which point my manager turns and says well we 're not dead yet are we '' 
 we had a laugh while she went off in a huff 
 goddamn was that some good <unk> i wait for an email from the big boss i wondered if all jobs are this worrying 
 probably 
 thirty seconds after i had put down the <unk> & gt new message & gt **** airz head of security and it has <unk> me to the theft of a rack 
 i have told him to do nothing 
 **** <unk> boss i took a sip of my coffee 
 it tasted <unk> 
 it tasted like instant 
 i hate instant 
 a knock sounded on the door 
 i looked up and it was one of the night shift it members 
 & gt <unk> : hey so remember level three was having connection issues about an hour or two ago 
 & gt me : oh yes 
 & gt <unk> : they’ve still got them 
 the words shook me down to the core 
 i had almost forgotten about the users what was i becoming 
 & gt me : right yes 
 they’re missing a switch in comms room on level three 
 can you go find an older switch and patch them up till we can get some new gear in 
 & gt <unk> : sorry they are missing <unk> & gt me : switch look don’t worry about it 
 not important 
 the <unk> looked at me a little suspiciously 
 & gt <unk> : okay… but… could i get that in writing 
 i almost chuckled and forwarded him the email the boss sent to me 
 <unk> went off to fix the switching whilst i found the box of locks that the vp had forced me to order 
 they hadn’t been installed yet mostly because the install order kept getting <unk> before it found its way to maintenance 
 i needed a drill 
 maintenance had a drill 
 i walked down to maintenance and found it was <unk> and the door to the tools was locked 
 would security have a key 
 security did not have a key 
 only maintenance people had keys and all maintenance people go home early 
 especially on friday 
 as i walked back to the it department <unk> i dream of an easier job 
 brain surgeon perhaps 
 when i arrived at the it department i wondered if the small drill we kept around it would get through the door 
 i dismissed it immediately 
 we didn’t have the drill bits 
 lost in thought i practically walked into the sales manager who was standing in it 
 & gt me : sorry 
 i was in another world 
 & gt sales : airz 
 there you are the big boss sent me down here 
 & gt me : its late on friday why aren’t you at home 
 & gt sales : the big boss sent me down here 
 he said you’d be amenable to giving up a box of keyboards 
 & gt me : sorry what 
 & gt sales : i need another box of keyboards 
 & gt me : its been a fortnight 
 how 
 & gt sales : the big boss said you’d need the key to the maintenance tool room 
 so i’ll trade you one box of keyboards for the maintenance tool room key 
 oh and one added extra 
 i looked down at my hands 
 no coffee 
 not even instant coffee was this fast 
 & gt me : whats the extra 
 the sales manager looked down at my desk where a box of locks was sitting 
 & gt sales : don’t install the lock on the second floor break room 
 do all the others just not the second floor 
 & gt me : what 
 i looked down at the box 
 then it hit me 
 & gt me : oh no… no no 
 i just need to catch a rat 
 & gt sales : i’m not sure we have any rat <unk> 
 & gt me : hahaha don’t worry 
 you’ve got yourself a deal on one condition 
 you owe me 
 & gt sales : i owe you 
 for keyboards 
 & gt me : it’s been a terrible financial <unk> 
 only a small favor 
 & gt sales : whats the favor 
 & gt me : nothing too big 
 so deal 
 the sales manager looked hesitant 
 & gt me : can’t do many sales without a keyboard 
 & gt sales : fine 
 deal 
 the sales manager handed me the key to the <unk> 
 i installed a lock on the door after <unk> had fixed the switching situation inside 
 i went down to the office and picked up my coffee 
 <unk> in hand it felt better 
 coffee is a good <unk> 
 i took a sip 
 tasted like the start of <unk> 
 next older this happened about a month ago this <unk> laptop kept <unk> out '' in her words 
 sometimes it would n't boot up sometimes she would be working and things would start typing randomly 
 it could n't be explained 
 i thought okay maybe her keyboard on her laptop is getting a key stuck 
 replaced the keyboard same issue 
 sometimes it would be fine other times you could n't get the thing to <unk> without beeping constantly 
 on one foggy morning though i stopped by her office while her <unk> was opened 
 and behold a wireless keyboard in her <unk> 
 turns out she would use it from time to time along with her wireless mouse 
 <unk> i bet she felt dumb i work the night shift as a support specialist for a fairly large healthcare system in my state 
 nights are usually slow and we do n't get a lot of calls except to change passwords or unlock user accounts 
 tonight that changed 
 me- '' hi this <unk> in it 
 can i get your name please '' 
 user gives me his name me- sir it does n't look like you 're in our system 
 have you called in with an issue before '' 
 <unk> '' no i do n't think i have and my issue might be a little weird '' me- '' that 's fine 
 we 'll do what we can to help you '' <unk> '' well this girl and i were having <unk> a bit ago and the <unk> came off 
 like ... in <unk> 
 me- '' ... sir this is the it department 
 we handle computer related issues for the hospitals and their <unk> 
 you should really try calling the emergency department '' <unk> '' well i tried to google it and ca n't find any help on my computer '' me- '' this is still a medical issue and you should really call the ed to get some help '' <unk> '' ok can you give me that number '' 
 and so ended my conversation with this guy 
 i 've been working here for a little over a month now and this is really my first brush with holy shit did that just happen '' 
 hope you guys enjoyed it as much as my coworker and i did 
 <unk> a short disclaimer 
 this information went through two technical people before coming to me so i may have gotten some bad information 
 ** at my previous job i was responsible for managing a large number of laptops out in the field 
 basically they would come in i would <unk> them and send them back out as needed 
 sadly the guy i replaced was bad at managing his images 
 so we had four laptop models and all the images were in terrible condition 
 half the laptops would come back because for some reason something did n't work right 
 so i set about <unk> the images and got two of the four models re-imaged 
 the field supervisors thought i was the greatest thing ever and told me their emergencies had been cut in half in the short time i had been working there 
 they were sleeping better there was less downtime and i had gotten everything so efficient i was able to <unk> any number of computers that came in and get them back out the same day 
 well something important to note was that they had a <unk> key for microsoft office 
 they refused to give me the key 
 and one of our images that i had n't gotten to fixing <unk> n't have the right <unk> 
 well we had to send out this laptop and had no <unk> to send in its place 
 originally it was going out in a month but the next day it got bumped up to the end of the week '' and later that day to in two hours '' 
 i needed the key the head of it would n't get back to me so i used a tool <unk> to pull the registry information and obtain the corporate key 
 one threat assessment later i was let go 
 it 's a shame too i really *really* liked that <unk> happened around <unk> the company i worked for was a vendor for large corporations 
 i worked on a team that provided server administration for one particular customer 
 it was the policy of the customer and probably every other than when file servers ran out of space we were to delete all <unk> media file types 
 we usually had few angry phone calls come our way when we cleared space 
 one particular incident got so heated and just down right nasty that the customer 's senior vp of it gave us his mobile number afterwards and told us to escalate these calls directly to him 
 as it turned out i received the very next irate phone call of someone looking for his missing <unk> collection 
 the guy on the phone was beyond <unk> he was barely <unk> his rage was so great 
 i popped up the vp 's phone put the user on hold and called him up informed him of the situation 
 he had me to conference him in to the phone call 
 which i did 
 the second i got back on the line with the end user he flew into another rage that was even worse than before 
 the vp sat silent when suddenly the raging end user stopped and stated an instant message popped up on his screen and it was more important than me 
 then i heard the customer 's hold music come on 
 the vp stated : he got an im from me hang on just a second <unk> sorry for wasting your time '' 
 i just replied that i was here for as long as he needed me 
 at that moment i really needed a large bag of popcorn 
 screw that i wanted the biggest bag of popcorn in the history of <unk> 
 the end user came back on 
 the vp then proceeded with one of the best even <unk> dress <unk> i have ever heard 
 the end user was sobbing 30 seconds into it 
 i received an apology and then the call ended 
 about two weeks later i traveled to the customer 's headquarters along with 2 of my coworkers 
 this was a normal trip we usually visited once a quarter during normal times or much more than that during roll <unk> and projects 
 the vp took us out to dinner 
 while there he handed me a name plate the type that you put on an office door 
 it had the user 's name and former title on it 
 the vp smiled and told me : it 's yours '' 
 tl dr : we 're sorry the number you have dialed has gotten you fired 
 this is n't strictly a tech support story but i figured it would be enjoyed here 
 first 
 a small bit of backstory 
 i am a regular member at my local <unk> where we keep a rather large supply of pc parts most of them fairly dated 
 about 3 months before the story i picked up an old <unk> to use on my <unk> until i could get my <unk> drive back from <unk> digital amazing customer support by the way 
 due to various reasons yay <unk> tests 
 i did n't even look at it for a few months 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- i was working on setting up <unk> on my <unk> so i could use it to store movies and tv shows from my dvd collection 
 once i had the software up and running i realized i needed something to use as storage 
 that 's when i remembered i had the drive tucked deep into the <unk> that is my desk drawer 
 i plugged it into my home pc to figure out what <unk> it was using so i could <unk> it 
 that 's when i saw the files 
 the drive was nearly full 
 out of idle curiosity i dug around a little bit in some of the folders 
 the previous owner left a massive amount of personal info on the drive 
 there was insurance info tax data addresses even bank account info 
 i figured that since this drive was left at my <unk> it must belong to a <unk> member 
 so i began searching our forums and wiki for the names i found on the drive 
 i found nothing 
 i could n't find any info on the internet about this person 
 after a few days i started looking again on the drive for more info 
 this time around i found some chat logs and based on the date i assumed they were irc logs 
 with nothing more than a few <unk> and channel names i set off to search the internet again 
 i tried every irc network i could think of 
 i <unk> the internet and searched every irc network that had those channels 
 i found nothing 
 finally after a week i was ready to give up and just wipe the drive 
 i decided to give it one more try 
 finally i found him 
 he 'd thankfully for me been using the same irc <unk> for almost 15 years most of the logs were dated late 90 's early 00 's 
 here 's a chat log i 've changed the names and whatnot obviously 
 <unk> - - <unk> : starting query in <unk> with <unk> <unk> & lt me & gt we need to talk <unk> & lt me & gt trying to find the owner of a hd i found <unk> & lt me & gt i think it may be yours are you insert name here

 tl dr : found an hd and using <unk> year old data tracked down the owner and returned <unk> <unk> i got into work and my pc was off so i turned it on and the windows said it was updating and then it said files were damaged and i need to install <unk> from the original media 
 call me back '' 
 10:00 i ca n't do any work it still wo n't let me use <unk> i really need your help call me back '' 
 <unk> it 's still not working i ca n't work call '' 
 <unk> i restarted my pc and it works fine now 
 ignore the other messages '' 
 tl dr all users should be forced to watch the it crowd 
 short but made me smile that the guy was <unk> about it & gt 10 minutes ago in my office : & gt *phone <unk> & gt me : hello 
 & gt guy : yeah my computer is frozen & gt me : how frozen 
 are we talking <unk> levels of frozen 
 & gt guy : well it has n't started singing at me yet & gt me : there 's still time then i 'll be right down **tl dr : <unk> & gt cmd & gt <unk> <unk> <unk> '' ** **edit : i know it 's <unk> and not <unk> i just like seeing all you <unk> techs twitch and <unk> 'm sure this happens to all tech support technicians but there is nothing i find more frustrating than being blamed for anything that has a plug going wrong in the 12 months after i work on a <unk> prime example : last month we deployed <unk> cloud care do n't judge <unk> not my call to a small business of about 7 machines and a file server 
 a week or so after : cust : ever since you <unk> on our pcs our printer has n't worked 
 me : sorry to hear that sir are we talking about the hp laserjet in the corner 
 cust : no the brother printer 
 me puzzled i do n't remember selling them a brother <unk> : ok and when you say its not <unk> what 's actually happening 
 cust : my customers are sending faxes and <unk> coming out 
 me : ahh so this is your fax machine not a printer 
 cust : same thing 
 me a little sarcastically : yes yes but is the fax machine connected to your pc or even the network 
 a short conversation <unk> that no it is n't cust : so you 're saying its all just a mighty <unk> 
 convenient that 
 me : well could i get you to go and have a look at the fax machine and read out what it says on the <unk> you can see where this is going ... in this case it was a paper jam the single most annoying thing is that you hang up knowing that despite all reason and logic they are still blaming you for it happening and will still be bitching about our services to anyone who will <unk> morning or afternoon or evening my fellow it <unk> 
 this is my first tale here so i 'll keep it short and sweet 
 i am fairly new to my it career and most of it has been at generic msp managed service provider monthly cost for it support for companies that do n't want internal it company $ <unk> 
 one of our newer clients at the time was a group of <unk> offices 
 mainly running an <unk> project to upgrade workstations and deal with a few networking issues as they came in 
 until this call i received one afternoon : & gt me : $ <unk> this is <unk> speaking how may i help you today 
 & gt user : hi this is $ user from $ <unk> our x-ray machine is not working & gt me : what seems to be the issue 
 is the workstation not receiving the images 
 & gt user : no it 's not taking pictures 
 & gt me : have you tried calling the vendor 
 & gt user : no we have n't 
 we figured since you 're our new it service that you would be able to fix it 
 & gt me : unfortunately this piece of machinery is out of our area of service so you 'll need to contact your vendor for support 
 overall it was a pleasant conversation but i do n't think the owner would be very happy if some random it people started <unk> around with a very expensive <unk> machine in their operation 
 tl dr : user drives <unk> to local mechanic 
 edit : added a description for <unk> shift in it is a rough job 
 after realizing my earlier mistake was a lack of communication between night time it and regular it i decided to speak with the night it manager 
 after sending him an email and finding that same email in <unk> inbox i realized i *was* the night it manager 
 huh 
 i scheduled myself for a night shift 
 ***** monday <unk> arriving at work as the sun set was odd we’ve no real <unk> between normal it and night it i didn’t really know what to do 
 i sat at my desk 
 a few hours later nightowl and eveninglady rolled into work 
 seeing the office light on they both entered my office & gt nightowl : another long day huh 
 & gt me : actually i’ve scheduled myself for a night shift 
 the two regular night staff looked sideways to each other 
 & gt eveninglady : a night shift 
 won’t your wife want you home 
 & gt me : alas so far <unk> 
 see this will be good 
 you’ll get to know more about me and i’ll learn more about you 
 eveninglady mouth moved as if she wanted to say something but nightowl put his hand on her shoulder <unk> 
 & gt nightowl : glad to have the help 
 & gt eveninglady : although we don’t really need ... <unk> hand moved from <unk> shoulder and <unk> her out the door 
 <unk> her away from my office and leaving me alone 
 after a few moments of silence where i checked my emails blank and the queue blank 
 i realized i had no idea what to do 
 i walked out into the department where eveninglady and nightowl were whispering <unk> 
 they stopped when they noticed my arrival 
 & gt me : so what is it you do ... during the night 
 & gt nightowl : we er ... first check the backups 
 nightowl and i went over to a computer the backups were running fine 
 it took about twenty seconds to check 
 & gt me : so ... i guess we rebuild from a backup now 
 check they’re backing up properly 
 eveninglady had an expression between exasperation and <unk> 
 & gt me : no point in having backups if you dunno if they’re <unk> right 
 & gt eveninglady : just ... stop worrying 
 it’s working 
 you don’t need to baby us go home 
 sleep 
 & gt me : you <unk> check the backups 
 right 
 my concern <unk> on my junior self who having created a backup system at a previous job was unable to <unk> any data from it 
 i’d lost a lot of data the day that failed 
 & gt nightowl : of course we do 
 eveninglady and i usually recover from backup every friday 
 she just likes the schedule 
 nightowl was giving eveninglady significant looks 
 she sat silently 
 & gt me : should we try recover one now 
 & gt nightowl : i mean ... this *is* usually a friday job 
 it was too late to convince me of that though i’d already started copying the backup files over to a testing environment 
 around an hour later the recovery had crashed 
 the error message was <unk> <unk> : crash 
 reason : <unk> & gt nightowl : huh thats never happened before 
 & gt me : i might have to schedule myself on for some more nights ... eveninglady looked <unk> swear to $ <unk> this story is true 
 <unk> description : ** paper jam now no power to printer <unk> cause : ** christmas lights were plugged into a loose outlet and the plug kept falling out 
 user unplugged printer plugged the christmas lights into the printer outlet and plugged the printer into the loose outlet 
 <unk> : ** moved printer plug to bottom outlet where christmas lights were plugged in 
 put call in to maintenance to replace outlet 
 edit : formatting i might have to post this on <unk> as well as here since i was working as a computer tech in a retail store at the time of the incident 
 i had a customer in probably his mid 50 's bring in a computer that was having problems booting up 
 the machine was about 5 years old and had obviously not had extreme care given 
 as soon as i looked at the computer and saw all of the symptoms for myself i knew is was a hard drive failing 
 i called the customer to give him the diagnosis and some options for repair as well as prices 
 he then asked me if i could recover any of his music because it was apparently the only thing he used his computer for 
 i asked if he had ever made a backup he said no of course 
 i then told him that our data recovery service was additional to the general laptop repair 
 he just could n't fathom that i would charge him more just to recover his <unk> music 
 this was when i knew he was going to be trouble 
 i tried to explain what went on with a data recovery and how long it took and why it took so many man hours 
 i also explained to him that if we were n't able to recover the data that there would be no charge 
 he was n't buying it 
 i told him that if he wanted the new drive put in and a new system installed that i could do that while he was deciding about the data recovery 
 he <unk> at the price again 
 ugh 
 essentially he tried to tell me that i was trying to rob him and that he could get it done any number of places for cheaper 
 i as politely as i could told him he was welcome to call around and check and i would wait for him to call back 
 about an hour later he calls back and in a very defeated tone he said go ahead and do it '' 
 he also authorized the data recovery 
 i replaced the drive and started the data recovery 
 i worked myself to death trying to recover that data 
 all of his documents movies music etc were recovered 
 i was so proud of myself 
 it took much longer than i expected so i decided to knock off some of the labor price from the data recovery as a gesture of good will 
 i worked for a small business and we really needed repeat customers so i was authorized to do so 
 this is where the story gets stupid 
 the man comes in to pick up his computer with all his recovered data 
 he <unk> wanted to look the computer over before he paid for it 
 so he 's looking through all his music and seems fairly pleased 
 then he says why does n't my toolbar look the same '' 
 i explained to him that that was one thing that seemed too corrupted to retrieve was some of his user account data so i had to create a new account and his dock would n't look the same 
 he flipped shit 
 started yelling at me and stuff 
 he was screaming in the store this is a <unk> <unk> '' 
 or you 're a bunch of <unk> scam <unk> '' 
 then the jumps toward the counter waving his hands at me and grabs all of his stuff and runs to the door 
 the computer with the new drive the old drive and all the recovered data 
 all i could say was sir if you 'll stop yelling in the <unk> we 'll figure this out '' 
 he kept yelling 
 finally i warned him twice that if he stepped one foot out the door that i would have to report the theft and that we have cameras recording in our store at all times and that i would have multiple ways to prove he did n't pay 
 he then starts shouting well then sue me '' 
 you 'll have to <unk> sue me 
 you bunch of liars '' 
 and then walks out the door and gets in his car to drive away 
 i told one of my co-workers to call the police and stepped outside to take a <unk> of his license plate 
 what this gentleman did n't understand was that when he dropped the computer off we required multiple kinds of contact info 
 so we had his name phone number email address and street address 
 i had the serial number for the machine the drive and now i had his license plate number 
 the police came and took a statement from my co-worker and i then called the owner of the store and asked what he wanted to do 
 the <unk> was really helpful they told us that they were allowed to press charges on behalf of us for theft of <unk> and services 
 i 'm not sure what happened to the guy but i understand that the police went to his million dollar home yes this guy lived in a very nice country club neighborhood and took him in in front of all of his neighbors 
 we did get all of our money for the repair but i 'm not sure if any other damages were paid 
 that was in the top 5 most stressful days of my life 
 most people ask us to do things for them but some people like the <unk> route and would rather just borrow the tools 
 one such guy came in and borrowed a <unk> screwdriver 
 i gave him the # 2 size and asked if it would work he said yes 
 then he came back and asked to borrow some <unk> and use a soldering station 
 but what kind of <unk> does he need 
 imagine that he does n't know 
 he leaves to find out 
 he is unable to figure it out and asks for regular '' 
 i was n't in the mood to explain how that works so i just gave him whatever reel was closest 
 he then returns later and says it must have been wrong because it <unk> stick 
 he wants to know if we have other kinds 
 i say that different kinds are for different purposes assuming that this time he would go off and research and come back with an idea 
 he came back with a laptop and asked what kind of <unk> do i need for this screw '' 
 and pointed to a screw on the bottom 
 it turns out that he wanted to replace the hard drive in his laptop 
 rather than ask for help he decided to <unk> it and ask for the screwdriver 
 but the # 2 <unk> was too large 
 rather than ask for a smaller screwdriver he decided to ask for <unk> 
 his plan was to apply the <unk> to the screw and jam the screwdriver into it while it was still hot then let it cool 
 then he would remove the screw because in this magical world the <unk> would stick '' and turning the <unk> would turn the screw 
 <unk> 
 of course this was n't working for him so we got the appropriate screwdriver size and removed the screw the old <unk> way instead 
 the moral of this story is that <unk> head screwdrivers and soldering <unk> are not often <unk> tools 
 people who think they are should not be lent <unk> used to have a few computer stores but sold them when the book money started to <unk> the store <unk> 
 i took off a few years enjoyed life but the guy who bought my stores asked me to come back and help him open up a bunch of them all around the state 
 wife and i talked it over finally decided to do it 
 first i had to get the original ones back into shape since they 'd pretty much been run into the ground 
 that 's where i 've been lately btw 
 anyway last night this batshit crazy woman came in i 'd had a few <unk> with her before claiming that i was obligated to give her the windows anytime upgrade '' license key 
 huh 
 i showed her that windows anytime upgrade '' was n't specifically a <unk> of windows but a program through which someone could upgrade their version of windows from home to professional or ultimate 
 she did n't believe me and kept repeating that she 'd spent an hour on the phone with microsoft and that they 'd told her she 'd have to talk to the people who 'd sold her the system 
 i kept telling her that there was n't an anytime upgrade '' version of windows so finally she <unk> to the properties screen pointed <unk> at the windows <unk> and the <unk> notice underneath and said accusingly you did n't even sell me a current version 
 this one is from <unk> and i bought the computer in 2012 '' 
 ma'am that 's the <unk> notice 
 there is no specific <unk> version of windows 7. it 's constantly updating '' 
 are you going to give me the windows anytime key or not '' 
 it was at this time that i finally lost it 
 my employees were shaking with laughter tears streaming down their faces trying to hold it in and failing 
 ma'am i ca n't give you a key to something that does n't exist '' 
 she glared at me took out <unk> wipes cleaned everything i 'd touched grabbed her computer and left 
 i ca n't wait to see her again 
 apparently she 'd been causing the employees hell for over a year and the ones that were left that i did n't fire actually -- it was a <unk> hated her and have really enjoyed seeing me interact with her 
 good times 
 edit : oh and btw i like getting random <unk> from people so if you 're bored <unk> at <unk> '' 
 edit 2 : at the store <unk> ass but holy sweet mother of god the snaps i 'm getting are awesome 
 i 've had <unk> girls crazy guys pics all around the world and one guy sent me a <unk> shot ... .. not at all what i expected but thanks for the fun during a really annoying day 
 keep <unk> up 
 i snap like a <unk> usually nothing important but hey you guys made my <unk> absolutely lost my sh t on a call with a vendor yesterday 
 since they were brought on a year ago & lt - contractor - & gt has never been able to do anything right 
 since <unk> we 've been trying to get a change order in place with them so we can remove many of the devices that we 're <unk> from monitoring but they have been unable to provide us with a list of the devices that they are actually monitoring 
 when they provide us with a spreadsheet it 's missing devices they are supposedly keeping an eye on 
 when asked they ca n't give a straight answer as to why they 're not on the list but they claim that they are monitoring them and alerting on them 
 a little over a month ago i decided to test them on that 
 i took down a switch that they claimed to me monitoring but was n't on their list 
 i never got an alert 
 i did it with another device not on the list but supposedly <unk> and received the same result 
 when i informed them of what i 'm seeing and what i 've done they started trying to run me around in <unk> 
 they kept telling me that they would have a meeting about it next week '' when some key people '' were back off vacation so i informed them that i would not be letting my boss pay the bill until we had this sorted out after all they are n't providing the services that we 're paying for and billing us for things we 've asked to remove 
 the entire time we 're trying to get this list straightened out they 're charging us full price because we never signed the change order 
 i have n't signed it because it 's never correct 
 we 're not talking about <unk> either this bill is over $ 20k per month 
 after that email they were miraculously able to get that meeting together that afternoon last thursday 
 yesterday was when they were going to give me the answers to these questions i had 
 it just so happens that at <unk> yesterday one of our <unk> experienced an outage 
 <unk> went down for right at 10 minutes and while my network management software caught it theirs did n't 
 during the meeting they were making all kinds of stuff up about what was being <unk> and what was n't 
 i brought up the fact that a datacenter went down just an hour and 30 minutes earlier and i never got an alert on that which i should have immediately 
 after giving them the ip and hostname i sat there and listened as the excuses started rolling in ... they said their software did n't show any missed <unk> data and i must be mistaken that it went down 
 & gt * '' how do you know it went down 
 * & gt '' my <unk> server said it did '' 
 i had them make me <unk> and i shared my screen to show them 
 & gt * '' did you verify that it really went down 
 * & gt '' here 's my still open command prompt window open with the failed pings '' 
 & gt * '' how do you know it was n't just your computer 
 * & gt '' a ping to another device in that datacenter but on a different circuit worked fine '' 
 & gt * '' did you verify on the device itself that it really went down 
 i do n't see anything in the logs 
 * i show them the <unk> summary where <unk> has only been up for an hour and a half ... then they told me that the <unk> their server is on must have some sort of other route in it to get to that device that my <unk> server and laptop do n't have 
 my <unk> server and their server are on the same <unk> 
 in fact they 're both <unk> on the same physical server 
 but i showed them the backup <unk> server at a different location just to prove that it had no connection too 
 they kept telling me that it must be something with all my different servers because they 're <unk> that device every 60 seconds and they have no missed <unk> 
 another technical resource from their side decides to add his two <unk> 
 & gt * '' well we did n't receive an <unk> trap that it went down and according to the configuration you 're showing us it 's configured to send those <unk> so it must not have really went down 
 * a couple other guys on their team immediately come to his defense to explain to me that he 's right if there 's no trap then there 's no problem 
 i had a simple question 
 & gt '' how is a device going to send a trap when there 's no network connection between it and you 
 <unk> was down 
 there was no route '' 
 i check a different log file and sure enough it shows the trap being fired 
 they did n't get it because there was nowhere for it to go 
 what i did n't tell them is that i called a buddy of mine that works for our <unk> provider and had him kill the connection for me 
 all these things they are coming up with are just them reaching at <unk> because they ca n't explain why their stuff does n't work 
 that 's when the manager that 's running the show decides to open up his cake hole ... & gt * '' well that device is n't on the list of devices you said you wanted to monitor going forward 
 * & gt '' you mean the list we sent you yesterday that brought you down from <unk> devices to 50 
 the list that you replied back that you wanted to have a meeting about with senior management about sometime next week before you sent us the change order because it cuts the bill by 90 % '' 
 & gt * '' oh i 'm sorry 
 that 's my fault 
 i sent that list to the overseas team and told them to only alert on the devices that were on it 
 that 's why you did n't get an alert because we 're not going to be monitoring it once we get the change order complete 
 * & gt '' dude your team has been telling me for 10 minutes that your server had no idea the device went down and now you 're going to make up some excuse about telling the overseas team not to alert on it '' 
 & gt * '' i 'm not making up excuses that has to be what happened 
 * & gt '' or your software is garbage and you team do n't know how to use it '' 
 at this point my server guy <unk> in 
 he lost some drives in the san last week on two separate occasions and they never <unk> him on that 
 the excuses on that start pouring in 
 the longer we 're on this call the more they are trying on my patience 
 what made me snap was when we told them that we only wanted <unk> monitoring on that list of 50 devices and would be removing all application level stuff 
 prior to sending them that list we had an internal call where the engineers were asking for them to be fired but management would n't allow it 
 plus somehow or another they managed to sneak in a requirement that we give them 90 days notice before ending the contract and my previous boss who hired them to begin with and left for another company a few months back had signed a new contract with them just a couple weeks before leaving where he said we 'd be keeping them until the end of august 
 i 'm pretty sure he got a <unk> from these idiots it 's the only thing that can explain all this 
 the manager decides that he 's going to try to sell me on keeping the other monitoring over just <unk> 
 & gt * '' <unk> are you sure that you only want <unk> monitoring 
 you 'd be losing ... '' * & gt '' yeah i 'm just going to stop you right there 
 i wo n't be losing anything 
 if it were up to the engineering staff your ass would have hit the <unk> months ago 
 i want to replace you with a small shell script 
 fortunately for you management wo n't allow that '' 
 i then <unk> into their ass for a good 4 or 5 minutes <unk> getting more and angry to the point that i was <unk> on unprofessional 
 i have tried to hold these people 's hand through this 
 i even took a week out of my schedule to fly down to their offices and walk them through everything 
 it did nothing 
 in all my years of working in this field i have never run across a vendor that is more inept at their job than this 
 and to think that we pay these people over a quarter million dollars a year to service this account 
 today they had the audacity to have the salesman call me to try to change my mind about dropping their services down to nearly nothing 
 not the managed services director not the technical lead no one to tell me that they 'll fix the problem 
 they sent a salesman to try to get me to spend more money with them 
 sorry this is so long and <unk> 
 i 'm just at the end of my <unk> with the <unk> and if i could i 'd <unk> their name all over this post so you could use my experience as a warning to not use them but unfortunately i ca n't 
 what i can promise you is that once this contract is over i will be posting an update with that information 
 edit : guys stop <unk> me 
 i will not tell you who the company is 
 very quick one here that has just happened ... -- - vp - important guy who understands technical information and generally leads the <unk> 
 can be a good guy too mb - my boss -- - email from vp 
 & gt & gt all as you may not be aware security is currently running an <unk> phishing <unk> to better <unk> users on the threat of external emails 
 & gt & gt i am glad to say that out of the <unk> staff in my direct only 5 have opened any items from the security team 
 & gt & gt those members and i have all been booked into training session to better <unk> the importance of <unk> these <unk> emails 
 & gt & gt thank you and well done again 
 in a reply chain to my boss mb & gt & gt me : does this <unk> that vp opened the phishing email 
 & gt & gt mb : i can confirm that he was one of the 5 yes ... apparently vp had a long day and the email looked like one that he had received earlier in the week 
 after opening it he immediately realised his error and phoned security 
 this did not however save him from a <unk> from his boss and the security team 
 ca n't really fault him for this but i do like the attempt to cover it up
